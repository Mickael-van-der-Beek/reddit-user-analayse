From what I can tell the anniversary website was up around 2:30 PST today.  Assuming that the week starts Monday(cause seriously who really considers Sunday the first day of the week) the site was live 62.5 hours into the week.

100% * 62.5 / (24 * 7)  gives us that that the site was released 37.2% of the way through the week. 

0.372 * 366 days this year = Diablo 3 will be released 136.16 days in to the year.

Calling it now, Diablo 3 will be released on May 15th which just so happens to be a Tuesday!  Clearly my logic is flawless and this is the only possible release date.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,monk-americas,True,t3_o3cd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/o3cd9/release_date_math/,

I’m Wyatt Cheng, senior technical game designer for Diablo III. I’m joined today by senior game designer Andrew Chambers and game director Jay Wilson. Together, in addition to an awesome team of assorted development minions, we’re responsible for creating and iterating on the major game design elements for Diablo III, including class skills, item development, monster affixes (powers), difficulty tuning, and much more. Now that the game has launched and a lot of you have gotten a chance to play, we’re excited to talk about Diablo III and answer your most burning questions. Or at least a good portion of them. 
 
Since we’re game designers and not server engineers, artists, marketing specialists, or PR representatives, we decided to go with an AMAA over an AMA. We want to talk about the game with you, but we realize there are a few things we can’t really speak on. We’ll still try to answer as many questions as possible during our two-hour window, but please keep in mind that we may be unable to address a lot of topics beyond gameplay.

Also, we just posted an article today regarding [upcoming changes in patch 1.0.3] (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/6262208/) (that you should definitely read if you haven’t yet).


Let’s get this going…AMAA!

**[UPDATE THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u54ik/update_the_potential_arg_contained_in_diablo_3/). Comment in that one. It's far better organized.**

Whimsy shire. We all know about it. Blizzard's secret level.

Now, this is where it gets interesting.
The music for this level is odd. Very odd.
Link to the music:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLAol0SyGA

If you listen to it, the music sounds a lot like a song in reverse, right?
Right. Reversing the music, you get this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1wqpBzaltg

This is where things start to get exciting. This reversing of Whimsyshire's music results in a tune very similar to Ravel - Gaspard de la Nuit.
Link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrHkclI98lw

**Edit 3: Here are all 3 of the songs**

**Ondine: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-LDHH8FDi0 **

**Le Gibet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrHkclI98lw **

**Scarbo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmOYFjZxhBA **

**Hopefully this helps!**


So what does this mean? Blizzard made a reference to a song in the game. That should be the end of that, right?
Wrong.

So I did some research.
From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit)
""Gaspard de la nuit is an old French expression for the Devil"" (!!!)

Moreover, the piano piece (the Whimsyshire theme played backwards) has 3 movements, each based on a poem by Aloysius Bertrand.

The poems which the piece is based off are entitled: Scarbo, Ondine, Le Gebit.

Scarbo english translation: http://english.agonia.net/index.php/poetry/164745/Scarbo

Ondine english translation: http://shadowlight9.blogspot.com/2011/04/french-poetry-iii-aloysius-bertrand.html

Le Gebit english translation: http://shadowlight9.blogspot.com/2011/04/french-poetry-iv-aloysius-bertrand-le.html

(thanks to http://www.reddit.com/user/donmanzo)

Woah! I decided to tackle ""Ondine"" first. I was going to use the poems to figure out if there was more hidden things in the game, that could only be found through the use of the poems. The first few stanzas stood out to me.

Specifically, 
""lit by the gloomy rays of the moon. / And here, in a gown of watered silk, / gazing from my chateau (large french castle) terrace, / I contemplate the beautiful starry night / and the ~~restless~~ sleeping lake""
Things just got interesting. A "" ~~Restless~~ *Beautiful* sleeping lake"", ~~that is a paradox right?~~ Or is it talking about a river?

This image was posted awhile back:

Well, who would have guessed it?

You can make out a moon, a soldier who is armed with a shield and something unintelligible. ~~A cross is in the background.~~

**EDIT 1: I don't think that is a cross. I think that is the [gibbet referred to in the poem](https://www.google.com/search?q=gibbet&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ei=zgO_T8a3A-ez6gGnn4nTCg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ved=0CGsQsAQ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bih=873#q=gibbet&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bih=667)** (Credit [RMessMann](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s46pp))

It's very gloomy, and reflects off of a ""restless sleeping lake"". What is there to reflect? Nothing.

This is as far as I have gotten on the treasure trail. I plan on continuing tomorrow by analyzing the other two poems. This is very interesting!

I also sent this to my English teacher. Maybe he could offer some insights.

**Edit 2: We [might have a lead](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s4hib)**


**TLDR:  reverse whimsy music and get song, song sounds similar to songs written based on poems that have themes directly connecting to diablo. Begin search.**

*edit: While there seem to be a lot of parallels, it seems that this might just be an elaborate Easter egg. I wouldn't write it off the boar just yet as we might see more on it later in time. The reflection in the river seems to be a graphical glitch, as well. *

I've seen a lot of threads asking about this and I found it incredibly frustrating myself that I could not see the stats of the item I sold in the auction house. Well anyway, my friend found the way it is, and here it is:-

Make sure you DO NOT send the gold you earned for the item to your stash. Open up a chat console, type a message to anyone (even party if there's no-one in your party), shift and click the little icon next to the gold amount (same as when you're linking your friends to your items in your inv), it will show the item you sold as a link in the console which you can click on and see the stats of.

I wanted to write up a list of stuff that I thought Blizzard should implement in Diablo 3. I wanted to avoid any controversial subjects, and just focus on general polish stuff.

**Thread on Official Forums: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5593230830**

1) As a player, I want the ability to lock my action bar so that I don't accidentally move or change an ability and lose Nephalem Valor stacks. 

2) As an Auction House user, I want a checkbox for ""buyout only"" so that I don't have to use a janky work-around.

3) As an advanced player, I want the option to show numerical cooldowns on my abilities so that I can better time them.

4) As a player, I want to be able to move and resize the chat window so that I can put it where I want it.

5) As a player, I want to be able to increase or decrease the font size in the chat window so that I can make it better for my monitor/resolution.

6) As a player, I want to see absorption effects on my health bar so that I can easily see and act on my remaining absorption shield.

7) As a Wizard, I want to see a buff icon for ""Magic Weapon"" so that I can know its current status.

8) As a player, I want some way to retain my stacks of Nephalem Valor when I accidentally disconnect so that I don't feel terrible if I disconnect with a 5-stack before a boss.

9) As a player, I want a way to disable lore/story text from showing up in the chat frame so that I don't have to always scroll after an in-game conversation.

10) As a player, I want to have my previous follower always automatically follow me whenever I start a new single-player session so that I don't forget and have to go back.

11) As an Auction House user, I would like to be able to repair my items from the auction house so that I can sell them without going in the game.

12) As a Blacksmith, I want to see what tier an item is before I salvage it so I can know what materials to expect.

13) As a player, I want my pets/minions to not attack invulnerable targets and instead focus on vulnerable targets so that I can kill things faster.

14) As a player, I want the experience bar to hide once I hit the maximum level so that it doesn't take up unnecessary screen space.

15) As a player, I want to see what difficulty my friends are playing so that I can know if I'll be interested in joining them.

16) As a new player, I want to be made aware of ""elective mode"" once I've become familiar with the game so that I can learn about and try more advanced builds.

17) As a player, I want it so that only my accepted friends can autojoin my game so that I don't get surprised by ""recent players"" that aren't my friends while playing.

18) As an advanced player, I want the option to show numerical values around my health and power orbs so that I can make better decisions.

19) As an Auction House user, I want to see a detailed view about all steps in the buying/selling process so that I can know exactly what the status on my purchase is (ex: ""XXX Gold paid for YYY item, (newline)YYY item received, (newline), YYY item sent to stash"")

20) As a player, I want the game to automatically hit my next-best-potion type when I'm out of my current potion type so that I don't have to reassign it during a long fight.

21) As an Auction House user, I would like tooltips for damaged items to still show the item stats when looking at them from the sell menu so that I don't have to log into the game to see them (maybe just put ""damaged"" somewhere on the tooltip?).

22) As an Auction House user, I want to be able to have ascending/descending orders by stat in the Auction House UI so that I can better find an item I want.

23) As a player, I want a ""build saver"" so that I can easily change between builds rather than trying to remember them.

24) As a player, I want integration between the website's ""build saver"" and an in-game build saver so that I can screw around with builds while not logged in.

25) As an advanced player, I want to be able to move, scale, or hide any UI element so that I can make the UI convey me information in a more customized fashion.

26) As a player, I would like some way to get Tomes of Jewelcrafting in Inferno that's not cumbersome so that I can combine my square gems without going back to Hell difficulty.

27) As a player, I want a ""Detailed Breakdown"" option that allows me to compare stats such as resistances, magic finding, etc. so that I can better analyze item choices.

28) As a player, I want a private chat UI element so that it will be easier for me to hold multiple private conversations at once.

29) As a player, I want to be able to have a private chat room so that me and my friends can chat even if we're in different Diablo sessions.

30) As an advanced Auction House user, I want a more complex query interface with ""OR""/""AND"" for stats so that I can better find an item I want to buy.

31) As an Auction House user, I want to be able to see the stats of items that I've sold so that I can refer to previous sales when determining prices for new sales.

If you won, I have sent you a message. Make sure to let me know your battletag, so I can get you your prize! 

I did the AMAA two weeks ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/xqv2r/ive_made_10000_legitimately_from_the_d3_market/

I was pumped at how it was initially received and the discussion it created, but it was especially exciting when articles started popping up on major websites. I always wondered what it would be like to read insulting comments about me on random websites from random strangers; I loved it. Also watching videos like [this](http://www.gamebreaker.tv/pc-games/blizzard-diablo-3-making-bank/) was hilarious, seeing people refer seriously to ""Wishbone The Dog.""  Basically, it was a really fun week in my life and it started with your upvotes and questions. So I want to say thanks with a fun givaway/raffle.

It will be for both NA and EU servers, and the prize pool will be separate for each. I will be giving away 20 million gold on NA along with 5 items. I will be giving away 30 million gold in EU. Help you guys ready to buy some 1.04 loot!

Having to be connected to a server to play alone sucks. And thousands of people are complaining about that today... yet most of them don't understand why Blizzard doesn't offer online play. They say it's to prevent piracy, when it's not. 

Blizzard has to run servers for at least 10 years to support this game, as they know from their past franchises, for the (very popular) multiplayer component. It shouldn't be surprising they looked for a way to get some recurring revenue from the game so that the ongoing costs are covered by the people still playing it. Their solution was the real-money auction house. 

To run a real-money auction house, they have to absolutely eliminate hacking and duping, or rare items won't be rare and there will be no incentive to create a robust market which Blizzard can earn money from. The only sure way to eliminate hacking and duping is to run D3 like an MMO... put everything on a server you don't control. You can hack your client all day long, but since your characters, the world, mob spawns and deaths, experience and loot are all generated and stored on the server, you can't cheat and create items.

There is no single player game. They never programmed one. To offer one at this point would be as much design and programming effort as creating Diablo 4. So don't expect there to ever be an offline patch for D3. When you play single player, you're just playing a multiplayer server instance that happens to only have one player in it.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_toog3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/toog3/the_real_reason_there_is_no_offline_play/,

**Edit** So people are claiming (with confirmed quotes from Blizzard) they took the secondary effects out of weapons. Despite this, Some of the weapons seem to have a secondary effect. It's not extremely apparent, but it does tend to do this by personal accounts of multiple people. I mainly wanted to bring attention to cold for DHs.

A few examples: 

Cold damage gives you an innate slow effect and works great on DHs because they can kite a lot easier. The slow will be applied to any ability that isn't using some sort of other elemental attack (i.e. Cinder Arrow rune will change it to fire). That means, Piercing Arrow and Devouring Arrow will apply a slow. As a side note, Nether Tentacles will as well for a nice AoE Line slow, but Ball Lightning wont. Fantastic for kiting mobs.

Fire attacks have a chance of exploding an enemy on death and doing a small AoE.

Holy attacks work a lot like fire, except instead of damaging enemies, it heals nearby allies when it explodes and it heals enough to be a noticeable amount. Great on tanks as it is a free heal if you get it to proc.

Lightning damage has a higher chance to make an enemy flinch, which is great for interrupts.


It's just something I wanted to share and make sure people know. Maybe instead of grabbing that lightning enchanted weapon because it has a higher damage output, maybe grab that lower DPS cold bow for better survivability or the holy fist weapons on a monk to help counteract the recent healing nerf.

* **How do the Auction Houses Work in Diablo 3?**

[This explains everything very well](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/services/auction-house/how-to)


-


* **Will DarkD3 get me banned? UPDATED**


DarkD3 could be used as a backdoor way to create botting programs (Don't as me how) so it is currently a grey area.  Use at your own risk. According to Jay Wilson on Twitter no ban is CURRENTLY likely. [Source](https://twitter.com/#!/Angryrobotics/status/201726183740686336) 


-


* **I have D3 standard from the WoW Annual Pass and plan on buying the Collectors Edition, will I be able to gift my standard edition?**

MAYBE.  There was a blue post from Bashiok saying you could but people are reporting that the CSR's at Blizzard are not currently allowing it.  [Here is a link stating one such case](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4888509092). Others are stating, as reported in the comments below, that it is allowed.  Either way proceed with caution and do NOT rely on it.


-


* **What do I do if my CE isn't arriving until after launch day?**

[Try and obtain a starter edition or guest pass.](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-starter-edition-guest-pass) 

Players on Starter Edition game licenses have the following restrictions:

* Act I up to the Skeleton King is available

* Level 13 cap

* Matchmaking available only with other Starter Edition players

* No Real Money Auction House access


Once your copy arrives, upgrade your key on Battle.net and continue playing the same characters without any restrictions.



* **I played Beta, do I need to redownload the client?**

YES. Make sure that you uninstall the beta COMPLETELY.  The Retail client and Beta client are two different versions and you will be unable to login with the Beta client on release.


*  **Is it possible to buy Diablo 3 online but install from a retail copy?**

Yes, just like all blizzard games you can download and install from any source. The only requisite is that you have an account for the game.

* **How can I locate Redditors to play with?**

Check out the flair on this subreddit.  When you mouse over it users who have attached their Battletag to Reddit their flair will display it.  Also check out /r/d3l4g to find a group.

* **Will there be a Day 1 patch?**

Yes!  According to Blizzard it will be under 100mb.
________________________________________________________________________________


**Things to do before Monday 5/14**

* **1.** Uninstall Beta if you haven't and Download the game, even if you haven't yet purchased it! [Find the links to download here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/qxyxm/diablo_3_windows_and_mac_download_links_all/)

Doing this will allow you to patch first thing Monday morning so you can be ready to go at midnight.  This will also help Blizzards servers from being smacked all at once and could potentially effect the ability to play at midnight.  You should use the links above no matter if you plan to purchase a physical copy of the game (Standard or Collectors use the same install files) or plan to digitally purchase the game.

Please note you can download the 7.5gb game files right away but will need to wait until 5/14 in order to install the game. If you experience any trouble installing visit [this site](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-installation-troubleshooting-pc).

ONCE YOUR COPY OF THE GAME ARRIVES ATTACH THE PRODUCT KEY TO BATTLE.NET.  Doing so early will help prevent you from having troubles on launch day.



-


* **2.** Create your Battle Tag. [Click Here](https://www.battle.net/account/management/battletag-create.html) to do so.

A BattleTag is required in order to play Diablo 3.  Again do this sooner than later because the Battle.net site will most likely be experiencing issues on Monday and Tuesday.


-


* **3.** [Claim your in-game sigils!](http://reveal.diablo3.com/en_US/)

Sigils are the main artwork used on your in game banners. Blizzard is currently offering 5 limited edition to sigils on their reveal site that will not be available after 5/18.


-


* **4.** Prep your hardware!

Make sure that you have [cleared your page files](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314834), [disabled any start up programs that are not needed](http://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=1688), and (AT YOUR OWN RISK) clean up your registry using a program like [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner).

Also make sure that you have the latest graphics drivers available from your video card manufacturer. Here's the links to [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and [AMD](http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx) 

-


* **5.** Update your /r/Diablo Flair!

[See this thread on how to do so!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/qyfqt/custom_rdiablo_battletag_flair_is_here/)


-


* **6.**  Attach an Authenticator to your account if you haven't already.


You can use the mobile authenticator for iPhone/Android, Use the Dial In Authenticator located on your Battle.net account page, or purchase a key chain authenticator from the [Blizzard store](http://us.blizzard.com/store/search.xml?q=authenticator).


-

* **7.**  If you plan on using the Real Money Auction House or want additional security setup SMS Alerts from Blizzard.

[You can learn more here.](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-sms-protect)

______________________________________________________________________________

**At Launch**

 Please be aware that a delay of up to 40 seconds is possible while the game attempts to connect you. If your connection doesn’t succeed in 40 seconds, you’ll be presented with an Error 37 message and asked to try again. If you see this error it does in fact mean that you should try again. 


-


**Set your Global Region BEFORE attempting to Login**

As Global Play will be disabled until after the game launches in all regions, it's important that you choose your account's correct region when attempting to play the game. If you do not select your correct region, your login attempt will be denied, and you will not be able to connect.

To choose your correct region:
At the log in screen click on Options
Choose the Account tab
Select your correct region in the Region drop down

______________________________________________________________________________

**Tips from the comments section below**

(my_nard)

In your gameplay settings:
Turn on elective mode
Turn on advanced tooltips

Normally each of your 6 skill slots are restricted to a particular category of skills. For example, Mouse1 is only for primary skills, Mouse2 is only for secondary skills, and Slot1 is only for defensive skills.
Elective mode removes this limitation and allows you to assign skills from whichever category to whichever slot. You can assign a primary skill to both Mouse1 and Mouse2, for instance.

If you want to add this, the English(EU) and German Client had to download a new downloader a few days ago because of an issue with the old one.

(Deadstarone)

Difficulties are progressed through linearly on a character to character basis.

Leveling ranges should be roughly as follows:

Normal is levels 1-30

Nightmare is levels 30-50

Hell is levels 50-60

Inferno is for level 60 only

You will realistically only be able to reach level 60 on a character by reaching Hell difficulty.

Loot is color coded:
White for Normal items

Blue for Magic items

Yellow for Rare items

Orange for Legendary items

Green for Set items


There are 16 visual tiers of gear. I say visual because the stats on that gear will vary wildly from piece to piece. 


A Rare tier 15 piece of gear with 6 affixes is most likely better than a Magic tier 16 piece of armor in many ways.
Legendary and Set items have their own unique models for armor on top of the base 16.


Each class will look different from one another even if they wear the same tier of armor. Legendary and Set items will look the same no matter what class you wear them on (scaled for size of course).

I did not actually expect him to read my email but I felt like I wanted to get my story out in the world.

Since then I was able to get my hands on a CE version of D3 with a shipping date of the 17th. I was just happy that I actually got my hands on the CE that was enough for me.

Today I received this email.

 Hi Jonathan,
&gt; I'm Brandon Broughton of Amazon.com's Executive Customer Relations team.
&gt; Jeff Bezos received your email and asked me to respond on his behalf.
&gt;
&gt; I'm very sorry for the trouble you've had with your pre-order of Diablo 3 CE. As a fellow Diablo player, I completely understand the level of anticipation for the release of Blizzard's latest creation. I've looked into your previous correspondence with us and see we told you to cancel your existing pre-order. This shouldn't have been done, as the CE version of Diablo 3 has been sold out for a while. Luckily, I see you were able to place a new order. I've since upgraded this order to release day delivery, so you can start enjoying D3 from day one. In addition, I'm using this opportunity to provide training and feedback in hopes we can prevent something like this from happening in the future.
Jonathan, I apologize again for any frustration caused and want to thank you for entrusting us with your important pre-order. Enjoy your return to Sanctuary!
Please feel free to reply directly to this message if I can be of further assistance.

To be honest this blew me out of the water. Thank you Amazon for your great customer support and your amazing staff that goes above and beyond!

Blue monsters : 60% chance to drop at 50% and 0% life.  
Yellow monster : 100% chance at 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% life.  
A bit risky against blue, but sometimes I'm running away and see the yellow boss has like 76% hp and try to stun him and make him drop his globe to heal when I'm low. There's even marks every 25% on the life bars to make this easier.   
Got this from the Brady Guide.  
  
Edit: Also, Health Globes dropped from blue and yellow monsters restore 35% of your life (+ boost on equipment) as opposed to 20% from globes dropped by normal monsters.  
Normal monsters only drop them at death, and the odds depends on the monster (tends to be bigger on big/hard monsters eg. 5% on Corpse Worms, 20% on Dark Berserkers, 75% on Demonic Tremors).  
  
Edit : Apparently, this changed after some hotfix, dunno which one. I'll make a new post, but still trying to figure it out.

1337896509.0,999,self.Diablo,u3fxw,"For those still leveling or having difficulty, here are some general tips from an A4-Inferno player regarding gear.",bigasianrichard,1423,424,379,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3fxw/for_those_still_leveling_or_having_difficulty/,"**Overview**

*Intro

*Survival through Equipment

*Making money

*Utilizing the AH

*Conclusion

***Intro***

This will be a long read. My train of thought may wander due to me being distracted from writing this as I am at work, so please bear with me.

It is a bit appalling to see so many people complain about difficulty. Earlier in A1-Inferno, I ran into another Wizard in a public game who was griping about his death-count, then I looked at his gear. Several non-rares, L40 tier gear in Inferno. /*yaomingface*

This game is a loot-whoring, equipment-based challenge with exponentially progressing difficulty, and the current item selection is unfortunately terrible at the moment due to the current main pack of users not reaching Inferno yet. Please realize that this is not a heavily hacked/botted D2 that has been out for ages. It has barely been a week and the standard quality of items on the AH is still subpar...not to mention inflated and overpriced. The AH itself has been broken several times as well so the market is messed up.  Supply is low and demand is high. I say this as an A-4 Inferno player sitting on a few million gold and I am simply unable to find optimal gear as the stat affixes are rarely a 'perfect' match for what I am seeking. The gear either hasn't been found yet, or there's not enough of it causing prices to soar. The top DPS chart is a prime example: A few days ago it was mostly blues. Now more rares are appearing, slowly but surely eclipsing the magic items.

***Survival Tips***

From simple observation of those completing Inferno,  I think you will agree with me that the challenge requires both a combination of flawless execution on top of top-notch equipment. It has been proven doable, albeit an incredible challenge. With that said, you need to learn how to 'optimize' your equipment and know what to look for. 

Prior to reaching L51+, there were a ton of stat affixes I didn't even know existed. There are even more at L60. Take a look at the searchable criteria in the AH and you can see that different armor slots vary in options, i.e. Knockback, AP on crit, class specific buffs, melee &amp; ranged damage reduction, all resist, etc which are not available at low levels.

Now you might ask, what should I prioritize? Anyone can stack class-specific stats to boost damage, and with high DPS weapons becoming more readily available, it is easy to boost your output. ***The problem is finding armor that gives BOTH survival and DPS,*** which is a critical factor for surviving Inferno.

* Wizard - INT &amp; VIT
* Monk - DEX &amp; VIT
* Barb - STR &amp; VIT
* WD - INT &amp; VIT
* DH - DEX &amp; VIT

I think we can all agree that it is easy to find these two-stat combos for your class. The main problem is items with only these stats do not provide survival other than base HP &amp; DPS.

Here are several example affixes you should/could look for to bolster your survival rate in addition to your standard 2 stats. These higher tier stats are accessible once you reach the L-51 equipment (Hell drops), and improve in effectiveness (numbers) all the way up to L60 (Inferno drops).

* **All Resist (includes physical resist).** This will give you % based mitigation, which is REQUIRED in Inferno, as the raw DPS of mobs has a very high minimum. Trash mobs can hit you for 20k in A1, and don't even get me started on elemental damage. At 600+ resist on my Wizard (I still have plenty of ways to go), going back to A1-I feels like I'm back in Hell as a L50, and makes life through A2-4 that much less harrowing. I'm starting to see items on the AH with huge +resist numbers, even into the +70s. 
* **Melee, Ranged, or Elite % DMG reduction.** Usually ranging around 3-4%, this affix will give you additional protection against mob types you might be weak against. For example, Barbs/Monks in A2 will benefit greatly from the Ranged DMG reduction.
* **Move Speed.** This is a severely underrated stat. Not only is it convenient and awesome to traverse across open ground quickly, but also great for fleeing, kiting, or microing back and forth while waiting for cooldowns. With MS you can run past packs of mobs should you choose not to fight, and not even really need any abilities (exceptions exist, a la A2). 
* **Regen.** Self explanatory, helps combat enemy DPS in boss fights, etc. However, you must first be able to withstand getting 1-2shotted for this to have any value.

In addition, there are many class-specific bonuses and other DPS-improvements that will greatly increase your output, which will shorten the time it takes you to kill mobs which is good for both farm/progression rates and survival. Killing faster means you take less damage over time. IAS, Crit%, CritDMG%, and other on hit effects like stun, knockback, slow, may provide extra utility in fights. Pick these according to your build. 

***Money &amp; Obtaining Rares***

With the introduction of the AH, trading is grossly simplified compared to D2. No more sitting in chat channels spamming your items! However, you still need gold to get what you want.

* **Magic-find**. Very important when it comes to loot farming. I started stacking MF as soon as I reached Hell (easily over 90% by L51). Hell was not too difficult as many of you can attest, so running with MF will not really detract from your survival like it might in Inferno. Just from questing, I was able to supplement my gold income by selling decent items. Yes, the market is a bit saturated when it comes to lower level equipment, but it's all relative. If you start early, selling items for as cheap as 2k, it beats the shit out of selling to the NPC. Gold earned is gold earned, and over time you will start to accumulate wealth. 
* **Gold-Find**. I personally have not bothered with GF, but seeing as how I picked up quite a bit by the time I finished Hell, that % difference might have given me a decent profit. Perhaps someone else can provide insight for this.
* ***NPCs** As reddit user Jakabov has mentioned, the NPCs sometimes sell good items for cheap...so often you can flip the item for a profit. MF jewelry is one of the most demanded items, as every class is able to utilize this stat and many players carry an entire set of MF gear.

I've seen a lot of people complain about not being able to farm Inferno gear. Yes, it is a bit of a catch-22. You can't just dive into Inferno and expect to easily farm elites if you are using L40 equipment. Spend some time in Hell and grind it out. You can find great L51+ gear in Hell which will give you an advantage when it comes to starting in Inferno. And if you don't find gear that will fit you, sell it on the AH and within time you will be able to accumulate exceptional wares. Speaking of which...

***Auction House***

Familiarize yourself with the Auction House search features. No, it is not the most comprehensive system and could use more functions, but that is another topic. I've spent many hours using the AH and have found much success here (as well as blunders). No, it's not as exciting to many of you, but to me it's still part of the game. At the least, it's a resourceful tool to be used at your disposal. If there was no AH, there's no way I would be where I am now.

* **Overwhelmed with too many items in your search?**. Add more search criteria. Restrict it to your current level. I.e, if I'm L40, I'd be looking at 30-40 EQ. If too many items turn up, start decreasing the scope of the search. Restrict it to 38-40. Or add a stat and put a minimum search value in. If you click on the columns, you can sort by DPS, Armor rating, or buy-out value. 
* **Finding good buys**. I find the most success by restricting my search value so I only see a few pages. This allows me to compare similar equipment to find items with the right set of stats. From there, I then gloss over the prices to find affordable equipment. 
* **Can't find something at the moment?**. Search for something else in the meantime. Look at your weakest armor piece and try to replace it. Given the huge player-base, there are items coming up in real-time at an exorbitant rate. Sometimes if you just sit and refresh your search for a few minutes, you'll come across great buys at low prices. With the AH restricted to 10 items, many players will undercut to unload items faster. As a buyer, use this to your advantage. 
* **Play the market**. Use the undercutting to your advantage! Rare item with decent stats for 5k, when everything else is 30k+? Flip it! I've made a few hundred K just picking off cheap items and doubling the sale price. Sometimes the seller might have a full stash so he's offloading for cheap. Sometimes he might just be stupid and not know the market-value of his treasures. 


***Conclusion***

The game has been out for a bit over a week. Yes, there are people who rushed through, but don't focus on their achievements/exploits as much as you should on yourself. In the end, it's all about you having fun. Take your time, go at your own pace. If you find yourself having difficulty, stop and analyze your situation. If you have room to improve, then you know what you need to do. Sometimes it's a problem with gear. Sometimes, you might be employing the wrong strategy. This game presents you with many different *(and some bullshit, another topic)* situations. Taking that into account, solving different problems with the same solution might not always work. Change your skill loadout, try different builds. Ask a friend to help, or even for advice. Read up in r/diablo3strategy. You need to adapt in order to overcome, and often times it is a process which requires patience and effort. Don't get mad, take a break and distance yourself from the emotional anger and maybe you will be able to see the situation more objectively or from another perspective. Within due time, quality equipment will soon become an affordable commodity. Perhaps that is a little bit of something we all need.

(kallell)

Doing this while having your inventory open should compare the item on the ground to what you currently are wearing as well. (broken1000)

2- There is a “force move” (labeled “Move” and is unbound by default) button that is unbound by default. This is helpful for running through packs of monsters and not accidentally clicking and attacking one. (need to manually bind) (kallell)

3- You can link items by bringing up the chat text box and shift+clicking an item, making it easier to show items to people to see if they need them or if you're in different areas. (twincannon)

4- If you think you have an upgrade for someone you're playing with, instead of asking him you can inspect him by right clicking his icon on the top-left. (twincannon)

5- Whites/grays sell for next to nothing and really aren't worth the inventory space outside of the first act, just toss that junk for less town trips (make sure to check the prices in nightmare mode and beyond though, who knows if this will change later on). (twincannon)

6- Buy +2-4 damage magic rings ASAP, they're pretty overpowered when they become equippable at level 6. Restart the game a few times if they don't show up, or if they give a poor secondary bonus. (twincannon).  Buy @ Radek the Fence: http://i.imgur.com/C0VXGh.jpg (Sf4tt)

7- Never sell magic items to a vendor as the crafting mats will probably sell for more in most cases (will change in retail but in beta, magic stuff sold for 50-75 usually and the essence sold for 150). Also rumors that you can trade the essence upwards, i.e. 10 normal mode essence for 1 nightmare mode one. (twincannon)

8- Dont waste money on bigger stash early on, make mules to hold items, (twincannon)

9- If leveling up with a friend, designate one of you for leveling up the ~~jeweler artisan~~ (JC is MUCH cheaper) and one for blacksmith artisan, saving half the money required. (twincannon)

Although I don't remember the exact numbers, the Blacksmith will require about ~700,000 gold to level up to max, while the jeweler will only take about ~45,000. (tolvinar)


10- You can hold left click to run around and simply tap shift to ""stutter walk"" fire instead of clicking the mouse (holding shift and casting will make you cast the ability in place,), works well for ranged characters to give your clicking finger a bit of a break. (twincannon)

11- If you've got a big friends list and don't want people to join your game without your permission, or just want to play alone, there's an option to disallow ""Quick Join"" under social options which is what makes your game show up with a ""Join"" button for friends (twincannon)

12-If  you open your inventory (C or I), and THEN hold ctrl while mousing over the ground loot, it will pop out the compare box instead of just the item's own stat box.
(similar to when mousing over an item in your inventory -- shows dps changes, etc.) (exuled)

13- And if you hold ALT it will compare to your off-hand/equip to your off-hand, while in inventory of course. Handy for dual-wielders. Also works on rings. (Nyctalgia)

14- You need to activate lecterns yourself. It is different than a chest as only you can activate your lecterns. If they don't drop lore they can still drop gold. (rec916)

15- When you are leaving a game and the timer is counting down because you are not in town, your mouse does not work but your keyboard does. You may be frozen and getting beat up while waiting to leave the game but you can still fire off those skills with 1-4. (rec916)

16-Lore books give EXP, make sure to pick up all you can. (Only works on lore books you have not already picked up!) (ethereal4k)

17- Elective mode (off by default). Gives MUCH more customization on where to stick your skills on your bar. (KroBa)

18 – Advanced tool tips (off by default). Shows advanced skill information such as % damage increase and what the skill does (KroBa)

19- While each player gets their own loot and gold drops, the health globes you pick up are shared and will heal other players if they are nearby. (Tolvinar)

20- Hitting ""g"" will make your banner fly down wherever your mouse is pointing at. Shows off your achievements as well. (Tolvinar)

21- Hitting ""f"" will bring up your follower's (templar's) inventory. Don't forget to choose his skills and give him equipment! (Tolvinar)

22- Once you begin the fight with Jondar, use town portal and then wait in town for about 2 minutes. Once you go back through the portal Jondar will have summoned about 50 skeletons. They will most likely be in a tight group so you can get big massacre bonuses from this.( Tolvinar)
That tip with Jondar will be great if they still have the achievement to kill 20 monsters in a single hit. I never managed that in the beta. (Oneironaut2)

23- Pressing ""alt"" will make items on the ground show their names for 10 seconds. The time can be adjusted in the options menu. (Tolvinar)

24- Intead of playing with your pinky on the shift key and the rest of your appendages on numbers 1-4 try this. switch the hold key from shift (default) to the spacebar. I felt it more comfortable if I played spacebar instead of shift. (spaceboundmonkeys)

25- Pressing 'Z' zooms in on your character until you press it again. (nathanstratton2010)

26- Checking  the advanced tooltips option in the game play menus will show additional item information in your inventory while holding CTRL key. (snhender)

27- Numpad 0-9 will make your character say in game phrases (both audible and to chat).  (kallell)

28- When hovering over a weapon in your inventory or a merchant it will bring up your currently equipped item to compare. However if you're dual wielding it will only bring up your primary hand. To quick view the other hand just hold alt. (dextini)

29 -You must be level 10 to do hardcore. (kallell)

30 – Your battletag is what is going to show up in game to your friends. As of now, character names really do not matter outside of the character select screen and in game dialog with NPCs. Pick a battletag that’s easily remembered and that you wouldn’t mind others seeing! (kallell)

31- Patch 1.0.1. bug - Running programs that put an overlay over Diablo III (such as Mumble, Xfire, and MSI Afterburner) can cause Diablo III to crash. Use these overlays at your own risk. (kallell)

32- Treasure goblins will disappear if they are not killed fast enough. Make sure once you see them they become a priority as they can drop vast amounts of gold and loot. (kallell)

33- Gems in game drop up to rank 8 now, ranks 9-14 need to be crafted. (kallell)

34 – Magic find is averaged across group members. IE: if player a has 300 mf, and player B has 100, the MF rate for the group is 200. You get 20% of companion MF(kallell)

35- There is no “procs” for new recipes in crafting. All recipes become available on a rank by rank basis. (kallell)

36- Monster scaling (damage and HP) depends on the difficulty (norm, nightmare, hell, inferno) and players in game. Details can be seen here - http://goo.gl/BBKPU. (kallell)
**You WILL NOT get more exp per monsters the more players you have in the game. You do however, gain killing speed – theoretically farming monsters faster which in turn gives more exp and loot.** (kallell)

37- If you fall behind or wander off away from your party, use your town portal and click their banner to quickly catch up.

38- Make sure to delete your D3 beta entirely (including files in programdata/battlenet) ortherwise your D3 install may not work correctly. (kallell)

39- MAKE SURE TO UPDATE GRAPHIC CARD DRIVERS (and sound card drivers if you have non-integrated ones)! This can have vast improvements on FPS. (kallell)

41- There will be two types of auction houses. RMAH and Gold AH. Gold sounds exactly like what it is. Sell and buy items off the AH with in game gold. 
With RMAH, you have two options. Send money straight to paypal or use “battle bucks”. If you choose to use battle bucks, the money will reside in your bnet account and can be used for other AH purchases, or blizzard merchandise. YOU CANNOT cash this out. If you intend on getting cash for items, be sure to go the paypal route.(kallell) 

42- RMAH will not be available for the first week after launch. (kallell)

43-**RMAH:**
- Blizzard charges $1 + 15% transfer fee  to paypal for items. 

-For commodities Blizzard charges 15% for the item itself, and another 15% transfer fee to paypal.  

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $0.30 + 2.9% paypal fee**
Formulas:

Items

(Sale Price - 1)*(1-Blizzard to Paypal Transfer Fee) = Profit

(Sale Price - 1)*(1-.15) = Profit

Commodities

(Sale Price)*(1-Blizzard Commodities Fee)*(1-Blizzard to Paypal Transfer Fee) = Profit

(Sale Price)*(1-.15)*(1-.15) = Profit

What are commodities?
Crafting materials (from salvaging items), gems, and gold.

Additional info and calculation tables - http://tinyurl.com/bnfmwfg (kallell)

44-The official authenticator should be out today (May 14th) for 6.50 + S. However, you can always get the mobile app for free on any smartphone. (kallell)
**Furthermore at the very least, make sure you sign up for mobile alerts. That way you get texted if anything is changed on your account (password, personal info, etc) Info and signup is here - http://tinyurl.com/7mu68rz (kallell)

45 – Dual wielding gives 15% attack speed bonus. (riraito)

46- The best magic finding will be from killing rares around the world rather than simply boss farming (unlike d2). Every rare pack you kill, you gain a (stacking) Nephalem valor buff which increases your gold and magic find. Dying or switching runes removes this buff. Only kicks in after level 60(kallell)

47-You can re-assign the 1234 keys to QWER (good for MOBA players)(riraito)

48 - Bosses have enrage timers. Inferno only?(kallell)

49 - Press X to show hp bars of every individual monster (altzan)

I think it's a great achievement, not only for him, but for the 'little guy'. This past week, people were talking about Method and Athene, as if they exist in a gods-only domain of sorts. Not saying they aren't good or trying to take credit away from them, but it's not like they're the only ones that are good. There a lot of great games out there that just don't have the exposure or opportunities others have.

So again, well done to DirtyYoda/Sygo on the world first achievement

That's not the point.  The point is that I'm reading far too many posts and comments of just a bunch of people saying ""I've played 200+ hours and this game sux luzlz"".  This is too common of a complaint.  If you've put more than 10 hours into this game, and by that time you still aren't having fun, you should quit.

It's almost like you hate eating at McDonalds, yet you eat there every day, and then bitch about how much the food sucks.  Stop eating there.

TLDR:  If you aren't having fun playing Diablo 3, stop playing.  It's not going to magically become a better game for you overnight.

original survey: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v0b6z/after_4_weeks_a_survey/

Hey r/diablo! The results are in! The first entry (mine) was at 6/13/2012 15:23:45 (new york time) and the last one was at 6/14/2012 1:48:05. There were 12391 responses which is just over 18 responses per minute or 1 response every 3.33 seconds. I never imagined it would get this big. We actually hit the max file size for Google documents. Sorry to everyone who tried to submit but got an error.

Firstly, I want to point out the the survey had some flaws. 

* From the comments, I found you either hated the answers or loved them. So some of the answers probably had some bias in them.

* Some questions didn't have a ""not sure"" or a ""maybe"" answer. I tried to avoid these as much as I could but some questions that needed one didn't have one. (I can't believe some people haven't used the followers yet!).

* I asked the ""Is your main class the most fun"" questions because I thought Google would only give me totals and not the detailed information.

* The survey kind of assumed you were a semi-serious gamer and that you played D2. So I apologize to the people that didn't know what a ""main class"" or who Deckard Cain was.

But enough with this stuff. On to the stats. So without further ado, here is the raw data:

**EDIT: TO VIEW SUMMARY RESULTS GO HERE:** http://imgur.com/a/HE39O

**EDIT2: google docs is slow with big documents (as we found out the hard way). so have patience please with the raw data.**

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqUcfPcf2zkMdGZPcW1uTUZKY0NlSk9iak5NdHY4dEE

**INTERESTING FACTS** (read the results first imo)

Since I can't install any programs at work the only tool I had to parse the data was Eclipse (Java IDE) so excuse the lack of pictures.

- The average score for ""Rate Diablo 3 overall"" was ~ 7.59

- The average score for people that answered 'Yes' to ""Is your main class the most fun?"" was ~ 7.74. If you answered 'No', it was ~ 7.39. Also if you answered 'Yes' to ""Is your main class the most powerful?"", the score was ~7.65. 'No' was ~7.57. Glad to see that r/diablo is rational!

- If you said you didn't use the auction house, you gave a lower than average rating (~7.41).

- If you said you were an achievement hunter, you gave a higher than average rating (~7.77)

- If you said you didn't like the new boss fighting mechanics, you gave a substantially lower than average rating (~6.70)

**EDIT:** [Read](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v28yu/after_4_weeks_results/c50sk2j) what Robo-Connery has to say about how ""class does not affect the persons perception of the quality of the game"".

- Based on what you said your main class was, from highest average rating to lowest: Monk (~7.65), Barbarian (~7.62), Witch Doctor (~7.61), Wizard (~7.59), Demon Hunter (~7.48). This is almost the opposite of how they ranked in terms of power.

- Accordingly, when asked the question ""Do you think you still be playing Diablo 3 a year down the road?"", Demon Hunters and Wizards had the highest average for ""No, this game will not last"" at 15.9% and 15.6% respectively. Every other class was &lt; 15% (which is the average).

- 12.1% of Demon Hunters have beaten Diablo on Inferno difficulty with at least one character, followed by 9.7% of Wizards, 7.1% of Monks, 7.0 % of Barbarians and 5.7% of Witch Doctors.

- 49.7% of Witch Doctors think their class is the most fun. Compared to 65.8% of Barbarians.

- As you'd expect, Barbarians are the most likely to be hardcore with 4.9% of Barbarians being hardcore mains, followed by Monks (3.7%), Witch Doctors (3.7%), Wizards (2.4%) and Demon Hunters (1.7%).

- The breakdown of the ""Do you feel like enough character information is exposed?"" question by main character class almost matches the overall results (give or take 2%). In other words, how you answered this question doesn't depend on your main class. The same is true for the ""Which act is the most fun?"" question.

- Barbarians are slightly more likely to read/listen to the lore than the other classes.

- Demon Hunters are slightly more likely to have used the RMAH (buying or selling)

- 12% of Demon Hunters think that the Scoundrel is the best follower for ranged compared to 6% of Wizards and 6% of Witch Doctors. (I will add that this question couldnt be skipped and some people haven't used the followers yet so it could be skewed)

- 52 redditors answered ""Yes, it's my main"" to the hardcore question and a variation of ""Yes"" to beating diablo in inferno. Congrats!

AVERAGE|27.42%|34.68%|15.92%|16.46%|3.85%|1.67%

- 35% of people who rated Diablo 0 are in the first gold bracket but 10% of the same people are in the top gold bracket. Conversely, 31% of people that gave Diablo a 10 are in the first gold bracket.

- 64% of the 117 people who chose Magdha as their favourite new character said that they listened to the lore (""stayed awhile and listened"").

- 242 Redditors who answered 'Yes' to ""Is your class the most powerful?"" didn't answer the question ""Which class is the most powerful?"" with their main class. 115 Redditors answered 'No' and then actually put their own class.

- I can't believe over 50% of people answered the last question with ""WHAT A MONSTROUS CREATURE"". I guess the WILL OF A TEMPLAR isn't stronger.

**WORD CLOUD**

There are 3 versions of the word cloud. There's a completely uncensored, unparsed version with just the copypasta from the spreadsheet. Then there's one where I went through and consolidated all the similar words (ie JONDAR = JONDARRR, JONDARRRRR, JOHNDIZZLE, JONDAAARRRRARARA!!!). The last version is a consolidated and censored version with no offensive words (I only removed the large obcenities, there might be some in small print).

So I just want to say thanks to everyone that participated and feel free to come up with your own facts. What would be really cool is if someone made an infographic or something. If you have any facts you want to add to the OP just comment with it and I'll add it after I verify it. Also, just throwing this out there, but do we want another survey in 4 weeks with questions from the community? I wouldn't mind organizing it.

1345944473.0,924,self.Diablo,yu04r,Paragon levels are great because you can't buy them. I think the game needs more rewards that can't come from the auction house. ,coelomate,1192,268,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/yu04r/paragon_levels_are_great_because_you_cant_buy/,"As Jay Wilson admitted in his recent comment, and many in the community have suspected, the auction house short-circuits the item hunt and can make the game frustrating or boring when the gear you find pales in comparison to gear that can be had for relatively little on the auction house.

1.04 made two big improvements. First, paragon experience is something to improve your character that only comes from time and slaying - not from the auction house. Second and also important is that better drops and nerfed content means even if more gear we see isn't valuable, it is at least ""good"" and could be used for self-found characters to progress. Finding a good item that I know won't sell well frustrates me less than finding junk. 

I think more content like that first bullet point would really help the game's longevity. Here are some ideas: 


* **Enchantments**: Bringing the enchanter NPC into the game and letting enchanted gear be transferred or placed on the auction house but destroying the enchantments when moved to a different account (via trade, dropping, or the auction house). 

* **Account bound gear:** Probably account bound on equip. These items could either be sprinkled into the loot table or drop as special rewards. It would allow the drop rate for some good gear to be dramatically increased, making that ""next good drop around the corner"" come back into existence, without making the auction house irrelevant. 

* **Bind on pickup aesthetic enhancements:** Particle effects, more interesting dies, weapon enlargers, auras, demon wings, whatever. Stuff that will be fun to find but won't imbalance the game.

* **Endless dungeon:** Stat rewards, enchantment rewards, or account bound item rewards. 

* **Follower rewards:** Unlock an extra few gear slots for followers. 

* **PVP and PVP rewards:** Could be any of the above things. ",,False,self,t5_2qore,1345949307.0,,barb-americas idscroll,True,t3_yu04r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/yu04r/paragon_levels_are_great_because_you_cant_buy/,

Act I. Why would Belial need Tyrael? Trust. Tyrael makes the worst decisions but is loved by humanity; saving him will instantly remove the agent of Belial (the PC) from suspicion.

Act II. Tyrael and our gang are hunting down the last lords of hell to put them into the Soulstone. Ever wondered why the Belial boss is twenty times bigger than the Prime Evil? And how he isn't the least bit sneaky, especially in the fight? That's because it isn't Belial. It's a servant who Belial has selected--Belial remains outside the Soulstone, but Adria (and Diablo) believe he is defeated.

Cinematic with Azmodan--Azmodan addresses Diablo inside Leah; he knows of Adria's plot. If Belial is the Lord of Lies, wouldn't he have caught on too?

Act III. Azmodan is a master strategist; but, at critical moments, he informs you of his plans, thus allowing you to thwart them. Would a master strategist do that? No. The visions of Azmodan are not of Azmodan at all, but are conjured up by Belial so the player character can react to Azmodan's plans without suspicion. 

Act IV. Diablo, believing he has assumed the power of all the Lords of Hell, assaults Heaven. Again, he reveals his plans--as before, this is Belial's predictions, manifested in false visions. Diablo is, of course, defeated, and his defeat total--he and the other six lords of hell are imprisoned in the Soulstone, that is conveniently chucked off the edge of Heaven--that Belial might simply pick it up at his leisure, and become the true Prime Evil, weaving his web of lies against the weakened and unsuspecting angels.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_v9f12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v9f12/guys_i_figured_it_out_the_story_now_makes_sense/,

Diablo 3 Is a good game, but it could be better. There I said it, can we move on now?

Most posts on this subreddit (86.2%+) are all negative. People are criticizing Bashiok and saying the game is poorly designed. 

If you are one of the people that keeps posting they are shelving the game then:
- Quit the game, stop whining on the forums. Stop posting your going to do it, ""just do it"". - Nike.  

If there's is a change of redeeming your soul, then please read on.

So I will say now, some of the things in this game **have** been produced poorly. I think, making the Auction House a major part of the game was fine, but I think the AH itself is terrible and could of been done considerably better. Its small things like this that make the difference, It would be more forgivable if it was Blizzards first game, but considering the WoW auction house is pretty much perfect, then why can't they borrow the ideas? 

There have been a lot of Bugs, Rubberbanding and AI errors which need to be fixed.

This is where we get to the bit I fully support Bashiok one:

For the first month of release, all over this forum people were whining and bitching about the game. They released the 1.03 design preview and did an AMA. (Seriously, how many major game companies can you name, they actually ask the community what it is they want). 

The Design preview was received relatively well, as it seemed to tick most of the boxes of the whiners and shut a few people up.  They are a few **major** game changing elements I disagree with (Elites regen off the screen, Chest not affected by MF and Ilevel63 loot going from 20% to 8% in Act3-4). However, largely the patch notes were very uplifting and I felt like we, as a community, were being listed too. 

Most people whining on the SubReddit are complaining about IAS. Are you serious? IAS was way too overpowered, it resulted in people being where they shouldn't have the gear to be and most ranged players destroying in Siegebreaker runs. My DH was using 2 level 50 rings because of +15% AS on both of them, and Ilevel 60 Rare rings were listed as worse. 

I think the damage nerf in Inferno is a a slight shame, but largely required. For a Melee class to progress through Inferno it took a large gold investment and most people felt pigeon holed into builds. I have a DH and a Barb, but I understand that most Monks were disappointed that they had to use a shield, and I was a bit miffed that DPS wasn't viable for me unless I spent ungodly amounts of gold. 

I **do** think Bashiok's PR skills need a bit of work, commenting on Kripp and Krippis Diablo was unprofessional in the manner that he did it, I also think that hes a bit to laid back given the current circumstances. 


I think, all in all, this subreddit would be a lot better with more positive posts, and the constant criticism of how your DPS has gone from 100k to 90k should be dropped. I understand Negative criticism is important, but every post on the front page at the moment is whining about the patch. 2 weeks ago, it was whining that we needed a patch! 

Ok my rant is over, but I think that we should show Blizzard and Bashiok more respect for their close relationship with the Reddit community. I think the game has improved over the month, and when they get time (Yes, I do believe it is a Time/Resource issue), when they get time, we will see the Auction House improved. 

**TLDR** : Be grateful, you are proving to be ""impossible to please"".

I have 232k dps after my buffs, with my improved archon that's 754k dps, how the wild fuck am I supposed to survive a reflect pack? I know what you are going to say, give up dps and get more health, give up dps and get more resists, but why? If I can tank most enemies (Not arcane or molten but that makes sense) why do I have to change my entire build for one broken retarded game mechanic that 100% should not be there.
Who here thinks the game is more fun because reflect damage is in it? Fuck you.

Life is hardcore mode, and as pissed off as you got when you're lvl 70 bowamanceadin died, there will be oodles more rage if you die in real life before you get to play Diablo 3.

So here are some tips on keeping you chained to the mortal realm in the short term (for long term tips, see the back of a Cheerios box):


&gt; Don't answer the door for anyone.

   You don't know who's knocking. It could be the pizza guy but it could also NOT be the pizza guy. Play it safe.


&gt; Don't go outside.

   Outside is a dangerous place filled with dangerous dangers. Depending on where you live, outside could feel like Normal, Nightmare, Hell, or Inferno (the Inferno designation is relegated to Camden, NJ). But guess what? We're basically all lvl 1 hardcore characters, so even normal difficulty can mean your demise. Whether its getting bludgeoned by an undesirable outside the corner store or  run down on the sidewalk during Jenny's first driving lesson in her brand new BMW, it's better to play it safe and confine yourself to your house for the next 32 hours.


&gt; Don't live near an airport.

   For those that haven't seen Donny Darko, planes crash into people's houses and kill them. Statistically, your chances of this happening are probably the same as finding a Zod rune in d2 (sorry everyone that actually found a Zod). In any and all cases, if you do live near an airport, relocate...without going outside.


&gt; Keep your chimpanzee chained up.

   You can't play without a face.


&gt; Only eat foods that are high in quality, life-preserving goodness.

   These include foods that are sealed up in cans, or frozen plastic wrap. Make sure there is a trademarked name that you trust on the front of the food. No one has ever died from anything that had Dinty Moore on the front of it (and stop asking me for sources on that). Personally, I would just stock up on pizza Lunchables, but that may be playing it a little too safe.


&gt; Don't make your significant other angry.

  All of the sources say that you are most likely to be murdered by someone close to you. So, keep your significant other, and probably all of your friends for the matter, at a distance. If they ask you why you're acting weird just smile, say I love you, and slink awkwardly out of the room. If your significant other is a female, make sure to have bowls of dark chocolate littered throughout the house to keep them sated and blissful.


&gt; Finally, Keep your eye on the prize!

   Stay completely alert at all times. Be adroit and dexterous. If you keep aware that your life hangs by a thread, you may see a possible Final Destination type situation before it happens (no rollercoasters or tanning beds, people.) 


If you follow this guide, you WILL SURVIVE! I really just want everyone to make it to launch day in one piece; and if it has to be two pieces, I hope at least one eye and two hands make it intact. A little over day to go, people. We can do this. Good luck.

When I was just a baby, Blizzard had a surprise drawing for Diablo with very vague details. All anyone knew was that if they wanted to be a part of the drawing, they had to send a postcard to Blizzard with your name on it, and after a said date, they would pick a card at random to win the prize. Being a very big Blizzard fan, my father decided to take part in this. He thought about it for a while, and decided that since my name is so unique, he would send the postcard in with my name on it instead of his. My first name comes from the Harrison Ford's character in the movie Blade Runner, my middle name is my mother's maiden name, and my last name is my fathers family name. 

It had been about 4 or 5 months after my father had sent in this postcard with my name on it to Blizzard, and he had begun to forget about it, and accepted that, because of the period of time sense he had sent the card in, we hadn't won this unknown prize. About 6 months after the drawing, a box arrived at my parents apartment in South Dakota. Not having ordered anything, they were curious as to why it had shown up. When they opened the box there were five things inside. A long yellow envelope, a copy of Diablo, a black hat with Blizzard in blue printed on the front, a very large Diablo T-shirt, and a blue statue of Diablo that stand a little over a foot tall. Inside the envelope was a letter from Bill Roper, the producer of Diablo, that explained that I had been chosen for the drawing prize. (I will have an imgur link to pictures of the Diablo statue, me holding the letter, and the letter up close for you to read.) The letter basically explained that the prize for being chosen in this drawing, was to have your name in the game. I honestly feel that, because of my unique name, Blizzard saw my name on the postcard and thought it suited the character they were looking to name. But either way, it's seriously cool. So if you ever wondered how Blizzard named Deckard Cain, you now know.

&gt;They are also requesting that affected gamers be given damages for troubles they may have had, and, in a much broader but more official manner, are asking the DGCCRF to have a close look at online-only DRMed games and how they work, including economically. They basically feel that it’s wrong to assume that an entire nation (well, at least France) has equal internet quality and reception across its entire territory and hence, online-only seems are harmful for some (many?) consumers (which is who they’re trying to protect).

Back in the day when I suggested new shrines, half of them ended up in the next patch. I was thrilled. Who knows what Blizzard listens to?

Thing is, if you want these features in, the posts need visibility. It would be really cool if it got like 100 upvotes or something. I don't get karma for these submissions (I've been stagnant since I started submitting only to r/Diablo the past few months... :D ) I don't expect most of these features implemented before an expansion, but the expansion is a big deal, and Blizzard **does** have a track record of taking community feedback and rollign with it.
_____________________


1. Survival mode
----
Two teams of four in two different arenas. Endless waves of monsters. Killing monsters gives you the currency you need to send havoc to the other team. Anyone that has played SC2 custom ""massing"" games will be familiar with this concept.

This mode has leaderboards.

2. Duel mode
-----
1v1 PvP with the option to put items ""up for grabs."" The 1v1 part is straightforward, the item betting is basically like a trade window. Both players negotiate and put up an item, and the winner takes all.

This mode has leaderboards.

3. Best offer! For auctions.
-----
I don't know why this is not implemented. Let me just throw up an auction for any price I want, let me set the reserve price, and let people make offers for my item! It may be up for 200m, but you bet your ass I'll take 180m from a guy who is just a little short.

Likewise, I keep seeing auctions for insane gear up for WEEKS, and sometimes I am really close to the amount, and I bet anything that seller would part with his DML for 298mil insteal of 300mil.

4. The dyes modifications I listed in a previous thread of mine.
----
Link to that feature: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/14h0y3/does_anyone_else_want_more_dyes_the_ability_to/



5. Endless Dungeon (keeping it simple...ish?)
----
I'd say the first 100 levels should be well thought out and planned, and the rest would just be a linear increase in difficulty. Open to anyone at any time at any level, you can jump right in and have fun. You'd have a town area you can teleport to at any time, and every 10 levels you get a checkpoint that lets you start at that point or any previous checkpoint in future runs. For every level you clear, you get 5% bonus MF/EXP. No Monster Power here. NV functions the same as it would anywhere at level 60. Every 10 levels would be a bonus boss battle. Each level contains elites, which vary in affix number and quantity. Below are some hypothetical gear checks

- Level 1-3: Clearable by any Normal mode player using self-found gear, only one elite per level with one affix
- Level 4-6: Clearable by any Nightmare mode player using self-found gear, one elite per level with two affixes
- Level 7-10: Clearable by any Hell mode player using self-found gear, 1-3 elites per level with three affixes
- Level 11-13: Clearable by any Inferno mode player using self-found gear, 2-3 elites per level with four affixes
- Level 14-15: Inferno MP0, 3 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 16-20: Inferno MP1, 3-4 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 21-25: Inferno MP2, ""
- Level 26-30: Inferno MP3, 4-5 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 31-35: Inferno MP4, ""
- Level 36-45: Inferno MP5, 5 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 46-55: Inferno MP6, ""
- Level 56-65: Inferno MP7, ""
- Level 66-80: Inferno MP8, 6 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 81-100: Inferno MP9, ""
- Level 100-125: Inferno MP10, 5-7 elites, 4 affixes
- Level 125+: Inferno MP10 mobs with +1% damage/health per level, 4-8 elites per level, every 10 levels elites gain an affix, until they have all affixes. 

Let's just say the goal is to make things insanely difficult, but do something with the drops too so that people can gear for the challenge. Aside from the MF/EXP bonuses, defeating a boss has a chance to drop an additional Legendary. Let's say 1% chance at level 10, and +0.5% every 10 levels. Hypothetically, after 1000 level clears, bosses have a 50% chance to drop a Legendary.

Gold drops are disabled in this dungeon.

This mode has leaderboards.

**EDIT:** Don't get me wrong now, I really love this game and haven't had enough of it by far. It's just that there are already certain flaws, which will only perpetuate if they are not adressed.

* The 'health globes grant +X life' stat on items is kind of lame.
* Potions are typically used most when health globes are less likely to be around (during combat vs champions/bosses), so there wouldn't be any 'doubling up' on the healing bonus from this stat.

Seems like a no-brainer to kill 2 birds with one stone: improve a lame stat, and give potions an interesting way to scale as your gear improves.

**Fury Generation**

First of all you'll notice that there is no usual fury generator, thats because theyre all melee skills and dont really fit with the idea behind this build.

Your bread and butter for fury generation - and also a great single target nuke - is Ancient Spear, with the Skirmish rune it generates 30 fury. With only a 10 second cooldown, the spell is quite spammable and the passive No Escape resets the cooldown whenever you crit, allowing you to generate another 30 fury - if you hadn't guessed yet, high crit chance is a big part of this build.

War Cry is the other main fury generator, casting it at the start of a fight with the Charge rune generates a massive 60 fury. Couple this with an Ancient Spear and right off the bat you have 90 fury.

90 fury will only get you so far, however, which is why No Escape is so crucial to the build. Critical hits with Weapon Throw have a chance to generate 14 fury. When facing large mobs of enemies - or infact atleast 3 - Weapon Throw's Ricochet rune becomes amazing, each individual crit has a chance to generate 14 fury. While unlikely it is possible to generate 32 fury with a single Weapon Throw ([3*14] - 10).

**Gear and Stats**

For this build you are going to want crit chance. However, it does not take much crit chance to prevent fury starvation. In fact I find a mere 20% crit chance is enough to stop this happening (and I often forget to recast warcry / use harpoon on cooldown). The great news is that the passives Ruthless and Weapons Master will give you +15% crit chance just for wielding a mace/axe. Ontop of the base 5% crit chance you already have 20%! Battle Rage also gives a bonus 3% crit chance.

The best weapon to be using with this build is a 2 handed mace. This is because your damage relies entire on cooldown spells (Ancient Spear) and a fury spender (Weapon Throw). The low attack speed high damage of a 2 handed mace will give you the most punch for your fury (and cooldown). It is also necessary to use a mace/axe to recieve the 10% crit chance from Weapons Master.

For people curious about the viability of might weapons with this build - Weapons Master does not seem to generate fury with Weapon Throw. Sometimes the first hit seemed to generate 3 fury and sometimes none at all, but I never gained 9 for hitting 3 enemies. If this worked it would be a very effective weapon choice with this build, causing Weapon Throw to effectively cost only 1 fury, aslong as there were 3 enemies to hit.

High crit chance goes hand in hand with high crit damage, Ruthless gets you started with +50% but gear with high crit damage will serve you well, however it should probably still be taken as secondary to strength unless your crit chance is exceptionally high.

You don't need to tank up quite so much with this build as you will be aiming to stay away from the enemies and kiting them, but needless to say having lots of vit and armor is mandatory in higher difficulties.

**Skill Rundown**

I already wrote a lot on Ancient Spear and War Cry so I will skip over those skills in this section.

Weapon Throw is your main damage skill in this build, and Ricochet makes it hit 3 targets, great!
The fact that each individual crit with Ricochet can generate fury makes it mostly self-sustaining against hordes of enemies with ~30% crit. Versus bosses, however, replacing Ricochet with Throwing Hammer is recommended because of the great 50% 2 second stun chance. It requires a higher crit chance to reach self-sustainability versus bosses but use of your fury generators should keep fury up.

Battle Rage is just a great self buff, giving 30% increased damage with Marauders Rage and increasing that all-important crit chance by 3%. It costs 20 rage but the increased damage means you require less Weapon Throws to kill the enemy - which in turn reduces fury expenditure. The increased crit chance also helps you gain fury with Weapon Throw and reset the Ancient Spear cooldown for yet more fury.

The remaining 2 spells Furious Charge and Ground Stomp come down to personal preference. These are basically the defensive skills, 1 escape and 1 control. Ground Stomp is increadibly powerful and every Barbarian should have it on their skill bar, but replace it if you want. I use Foot of the Mountain just to help a little more with fury generation. But note that while Wrenching Smash is the usual go-to rune for Ground Stomp, it doesn't work very well with this particular build. Furious Charge can be replaced with Leap if you are more comfortable with it. However, I chose the charge for my escape as with the Merciless Assault rune escaping through enemies keeps the cooldown low, and having your escape off-cooldown is always good.

**Gameplay**

First of all let me say the build is really FUN to play. Especially after having played lots of hours hitting things at melee range. Its great to mix things up.

The way the build usually works is you start a fight with Warcry for 60 fury, buff youself with Battle Rage, and then throw out Ancient Spear for 30 more fury - if it crits, go again! Now start spamming Weapon Throw. The great thing is it applies a 2 second 60% slow! Spamming it into a horde very quickly applies this slow to all the enemies, making kiting a breeze. The damage on each throw is also great because you're using a 2 handed mace. 

For the most part your fury should self-sustain with just Weapon Throw spam as long as you dont leave combat for too long you wont actually need to recast Warcry, keeping it off cooldown for those moments where you get unlucky with crits. Always make sure to cast Ancient Spear when its off cooldown though simply because its a great nuke. Try to cast it on enemies that cant be pulled or will be finished off by the spear, otherwise you might pull something unpleasant next to yourself and have to stomp to get away.

So you basically just run around kiting enemies, using Weapon Throw and Ancient Spear, and buffing with Battle Rage. The other skills are simple for the ""oh shit"" moments. Need to control? Ground Stomp. Need to escape? Furious Charge. Fury starved? War Cry.

I should probably note here that this build is exceptionally weak to vortex champions, but the 60% slow takes care of kiting pretty well against other types. Of course there are always those horrible combinations out there but every build struggles with them.

**Conclusion**

This build is really fun and a way for Barbarians to play range that is viable and works. I know many of you will be skeptical about becoming fury starved but I say try it! If you get over 30% crit chance then the chances of getting fury starved become almost impossible.

Let me know what you think! Anything that could be changed/improved?

EDIT: This is random but I just confirmed that you can crit scenery, no numbers show up but my Ancient Spear cooldown reset when I destroyed a cart of some sort.

EDIT2: Please note I have only tried this out in Nightmare so far, results in higher difficulties may vary! But please still give it a try. BishopAndWarlord posted [this great link](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4210102758) to a similar build by Zeltak, who has tried his out in Inferno according to his post, ""Currently I'm at Inferno Act 2, I solo'ed with some cooperative gameplay with my friend to Inferno Act 1, from there I have progressed mostly in cooperative fashion"".

EDIT3: There have been several replies basically saying the build lacks X (X often being life leech). Please just consider this as a core build idea and not a strict build. Specifically for life leech, you can change the runes on Ancient Spear and Furious Charge to Dread Spear and Dreadnought Respectively. Or for more escape/stun, replace Furious Charge with Leap with Death From Above rune. The core design is just to show that it is possible to generate enough fury to make Throw Weapon your primary attack and thus play as a range Barbarian.",,False,self,t5_2qore,1337804504.0,,barb-europe idscroll,True,t3_u13un,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u13un/the_ranged_barbarian/,

This is in response to the post I made yesterday clearing Act 1 Inferno with 500k in gear which I thought sounded much more difficult than it actually was.

Let me tell you - this one was more difficult.

A redditor by the name of codeninja has been giving me ideas for gearing cheaply for Act 3 and 4. As long as I can get by Ghom, I'm thinking 500k is the lowest I could go.

If anyone has any questions - please post them here or in the Youtube video. I'm more than happy to give out gearing and speccing advice for Monks.

I'd also highly encourage other classes to make similar videos (or even Monks - try to do it even cheaper). A lot of people have requested that I make similar videos for the other classes. I do have a Witch Doctor - but I have no idea how to play it at the same level I play my Monk.

Speaking of others - I was informed that someone else was doing similar challenges (one million gold for Acts 3 and 4). If you're a Barbarian, or just curious, you should check him out. His name is Zrave and his page is [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/zrave/b/322716460) A screenshot of his gear can be found [here.](http://i45.tinypic.com/2eba9ow.png)

If anybody gives you a price check, I guarantee you that they are just following the steps in this guide. Please do it yourself and stop wasting their time! It's really not that hard. And if you think you never find good items -- you probably do, but don't recognize it as such! I hope this guide can teach you how.

Why should you believe what I have to say? A picture is worth a thousand words, note that nearly everything I post sells. And there's a few successful flips in there. http://i.imgur.com/sMaob.jpg

**1. IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE SALES**

When a piece of gear drops, the first thing to do is to decide whether or not it's worth selling on the AH. There are some special cases, but here's the basics.

1. Weapons

If a 1-handed weapon has 900+ DPS OR 600+ DPS and 500+ life on hit, you can sell it. Any extra stats will increase the price, but do not make it worth selling on their own. For 2-handed weapons, you want 1100+ DPS to consider selling it. Lower DPS with Life on Hit is not as valuable on 2-handed weapons as it is on 1-handed.

Bows are valued a little differently than other weapons. For 2-handed bows, 1000+ DPS is worth selling OR 800+ DPS with either a socket or 50%+ crit damage. For 1-handed, consider 900+ DPS or 800+ with socket or 50%+ crit damage.

2. Armor

Armor can be a little tricky to figure out what will sell and what won't. For convenience, I have grouped stats into three categories: UNIQUE, PRIMARY, and SECONDARY. UNIQUE stats are only found on small numbers of slots, and thus are very important to have on slots that can have it. PRIMARY are useful for everyone of a given class, and SECONDARY are generally not as useful. If you have a LEGENDARY that contains a UNIQUE not generally found in that slot, it will be valuable.

    UNIQUE
    Crit Chance (Gloves, Bracers, Amulet, Ring, Helm, Off-Hand)
    Crit Damage (Gloves, Amulet, Ring)
    Attack Speed (Gloves, Amulet, Ring)
    Socket (Helm -- consider sockets in other slots as +40 stat of choice)
    Life On Hit (Amulet, Ring)
    Movement Speed (Boots)
    Max Discipline (Demon Hunter Chest, Off-Hand)
    (Other class-specific? Unsure)

    PRIMARY
    Strength
    Dexterity
    Intelligence
    Vitality
    All Resist
    Gold Find
    Magic Find

    SECONDARY
    Everything Else

Now, how do you know if an item is worth selling? Generally, you want items to have multiple good stats that complement each other. Below I have provided a list of ""good"" stats, as well as the number needed to sell for that slot. FOR ANY SLOT, you can sell with less stats if they are VERY HIGH (e.g. 200+ main stat, 25 gf, 20 mf, etc.) Note that the more possible ""good"" affixes in a slot, the more you need to have the item be worthwhile to sell. Prices vary wildly by slot, but here's some examples of makes a good item in various slots:

    SHOULDERS (2 to sell)
    Main Stat 150+
    Vit 100+
	AR 50+
    Gold Find 20+
    Magic Find 15+

    Main Stat 100+
    Vit 100+
	AR 50+
    Crit Chance 3+
    Gold Find 20+
    Magic Find 15+

    AMULET (4 to sell)
	Socket
	Main Stat 100+
    Vit 100+
	AR 50+
    Gold Find 35+
    Magic Find 30+
    Crit Chance 5+
    Crit Damage 20+
    Attack Speed 6+
	Life On Hit 300+
	
	RING (4 to sell)
	Socket
	Main Stat 100+
    Vit 100+
	AR 50+
    Gold Find 15+
    Magic Find 13+
    Crit Chance 3+
    Crit Damage 20+
    Attack Speed 6+
	Life On Hit 100+
	
    OFF HAND
	Varies wildly by class.
	
	DEMON HUNTER (Quiver) (4 to sell)
	Dex 75+
	Vit 75+
	Socket
	Crit Chance 6+
	Max Discipline 8+
	Hatred Regen 1+
	
The above list provides what I hope is a useful guideline for what to sell. Note that certain classes will target certain items more than other classes. It is good to target a specific class when selling. The below list demonstrates what various classes want, in rough order of preference -- the more items on that list you have the better.

    BARBARIAN
	Life On Hit
	Vitality
	All Resist
	Strength
	Attack Speed
	Crit Chance
	Crit Damage
	
	MONK
	Life On Hit
	Vitality
	All Resist
	Dexterity
	Single Resist
	Attack Speed
	Crit Chance
	Crit Damage
	
    DEMON HUNTER
	Dexterity
	Crit Chance
	Crit Damage
	Attack Speed
	Vitality
	All Resist
	Life On Hit
	
	WIZARD
	Intelligence
	Crit Chance
	Crit Damage
	Attack Speed
	Vitality
	All Resist
	Life On Hit
	
	WITCH DOCTOR
	Intelligence
	Vitality
	All Resist
	Life On Hit
	Attack Speed
	Crit Chance
	Crit Damage
	
Before going on to the next section, there's a few fringe cases to consider:

    FRINGE CASES TO SELL NO MATTER WHAT OTHER CRAP IT HAS
	18+ MF (any slot except helm, which needs socket, and amulet, which needs 30+)
	23+ GF (any slot except helm, which needs socket, and maulet, which needs 35+)
	200+ Life On Hit Ring
	600+ Life On Hit Amulet
	
OK, that was a lot of stuff, but hopefully we know what is valuable enough to sell. And we know that the more stats and the higher those stats, the more valuable.

**2. HOW TO SELL ITEMS**

1. Armor

First, identify your top three stats. This is normally primary stat, vitality, and all resist. If you don't have three useful stats, only use two (or one!). Select the type of armor, and enter in rounded numbers below your item's numbers. If it has 136 dex, search for 130. 200 dex, search for 190. You get the point. Enter that in for all stats, you are searching for. Finally, enter 9999999999 in the max buyout field and click search.

Sort your results by lowest buyout (click buyout twice). Depending on how good your item is, you will see a range of prices here. Hover over the first few items in the list and mentally compare to your item. If they are all better than yours, you might want to adjust your filters downwards a bit more. Same if they are all worse -- adjust upwards a bit. Refine until the first few items are similar to yours, and check the prices. If the first item on the list is 1d10h or 1d11h, post a buyout 10% less than it to sell. If it is a lower period of time, post a buyout 25% less to sell. Initial bid prices are up to you, but I usually post initial bid as 25% of my buyout price on normal (read: not godly) items.

2. Weapons

Identify your top three stats as with armor, and set up your filters the same way until you get to the buyout. Here, enter in 10,000. Click search and look at the top DPS. Is it more than your weapon? Sorry, not worth selling. Is it less? Change buyout to 100,000 and look again. Continue adjusting buyout until the top DPS weapon matches yours. Subtract 10% from that max buyout you just discovered, and use that as your buyout.

3. God-tier items

If you follow the instructions of searching based on your item and absolutely nothing pops up even when you subtract a bit from the stats you search for, congratulations you just won the internet. I do not recommend buyouts on god-tier items. Instead, start an auction with a reasonable starting bid (10 million usually works for items in this category) and let the free market do its work. 

4. Items with 4+ useful stats

These are tricky to sell. Pick 3 and filter as normal. Now, though, you have to do more work. Check the stats of each item until you find the cheapest one with comparable fourth stat to yours, and undercut that by the standard 10-25%.

**3. CONCLUSION**

I know this was a huge wall of text. I hope it was useful for somebody -- most of this was just instinct for me and this is my first attempt to put it into steps to follow. If there are any problems with this or you have suggestions, please let me know!

I've done my best to list everything found here (http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vabwm/hidden_nerfs_for_patch_103/). Please feel free to make additional comments and I will also add in.

* Whimsyshire Pony Bottleneck was fixed

* Act 1 Cultist Ritual easy Champ kill nerfed

* Zombie bears now bugged

* Command per second lowered and disconnecting people for spamming commands too fast

* Monster walls now correctly block certain abilities like Evasive fire/Archon beam/piercing orb/etc. EDIT: Archon still shoots through. Piercing orb never did. Evasive patched.

* Elite mob that used to spawn to right of Dahlgur Oasis is now purple monster that does not grant NV.

* Magic weapon no longer duplicates its effect on your character sheet display (it used to stack double)

* Elite mobs often regen to full health if kited just outside of your view on the screen

* Elite mob reset timer lowered

* Clouds in Whimsyshire fall under the same chests/destructible objects loot nerf (could be deemed as expected from patch notes, but left here to let people know anyways).

* IAS is nerfed more than 50%. 50% nerf is the best case scenario. For most items its around 60% and for weapons it is higher (as high as 75%).

* IAS items did a re-roll on stats in their category. You could have a high roll in the range of the original category that re-rolls low on the new category range.

* Act 2 nagas before waterlogged passage replaced with a single named elite.

* Dank Cellar Sarkoth now fights

* Event in Festing Woods changes spawn locations now, and sometimes won't even appear

* Belial powerleveling patched

* Goblins gained immunity to barbaian's hook when portaling away

* Mythic potions drops nerfed? Could be related to destructible items

* You can no longer force the same instance of a map by reloading a game. It will randomly pick a map every time. If you want the same map you'll have to load up several games.

* Whimsyshire staff plans changed from 1 gold cost to 50k gold for hell. 100k for inferno. nightmare =15k

* Certain popular crafting recipes ninja nerfed to higher costs. Such as Seven Sins and all pieces in Sage's set.

* Dank Cellar goblin runs nerfed

* Gold spammers muted/banned better

* Act 3 pop-up mines no longer do 400k damage to enemies. They now do about 50k.

* Monk spirit regen has changed to a cap of 6.18, probably in an attempt to stop people from doing things like unlimited spirit rush builds.

* Diablo didn't used to spawn a shadow in Phase 2 for any dead players. Now it spawns a shadow regardless of whether they are alive or not.

* Iskatu loot nerfed even more. Now he might drop nothing or a single white.

* Smoke screen no longer usable while frozen despite other skills being enabled.  Conflicting reports. Some say yes, some say no.

* Cemetery elite changed to purple mob (no NV)  

* Half price potion vendor in Act 1 removed from game

* ctrl + r bugs and only shows 0 framerate

I hope I got that in a nice compressed list so that you don't have to scroll through a million comments like I just did.

EDIT: I should have called it ninja nerfs AND patches. It started with compiling a list of nerfs but the list grew. Yes not all of them are technically nerfs (like getting rid of some of the gold seller spam) as some of you pointed out.

EDIT2: Heading to work now, I think I got everyones comments as of 8am EST. I'll do another run through later.

Edit3: added few changes. Also there are a large number of posts about hydra life on kill being fixed. It's in the patch notes although kind of hidden.

With the amount of hype and buildup, plus Blizzard's reputation and the track record of the Diablo series, we all had expectations that may have been unrealistic. Some of us have been thrilled with what we got, and some of us have been disappointed.

The /r/diablo moderation has team never stopped trying to promote a congenial, informative, and interesting atmosphere. But we also never forgot that this community is a living, dynamic thing, so we gave it room to grow on its own.

The intensity of hatred in /r/diablo since release has been astounding, but that's not necessarily bad. reddit is a place of free speech and open discussion, a place where members should be able to express meaningful feelings, positive or negative. The moderation team has no desire to control what people want to say. This subreddit will always be a place to discuss Diablo.

But we also remember our original goals. We want /r/diablo to be a friendly place. Now, after two and a half months of self-directed growth, /r/diablo is ripe for firmer guidance. Look for a more active moderating hand in the future, including less tolerance for empty hatefulness and a more persistent application of the zero-merit-post rule.

**To the people who like the game but are sick of the negativity:**

Hang in there. The Blizzard-bashers and indiscriminate antagonists won't last forever. In the months since release, we've already seen a marked drop in bitterness as dissatisfied members move on. Soon, only genuine discussion will remain. Please be patient through these growing pains.

**To the people who are waiting for everything to suddenly become perfect:**

Go play something else for a while; take your mind off it. Patches will come, in time. Many people think 1.0.4 will fix every complaint, and it might. But don't rely on it. Overexpectation is what caused much of the dissatisfaction with Diablo 3 itself. Let the patches come as they may. Play other games in the meantime. Maybe the next patch will make you love Diablo 3, or maybe it won't. Maybe you'll never love it. Accept that, move on, and try again later. You'll have more fun that way.

**To those still here upvoting, contributing, and being a part of the community:**

Thank you. Please keep taking the high road. You are the core of /r/diablo. We couldn't do this without you.

I am know as Juxtapose in the diablo 3 community, playing/played on the EU servers.

First of all I am not here to cry, just simply to play open book with the community that I have been a part of for a long time. As the title says Cro has scammed me for 2500 euro worth of gear.. the items involved in the trade are:

http://www.diabloprogress.com/item/34799695
http://www.diabloprogress.com/item/34529709

Also after these trades we made an agreement for 1500 euro on my axe if we would trade EF's for the time being, the following day he would pay and I would also give him his EF back (a good trade for him) + I donated him my zunimasa's boots roughly worth 150-200 euro to a ranking barb.

With that being said the story is as follows; Cro paid me 1000 euro on the 20th for the amulet and 1500 euro for the ring on the 21st of june. The following day on the 22nd this money was blocked by paypal due possible unauthorized usage of a creditcard, a dispute/claim started by paypal , Iater I discoverd after phoning Paypal that this was due to the fact his Paypal name was Twitch Cro, Paypal requires full names of the buyer and seller to keep proper documentation of trades.

On the 6th of July the money was released by paypal in the afternoon, I spoke with cro later that evening with him declining that he had received any of the money, while my paypal record clearly said Completed and Instant payment. After ringing paypal on monday 8th of july I asked Paypal if there was a possibility of it taking maybe longer than this, they said it could take 1-3 days but if he would link the card that he used to his new account it would be available within a day. Also they 100% guaranteed me that he would have received a message in his paypals mail about the money being refunded, which many of us paypal users could confirm from experience.

With all this being said Cro was unbelievable hard to reach after the refund took place, he even removed/ignored me after we got into an arguement with me telling him I would go public if he kept ignoring me. He used this ""threat"" as an excuse, it gave me the feeling he was acting like he was being questioned by the authorities and this is his shield against that. Saying that he would break communications with me to protect himself from people such as other big streamers.

Despite of what I or him might think or say, the bottom line is, he has my items and he has not paid for them after I traded them goodbye on the 20th and 21st of last month. I will share all my paypal logs from this trade with everyone right now.

Overall Paypal history between us: http://i.imgur.com/TZtH4GF.png

These are all the facts, as for feeling sorry for me, please don't. I trade and have traded with valueable items in the past and know the risk that it brings. I know people that have been scammed in diablo for 10 times this amount + these were only 2 of my items, I still have plenty for sale. As for trusting a famous member of the community and on twitch... well let us all learn from this. As you can imagine I was not pleased finding this out, also after trying to support this player with decent deals and donations, the knife will get that much sharper when piercing the back. All I can really say after all this is that I have been CRO'D and I hope that nobody else has been or will be, have a nice day.

Edit: cro claiming the PP was not his, he says the PP on his twitch page is his PP and that he paid me with that, but he can't proof he paid me with that account because he diden't. Also saying that he will never do a trade offstream from this point (so utter transparency), so I don't see the issue with him streaming the PP history. Also saying I wanted the items back because he had larger offers, I hardly even been online since the trade took place, 2500 euro is more than enough also I never asked for the items if he just simply pays me. Also he is saying I sent him back the money however if you look in the detailed payment screenshots under Status you can see: Reversed, paypal reversed this payment because of a dispute or payment review. The money has been returned to the sender's Paypal account.
Meaning I had no take on this whatesoever, it was the decision paypal made after a dispute from the 23rd of june till 6th of july.

1339628643.0,671,self.Diablo,v0nqa,"To Auction House, Salvage, or Sell: A Guide",Gigged,869,198,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v0nqa/to_auction_house_salvage_or_sell_a_guide/,"This guide is intended to help those who don't know what to do with the bag full of gear they just acquired on a farming run, and either spend way too much time trying to decide what to do with each piece or don't know that a particular stat is worthwhile and miss out on substantial gold as a result. While not hard and fast standards, these are the rules I usually stick to during my own farming sessions to give me the best results. (EDIT - This is for softcore AH only - don't use this if you play hardcore).   

**I. What Goes on the AH**   

Ideally, you are looking for items worth 10k+ on the AH, minimum. Anything less isn't worth your time or the auction slots, so they can just be sold or salvaged. Here are my general rules for each type of piece:   

**Armor Generally**- The following are stat combos I look for on a piece where I think it will sell for 10k+ on the AH. If no number is listed for the stat, then that just means that typically any amount (on a level 60 item) should work.  

- 15%+ magic find

- 18%+ gold find

- 220+ dex

- 220+ int

- 100+ int / 100+ vit

- 100+ (int or vit) / 50+ All Resist (AR)

- 100+ dex / 30+ (any resist) / 50+ AR

- (int or str or dex) / vit / AR

- vit / AR / armor  

If the piece has a socket, consider that socket worth 40 of int/vit/str/dex and see if it meets one of the above. If the armor piece has one of those combos put it in your bank for the AH; if not I sell or salvage. This is however subject to the special slots below.  

**Special Armor Rules** - The following pieces have additional stats to look out for that may alter the above list.  

* **Helm** - Needs 20%+ magic/gold find in the absence of a socket. With an empty socket, it can have as little as 12%. (EDIT - for clarity, I don't mean to imply that *all* helmets need MF/GF - just that if it's all that piece brings to the table, it needs this amount to be worth selling on that stat alone)

* **Bracer** - Crit chance of 5%+, paired with high int or dex or any int/AR, int/vit is worth saving.

* **Gloves** - Keep anything with 13%+ Attack Speed (IAS). 8%+ crit chance and/or 25%+ crit damage can sub for another useful stat on the general armor list with int/dex gear.

* **Boots** - 11%+ movement speed can be subbed for a useful stat on the general armor list with int/dex gear.

* **Amulet** - Needs 20%+ magic/gold find to keep based on that alone. Also, keep to AH with any of the following: 300+ life on hit, 13%+ IAS, 7%+ crit chance, or 60%+ crit damage. These numbers can be lowered if paired with each other or any other useful stat.

* **Rings** - Exact same rules as Amulet, but divided by half. Generally, only half of the stats required of other armor are needed to save the ring. Rings sell well - when in doubt, save it.  

**Weapons** - As we all know, weapons are mainly about DPS. Therefore my criteria is all about the minimum DPS a weapon needs to be sold. **The quick and dirty cutoff is this: 1-handers need to be 700+ DPS and 2-handers need to be 1000+.** This, however, can change based on the following, which I've roughly put in DPS terms (so a stat labeled -50 DPS means that a 1-hander with that stat should be kept at 650+ DPS, etc.)
  
* Hand-Crossbows: +100 DPS

* Bows / Crossbows: -75 DPS

* Cold Damage (X-bow Only): -150 DPS

* 100+ dex/int/vit: -50 DPS

* Socket: -50 DPS

* 50%+ Critical Hit Damage: -50 DPS

* 150+ Life on Hit (1h Only): -100 DPS  


**Off-Hands** - I'm by no means an expert at this slot, and the lack of search functionality on the AH makes it a hit-or-miss proposition to attempt to generalize patterns in what sells well. Here is what is important to know, however:  

* Sources/Mojos - The biggest factor is the +damage, where you want the top number to be 300+ to ensure a sale. Crit chance of 7%+ or high int also helps.

* Quivers - (Edit - credit to not_a_haddock) Good ones have some combination of 100+ dex, 8+ max discipline, crit chance, 14%+ IAS, and +x% of elemental arrow.

* Shields - Ideally, you want a high block percentage (17%+), the highest block amount (3.7k-4.7k), and 1100+ armor, plus a few useful stats (dex/vit/Life %/AR mainly).

Beyond these tips, off-hands seem to track the same numbers as general armor for magic find / gold find percentages.  

**II. I've found an item I should AH. Now what?**  

To effectively list gear on the AH, the first thing you should do is look for comparable items. What you want to do is find your item's ""primary"" stat, so that you can search for comparable items accordingly. For example, let's say you have some shoulders with 150 int, 50 vit, and 35 AR - in this case ""int"" is your primary stat. What you then want to do is search for shoulders using tight parameters for your primary stat, and looser parameters for the others. Here then, I would do a search for all shoulders with a minimum 140 int (tight), 25 vit (loose), and 20 AR (loose), and price myself under the lowest that comes up under that search.  

By doing this, you ensure that someone who primarily wants int (and thus will be attracted to your piece in the first place) will choose yours based on cost over the dozens of other similar pieces. Also, don't be afraid to significantly undercut the pieces in your search if it seems that none of them are selling. If the lowest items all have 1d 11h durations, chances are they are priced appropriately and you don't need to undercut much. If they have been up a while, however, you may need to price substantially lower to ensure a sale.  

Finally, a few more tips:  

* Don't sweat heavily undercutting when you are sitting on a bag full of things that need to be put up on the AH. The 10 item limit can become a huge bottleneck toward making money, and it is better to make a chain of sells where you lose out on some potential gold than have your slots tied up by gear that you priced too high.

* If you need to clear some bag space quick, sell your gold find / magic find gear first. This gear has a very stable market, and you can undercut for very little and still effectively ensure a sale within 10-15 minutes.

* *Always* socket your items with plain squares (not flawless, but plain) before putting them up on the AH. The specific gem used depends on the nature of the item, but try to compliment the primary stat if possible.

* Utilize the string of 9s. There is a reason every store in the world does it - 99,999 gold just looks a lot less than 100,000 gold, especially when listed next to each other. Selling everything with trailing 9s is a great way of minimally undercutting and still selling your gear quickly. 
 

**III. This item is trash. Do I sell it, or salvage?**  

This answer may change over time depending on whether the essence market remains constant, but for right now the answer is simple: 
 
* **Salvage** all level 60 gear and level 59 rings, amulets, and follower specials.

* **Sell** all other gear (first checking that your level 55 weapon isn't a level 60 in disguise with a reduced level requirement!).  

Right now, inferno essences (guaranteed with level 60 drops) are selling at ~2k gold, and you also have a chance at salvaging yellow/orange mats which sell for even more. This makes salvaging easily worth it for level 60 gear of all types.  

So that's what I've learned so far after a few weeks of farming and learning the AH. There have been countless times I've almost salvaged something such as a blue amulet with solely 500 life on hit only to check the AH and end up selling it for half a million, and hopefully this prevents others from making that same kind of mistake. If I missed anything, let me know.

[kolchin04](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a2l42) has created an amazing spreadsheet which has similar information in an easy-to-reference visual format. If anyone wants to work on combining the information from this post with the spreadsheet that he made, I would be very interested in seeing that.  His spreadsheet is here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoEU_oBnESrOdElTaVBhZTVFbEYwYzlqbHZJeXk1dGc#gid=0

The problem that many are encountering now trying to sell on the AH is that most people have been at 60 for a while and have been constantly upgrading for weeks. The AH is flooded with mediocre gear that doesn't sell. The people who are leveling alts have enough gold to buy high end gear for them, so starter gear isn't selling well. 

Here are the guidelines I use when deciding what goes to auction: [Ashmedai](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a0xm3), [chanmancan](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a23m4), [bonerfleximus](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a3dcl), [kolchin04](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a2l42)

* Mojos: &gt;300 damage is valuable (ex. something like 50-350 is nice) + high int + high vit 

 Mana regen is nice, but not necessary

 Add attack speed, crit chance, or life% for bonus bucks

* Good int gear that also has pickup radius is very desirable

* Good int gear that also has a high roll on physical damage to attackers

* Good int gear that has &gt;5000 bonus to health globes

* Mana Regen on Ceremonial Knives and Helms is a plus

* Reduced Cost of Zombie Chargers is a plus

* Arcane Power on Crit is very desirable on sources and weapons
 
 Triumvirate with no AP on Crit sells for 0-20m depending on damage. AP on crit skyrockets the price.

* Helms with 4% crit chance and 9+ arcane power on crit are valuable
 
 Add int, vit, all resist, socket for bonus bucks 

* For CM/Spectral Blades wizards, max (11%) increases spectral blades damage is pretty useful

* Source with over 300 damage is valuable

Monk: [Splitshadow](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6afxab)

* Rings and amulets with max/near-max GF and MF will sell regardless of other stats

* Max/near-max GF or MF on other good items as listed above can greatly increase their value

* By itself on rings and amulets, GF sells better than MF

* High end items with MF are worth more than the equivalent with GF

* Combination of gold find and increased pick up radius adds value to armor

* Helms with MF + socket + main stat + all resist/vit sell well because you can add a GF/MF gem, bonus bucks for crit chance

* At least 12 reduced level requirement will sell for a lot more

* High LoH rolls add value - &gt;150 on rings, &gt;500 on amulets and weapons

* High +armor rolls add value

""Trifecta"" items - at least three of these stats [Ashmedai](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a0zst)

* Gloves: &gt;7% crit chance + &gt;35% crit damage + attack speed 

* Amulets: &gt;6% crit chance, &gt;45% crit damage, attack speed, &gt;500 LoH

* Rings: &gt;3% crit chance, &gt;25% crit damage, attack speed, &gt;200 LoH



I use [this site](http://www.d3rmt.com/guides/diablo-3-item-stat-maximum-values/) to look at max values for everything.

Class-specific stuff is tough for me as I have really only played DH. If I'm not sure, I hang on to it and check the AH or just ask general chat if it's any good.

1341522311.0,652,self.Diablo,w3fmp,The understated importance of legendaries,stevebeyten,935,283,341,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w3fmp/the_understated_importance_of_legendaries/,"A lot of talk has been flying around here about the ""broken"" end game, and Bashiok certainly helped fuel our debates and arguments. One thing he said in particular that stuck with me was: ""We recognize that the **item hunt** is just not enough for a long-term sustainable end-game.""

Well that's your problem Blizz... you have taken the ""hunt"" out of ""item hunt"". 

While I think PvP, progression, ladder, etc. all present problems and/or areas for D3 to currently improve on, I think right now, at least for me, the most glaring problem is the ""item hunt."" 

For better or worse, D2 and most like-games are gear/item centered. The item hunt, for a lot of people (not all) IS the end-game. That's why the crappy legendaries in this game are so exceptionally painful. 

In D2, when you saw an un-ID'ed legendary drop, you were stoked IMMEDIATELY because you had quite literally been hunting for that specific unique, set item, or rare rune. 

In D3, it actually feels like you are coal mining. You fill up your inventory with a full of coal (crap blues/yellows). When you're at capacity, you look/identify and sift through the junk seeing if there are any gold nuggets involved.  On the off chance you actually see green/brown in game you either a) assume you found lore, or b) dread to see how bad the random props are going to be on this one... 

So instead of hunting clearly identified uniques which literally have legendary properties, your focus turns to rares, with pretty much infinite variance. And this system is ""broken"" for a number of reasons:

1) It turns off the ""joy"" you should feel when you kill a difficult mob/boss, and instead turns it into an almost analytical process at the vendors as you debate whether to salvage vendor or AH. Or whip out a spreadsheet to see if maybe you can actually use it.

2) We are using SPREADSHEETS to determine if we should use the new ""uber"" item we just found. That's insane. In D2, if you found a Shako... you were using a Shako. Done, move to the next one. Our new ""uber"" finds should be definitevely better than our old crumby gear, not ""well... it reduces my AR by 20, but gets me an extra 400 DPS..."" 

3) In D2 uniques/sets were literally, legendary. Even casual gamers knew them by name, knew their properties, knew what build they were good for, etc. etc. In D3, a casual gamer, who currently has 1 maybe 2 developed toons, very well might have no idea what constitutes an ""uber"" drop another class. So in D2 when I was a Sorc and saw IK Chest drop i thought: ooh... I can trade this. In D3 as a wizard, I honestly don't know what stats are considered good for other classes. 

Now some of you may tell me that is my own fault, and to an extent you are right. But I don't think I should be expected to do market research to determine whether my drops are any good... 

TL;DR: In my humble opinion (which I know some disagree with), the best thing Bliz can do for D3 is put the ""hunt"" back into ""item hunt"". 

**edit: wow, great response guys. I really appreciate all the great discussion. I just wanted to make 1 more point up here because a lot of people seem to be accusing me of wanting to water-down D3 and make it easier w/ uber-legendaries, and that's not it at all.  I just thought of this analogy, but it really is a form of psychological training:**

**In D2 when we saw a rune or great gold/green drop we were excited, immediately. And our excitement was directly connected to whatever we were doing in game, so our natural instinct to was to keep doing that thing... in game. In D3, even if we find a great item, we probably won't realize we found it until 15-20 min later (after we finish the  run/max our stash) and not until after we consulted a EPH/DPS spreadsheet or checked the AH for like prices. So now, not only is our excitement delayed/subdued, but it is directly connected to an out-of-game event.** ",,False,self,t5_2qore,1341577836.0,,,True,t3_w3fmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w3fmp/the_understated_importance_of_legendaries/,

Advice inside.",tashinorbo,895,252,618,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u7ahj/my_trio_barb_monk_wizard_just_legit_beat_act_2/,"I [Monk] hit lvl 60 4 days after launch. After 3 days Inferno Act 1 was ez mode, I earned the killing Butcher in under 2 minute achievement, and had many gear runs. After all that, act 2 still just kicked my ass, and it was frustrating. 

My friends and I sat down and started figuring out how to fix this (we really spent hours theorycrafting), and built a somewhat elaborate spreadsheet to figure the best way to min-max.

Act 2+ is ENTIRELY about defensive stats. Do NOT care about your DPS. Build for survivability and THEN add dps later once you get really perfect pieces (that have your D-stats and also O-stats).

Vitality is the least important defensive stat. For most of the game you can just add more vit to brute force your way through bosses, not so in Inferno.

Armor, and Resistances are identical, and dodge is equally(mathematically) as good. You want them all incredibly high (900-1k resists and 9000-10k armor after buffs). The synergy between the Barb and Monk in achieving this unmatched.

Using Monk's Mantra of Evasion (+15% dodge, +20% armor) Barb's war cry (+50% resist all, +20% armor). We were able to achieve this, and then suddenly... you can survive. Once you have damage down to a managable level the next necessary element is life-gain. If you are taking incoming 3k DPS but have also 3k HPS, you are solid. 

Barb uses life-stealing abilities(such as revenge) and is very good with groups of mobs, as a Monk I used Transcendance with a 2.11 attack speed in order to rapid build spirit and spam Evasion Mantra and Lashing Tail Kick to regen health (I prefer tanking the single-target Elites/heavy hitters). 

I can see in my spreadsheet that my 37k HP, after you account for all the resists are effectively about 1.2million hp (thats how much raw damage would come my way, before damage reduction, before I actually died), and while I keep my temporary dodge-boosters up its actually over 2million.

We started act 3 and its also fine. Things have a lot of HPs so we need to increase our dps a bit now but tanking is cake. Once we get the right DPS we will be able to farm higher-level acts efficiently and without the frustration of constant dying and kiting.

BTW, the wizard's roll was to increase our dps. He can't take many hits but uses force-armor and teleport to be very mobile. Mostly poison hydra and arcane orb for dps. My barb friend and I were progressing just fine through act 2 as a duo but he sped things up a great deal.

If you have any questions, let me know. 

This is my (monk) build: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#bZghdi!XYU!ZYaacY


edit#2: this was our dps:

* Barb dps: 6k
* Monk dps: 10k
* wizard dps: 16k

We didn't ""glass cannon"" our way through the act, that doesn't work. Slow and steady wins the race here, but its a lot more satisfying. We had some incredibly epic fights.

Hello there reader,

I'm going to be giving away all of my gear today, to those of you of this sub reddit.  My gear is by no means the best.  Before the patch for 1.03 I had worked extremely hard to find some of the best Attack speed items out there and get them cheap.  I'm also a professional SC2 player and this game took up a lot of my time.  After this patch I'll be back into SC2 full time.

So please allow me to brighten you're day up dear reader!  If you add me and join my game, I will allow you to choose 1 (ONE) piece of gear of mine to have for free. Most of the gear requires level 60, however if you are under level 60 you can still have 1 (ONE) piece of gear as a gift for whenever you reach 60.  All you'll have to do is add me, and request invite. (BE PATIENT AND PLEASE CHECK ALBUM TO KNOW WHICH YOU WANT!)  After you receive your piece of gear please leave the game.  (I played a Wizard, sorry if the best gear is for them).

My character code is LiquidSheth#1892.  Add me, and request an invite.  This will be a fairly long process for each person.  As I doubt everyone will know which piece they want, even though at the bottom of this post there is an album with every piece of gear.  

I will be streaming the whole thing, however again feel no need to watch, but feel free to as well.  I will be streaming at [Sheth's Stream](http://twitch.tv/liquidsheth)

RULES:

NA Server Only !! (Sorry!!!)

1 PIECE OF GEAR, NO EXCEPTIONS. (Check Album before hand please!) 

IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING YOU WANT, YOU CAN HAVE 200,000 GOLD. (Until I run out of gold)

If you don't want money or gear, you can have all of my gems, or all of my blacksmiths mats.

After I give an item to you, I will remove you from my friends list, and write your name down.  PLEASE don't try for more then one item, as I won't give any more then one per person.

Thanks, and enjoy what I hope is positivity :)

I wanted to play WD since I heard about it and D3.  Did not care about DH at all.  Heard about the DH as a class and thought ""Bleh I've already been a bowazon"".  

All of that changed when I found the glorious ability of Demon Hunters - Summon Ferrets.

This spell gives you two ferrets that follow you around - attack crap - and pick up gold.  Easily the coolest idea for any spell in the game.  The mere idea of two little critters scampering around my feet and picking up gold and shit is just so obscenely awesome that I immediately decided that a Demon Hunter would be my main.

I then played the living hell out of the Demon Hunter class and the following is my dissertation on ferrets; what they are doing right, what they are doing wrong, and how to fix them.

The first time I summoned my ferret companions my immediate reaction was ""holy shit that's cute as hell"".  (Done right).

I then proceeded to run around a bit and I lost a ferret (shit I'm a terrible pet owner).  Suddenly wtf, my ferret has two heads?!  Then I look closer and watch them much closer while moving and so forth and I notice that there are actually two ferrets there.  They just path perfectly on top of each other. Two headed ferrets are extremely rare and should not be a summonable companion.  (Done wrong).

So I proceeded to test the ferrets out for awhile.  They would scamper around and pick up gold for me as one two headed ferret.  Generally always taking the exact same path to the same lump of gold, arriving at the same time, and moving on to the next together. (Done wrong).

A few of the things I noticed that made them rather poor at their primary function of gold gathering.

1) They apparently have 0 pickup radius. (Occasionally they will just sit on top of a pile of gold for what seems like forever until they randomly twitch slightly and pick it up)

2) They are incredibly slow.  (I found myself occasionally just standing still in the middle of a group of gold waiting for them to pick it all up and realized that I could do it faster by just getting 5-10 gold radius).

3) They always attack mobs, regardless of if you have engaged said mob or not. (This is absolutely terrible for elites, goblins, pretty much anything - Plus they do not loot gold while fighting things so their primary function is shelved.)

4) They generally act as one glorified ferret which is unfortunate because they could theoretically be twice as efficient.


The way to fix the above problems in order.
1) Give them a pickup radius of like 1.  There is literally no harm in it and the ferrets wouldn't get stuck trying to pick crap up anymore.

2) They need to be quite a lot faster.  Why do they run at the same speed as I do when they should run much much faster to catch up and collect the gold?

3) Please have them only aggro things once the owner has attacked it and have them loot during fights as well.  Their dps is so low that it really wouldn't matter if all they did was run around during fights picking up gold.  At least you wouldn't have to wait on it.

4) Somehow the ferrets need to repulse each other so that they are not always pathing as one object.  Perhaps have a rule that the ferrets never go within 10 yards of another ferret.  OR make a rule that one ferret always goes for the gold at the left first and the other ferret always goes for the gold on the right first.  And have them always prefer opposite shoulders of the DH.  So that they would never become a two headed ferret again.

Thank you for reading!  Hopefully someone enjoyed it.

",NobleV,1552,928,985,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wg9lx/never_in_all_my_gaming_career_have_i_seen_so_many/,"It is just astonishing how many people will sit and complain about a game being taken offline so it can be fixed. I enjoy D3 a lot, but I don't think I've ever seen a fan base that is so divided and hateful towards a product. Blizzard can't do a damn thing without forums filling up with hate over it. It's just stupid, and it makes the fan base look stupid. 

Game comes out. Huge portions of forum posters don't like that AS is too powerful, Inferno is too unreasonably difficult, and loot drops are too rare. So Blizzard spends hours listening to people and making changes that the users asked for, and then a new batch of people come out and bitch about the changes. It's just absolutely crazy. It seems like every fan on every forum expects the entire game to be tailored to their every desire. 

I've never seen such an unreasonable fan base in my entire life, and I'm a Final Fantasy fan, so that's saying a lot. 

EDIT: Surprised this got this much attention. Just wanted to point out one thing. I've seen a lot of talk in here comparing this game to WoW. This isn't an MMO. It's not designed to last for 5000 hours of playtime. It's a single player, Action RPG in which the entire basis is farming for gear. You just have to think that maybe it's not gonna last for 2000 hours before you get bored because it's not that kind of game, and anybody who expects that is expecting way to much from this type of game. 400 hours on a single player game to me is a great game. I wouldn't play it 10 hours if it sucked. 

EDIT2: I do agree that the network issues have been bad at times, but that is the only real, legitimate issue with the game, imo, along with the RMAH transactions in which people have been greatly delayed of getting money. Those things should be the primary targets to be fixed. After that, balance issues and legendary weapons, then additional content.

Something to reference Diablo, and will totally shock and surprise him that I knew what the references mean (Well, I don't, but just me taking the time will win some wife points!) 

So how about it Diablo fans, can I get a few suggestions on what to write as he enjoys the first thrill of playing Diablo III?  TIA

""I sense a soul in search of answers so I suggest you stay a while and listen.

I'm sick and tired of getting hit by melee enemies 10 meters away, of dying to ranged attacks I clearly avoided on my screen. Of getting hit despite having activated my defensive stuff in time, or simply having a skill not activate because the game feels like it.

Inferno is about mitigating, avoiding and countering hard-hitting mechanics but the game simply won't let me do the latter two in too many cases. It's as if regardless of where you're playing and what connection you're on, you're having at least 500 ms ping.

While I can't argue with the results as it obviously works, the entire mechanic is **clumsy**.

Blizzard either need to **embrace** the way things work by letting us manage weapon/armour sets and switching between them easily with a keybind (WoW style), OR they need to **overhaul** the system entirely in a manner that doesn't punish or frustrate players for using their broken design. Magic Find has the potential to be so much more than a simple stat used right before boss kills. I think the most popular idea I've read regarding MF is enchanting gear with the mystic artisan (possible future patch?) to boost magic find on gear.

Here's how I think it should be done:

* Divide gear into various categories and the type of enchant one can apply on a piece of gear depends on the type of gear in question.
* Leave core stats like STR/INT/DEX to powerful items like weapons and off-hands. MF should never have to compete with these or no one will ever pick them unless they have godly gear already.
* Pieces of armour could be enchanted with less valuable stats like Magic Find, Gold Find, Thorns, etc.
* Rings and amulets could house defensive stat enchants like resistances, etc.

*(The above is just one example of how to categorize items)*


The possibilities are endless, and leveling up the Mystic artisan would allow us to enchant our gear with more and more powerful bonuses. I don't think MF should exist natively on items *at all*. I really dislike slowing down at around 3% on a boss, equipping 10+ pieces of MF gear, and then trying to kill the boss without getting killed. Is this *really* how Blizzard intends their MF design to work?

Each town has a portal to some instances. Once your team enters, it pairs you with another team, perhaps based on stats and level. Imagine a few instances that you have to travel to, eg one instance in the Cathedral, slightly harder to get to, but people now have another reason to clear a dungeon. 

You don't lose money/repair costs in these PVPE instances. 

Depending on the instance, the maps vary and add a lot of strategy to the game. 

Edit2:

Great ideas guys, is there any way to relay this to blizzard. I feel like diablo could massively expand on pvp and pve content. I'm not talking about nerfing the original pvp plan, but adding different types of pvp that involve the environment, where the goal is to complete pve type instances but adding pvp for variability, team competition, new strategies and factors, etc. that way you get drops, xp, and gold but also perks and points towards a ladder or perhaps gear. 

In the game Aion, pvp points gave you access to the vender selling pvp related gear. I'm not saying Blizz should do the same, but something related to make pvp worth while.

It seems to me there are a few issues that get brought up often and I think they're sort of unfounded. Here's my take on the major 4:

**1. Inferno is too easy:**
This is a total misnomer IMO: the only groups that have managed it ghosted their way through and didn't actually beat it. They didn't beat it in my book, and if you consider their method of clearing to be a true clear, then there's no arguing with you. When people are consistently farming elite packs and doing full runs of Act's III and IV, then I'll consider it cleared. 

**2. Itemization is screwed up:** While this may be correct, I have faith that Blizzard will correct it in a timely manner. Have we forgotten that the game came out Tuesday?! People have not figured out the game yet, and while it may be that rares with very high DPS will be utilized and be good, that doesn't mean that Blizzards official interpretation of itemization is batshit insane. No one has a full set of endgame gear, no one has even figured out the optimal way of beating Inferno!

I for one think that stats like health range pickup and other seemingly peripheral affixes will prove to be very useful for inferno, and that there is nothing wrong with a mix of different item types is good. I should say though that I 100% agree that top roll legendaries should just flat-out be the best items in the game. But it's been a week! Have faith people.

**3. Not enough viable builds:** I don't see a logical basis for such a conclusion. We have not experimented with many builds as of yet, and from what I've seen of people linking their builds, there are a lot of builds that are very viable. The only problem I see is (I have only played DH so far) are the necessity of a get-out-of-jail-free ability (smoke screen.) But considering that means I can customize essentially 4 skills, I can't even begin to call that design failure.

**4. Elites/champions too hard, must kite:** This is inherent in the non-role style of Diablo. You've been playing too much WoW if you think the game could necessarily different. Without a dedicated healer or tank, there is no way to scale difficulty other than to have them kill you quicker, or kill you in more interesting ways. It would be nonsensical (except maybe for Barb's? my experience is limited to DH and anecdotes from wizard playing friend) for a player to have so many heals as to completely mitigate elites/champions damage. Without D2's incredibly flawed method of health pot spamming, you shouldn't ever be standing toe-to-toe with champs/elites. Kiting and controlling are the ONLY possible methods of killing them, inherent in game design.


Anyways, just my thoughts. Hope we can be less harsh on blizzard and voice game problems respectfully so as to expedite the solutions!

NOW WHAT?  Do we farm random zones over and over again?  I guess so, we just go around to different zones in A1-A4 and kill random elite mobs for drops... The game is currently lacking, FUN MODES, like ubers (yes, I realize that was 5 years into the lifecycle) in D2.


What do you guys think of an ""Endless Wave"" zone that would unlock after you beat Diablo on Inferno.  The idea would be that you are on the edge of heaven(maybe it would be hells last minions storming the gates) and you'd have to defend it from incoming waves of enemies.  The longer you hold off the mobs, the harder they become. (The iLVL of items would also increase). 


Elite mob spawns could be timed, and you could even include boss encounters at the major time milestones.  (10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour). Personally, I love would to see some cheesy ""BOSS FIGHT NEW EVENT"" mechanic!  


The actual Endless Wave would only end after all party members leave the game, or get tired of dying over and over.  (Mobs would become harder and harder, eventually being unbeatable even versus the most geared champions)


This would provide soloist and people who like to play in groups a great, fun, repeatable way to play the game after inferno.  While giving even the most geared champions something to achieve... ""Hey, I made it to 1 hour and 13 minutes into the endless wave!!""  




What do you guys think of this game mode?

EDIT:  Maybe the question I should be asking is, what unique game modes do you think Blizzard should add to the game to create more replay value??


Some suggestions that I wanted to highlight:
""Do it in now-classic horde mode style: a period of time where dead teammates can be revived, teammates that do die respawn at the start of a fresh wave.""  -Winless

Dungeon Mode:  Endless dungeon like in Diablo (I think we all want this!)

**EDIT: Great response guys, I really think this shows that we would like to see Blizzard put some interesting modes into place.  This is a great game - over time it will be even better**

Can anyone relate?,bolbor,1072,501,725,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v1nhx/i_spent_50_on_the_rmah_and_felt_underwhelmed_i/,"This isn't meant to be a whining/complaining post. I don't know if anyone cares, but I felt like I should share my experience to see if anyone could relate. Pardon the wall of text.

I'm an average gamer; some might call me a ""casual"" by today's gaming standards. 23 years old, fresh out of college, and fortunate enough to have a decent job in this tough economy. 

Back in high school, a friend introduced me to the digital cocaine that is Diablo 2. And I played the crap out of it. My freshman and sophomore years, I probably spent as much of my time, if not more, playing Diablo as I did in class.

I made a barbarian. His name was Bolbor. Leveled into the 80s and did a real fun Whirlwind build with lots of life-steal. I was the mesmerized kid manually farming for gear, and had fun, got a couple SoJ's (read: two!), traded around for some cool gear to make a Meteor/Frost Orb sorceress, rinse and repeat. I lived the Sanctuary dream, as it were.

Rose-tinted nostalgia aside, Diablo 2 was simple, boring, math class, stupid, complex, rewarding, frustrating, and when I saw the prettiest green or gold text fall to floor, it was like someone injected some delicious drug straight into my eyeballs. But in the end, it was entertaining and it was fun. 

I loved that game.

Fast forward to Diablo 3. I have a full-time job. A loving girlfriend. Bills to pay. Send money to my mom when I can. I'm time-poor. March 15, 2012 I drop the $100 to pre-order the Collector's Edition. All my friends pre-ordered as well.

I waited nearly a decade for this game, and it really didn't disappoint. The CE box was beautiful. The art book was a treat and a half (I'm a former art student), and the Diablo skull with Soulstone USB quickly found its home atop my bookshelf. I was as giddy as a kid on Christmas morn.

I resurrected my old barbarian friend. Bolbor lived!  and made it to 60 in a week. In hindsight, the plot was a bit strange at times, but the gameplay was pretty much everything I had hoped for. I could leap into hordes of demons, smashing everything the same way I imagined my old pixelated barbarian doing. 

And I played through Hell. Again. And again. And when I saw the same golden yellow text that always gave me a sweet pixely high, I right clicked to identify. Hmm. Okay, I guess. 

Then it happened. Orange. Orange text! My first legendary dropped. It was a [Blackguard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackguard). Holy crap, it looks cool as hell! 

""Check the stats, idiot!"" my inner 14-year-old yelled at me. 

Oh. Hmm. Yeah, it's... it's a downgrade? I tried to rationalize, and stored it in the bottom-right corner of my stash. It would be my little trophy of sorts.

Then the RMAH came out, which I was also eagerly expecting. Seeing how I was still as gear-dependent as I was in D2, and have way less time to farm, I figured maybe I could treat myself to a nice String of Ears, Helm of Command, Ivory Tower, and a better amulet. 

The $50 went as quick as it came. ""Send to stash."" Click! ""Resume game."" Click! I actually felt excited to see how badass Bolbor would be now.

Imagine the smug grin on my face when I could finally tank the Act 1 inferno elites with relative ease. Sure, my DPS was still kinda crappy and I still had to actually pay attention to my gameplay, but at least I wasn't getting completely steamrolled anymore!

But the satisfaction was fleeting. I found myself asking, ""well... now what?"" 

$50 had bought me nothing. The pixels were there, but gone was the pixelated high I used to get seeing items drop on the floor. The yellow items remained slot-machines of disappointment. I could kill the Butcher now, but I still wasn't getting that high I so longed for from rares.

I don't know what happened. I feel like it wasn't supposed to be like this. I still want to play the game. I still want that high. I waited so long for it.

**TL;DR:** I'm scared. I'm scared for the game, scared that I can't find that green/gold text high we all know and love. I just need to know if I'm not the only one.

There, I said it.",Stupid_Fucking_Cunt,1122,566,1190,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vc5k1/glass_cannon_builds_are_having_a_hard_time/,"I've read a lot of complaining in the past 24 or so hours about how awful Blizz has nerfed DHs and wizards. Yeah, DHs took a big hit with the Elemental Arrow nerf, but from what I gather (and this is coming from people who I play with who use a DH), it was clearly not intended to be so good. Wizards weren't nerfed directly, but they're typically having a tougher time than before.

Almost invariably when a friend of mine in the above category complains about the patch, I inspect his gear and see that at least one ring is blue and gives 71 dex/intelligence and (now) 7% attack speed. Resists are nowhere to be found unless incidental. I have sold several blue shoulders/belts, etc, with 200+ dex and some random stat for 1m+ on the AH, because I know most DHs up till now have ignored everything else except for crit/ias/crit damage where they can get it, and in every other slot, dex is all that matters. As a melee character, I wouldn't have paid 50k for a piece of equipment without resists/high armor. We couldn't afford to do that because what's the point of high damage if we get 2 shotted whenever we get within range of enemies?

The new patch has essentially tweaked the mob damage so that characters with high damage mitigation will notice a HUGE difference between the lethality of enemies now and pre-patch. I can literally stand afk next to a (single) soul ripper, get up and grab a soda, and walk back 30 seconds later and MAYBE my life will be below 25%, but usually my enchantress will have killed the soul ripper before he could kill me. Before the patch (and after tyrael nerf) I couldn't take the siege breaker past three quarters of his health. I can now completely face tank him and, usually, my life won't dip below 50%. I don't know the numbers, but whatever blizz did, the damage reduction of mob is HUGE if you have been stacking resists/armor.

On the other hand, glass cannon builds have noticed nothing in terms of reduced damage, because they're still getting 1-2 shotted. Many DHs felt it was fine to run around with 18k health and rely on dps dumps to ""mitigate"" damage by killing enemies before the enemies killed them. So Blizz could have reduced damage from mob by half, and glass cannons would notice very little in terms of a difference.

And honestly, I don't see what's wrong with that. I'm not trying to bash glass cannons; their builds were insanely effective and efficient before the patch. But did they (you?) really not see a balance patch coming?

1339362610.0,554,self.Diablo,uv2ym,Jar of Souls event didn't go far enough imo. I wouldn't mind a horde mode.,Churchie,716,162,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uv2ym/jar_of_souls_event_didnt_go_far_enough_imo_i/,"The [Jar of Souls](http://www.diablowiki.com/Jar_of_Souls) event in Act 1 was fun but I felt it ended just as it was getting good. Even on Inferno it's a breeze so it got me thinking...

There are games out there that have a similar style game mode sepperate from the main game. The famous [Call of Duty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAOoVvGMzHk) zombie mode, [Space Marine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPCs5_bIRYM), [Dawn of War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h72XhZKwLDs), [Borderlands: Mad Moxxi arena](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq_cxqQZoy8), [Gears of War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp_POS-xJNQ) etc... There was even a very old trailer for a coliseum type event in WoW but Blizzard never implemented it (Trial of Crusader doesnt count :P ), where players fight against spawning waves of monsters.

In these modes you fight against endless waves of progressively harder monsters, solo or teamed up with friends. The Jar of Souls event was good but it would be fun to fight waves of monsters and get progressively better loot at the end of every 5 waves or something. It doesn't fit in well with the ""theme"" of Diablo but it would break up the farming runs with something a bit faster paced and different. The crumbling tomb in Act 2 definately changed the pace of the game for me and I was sad not to see more.

Edit: In my mind I had an image of a big graveyard arena, something like the entrance to the Cathedral crypts where zombies and skeletons would rise from their graves. Or a portal summoning demons etc... The timed dungeon in Act 2 was great also.

Edit 2: Im sorry if some think this is a repost, Im human and things slip under my radar. This was a legitimate thought I had while playing the game and decided to share.

**TLDR: I wanted a game mode where I can put the gear I have earned to use and not just farm more gear with it. Yes the persuit of perfect gear is addicting but a distraction / challenge is fun sometimes. Jar of Souls in Act 1 and the Crumbling Tomb in Act 2 were good examples of this. Yes there are similar events ingame but I felt they were not pushed far enough.**

Edit 3: Maybe with different challenges, different builds would shine and we would have an area where we can put some of the lesser used gear stats / player abilities and builds to use.

I would propose that it should look something like this

*-You drain life from enemies around you equal to 2-5% of your total thorns damage.*
    
*-Burn the ground you walk on for 6% Fire damage.*
    
Those wouldn't be the exact numbers but just making an example

I say that if you study history, you're doomed to be forced to stand by and watch everyone else repeat it and ignore your warnings.  

Something similar has been happening to me as I have played D3 from beta until now.  I have been trying to explain why the D3 economy has imploded and how to fix it but it seems like I'm doomed to stand by and watch it happen.  Below is an aggregation of several posts that I have made.  I have posted similar things on official and other unofficial fora as well with very little reception.  Please feel free to ask questions, I love talking about economics :) 

* D2 was good because the economy of SOJ's was a free market and only crashed after massive inflation due to duping.  Well, with D3, Blizzard built that flaw into the full retail version as a ""feature""... There is no destruction of items, there is no way to remove anything from the economy other than players rage quitting because the economy sucks... 

* **Each player brings in untold thousands of gems, rares, and legendaries into the economy and there is no *use* of these item.**

[Read more about this position here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/149h9x/what_is_really_happening_with_the_economy_is_it/c7b4y4u)

I have identified two major issues and I will summarize each below: 

* There must be **actual diversity** among the classes and there must be **productive destruction** of items, gems, and gold.

----

**Productive Destruction:**

Currently, Items get vendored or salvaged; neither are even remotely productive since the effort you put into finding the item is much greater than the reward of 1,000-3,000 gold; and salvaging an item is stupid since crafting is an utter waste (I've given it a good 50m faith effort and it was a GIANT net loss). 

Gems have no final use, thus the market for them is exactly where it would be expected, just above marginal cost of creating the gem +15% and below the cost of 3x the lower tier.  

Productive Destruction can be done by many ways, my suggestions: 

* Rerolling items by putting gems and items into the Crucible
* 3x Gem + 3x same Item + gold = Item Reroll with guaranteed roll of stat relative to Gem
* 1 of each gem + item + gold = item with guaranteed socket

----

**Diversity of classes:**  

Currently, the best spec of each class requires the same 3 stats: IAS, Crit Dmg, and Crit %

This has destroyed the economy because anything without these three properties is worthless, while anything with all of them costs hundreds of millions or billions and it is too rare to get all three - Therefore most people never see an item roll with all three and are relegated to selling crap items for 50k or less.  Thus the market crashed in this regard after the IAS nurf and just got worse after the legendary drop rate increase.  

* To fix this problem: 

Blizzard needs to actually implement diversity among the classes.  Some suggestions: 

* Barbarian ability that cannot crit but does more dmg the more Thorns damage the player has.  

* Wizard Fire spell that is channeled and does not crit but does more dmg the lower the APS and does not rely on the DPS number on the weapon.  

* Witch Doc ability that siphons life from enemies as a function of vitality that does not crit; when the mob dies, the mob explodes for x dmg where x is a function of how much ""Life After Kill"" the WDoc has.  

* Monk passive that allows any base stat to give %dmg instead of just Dex.  But its balanced so that if he goes +/- 10%, he loses the Str and Int.  [Explained in more detail here](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/13q2g0/thoughts_about_how_to_fix_the_monk_class_general/)

* Monk ability that does more dmg and steals more life/more life on hit the closer to .8 APS the monk gets.  

----
Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you'd like a more thorough economics analysis, I can do that.  I tried to keep this post as short as possible and readable :) 

Thanks for reading! 

----

**Edit 1** 

I am adding a great suggestion from Ashmedai: 
----
I'd suggest a system like this:

* The player goes to the mystic, where he or she can attempt to improve an item.

* Any item to improve an item binds the item to the players account.

* Attempts to improve can be either ""slow, no risk"" or ""fast and risky"".

* Both slow and fast methods can improve items the same amount, the slow one requires more attempts and therefore more investment.

* The risky method has a chance of destroying an item.

* Investment costs would be gold, mats, and gems all 3. Improving legendary items would require brimstone.

* The types of improvements and changes to items are left to your imagination.

For example, the barbarian shout **Battle Rage** has the rune *Into the Fray* which states ""Critical Hits have a chance to generate 15 additional fury"". What is that chance? Is that 80%? Is it 5%? Battle Rage has 3 other runes that say Critical Hits have a *chance* to cause something but don't give a specific percentage.

There are many, many other skills like this; the barbarian passive **No Escape** states that ""Critical Hits on Weapon Throw have a *chance* return 14 Fury"", while other skills like **Hammer of the Ancients** flat out state that ""Critical Hits have a 10% chance to drop additional health globes"" with a specific rune.

This inconsistency in skill details is frustrating to say the least, and I am wondering where do players go to find out more information? I'm trying to put together a ranged barb build for Act 2 Inferno, but with the lack of details on some skills, it is proving very difficult.

For me, so far, it's just as addicting as D2, though, of course, it remains to be seen if I will still think that in 10 years. But for now, I'm still having a blast. 

My first character was a WD, and yeah, they're pretty shitty at the moment. So instead, I leveled a DH (and a barb and a HC Wiz). In the meantime, I love the diversity of the Wiz, smashing shit with the barb, or vaulting around crazily with the DH. I like trying out new, weird builds with all the classes. I like the fact that I can without needing to re-level a new character. (Years ago, Pre-and-post BC, when I played WoW, my main was a Druid, so I know how to wait for Blizzard to fix a wonky class (and I know they will, eventually)).

 I enjoy panning the AH to see if there's an upgrade. I still get excited when a yellow drops, because even though most of the time it's vendor trash, sometimes it's some awesome item, and I've been lucky enough to occasionally find an upgrade. 

That's all.

I see people who have logged 300+ hours in like three months whining about how there's nothing to do in the game.  People saying how broken and unfun and tedious the game is then they go back to farming for the rest of the week.

How many other games have you bought and logged that many hours?

It is just crazy that people expect to be able to play a game 6-8 hours a day everyday for months and expect to not be bored.  I think part of the problem is that people do not understand how much time and effort it takes to make a polished Triple A game like D3.

This is also my first post in this subreddit.

So I'm a fairly casual gamer. Probably the last time I was super serious about a game was D2. So of course I decided when D3 was announced that I would put my real adult life on hold as much as possible and take D3 as seriously as I took its predecessor.

I got the game. Started playing. Loved it. Felt a little lost. So naturally I went to the interwebz to start drawing on resources. I found a TON here (thank you) and I found a FEW on the Blizzard forums. But mostly on the Blizzard forums (and to some lesser degree, everywhere else) I found a whole lot of complaining.

My problem is that I have to wade through that complaining to find the stuff I want to read to get better at the game. And when the complaining greatly outweighs everything else, it gets hard to ignore.

Now I find I'm enjoying the game less. Not because my wizard's DPS got nerfed yesterday. Honestly if I hadn't been reading all the nerd rage on the Blizzard forums about it I probably would have barely noticed, just sucked it up and found some way to work around it. 

I'm enjoying the game less because... well, wouldn't anyone in their right mind with all the constant negativity and QQing?

I'm not saying the game's perfect. I'm not saying it's better or worse than D2. I'm not saying it's just a WoW rehash because I never played WoW and frankly couldn't care less. I'm actually not here to offer a professional critique of the game like anyone gives a shit about what I have to say. 

I'm a casual gamer who wants to have fun and maybe dabble in advancing to the next skill level. But whenever I dip my toes in the world of more advanced players for some tips and tricks, I get assaulted by all the bitching and moaning.

My takeaway: if you're just an average player who wants to learn more about game mechanics, take the spreadsheets, take the guides, and run. If totally immersing myself in the world of the hardcore gamers who posture as authorities on games like this means I end up being miserable about this nerf and that nerf and either feel like I need to quit, or write an angry/weepy open letter to Blizzard, or feel quietly guilty for still enjoying the game... Count me out.

Please please PLEASE let me sort AH results by +damage added.

Disclaimer: English is my native language but I'm pretty drunk so yeah.

The longer version: I have played a fair bit of D3, but my only level 60 is a wizard.  Currently I can struggle my way through A2 but it's not worth farming solo and A3 is out of reach.  In order to improve my gear, I've been searching for a new Source (off-hand for you non-Wizards).  My current source is actually pretty good - something like 60 - 340 damage, 125 intel, a little bit of vit.  I did an AH search for a source with intel and crit % to boost my damage.  I set the max buyout at 10 mil,(which is pretty optimistic because I made a bad judgment call on an attempted flip and am under 1M in cash atm).  But guess what? With one exception, every item on the first page was vendor TRASH.  All these kids playing their demon hunters pull a rare source off some garbage mob and roll it with intel so they think it's godly.  But none of them realize that it's WORTHLESS without the +dmg mod.

Early on I decided I wanted to go 1h/Source instead of 2h.  I actually shelled out for a 2h axe with 1400 dps but I sold it back because I hated the look of my wizard with a 2h axe - terrible flavor, felt lame, wasn't feeling it.  Instead I went for a spear with 1050 dps, figuring I could make it up with a source with mods.  UNFORTUNATELY, I am unable to sort AH search results by damage.  This is total bullshit.  ~~Any monk can sort his fists/daibos by damage.  Any barb can sort his swords by dps.  Any DH can sort his quivers my attackspeed, dex, discipline, any mod you like.~~  (edit: Someone has kindly pointed out that, for instance, DH's can't search quivers by attack speed and monks/barbs can't sort shields by block %, attributes which are the actual defining characteristic of their respective items.  My only response: Blizzard, what gives?)  But I can't sort my sources by damage.  And that means the market is absolutely FUCKED by any kid who draws a source with sweet mods and +50 damage and doesn't realize that his item is garbage.  Instead he posts it for 5 mil and it clutters up all my results.

This is further exacerbated by the fact that when blizzard first announced they were going to boost crafting, I realized the 6 prop plans would go way up in value.  Feeling very wise, I bought a 6 prop plan.  Unfortunately, I was a wizard and thought it would be cool to buy the 6 prop orbit stones plan.  Guess what?  The plan is worthless, because even if I happen to craft a sweet source, I can't post it because it will just be buried under the mountains of garbage currently inhabiting the AH source market.

What a disaster! you think.  How sad! you exclaim.  How could we ever fix this? you despair.  But no! I say.  There is a fix.  LET ME SEARCH FOR THE MODIFIER +DMG.  LET ME SORT RESULTS BY DMG ADDED.  LET ME IGNORE ALL THE IDIOTS WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED A WIZARD AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY POST A WIZARD SOURCE.

Also any WDs who have the same problem (My WD is only level 30 and I haven't searched for mojos but I'm sure y'all have the same problem) please chime in!  This should be such a simple fix but it would make such a big difference to so many of us.

I made this topic to prevent people from dangerously group-thinking. I want people to form their own opinion. I am not trying to take anyone's side


**Here's some things you should know:**


 Kripp, a streamer claims a friend of his (Krippi) loses 4 million gold to an AH glitch. There is NO video evidence (from what I've found) of an actual glitch. Kripp himself has not actual performed the glitch live. The forums are in an absolute uproar about this.


Bashiok has addressed the community staying there was no hotfix to fix this. They are investigating. [link](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5760137425?page=3#51) 
Many players however have stated that there has been a general chat hotfix tonight allowing the game to remember, between logins, that you've left general chat. i.e. you will not be put back into general chat after leaving it.


The Auction House has had some weird items for extremely high prices. Some people cite this as evidence for gold duplication.


Here is one supposed method of how the item duplication worked:

* Bid 200k (random value) on item A.
* Roll your clock back.
* Your gold resets to what it was.
* Bid stays.
* You outbid yourself on item A.
* You receive your 200k gold from getting outbid.
* You now made 200k gold out of nowhere.

Three **theories** as to what happened/is happening:


1. Kripp creates controversy to gain streamers and ad revenue.

2. Trolls.

3. Blizzard has actually messed up and is doing damage control.


The photo with 100+ billion gold is **believed to be photoshop**. I believe it was meant as a joke in response to the photo of 4 billion gold. however people are now using this incorrectly as evidence. http://i.imgur.com/gucjP.jpg


There IS video of item duplication as well as an inordinate amount of gold on **Asian** Servers. They were not rolled back, they were put into (What looks like) emergency maintenance I assume to fix...things. [link](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fkr.battle.net%2Fd3%2Fko%2Fforum%2Ftopic%2F1821324957)


Things I think you should keep in mind:

* Blizzard can see people's gold. People who've done this will be easy to spot.
* Everything upsetting you is on the premise that there IS gold duplication. Wait for proof before your jimmies get rustled.
* Blizzard noticed bugs on the Asian servers immediately maintenance'd them. Wouldn't they do the same to us?
* Has there ever been a time you've received gold late or had missing gold only to have it return later?
* There is something fishy going on and it's too early to pass judgement.

Please share any information you can on this topic as I'm sure we're all dying to know if this is something to be concerned about.

It shows a complete lack of understanding of basic UI/UX and adds NO value.

First of all, the way things are grouped is completely arbitrary for some attributes.  ""Crowd Control"" seems to be the default if it doesn't fit in elsewhere.

Secondly, the main problem this causes is if I'm looking for an item with attribute X, I don't know if its because that item *can't* have attribute X, or because its in a group somewhere else.  In the old model, where things were in alphabetical order, I could at least figure out where things were, and pretty quickly determine if it was missing.  Now I have to scan the list multiple times to find the attribute I'm looking for.

Please, please, please, at least make this an option so I can switch back to alphabetical sorting.  And while you are at it, let me search for attributes on items even if YOU (Blizzard) don't think items in that category can have that attribute when it's clear they can (e.g. move speed on pants, bracers)",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_vd4y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vd4y6/does_anyone_else_really_hate_how_attributes_are/,

Greetings,

Well the obvious answer for that is the word potato is highly offensive in some count... Yeah you're probably not going to buy that. So, if we're being honest here, I have no idea. Potato is a starch, not a violation, so I'm confused too. Could you grab a screenshot of the page where it tells you potato is a no-no? I'll see if we can get that sent over to be investigated. ^_^ Just attach it to your reply.

If you have any questions or run into any other issues please don't hesitate to let us know.

Game Master ""Minolayre"" here! I have to admnit this is a werid one. Nobody seems to know why this would be stopping it. Even Mike Morhaime likes french fries.

I did some research though and did you know a potato is in the family Solanaceae, also called nightshade! Which kills people! I know I was shocked as well. But still I am thinking this may be a mistake. I passed along the issue but sadly this is not the kind of thing that we can resolve in a day.

Hopefully the hate for poor potatoes will end and they can be married like anyone else. Oops I mean marinated:P

It is so much more enjoyable than farming for loot by yourself, I have learned so much about other classes and skill synergy across classes. So last night after a long day of play, I was unable to sleep and thought long and hard about how Blizzard can promote party play more. 



I think I have found a pretty simple solution to the problem. Have a fourth passive slot for each character that is only active when they are in a party and not solo. The passives would be class specific and should probably be limited to 4-5 for each class. Their properties should be similar to follower passive skills. each class should have a skill to increase attack, defense, magic find, resource regen and a special class characteristic passive.


**Examples of class specific passive**


* Barb Group Passive. *Can't Hold Us Down*  When WOTB is activated, your group gets 15 seconds of CC immunity. 

* Monk Group Passive. *Float like a butterfly* When group member is within 6 yard of you, your dodge chance is shared with them for 5 seconds. Can occur once every 10 seconds. 

* Demon Hunter Group Passive. *Hawkeye* When in a party, DH has a detection radius of 250 yards, Elite and Champ pack will ping on the map when DH is close. 

* Wizard Group Passive. *Power Overwhelming* Chance to fill every party members resource to full and keep it there for 5 seconds. Can happen once per minute. 

* Witch Doctor Group Passive. *Vodoo First Aid* When a party member is below 20% health your pets will be drained of their HP to replenish the party member to 50% health, can occur once per minute. 


These are just some ideas, besides the obvious, group crit chance, group armor, group pick up radius, group resource regen and group mf boost. I think with this fourth passive slot, people will be more inclined to party up, it might just be 4 people all running +MF passive, but it will still get people to play together. Having 5 group passives for each class will mean that players need to communicate and balance their skill with one another. These passive should not be very powerful but still provide a noticeable difference from solo play.

**Item Gold Find and Magic Find still matters!** At most by Paragon Level 75-85.

The time it takes to level from 75 to 100 is so long, almost equal to the time it takes to level from 1 to 74! So long, you'll maximize that 30-60 extra GF or MF on your gear during that time period!

See this chart: http://d3cauldron.com/2012/08/diablo-3-paragon-level-chart-how-long-does-it-take/

---

**Signal the party when found an elite.** Press G to drop your banner where you've found an elite. This will also create a Mini Map Ping that makes your partymates go to you.

---

**Cemetery of the Forsaken Zippy Elite Hunting.** Your goal is to go to each crypt, kill the first elite you see, then TP out asap after killing, proceed to next crypt.

Resist the temptation to look for that 2nd _possible_ crypts elite. Why? Each crypt has almost always 1 elite in it. Shaves a lot from your key farming time!

---

**Framerate Graphics Optimization.** In Options -&gt; Graphics, set your Foreground Framerate equal to your monitor's refresh rate. For LCD Monitors, this is usually 59 or 60 Hz.

To view your monitor's refresh rate, right click Desktop -&gt; Screen Resolution -&gt; Advanced Settings. Click the Monitor Tab and there you have your current Screen Refresh Rate.

**Faster Act 1 Key Farming.** Pick the ""Return to New Tristram"" Quest. Go directly to the Fields of Misery, and work your 5 stacks there.

If you've found the Keywarden, and you're still below 5 stacks, go back to town.

Then complete your NV stacks with

* 1-3 elites at Highlands Crossing (while looking for the Cave of the Moon Clan)
* 3-4 elites at the Cave of the Moon Clan (in Highlands Crossing) + 1 Resplendent Chest
* 3-5 elites at Festering Woods
* 1 elite almost near the Cathedral Level 3 waypoint
* 1-3 elites from Leoric's Manor waypoint up to the manor gate, or
* 3-4 elites from Cemetery of the Forsaken

Then go back to where you found the Keywarden, and kill.

---

**Multitask Town Portal:** While you're casting Town Portal, and your Inventory Panel is open, you can throw away the white items you accidentally picked.

---

**For Yahoo Unpaid Mail users with PayPal accounts.** Do yourself a favor and switch to Outlook.com and Gmail.com, and take advantage of free always-on HTTPS. This will strengthen the security of your account because HTTPS prevents cleartext snooping.

After making the switch, update your Battle.net account with your new secure email address.

This tip also applies when you're using Amazon, eBay, Online Banking, iTunes account, etc...

---

**Faster Act 2 Key Farming.** Pick the ""Black Soulstone"" Quest. Go directly to the Dahlgur Oasis, and work your 5 stacks there.

If you've found the Keywarden, and you're still below 5 stacks, go back to town.

Then complete your NV stacks with

* 1-2 elites at Road to Alcarnus
* 1 elite from Sewers of Caldeum
* 1-3 elites from Black Canyon Mines, or
* Many elites from the Vault of the Assasin in Desolate Sands.

Then go back to where you found the Keywarden, and kill.

_Special DH Tip -- Use Elemental Arrow: Ball Lightning to easily kill the keywarden. Saturate the Missile-Dampening Dome with Slowed Ball Lightning. It will kill the keywarden faster!_

---

**Speed up your UI access with the Mouse Wheel!** In Options -&gt; Keybindings, assign these:

* MouseWheelUp = Toggle Inventory Panel
* MouseWheelDown = Potion
* MouseWheelClick = Close all Windows (will also End Dialogs or Stop Cinematics)

---

**Act 2 Key Farming with Leah and Adria.** Simply pick the very last quest. Leah and Adria will help you block some of the missile attacks.

---

**Uber Farming with a Stunning DH.** This applies to DH with high crit chance, like 45% and above Crit Chance. If you're Uber-Farming, your farming team will love to have you! Just temporarily switch to Bola Shot: Thunder Ball and Elemental Arrow: Lightning Bolts. Now you can almost perma-stun the Ubers! Especially Uber Zoltun Kulle!

---

**Faster Act 3 Key Farming.** This is bit different. Don't go to Stonefort without 5 NV, because the keywarden can appear near the Stonefort waypoint!

Pick the ""Kill Azmodan"" Quest (at the end). Before going to Stonefort, stack up 5 NV from

* 1-3 elites at the Core of Arreat
* 1-2 elites that usually spawn near the Level 3 Keep Waypoint
* waypoint to Level 1 Keep, but go downstairs to Level 2 Keep for another possible 1 elite near the door
* 1-2 elites near each Arreat and Tower waypoints
* 1-2 elites near the Bridge of Korsik waypoint

---

**Guaranteed 3 Uber Boss Portals.** Always have 3 Infernal Machines ready before going to the Heretic's abode.

Or at least have everyone in the party net a total of 3 Infernal Machines. Never start Uber Boss fights with just 1 Infernal Machine; This will maximize all that hard work farming keys!

---

**Diablo 2-Style Graphics that improve performance.** In Options -&gt; Graphics, simply uncheck ""Anti-Aliasing"", and set the Shadow from ""High (Smooth)"" to ""High"". Now you have that gritty Diablo 2 look!

I would meet many of my customers in game to personally hand them the items so I had the chance to ask them why they would spend $10 on a virtual axe. It was just as crazy to me back then as it is to some of you Diablo players. 

**Every customer I chatted with was an adult with a high paying job (doctors, lawyers, etc).** Every one enjoyed the game but didn't enjoy the grind. They just wanted to progress in the game and the way to do that was with items. Time was more valuable to them than money, it's as simple as that. They didn't care about fair play, they didn't care about if it was ""wrong"", they just wanted to have fun for the hour or 2 they had in their day to play the game.

When 1.09 hit, the drop rates of unique items increased dramatically in that patch. Uniques that would usually sell for $100s on eBay were dropping like candy. I knew I had a small window to make a HUGE profit before the market was flooded so I farmed for 24hrs straight. The first few days prices remained extremely high but dropped like a ROCK within a week.

**I imagine prices will fall dramatically in D3 as soon as everything dies down or 1.0.3.**

As for people complaining about the RMAH ""ruining"" the game, I remind you that Diablo 2 had all this and remained successful. The RMAH is there but you are not REQUIRED to use it just like eBay was there but you weren't required to use it. If you need proof that Blizzard also believes that the RMAH is not essential to the game, look no further than Patch 1.0.3. They are making the Inferno Acts a smoother transition. You can farm the previous Act to progress to the next. If Blizzard wanted you to use the RMAH, they definitely wouldn't have done this.

If you feel that some how the RMAH is ruining **your** enjoyment of the game, I'm not sure what to say. The enjoyment of Diablo 3 for me is progressing through inferno. Once 1.0.3 comes out, I won't have to depend on either the GAH or the RMAH.

The **only** concern I have about the RMAH is PvP. PvP has the potential to add HUGE replay value to D3 (just like arena's in WoW). If players can simply one shot players by spending more money then we'll have serious issues.

Furthermore, there is no motivation for doing the quests. YET all the options you have for finding a group is joining A QUEST. There is no lobby, no more-configurable game creation option, no game filters, no city where the people run around (Path of Exile, Guild Wars, etc). There is nothing which supports the game purpose of farming (with strangers).**


I'm not a big community-member, thus I don't read much in forums and I don't know whether people already talked about this.


A game like Diablo 3 is in my opinion not designed to spend a lot of time for doing the quests. The long term goal is farming. As in Diablo 2, you level your characters and you farm for gear. Later on, you spent time for searching the stuff you needed to kill the UBER-bosses, which rewarded you with items you can only get from these bosses. Although you didn't really care about doing the quests in Diablo 2, you actually DID care, since some of them rewarded you with skill points and stat boni - something it was worth for doing them.


In Diablo 3, you farm for higher paragon levels and for better gear. There is almost NO motivation for doing any quests. There are no rewards nor does anybody care if you skipped a quest or even a whole act.


And yet, grouping up, finding a party and farming together with strangers as you did in D2 is a big pain in the ass in D3 since all this is limited to the option of joining a quest. You may argue that it's still not impossible to find a party, and you're right with his. I could just join any game and do my farming, because I would still get exp and and I would still find items. But if you develop a game, I think you design the game options for a specific purpose and you try to include options which support this purpose in the best possible way. When I look at this party/quest system, I have the feeling that blizzard did the exact opposite. The thing you want to do the least in Diablo 3 (talking about late game) are the quests, yet it's all about joining a specific quest.


There is no game lobby as in D2, you can't create a game with filters or with a specific purpose, there is no city where all people are running around (as they do in Path of Exile or Guild Wars), there is just NOTHING. It's 2012, over 10 years after D2 release, blizzard is offering online-only playing and the WHOLE multiplayer content consists of a friends list, an auction house, a crippled chat and the option to join A QUEST. 

Especially the latter one, regarding the purpose and long term goal of the game, does not make ANY sense to me.

PATCH NOTES

* Removed shared gold and stash per account. To transfer gold or items between characters, please create a game, have a friend join, drop items, leave game, switch characters, and rejoin game.

* Skill and rune changing has been removed. Upon selection of primary skills during leveling, skill selections will be locked in. To respec, delete your character and create a new one.

* The power of magic and rare items has been modified. All magic armor pieces have been reduced in effectiveness and available modifiers, and magic weapon DPS has been reduced across the board. Rare armor and weapons have also been reduced in effectiveness. 

* The auction house has been removed. To trade items with other players, please join the Trade channel and spam your items over and over. 

* Treasure Goblins (and their ilk) have been removed. 

* Nephalem Valor has been removed; you must now purchase and stack magic find gear in order to find better items.

* Guaranteed rare drops have been removed from bosses.

* Wizards and Witch Doctors no longer receive any benefit from weapon DPS. To improve the power of your spells and skills, search for rare modifiers to specific skills on Legendary weapons or armor!

* Due to complaints, we have removed Invulnerable and Shielding modifiers. To replace then, we have added Immune to Physical and Immune to Elemental affixes, which nullify 100% or more incoming damage of a given type. To deal with these enemies, seek out rare weapons with elemental damage modifiers, or party with a specific class using a specific skill. However, in higher difficulties, these monsters will be less affected by immunity-piecing skills and weapons. Enjoy the challenge!

* The Reflects Damage affix has been modified and now reflects 250% of incoming damage.

* Inferno difficulty has received complaints of its difficulty, despite having only been played by a small portion of players for a few weeks. As such, we believe it is too challenging, and it has been removed. The difficulty of Hell has been slightly buffed to compensate.

* Graphics, music and physics systems have been downgraded and/or removed.

* Town portal now requires a 100g item taking inventory space to use.

* You now require a 100g item taking inventory space to identify items, or you must return to town and speak with an NPC each time you have items to identify.

* We've added a stamina bar that depletes as you move. To refill the bar, you must stand still or quaff stamina potions. However, this mechanic only affects low level players.

My friends thought that people would be interested in asking me a few things, so I thought I would post it in this subreddit. 

One of my favorite parts of gaming has been the economics of the item markets since I started trading in Neopets ten years ago. It is what first got me interested in economics, and I am now studying business at a good university. I hope to consult with game companies someday. (So Blizzard, if you read this, hit me up!)

There are a lot of misconceptions about the markets in a game like this, especially now with a real money option in-game, and I hope I can clear some up. I said amAa, because the one thing I'm not going to disclose is the specific items I have bought and sold, and a few specifics about my techniques and trade secrets, simply because it's part of what makes me successful :P I will try to answer most things, though.

Some proof:

[Some recent paypal transactions](http://i.imgur.com/Zc4A6.png)

(The one transaction that is blurred is a gold sale directly to a person. I have a few regulars still from months ago that I occasionally sell to. These days, most sales are from items on the RMAH.)



Some corresponding sales on the RMAH:

Some of the trading on the GAH:

I have never botted, scammed, used any of the number of exploits, or cheated in any way whatsoever. Before this game, I never made any money off of what I did because it was against the rules. Investing and trading in the item markets is part of how I have my fun, it wouldn't make sense for me to cheat. Anyone who played D2 with hacks knows what I mean.

I just wanted to thank you all again for helping this crazy idea of come off as successful as it was. Everything about the past 24 hours feels magical and surpassed every expectation I had. Many many thanks to all of you.

..ok...now to bed :)

**10:00AM Update:** Almost there! 2 hours left.

Things are winding down as I collect the final pieces for the giveaway at noon. Though I'm absolutely exhausted I can't wait to have the final giveaway to celebrate how tremendous the past 24 hours have been.

**8:00AM Update:** FOUR HOURS TO GO! I'm so ready to crash, but I'm going to keep going until I finish this. 

We just hit $1,550 donated and are only $50 dollars away from hitting the amount it would cost to keep my brother in the program for a whole month. To all the people who have joined the stream and stayed to chat, thank you so much for keeping me company and helping me stay awake. The overwhelmingly positive response I have received from all of you has ... I don't even know how to express how wonderful it makes me feel.

Thank you to everyone who has participated in this event to help my brother and start a conversation about mental health disorders. I realize it's a difficult topic for many of you to talk about so it means a lot to me when we cann all open up to each other. It really makes it feel like a community and we're all in this together.

It's been a pleasure!

**4:00AM Update:** Still going strong! I will be extending the stream by 1 hour until Noon on Sunday. 

So far we've raised $,1425 and small donations continue to trickle in. So many people have stopped by the channel to show their support and share stories about how mental illness has had an effect on their lives. I can't tell you how much it's warmed my heart to have so many people contribute their time and kind words.

Well, we have 8 hours to go. I'm in the last third of the stream and still feeling pretty strong. It's probably been 10 years since I've stayed awake long enough to see the sun rise so I'm pretty pumped. Feels like college, cramming for an exam, except I'm doing this for my brother which is a really big thing for me.

Having a sibling who has grown up with a serious mental illness meant we never really had a chance to get past that sibling rivalry stage when we were super young. By the time we were old enough to start mending fences my brother was already extremely hard to communicate with. While I've always been there for him, it's always made me sad that we never were able to really bond. I'm hoping that with the help of this program we can begin to start building a stronger relationship that brings us closer and keeps him out of the hospital for as long as possible. I hold no illusions that it will be a simple fix, but I think this will be a *huge* step in the right direction.

So, 8 hours to go. Thanks again to all the people who have donated gold, or money, or even their time just hanging out on the stream chatting with me. I would have been happy if I had raised $50 dollars for my brother, so to be at almost $1,500 with 8 hours to go is unbelievable and...well, you guys are just straight up swell!

I am preparing an enormous grand giveaway for 12:00PM for the end of the stream. There will literally be hundreds of legendaries to be scavenger hunted by 3 lucky winners. UNID Manticores, tons of amazing jewlery items, tons and tons of just about everything. This will be HUGE. So please, stick around and spread the word. 

12:00PM EST: Massive Giveaway on Stream!

I'd also like to give a shoutout to a few people who have gone above and beyond to help out. Shonrii, cdxliv, Chaz, Siggeta, and many many more...please forgive me if I didn';t name you. My brain has almost literally turned to jello at this point.

And finally, an enormous, massive, magnificent hug, handshake and just...plain jawdropping admiration goes to deafnight who graciously donated $1,000. I cannot thank you enough for your contribution. Never in a million years would I have expected such generosity and I hope one day I can repay the favor in some way.

Alrighty, back to the stream!

See you all at 12 I hope!

Hi there /r/diablo3 ! I will be streaming today starting around 11:00am EST until 11:00am EST tomorrow morning in order to help raise money to get my brother the medical help he needs. For the past 15 years my brother has dealt with two serious mental health illnesses. When he was around 15 he was diagnosed with both Bi-Polar disorder and Schizophrenia. He has struggled every day since then to find the right dose of medicine to help him.

Due to the combination of these illnesses it is very difficult for him to keep taking his medication on a regular schedule. The more time he spends alone away from people and without a job, the easier it is for him to slip up. Slip ups in not taking his meds almost always means a trip to the hospital for 1-2 weeks to get him back on track. There have been good days, and even good years for him where he has been able to function normally and hold down a job. The past few years and especially the past few months, however, have not been kind to him.

After struggling with illness for so long, he has recently become convinced that he has been miraculously healed and will not take his medicine unless monitored. This has resulted in him spending most of the past 4 weeks in the hospital, including Thanksgiving. (We brought him lots of turkey, stuffing, and pies but it still really sucked for him and for us).

Today my mother made me aware of an outpatient program that could do wonders to get him back on his feet. He would have multiple group therapy sessions a week, a home cooked meal every night, and nurses to monitor his progress with his medicine. My family and I believe this is exactly what he needs to get break out of his downward spiral and start becoming a functioning member of society again. Unfortunately, the program is not covered by insurance whatsoever and the cost is $1,700 per month. His main therapis, who he has been working with for over 15 years, believes that just 2 months of the program would be enough for him., which means we need to find $3,200 dollars to pay for it.

I'll be honest Reddit, regardless if I get a single cent donated my family will find a way to get my brother the help he needs. However any help we could get would be incredibly appreciated. Therefore I will be streaming for the next 24 hours in the hopes to not only raise money for my brother but to bring awareness about mental health disorders like schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. If by some miracle I raise over the $3,200 needed for his program the excess would be donated to the IMHRO (International Mental Health Research Organization) in the hopes of finding a cure for these horrible diseases.

I will be answering any questions throughtout my stream about Monks, Diablo 3 theorycrafting or relating to Mental Health Illness. Besides my raising money for my brother my main goal for this stream is to have a great time playing Diablo and to raise awareness about an issue that is very near and dear to my heart.

If you made it this far through that wall of text , here's the stream info. http://twitch.tv/meto5000

If you're able any amount you're able to donate would be amazing. Even if you can't donate but still want to show supprt, please come by and say hello. All legendaries I find and anything in my inventory will be raffled off to viewers in order to raise as much money as possible.

Thanks for reading,

Yeah, I know there are hundreds and hundreds of Paragon level 100 players but I just hit it today and it feels great. These past two weeks have been a huge grind and I'm so glad that it's finally over. Perhaps surprisingly, I still find the game interesting and have had loads of fun experimenting with slight build variations.

Anyway, here are some of my leveling stats;

* My barbarian has 552 Hours on him. I leveled him to 60 pre 1.0.4 but started playing at level 60 only after that patch hit.
* I've killed 1,42 elites / minute. This might seem low but I was terribly geared when I started with no more than 20k DPS back then.
* I was Paragon level 70 on the 7th of October and it took me more than a month of active playing to get from that to 100. 
* I did all my leveling on A3 although my routes varied a lot during the process.
* I didn't start using a ruby in my helm or a Hellfire Ring until Plevel 80
* I never played below MP5 after monster power was released.
* My most valuable drops to date came on levels 96 and 99. (275M and 425M)
* I've picked up 152 million gold from the ground and have 1,118,982 lifetime kills. Barbarian has 47k Elite kills.
* I never put any money on the RMAH until the very end when I bought myself some gold to celebrate the end of the process and got new gloves. I plan on getting that money back, however.
* [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/ZqzFV.jpg) a picture of what my guy looks like. Standard high level barbarian I guess.

[Here's a video of my final leveling run, 11:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE931Z1JLU&amp;hd=1)

[My armory profile](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Fleme-2972/hero/1339439) and [my diabloprogress profile](http://www.diabloprogress.com/hero/fleme-2972/Fend/1339439), not yet updated. I call my current build the omnibarb - It has the mobility and efficiency of standard WW combined with the reach and convenience of Weapon Throw and the single target damage of HotA. Loads of fun.

That's it. Just wanted to share with you guys and thank you for having been such a great community. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer.

I have been hacked. This was confirmed through a response to a ticket I sent to Blizzard that my account has been compromised. I have since changed my password on both my battle.net account as well as my e-mail account.

I *had* a Dial-In Authenticator, and.. since I've been hacked, I'm here to tell you that that option might not successfully protect your account. If you are interested, I will list the instructions to opt out of the Dial-In Authenticator, and switch to the Mobile App Authenticator.

1. Log in to battle.net
2. Go to Account, click Security Options, and click Authenticator from the drop bar.
3. Locate the option to opt out of the Dial-In Authenticator, should be on the bottom right of the box.
4. Dial the number (with the phone you bound your account to)
5. Follow the voice instructions.
6. Verify the opt-out, should be right next to the number you got when you chose to opt out of the Dial-In Authenticator.
7. Load Play Store or the Apple Store(?) and download Battle.Net Authenticator.
8. Choose to secure your account with the Mobile App Authenticator on your browser.
9. Enter the Serial Code, and then the Authenticator Code.
10. CHECKBOX the ""Require an authenticator code every time you log in to the game"" option.

I'm sorry if this is redundant, but I feel the need to just pass on the information so that others don't get hacked. The Dial-In Authenticator did not protect me. I hope this will.

You can read about rising hack reports by googling ""diablo 3 lost items"" or this link http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5149008104 .

I'm not exactly sure how to prove that my stats were as I claim - I did a lot of swapping gear between characters and such so it'd be a pretty big pain to get screenshots of all of them in the right gear. Plus screenshots are not actually conclusive evidence anyway. Hopefully my knowledge of the classes and boss fights is proof enough that I'm not lying.)

After 350 hours of play, I've killed Inferno Diablo with each class. I did everything solo and never spent a minute farming gear (I've always hated farming in pretty much every game I've played). Any time I hit a wall in progression, I'd go to the AH and buy some cheap upgrades. I don't think I ever spent more than 250k on any single piece of gear. I only sold gear if it wasn't an upgrade for a character that I was trying to progress with. As you can imagine, I could never amass much money with this strategy, but I was generally able to stay within the 500k-1m gold range, and I never went completely broke.

Anyway, I figured I'd share my experiences with each class, figured it might be helpful/interesting/informative or whatever. I've listed below each class in order of relative strength (strongest is first), and I describe each class's strengths and weaknesses. I also give my final stats (unbuffed) for each one after finishing Inferno, so you can get a general sense for the kind of gear I could get without farming.

Note: When referring to a class's strength, I'm only talking about how good the class is at progression. I obviously have no idea how good each class is at farming, and I don't have any experience playing a particularly well-geared character.

* 1. **Monk** - I was actually really surprised at how good monks are. It was the second-to-last class I played, and I got the sense from forums that barbs are generally considered the better/easier melee class (which may very well be true for farming at higher gear levels). I played a balanced tank/dps monk, using Mantra of Conviction and a LoH dagger+shield.

*Strengths*: Amazing mobility with Thunderclap, and very strong dps. I was able to use Mantra of Conviction with Overawe for the entire game (with the single exception of Rakanoth, where I had to switch to the healing mantra for extra damage mitigation). I bought a handful of pieces of cheap offensive gear with one resist type (lightning) at the beginning of Act 2, and I never had to upgrade anything after that. Progression was extremely smooth and enjoyable. The only elite packs I ever had to skip were the bullshit Morlu Incinerator guys in Act 4 (LOL every time you touch me I'm gonna teleport off screen so you're guaranteed to hit the enrage timer!)

*Weaknesses*: Not much. Ghom was the only boss that took me a little while to figure out, but after maybe 10 deaths or so I discovered that Deadly Reach with the +50% armor rune makes kiting him to death quite easy.

Final Stats: 16k dps, 650 resist all, 6k armor, 29k hp, 800 LoH

* 2. **Barb** - Apparently melee is the way to go now, post Inferno damage nerf. I played a tanky barb with a LoH dagger and shield. My dps was decent, though, because I used the Berserker Rage passive with no fury-spending ability.

*Strengths*: Between the strength primary stat, passives, and defensive cooldowns, barbs get a ridiculous amount of armor. This means that you can pretty much ignore resistances and still be fine. The only time I ever cared about resistance was for Ghom - I bought some cheap poison resist gear for about 300k total to get it up to 800 post-warcry, popped on the Relentless passive (which pretty much hard counters Ghom), and proceeded to face-tank him to death (he doesn't even spawn adds if you never leave melee range!) The Ghom fight is definitely a strength of the class, as every other class required kiting.

*Weaknesses*: Those cleavery skeleton guys in the Breached Keep that do a bajillion damage. Fuck them. At least with my monk, I was able to Thunderclap around so that I only ever had one guy hitting me at a time. Barbs don't have that kind of mobility though, so these packs were really rough. Besides those guys, I can't really think of any other significant weaknesses; all of the bosses were relatively simple. I mean, Morlu Incinerator elites were as impossible as ever, but that's kinda true for every class (ranged have a little less trouble with them, but they're still super obnoxious).

Final Stats: 17k dps, 100 resist all, 10k armor, 47k hp, 900 LoH

* 3. **Wizard** - Pretty well-designed/balanced class overall. Force armor is kind of a crutch, but whatever. I found the class to be very fun to play. I played the standard blizzard/venom hydra wizard.

*Strengths*: Wizards are great at trash mobs and elite/champion packs. You can kite stuff forever with blizzard while venom hydra does all the work. And force armor saves you if run into a little trouble with the kiting (unlike most save-me abilities, force armor is effectively a passive). Some of the ranged elites could get annoying at times, but I think the only pack I ever ended up having to skip was fast phasebeasts.

*Weaknesses*: Bosses, especially Ghom and Cydaea. For Ghom, it's very difficult to kite him in such a way that his first poison cloud disappears by the time you kite back around to your starting point. Kiting wasn't a problem at all for my monk, because I could stand in melee range. But when you need to stay out of melee range, the kiting becomes far more difficult since he spawns new clouds on top of you (so these new clouds won't overlap with the previous ones). Ultimately, I decided my kiting was just barely not good enough, so I went to the AH and got cheap poison resist gear to get 1000 resist (with prismatic armor buff). Then, after kiting Ghom around the room, I was able to stand in a cloud for a good 5-10 seconds while waiting for it to disappear. As for Cydaea, well, that fight was just super obnoxious. The spiders should really not auto-hit you if the pool happens to spawn on top of you, that's just poor design. Basically 100% of my damage dealt to Cydaea herself was from venom hydra, everything else was devoted to killing off spiders. And I spammed pots like crazy during the spider-spawning phases. It was a very tough fight.

Final Stats: 27k dps, 250 resist all, 2.8k armor, 40k hp, 800 life/sec

* 4. **Demon Hunter** - Disclaimer: my opinions regarding the Demon Hunter class are kind of irrelevant at this point in time. This is because I did everything up to Inferno Diablo before the Nether Tentacles nerf. I killed Diablo himself post-nerf (I actually reached Diablo 15 minutes before the servers went down for the patch). Also, Demon Hunter was my first class, so I was a little less geared than my other characters, and I had to learn all of the boss fights. With that disclaimer in mind, I found the class to be pretty strong, but also frustrating to play. It's completely dependent on smoke screen, which means that any time you're about to die, you have to see it coming ahead of time so that you can activate the ability. Maybe the class plays differently when it's less of a glass cannon, but it seems impossible to get to that point with cheap gear.

*Strengths*: Trash mobs and elite/champion packs were very easy. Just smoke screen anything that's scary, and burn them down in seconds with NT. Of course, this doesn't work anymore, so I don't really know how it works now (haven't touched my demon hunter after killing Diablo, so I literally have 0 experience killing trash mobs without NT).

*Weaknesses*: Rakanoth (probably Ghom and Cydaea, too, but I only fought them before they were buffed). This fight single-handedly made progression with demon hunter difficult. He is far and away the worst-tuned fight in the game. I was amazed when I looked at the patch 1.0.3 notes where a bunch of bosses were re-tuned, and Rakanoth wasn't touched. A tip for game developers: never, ever give a boss an unpredictable ability that unavoidably one-shots the player. The fight was fine as a wizard because force armor makes the teleport ability survivable. As a demon hunter, you have to pre-smoke screen it. Since the teleport initially looks basically the same as his other two abilities (shoot swirly things and spawn soul lashers), you have to pre-smoke screen all of his abilities. This means you'll run out of discipline and die. I kept dying over and over to Rakanoth, until one attempt when the 30% Preparation rune proc'd twice (giving me 3 full bars of discipline), and I happened to dodge his teleport attack once after I ran out of discipline. So when I killed him, I probably had a &lt;5% chance of being able to repeat the kill. This is the definition of a poorly-tuned fight. And having better gear wouldn't help at all, since I'm pretty sure a demon hunter can never reasonably get to the point where the teleport ability won't one-shot (I had 36k hp and the attack did 75-80k damage). All that being said, I did happen to accidentally discover a way to completely avoid Rakanoth's teleport when I played my witch doctor later; I'll go into that in the witch doctor section.

Final Stats: 26k dps, 100 resist all, 2.4k armor, 36k hp, 200 life/sec, 49 max disc

Examples:

1)

&gt;""When a Legendary drops, the question that goes through a player's mind should never be ""is this a good item?"" It should be ""how awesome is it?"" For example, if you are playing a Demon Hunter wielding a Rare crossbow and a Legendary crossbow drops, we want your reaction to be ""Holy crap, YES!"" not ""*sigh* another Hellrack.""

2)

&gt;When you identify hundreds of Rares and only a small percentage are worth equipping or selling, those items become a burden rather than something to get excited about. ""Great. Now I have to identify them all, read their stats, and I’m probably going to salvage all of them."" I feel your pain.


All of these could be taken straight from this subreddit. They finally start to speak the language  of the players.

It's been a long road and you've all been incredible. I've received hundreds of emails containing bugs, feedback and suggestions; all of which are either in this update or will be coming shortly. I'd also like to say that come friday, there will be yet another **MAJOR** update to [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) that I think will blow your mind.

So to start everything off, I just want to say...

THANK YOU
---

Thank you for being so passionate about the game, my tools on D3Up.com and your characters. I may be the only programmer working on this project, but I'm not the only one thinking about how [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) should work :)

The goals of D3Up.com V1.0
---
The entire goal of this update was two-fold:

- Make D3Up.com a lot easier to use and gather information from.
- Rebuild all of the Tools so they can be used in many, many new ways. 

I think I've accomplished both of these goals (hopefully), and D3Up.com will become even more valuable over the course of your Diablo 3 character's lifetime. 

What is [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com)?
---
If you've been to the site, you obviously can skip this :)

[D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) is a 'Build Calculator', a site that can import your build from the Diablo 3 Armory and help you understand what you need to do to up your diablo 3 game. It's useful for sharing your gear, build and stats with other players, finding upgrades and learning the inner workings of your character.

[D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) is designed to assist you with the following:

- EHP Calculations
- DPS Calculations
- Individual Skill DPS Calculations
- Gear Comparisons
- Simuating changes on your Items
- Creating Snapshots of your Build
- Individual EHP/DPS Contributions by Gear
- EHP/DPS Gains per Stat
- Many more statistics you might need!

Interested in a Video showing how to use the new site?
---
I took some time and did a video showing off the new D3Up.com, how to use it, creating your build and how to read all the statistics. It's 16 minutes long, but pretty much covers everything and if people find it useful, I can make more. 

I figure it's also a great tool for showing people how exactly to use a build calculator to explore their character in-depth! I see a TON of ""What should I upgrade next..."" posts, hopefully after understanding how to use a site like D3Up.com, they won't have to ask, they can just figure it out themselves!

[D3Up.com - Introduction Video (16m)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaRts-nmOE8)

So, without further ado, here's a list of all of the changes:

Version 1.0 Changes
---

**General Updates**

- D3Up.com has been completely redesigned from the ground up. 
- The navigation has been updated to a new, easier to use ""Mega-Menu"".
- For non-registered users, you'll see a 'Getting Started' part of the navigation with instructions on creating your build.
- For logged-in users, you'll see a 'My D3Up.com' part of the navigation with quick links to all of YOUR information. 
- I've attempted to simplify the entire site and categories each section to fall under one of the links in the Mega Menu: Builds, Guides and Items. 
- The ""Items DB"" will be slowly phasing out, you'll learn more about this very soon.
- A link to our Facebook page has been added to the Menu, feel free to like it and use it to chat with me.
- The homepage has been streamlined slightly and will be a bit more flexible in the future. I realize most people use the site for their own personal builds and not as a site to browse, so I haven't focused incredibly hard on it (yet).

**Build Browsing**

- An 'Advanced Search' button has been added to the builds page that lets you search for builds that use a specific combination of Skills and Passives.

**Your Build/Character Updates**

- The Build Interface has been completely redesigned into a 3-column layout. They are as follows: Left - Controls, Middle - Items/Skills, Right - Statistics.
- The Gear panel now has 3 different modes: DPS/EHP Contributions, Gear Stats/Perfection and Change/Compare/Simulate Gear.
- *DPS/EHP Contributions*: Lists the contributions to DPS and EHP that each individual piece of gear provides your Build.
- *Gear Stats/Perfection*: Shows every individual stat on each item, along with how 'Perfect' the stat is, and allows you to filter down to the statistics you want to review on your gear. 
- *Change/Compare/Simulate Gear*: Lets you compare/simulate changes on multiple items at the same time, creating a ""Comparision Diff"" showing exactly what will happen to your character if you were to change gear. 
- You can now Simulate an item change AND do item comparisons at the same time, mixing and matching how you see fit.
- You can now activate/deactivate skills, passives and misc buffs DURING item simulation and comparisons.
- You can click on the icons in your build header to activate/deactivate skills.
- The Skills panel now also shows 'meta' information, such as cooldown, cost as well as it's individual skill-based DPS calculations. 
- Companion Abilities and Shrines have been added as buffs you can now 'Activate'.
- A new panel called 'Battle.net Sync' has been added to all builds allowing for quick and painless updates to your character.
- The edit page has been moved and is now part of the Build itself.
- A link to ""My Items"" has been added onto your build, for quick access.

**My Items**

- The interface has been redesigned to make it a bit easier to look around. You can filter by stats and they will appear on the page as you specify them.
- You can now delete ALL items with the 'Delete All Items' button at the top. There's a confirmation page that makes you confirm this decision. 
- You can now select multiple items with the checkbox next to their name to delete multiple items at once. 
- Deleting items will NOT remove them from your builds, just your 'My Items' page. You also will NOT be able to re-equip these items if you delete them. Deleting removes you as the owner of the item and prevents it from showing up in any section that shows your items.
- When you hover over an item row, the 'Delete', 'Edit' and 'Sell' buttons will appear in that row. Makes it a bit easier on the eyes. 
- Clicking the 'Sell' button on an item will currently load it up into the 'My Shop' feature for price tracking. 
- Items are sorted by newest first, there's currently no way to change the sorting. 

**My Shop**

- Major changes are coming to this section at some point after 1.0.5, more details in the coming weeks.

Final Thoughts
---
I'm devoted to making D3Up.com the ultimate tool for your Diablo 3 Characters, and your feedback has helped mold the site into something really great. So, with that being said, there probably are going to be a few new bugs that pop-up over the next couple days that I just didn't catch, PLEASE report them to me, I'll fix them ASAP. Respond here, email me (aaron.cox@greymass.com) or reach out to me somehow.

I've got a few changes that didn't make this version that I'll be working on soon. I plan on taking a break from the site and doing feature development only for a couple weeks after 1.0.5 is released, and I'm working on a still un-announced new website in conjunction with another developer in the D3 Community. More details of all of this will surface in the near future as we move forward!

I finally made it.  I have been farming non stop for the last few weeks getting ready to go for the final goal of soloing act 3 and 4 without getting any waypoints from people or help in any way.

After that I started act 3 and just didn't stop until now, after killing Diablo!  The last 5 hours have been the most intense hours I have had playing Diablo 3 since release, but it was worth it.  I'm not sure what I will do now, maybe just keep farming with friends and save $ for hardcore PvP.  I had at least 5 really close calls with some elite packs in act 3 and 4, but I kept an escape path and was extremely patient with saving berserker for each pack.

http://youtu.be/DBQSy0eP8u8

There are really only 3 builds you need access to: Poison Darts (for only some bosses), Dire bats for general farming/progression, and Zombie bears for the toughest of elite packs.

My credentials? I’ve solo’d inferno all the way up to A4, and just beat Rakanoth last night (who is by most accounts unkillable, but I managed to get a kill on him). I have killed the Butcher on Inferno is less than 7 seconds. I have sold probably roughly 50 million gold worth of AH gear, mostly farmed in Act 4 inferno. I have a 188% MF gearset that can kill elite packs in Act 4 inferno, because of a tight spec, and solid tight play that hopefully this guide will teach you.

**Here are the three specs you need:**

(Sorry for format, I can't link to a build calculator at work)

1) Dire bats, Vision quest. You need dire bats for most inferno content, the range is just OP, and unlike poison darts, Dire bats is aoe, which is absolutely crucial. Rest of the spec is up to you, but I use: Spirit Walk (with 3 sec rune), BBV (with either 20% dmg or mana rune), Soul Harvest (with either 60 sec rune, mana regen, or healing rune), Grasp (with 80% slow rune), Fetish Army (with either reduced CD rune for general farming, or legion of daggers for burst fights), Dire bats.

Passives are Vision Quest (naturally), Vessel (mandatory in all specs), and usually more mana regen (spiritual attunement I think it's called?). 

2) Zombie Bears, Vision quest. You need this for certain elite packs that just aren’t kite-able. Typically stuff like Vortex, Teleporter, Fast. You aren’t kiting that pack, so you have to just zombie bears blitz it. 

Typically I will use Mass Confusion instead of Grasp. If I have widdled down to only 1 unit remaining, I will use Hex with Jinx rune. BBV gets the mana rune (this adds WAY more dps than the 20% rune with a fast 1her, since you can spam it for a solid 15 sec). I sometimes use wall of zombies: pile on, replacing soul harvest (if only 1 mob to soul harvest).

**PROTIP:** If you back yourself into a corner, your bears will funnel out in SINGLE-FILE. This is absolutely brutal dps if you can manage to pull a boss such that you can sit in the corner and fire out machine-gun single-file zombie bears of death at him.

3) Poison Dart build, you only need this for Belial and Azmodan (and maybe Diablo, but I haven’t got to him yet). This is the standard build of Poison Dart splinters rune with Pierce the Veil rune for 20% more dmg. Every other skill is optional really. I'd highly suggest grasp with 80% slow, since you NEED aoe dmg and the slow is insane. Anything else is up to you, but you'll prob use BBV for bursting single targets, and fetish army, because it's just stupidly strong.

**Gear**

Most people say the best setup for Dire bats or Zombie Bears is a slow 2her, and they are correct, up to a certain gear threshold. The problem with slow 2hers is that you really lose out on +dmg on rings/amulet/(offhand), since it doesn’t scale well with slow attack speed. 

However, once you get thoroughly pimped out (say once you get that 1400+ dps 2h-er, and there is nowhere else to go), you actually get more dps out of a fast 1her, high dmg offhand, and high dmg/ias rings/amulets. I went from around 49k dps to almost 70k dps by switching. The tradeoff you have to make is to change your BBV into the mana regen BBV rune, but when you do, my God you kill things fast. I had a 4.5 second butcher kill, a 5 second Rakanoth kill, etc. Some of these bosses, this is the ONLY way to kill them. 

Most of inferno is gimmacky like this. You have to fight these 5 second burst dmg fights with zero hp and rely on your spirit walk and spirit vessel to let you dps as a glass cannon while being invulnerable. Unfortunately, when bosses hit you for 250k, I learned pretty fast that my 80k hp build was just not viable anymore (past mid A3 inferno). So the only option is to go with 10k hp, but 70k dps and just literally never get hit.

The other good thing about doing the switch to 1hers is that you can run the poison dart build with the same gear.  For direbats grinding, I’d suggest also using Soul Harvest runed for mana, since BBV is only up so often. That being said, with some mana regen on your 1her you can regen mana really fast with Vision Quest active.


**Must-Have Skills - a brief discussion on why I choose what I choose, and why you need to also**

Spirit Walk: Obviously you absolutely must have this in inferno to stand a chance. This is one of the reasons I believe that the Witch Doctor is the best inferno class right now. I used to run the life regen rune, or the severence (dmg) rune, but you absolutely, 100% need to be using the 3 second rune. This is a 50% increase in INVULNERABLE DPS TIME, and I can't even begin to give it credit. Just take it, you'll thank me.  

Vessel: I shouldn't have to say why this is manatory, but if this isn't in your spec, you are either not in inferno, or you are doing it wrong. Inferno is all about these 3-5 second burst dps encounters, and this passive is absolutely required to survive past act 2 and actually get stuff dead. Unfortunately, most content requires you to just blitz it down while you are invulnerable with this because you just got 1-shot, then following it up with a 3 sec invulnerable spirit walk. Hopefully the monster died while you were dishing out 70k dps in this 3-5 second timeframe.

BBV/Fetish Army: These aren't must-have per se, but they are just so absurd at burst dmg that you'd be crazy not to use them. Note: I've recently fallen in love with Ambush rune on Fetish Army. Doing 1250% weapon DPS in AoE turns out to be pretty huge burst (duh) on an already amazing spell).

Grasp with 80% slow: This abilitly is so important in almost every build. Not only is the slow important for keeping stuff off you, but mobs get clumped up together in the slow, making dire bats, zombie bears, whatever hit EVERYTHING. It saves your life and increases your dps by ensuring your AOE hits more stuff.

Soul Harvest: This is a great spell for taking down elite packs, because a BBV zombie bear spam with 5-stacks of soul harvest is insane. The soul harvest buff alone accounts for upwards of 20k dps in these burst phases. Obviously not great for boss fights, but amazing for taking down tough A4 inferno elite packs.

Zombie Bears: This spell is literally the only reason why witch doctors can take down some elite packs in A4 inferno. Some bosses like Rakanoth are just impossible to beat any other way.



**GEARING**

For gearing, your 1her priority is as follows:

**One Handed Weapon:**

#1) Fast Attack Speed. You NEED this to be at least 1.74, the higher the better, as it will scale all your +dmg on gear better.
#2) Mana regen. This helps a ton when you are spamming 2-3 dire bears every second.

**Offhand:**

#1) Offhand has to have at least +240 avg dmg (i.e. +80-400, gives an avg of +240). This is so dominant that it's really ALL you care about. See my stat valuation guide below to assess if a whole whack of int/crit/etc is worth trading a little +dmg for, but generally the +dmg will scale better as you gear up with more ias, so you NEED this to be high.

After getting enough +dmg (say +89-400), you want crit chance, crit dmg, and int (see stat guide below for details on what proportions).

**Rings/Amulet/Gloves**

You need to get attack speed here, since it's the only place you can get it, and it's so so so important. After that, focus on +dmg, int, crit, crit bonus dmg.

**Chest/Boots/Legs/Belt**

As much int as you can get. If you can get crit and crit dmg bonus, you can get that too.

**Hat**

Mana regen is a must, then as much int as you can get.

**Important note: buggy IAS on non-ias slots**

Currently if you have IAS on a belt, boots, legs, or anywhere that doesn't naturally have access to IaS, it actually will NOT work. 


**Stat Guide - Stat valuations:**

General dps values are as follows, translated into int equivalents:

1 int = 1 int

1% Ias = roughly 12 int

1% crit = roughly 8 int

+1dmg = roughly 2.5 int

1 vit = WORTHLESS. 

HP is literally zero value in inferno, because you will get 1-shot regardless. It took my a while to learn this. This may change if somehow we get access to heavy dmg mitigation in legendaries (like 75%+ reduction in melee/range attacks), but for now, vitality is absolutely zero value. At all. Zero.

Notice how I say ""roughly"" everywhere? This is because these equivalencies are dynamic, and they change with your current gear setup. For now, these values reflect the equivalencies for my gear (1.74 attack speed 1her, character stats: 1900 int, 50% crit bonus (i.e. base), 60% ias on ringes/ammy/gloves). 

If you stack a bunch of +crit dmg bonus, naturally the value of crit chance will go higher. Most stats have diminishing returns, so if you have more int than 1900, the value of each int past that gets lower and lower, and the value of the other things, +dmg, ias, etc, gets higher and higher. These numbers should give you general guidelines to follow though.


**PROTIP: how to get your exact values:**

The best way to check for yourself is to go to the AH, and buy a  bunch of cheap $500 rings: one with +1 int, one with +1 attack speed, one with +1 damage, one with +1% crit, and one with +1 vit (or whatever, use this as your baseline). Then you can equip the ""zero ring"" (i.e. the vit ring) and then hover over each other ring and find the equivalent dps values for each stat, and figure out your own stat valuations.

If you favor effect-per-attack or low-cost skills, aim for Increased Attack Speed and high-DPS quick weapons. If you favor high-cost low-frequency skills, *DPS is irrelevant*, and you want hard-hitting slow weapons.**


Okay,

In Diablo 3, your damage is entirely dependent on the weapon you're holding. A lot of people have been asking about whether to use 2H or Dual Wield, and what type of weapon works best with their spells. I did some experiments to figure this out, and I present those results below:

Some people have claimed Diablo 3 only uses your DPS to calculate skill damage. That is false.

I compared a very quick dagger to a slow 2H hammer with nearly the same DPS. Despite having the same DPS, spells like Arcane Orb did a lot more damage per cast with the hammer.

I used a dagger (46.5 dps, 16-46 dmg * 1.5 attacks/sec) and a 2h hammer (46.35 dps, 47-56 dmg * 0.9 attacks/sec).

I tried a variety of spells, including Blizzard, Arcane Orb, and Ray of Frost. (10 full casts of Blizzard per weapon, measured before/after enemy HP values with the HP overlay.)

With the 2h hammer, my Blizzards did an average of **590.7** damage.

With the dagger, my Blizzards did an average of **346.3** damage.

(Deviation was small, this is definitely not a statistical fluke. Note the ~1.706x experimentally measured factor corresponds within 3% to the ~1.661x ratio you'd predict by comparing the weapons' individual average per-hit values.)

Arcane Orb did more damage per cast with the hammer. Not sometimes; *every time*. I also tried with/without ~+30% IAS. *The +%Attack Speed gear made no difference on the damage per orb.*

However, IAS **did** affect the average damage per tick on Ray of Frost.

Conclusion: Technically speaking, you do the same average DPS on Arcane Orb with the dagger or the hammer, but *only as long as you're chain-casting it.* Because the spell is expensive, you can only afford to cast it ~3 times in a row, and the total damage of those 3 casts will be much higher with the hammer. However, the casting animation will be slower.

Note: I did no experiments on cooldown skills. It is possible that cooldown damage uses DPS instead of raw damage. I have no data on this at present.

Some skills will work better with fast weapons, some will work better with hard-hitting slow weapons. If you are favoring a skill that does something special each time you cast it (like Attunement, which adds 4 arcane power on every cast, or a Fury Generator), then a quick dagger will work best. If you are favoring an expensive spell, like Arcane Orb (or a Fury Spender), then you want as much punch as possible per use, and you should focus on max damage-per-hit.

It can be a lot easier to get your DPS up by acquiring +%Attack Speed gear, but this won't affect your damage at all on skills like Arcane Orb! However, fast attacks enjoy better granularity, rather than wasting DPS on overkill, so if you don't need the extra punch of a slow weapon, you should look for speed.",,False,self,t5_2qore,1337743682.0,,witchdoc-reddit,True,t3_tznjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tznjx/diablo_science_heres_what_you_need_to_know_about/,

If the loudest voices giving me feedback for my game were calling me stupid, I honestly don't think it would be worth to even continue working on games, much less actually continuing support and patching released games.  One of the awesome things about being a game dev is knowing that you're actually providing people enjoyment through your game.  It would really suck if after working 1000+ hours on a game, I would get people calling me a moron as a result.

You can't become a lead game designer of Blizzard by being a dummy.  It also doesn't mean you're perfect.  All I know is the making a game to keep people's attention for more than 100 hours is ridiculously challenging, especially when you're trying to be a little innovative and not just do a blind copy of the game's predecessor.  

Edit:  Apparently, I need to grow a thicker skin.  Maybe that's true, but devs aren't going to listen to people that call them idiots, thick skin or not.

The recipe to craft the staff is a drop from Izual (Act 4 Boss)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geoODfSVs3U

Once all 6 items are obtained, open the window of your blacksmith and right click the pattern to learn it, you can now craft it under the weapon section.

Now that it is crafted, you must visit The Ghost of the Cow king on old tristram road in Act 1, he will have a brief dialog with you and then open the path to Whimsyshire, the magical land of rainbows and ponies.

1341316843.0,429,self.Diablo,vz3mw,Removing NV stacks on gear swap is a bad solution for gear swapping.,ElOhTeeBee,681,252,398,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vz3mw/removing_nv_stacks_on_gear_swap_is_a_bad_solution/,"I see this ""solution"" bandied about a fair bit, and it bothers me, because I believe it's not a particularly good solution. So, I'm making this post to explain why it's not a good idea, and to propose some alternatives that would work better.

First off, why it's not a good idea. There are two factors I'm going to address here - punishing good play, and misinterpretation of problems.

Losing your stacks for gear swapping punishes good play. Suppose you're playing a barb wielding a 2H weapon, with a fair bit of survivability but mainly specced for damage, going through Act 2 Inferno, when you run into a champion pack of those freaking wasp assholes. The affixes don't look so tough, but they do amazing amounts of damage by default. Under the current system, you aren't penalized for switching to a 1H+shield combo, or maybe switching out your Str+a bit of vit and resi all chest for a chest that gives you less DPS, but a lot more survivability. If you lose stacks on gear swap, though, then your options are to give up at least one stack when you switch to take on the pack *and* at least one stack when you switch back to your normal set of gear, or to skip the pack despite it being very much killable if only you could switch out your gear without being arbitrarily punished. I don't think there's anything wrong with carrying a few pieces of gear to help through tough situations but not to use in general play; removing a stack on gear swap would punish something that doesn't seem remotely exploitative.

Here's another example. You're a DH, doing a loot run in Inferno Act 1 in hopes of getting more survivability so you can finally wander into Act 2, and progress a bit. You find a truly amazing bow - 1600 dps, 800 life on hit, +80% crit damage, three sockets, +200 resist all, kittens jump out of your monitor and cuddle with you whenever you shoot it, the works. That truly amazing bow... proceeds to sit in your stash until the run is over, because you'd be penalized for equipping it right away. Finding a great piece of gear, and then realizing that you can't equip it right away because the game punishes you for doing so, *sucks*. This game has already had some very fun stuff stripped out of it for the sake of stopping an abusive few; destructible objects give shitty loot, MF doesn't work on chests, and so on. More legitimate play being punished because some people are doing things in unintended ways would be terrible.

Next up, misinterpretation of problems. This is a smaller point than the above, but it's worth mentioning. A lot of people hate on gear swapping into MF stuff, which is good, because gear swapping sucks. But I think some of them don't really grasp why it sucks. There's nothing wrong with twinking a bit to get better loot. The problem with gear swapping is that it is *tedious and unfun*, and even the people who do it agree with this. Gear swapping would be perfectly okay if it wasn't such a giant pain in the ass to do, slowing down play and generally being annoying.

And that brings me to my first possible solution: a gear swap button. You have two gear loadouts in your inventory, and can switch between them instantly with the tap of a single button. Anything you're wearing right now that the other set doesn't have a replacement for stays equipped. The tedium of gear swapping is gone, and the game stays fast and fun to play.

Personally, though, I think this is a bandaid on a bullet wound; I consider magic find on gear to be a bad mechanic in general. I think a more ideal solution would be to reroll the MF stat on all gear that currently has it into something else, and then give Nephalem Valor a comprehensive rework. Have it apply at all levels, through all difficulties. Change the number of stacks you can have, and how much MF and GF each stack grants, and adjust the secondary rewards (like the current guaranteed rare from elites and two rares from bosses).

So, yeah. Those are my thoughts. Discuss?",Discussion,False,self,t5_2qore,False,secrettome,,True,t3_vz3mw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vz3mw/removing_nv_stacks_on_gear_swap_is_a_bad_solution/,

And because it is rather large, I've attached a PDF version for you to more easily read through: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/71014109/Darkie%27s%20tiny%20guide.pdf

Because of the seemingly lacking wikis and already outdated, Brady's guide, I have decided to make a little go-to guide to elite and champion pack affixes you will encounter in the world of sanctuary, hopefully also providing you with some guidelines on how to deal with them.

As a disclaimer, this guide might have a few errors that will make you bang your head over, and does have a little bit of a ranged bias, since I have two level 60 Wizards (don't ask). (ok, if you're really curious, I've answered a couple of times in the thread already)

Now that I'm re-reading through it, I'm noticing quite a few typos and repetitions. I kinda wrote this in a few hours straight and threw it straight up on reddit, so I'm sorry for the glaring grammar and spelling errors I have made. 

---------------------------
Now then, let's start with the basics:

Monster affixes are certain attributes that any special monster pack may possess. These abilities are piled upon the already existing inherent abilities of the monster along with a healthy HP boost.

--------------------------

There are two kinds of special monster packs:

1. **Rares (Elites):** They appear with a yellow glowy model that is much larger than standard and have various minion monsters around them. They have the highest HP boost of all the special types (affixes not included) while the minions have the least. The Rare monster's minions do not have to be the same type as he is. You may find a caster cultist type Rare with hellion minions, for instance. It always makes sense in the fact that the minions are either of the same type or are typically found along with the said monster type that the Rare is. There are certain affixes that the Rare will not transfer to his minions, but we'll get to that later. You can see what affixes have transferred to each minion by mousing over it (under his health bar up there).

2. **Champions:** They typically appear as 3-4 equally strong mobs with a blue glowy, rather large, model (smaller than rares though). Champion packs have less of a primary target, and have certain abilities that gives them a team-worky vibe. Killing one of the group will diminish their killing power immensely, giving you ample reason to single them out and try to separate them. Many champion only affixes will only work if the champions are within range of each other, hence why it is a viable tactic to separate them.

There is a third kind of monster: The Unique monster. These monsters do not clearly show their affixes, but they seem to always have the same ones every time you meet them. I will not go into these much because they do not give you the Nephalem Valor buff, and are actually rather easy to deal with (even end act bosses fall here) compared to a bad combination Rare or champion pack because of their comparatively low HP and fixed abilities.

There are 25 monster affixes that may appear on a monster pack. Of these, depending on the difficulty you are in, a certain number is chosen randomly on each pack. In normal mode you will always get one single affix, in nightmare 2 affixes, in hell you'll get 3, and finally, in inferno mode, you'll always get 4 affixes on a pack. 

Not all of the 25 affixes can affect both types of monsters. Some are champion-specific, some only the Rare with its minions, while some will only affect the Rare itself but not its minions.

-------------------------------
Here are the 25:

* **Arcane Enchanted:**

Arcane Enchanted mobs are easily recognizable by the purple orbs they create ocassionally. These orbs will activate after a few seconds sending a beam in a random direction (the beam appears instantly when it activates), which will then proceed to revolve around the orb clockwise or counterclockwise dealing high arcane damage to any unfortunate trespasser. The beam lasts for about a full revolution before it dissipates. This ability can appear on any mob pack, and typically the orbs will be cast at the same time by all the monsters in the pack. Plus, they do arcane damage and are resistant to arcane damage, but that doesn't actually affect the incoming damage very much for some reason.

It is a good idea to move well away of an orb when you see it, as it may very well spawn the beam right through you when it activates, killing you instantly if you're running a glass cannon build with low resists. This ability is much harder to deal with in tight quarters, and it does enough damage that it is always worth getting out of its way, even as a tanky melee. Because of their random direction rotation behaviour, some orbs may create scissoring beams in situations where you cannot get out of the way effectively.

In the case where you have to go through a beam, popping a damage mitigation cooldown is a good idea, as well as passing through it in the opposite direction of its spin cycle or trying to move quickly somehow. The damage ticks very quickly, so the less contact you have with the beam, the better. This goes without saying, but don't touch the orb itself.

*Note:* The affix ""Enchanted"" does not, in fact exist. It is just a myth. Just FYI.

* **Avenger:**

Avengers (not to be confused with THE avengers) can only be champion packs. As each member of the pack dies, the remaining monsters become larger, do more damage with their attacks and also seem to move faster. The end result is a last champion in a pack who is much bigger than even a rare version of the mob, and can often seem quite intimidating (even quill rats seem scary when it's as large as an unburied). 

Note: The champions who get the avenger buff also glow with some kind of inner fire.

The best way to deal with this affix is to try to deal as much damage as possible to all the members of the pack in question before taking them down. The extra damage gained from the buff is substantial, so taking all members down quickly and painlessly is a viable tactic. If you cannot do that, be careful with the last few members of the pack, as they will pack a wallop. 

At least there is a bright side to this, the law of mass dictates that the mass of an object dramatically increases the force of impact when said object collides with the ground, and with how big the mobs are, the impact made will mean, quite literally, the mob's innevitable defeat. In other words, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.

*dan_au: A note on the Avenger affix - it does fade away after some time*

* **Desecrator:**

Desecrator mobs, aside of having an awesome affix name, also gain the ability to create lava-like void zones under the player character. These zones take a few seconds to activate after they appear, giving you a good window of opportunity to move out of the way. When active, the pools of poop hurt like a frenzied kitten you grabbed by the tail. You can see you're actually sitting in the void zone because a skull debuff icon appears next to your resource globe.

Dealing with this kind of packs is again a question of positioning. Minions cast desecration too, quickly filling the area with pools of crap, so keep moving back the way you came while whittling away at them. It goes without saying that combinations of desecration with jailer and waller suck donkey arse, so keep your hand on that escape skill hotkey. 

The damage done by the pools themselves is physical, mind you.

* **Electrified:**

Electrified mobs are recognizable by being the less scary cousin of the MSLE mobs from D2 LoD. Hitting one of these mobs will shoot charged bolts in random directions around the mob itself, most likely electrocuting a melee character. The damage the bolts of lightning do isn't as acute as it was in the nightmares induced by the D2 hardcore deaths from their cousins, but it's not something to sneeze at later on either. It's one of the easier affixes to take care of in combination with other affixes, simply because it only means you take some additional damage while attacking the mob.

The damage is not spiky, it's not even really worth avoiding it if you have good resists. The minions of an electrified rare will also shoot thunder bolts. The monster also deals a bit of additional lightning damage and has a bit of lightning resists, but again it isn't that big a deal. 

There is a nasty situation you do not really want electrified in, and that is the combination with vampiric. Each of the bolts that hit you will heal the enemy, so the fight may devolve into a fight for attrition.

* **Extra Health:**

Extra Health have 50% more health than is usual for an elite/champion pack. That means they take about 50% longer to kill. According to meme sites they're a bit more than Russian.

This can prove a pain to deal with for tanky builds in inferno because you have to whittle away at it 50% more, which brings you that much closer to the enrage timer. While the affix itself isn't as interesting as the others, it plays annoyingly ""well"" with other damage mitigation affixes, like shielding and invulnerable minions. Add to that the fact that the mob in question may be one with high base health, like an unburied, with an inherent knockback or shield (like the corrupted angels) and you get a pack you'd rather not fight.

Because it's such a boring affix, I have no real tips to give you to kill them with. Just do your usual for about 50% more time. Wish it had 50% extra loot for the effort. 50%.

1346017361.0,430,self.Diablo,yvckd,Was Diablo 2 REALLY that perfect?,killswitch1968,915,485,502,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/yvckd/was_diablo_2_really_that_perfect/,"I wanted to post this before 1.04 came out, so I hope it's still timely. Diablo 2 is a really old game, and I think some people wax nostalgic through some very rosy glasses. For those of you that played it I'm sure you remember all this bullshit, and those of you that didn't will probably gawk in amazement at what we put up with. I still really liked Diablo 2, but I want to remind people it had some seriously stupid stuff in it you may have forgot.

1. You had a stash but it was HALF the size of ONE page of our current stash. Yes, multiple character could have their own stash and you could make unlimited characters, but that meant you needed tons of characters that were just mules for carrying gear. You would literally need a specific naming convention of each mule to remember what was in each stash.

2. Obviously this meant no shared stash between characters. If you wanted to transfer something you had to either get a friend or do a very risky game transfer - Create a game, drop the item on the ground, then rejoin it with the character in question and pray it's still up and you don't get disconnected.

3. Imagine in Diablo 3 every time you died you lost 20% of all of your gold. Just instantly gone. Any gold you picked up since being in town was 100% gone unless you could get to your body again. This meant gold was completely unreliable as a method of storing wealth, so it became a completely worthless resource except for repair bills which were admittedly paltry. 
In later levels you'd also lose 20% of whatever Paragon level you were grinding. Awesome.
4. The need to store gear was exacerbated by the lack of a common currency (see point 3). All kinds of different units were used to price out items - SoJs, Pskulls, runes, PGems, there are pages and pages of forum posts intricately detailing the market rate of various items because gold had no value. It was a mess.

5. Imagine in Diablo 3 if you died you were LITERALLY naked until you could locate your corpse and get your gear back, through the same monsters that had just killed you when you were FULLY geared.

6. ""Hit Recovery"" was an actual affix on an item. If a mob hit you hard enough it did a kind of 'mini' stun where you couldn't walk or attack, just grunt and sort of stutter. As if it wasn't bad enough you just took a bunch of damage you also get stunned despite the mob not actually having the ability to stun you. Fun times.

7. You think pubs are bad in Diablo 3? In D2 there was no independent drops. The only thing that was equitably shared was the most worthless thing in the game, gold. That means the moment a legendary or rare dropped it was a free for all to pick it up. At the last sliver of the bosses health EVERYONE just huddles around the boss praying they get the drop when he dies. And, *I am convinced this is a little joke Blizzard intentionally coded*, EVERYONE had a tiny bit of lag as soon as the boss died. Even people on powerful computers had this and it was frustrating as hell to kill this boss then not even SEE the loot fly out because by the time you're resynced some guy has already collected everything.

8. No authenticators.

9. Let's talk about the ""Stamina meter"". In Diablo 2 you could Run or Walk. Guess how popular ""walking"" was. But it's not that simple. After running for a certain time your character 'got tired' and you became FORCED to walk until you 'recover' your stamina. They even put in an entire stamina shrines that let you run as much as you wanted till it ran out. A whole shrine just so you don't have to watch your character limp along the battlefield.

10. Ya Phase beasts suck, but Diablo 2 had worse mobs. Imagine if Fallen Maniacs moved even faster than they do now, explode far quicker, and explode EVEN IF YOU KILL THEM. D2 had that. Now imagine Act 2 Constructs, but double their range allowing them to attack off screen, and have them to whiz around the map and have that stun effect as mentioned in point 6. Oh and the attack penetrates through multiple people. There was nothing funnier than watching an entire 6 man party zone into the final area and see nothing but ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!""

11. Your resistances capped out at 75% unless you had these really expensive legendaries that let you go beyond that. And having max resist just let you survive those same Black Souls an extra second longer before dying.

12. People seem to love that you could level up your own dex, vit, str, and int. In principle it sounds neat, but literally every build recommended the following: ""Put all your points into vitality except what's required to wear this recommended gear."" Diablo 2 didn't have level requirements for gear, it required you had certain stat thresholds. Just to be dicks Blizzard created an item called ""Wizardspike"" and then required you dump like 25 points into dexterity to use it as a wizard.

13. No respeccing. Have fun when a patch botches your character. Just to screw over people who were new to the game, just about every low level skill was garbage late game, so anyone that put more than 1 point into it would get screwed in late nightmare/early hell. It got better when synergies were introduced but still, one wrong click and you were stuck with it.

14. You had followers in Diablo 2 that had the same archetypes as D3, with 2 exceptions: They had no personalities, and when they died it cost you 40,000 gold to resurrect them. They were at least as brainless as the current followers.

15. Unsocketing items was a laborious and expensive procedure. Gems only went up to 'perfect'. They later released ""runes"" (completely different than D3 runes) which are more similar to the current gem system now, except you couldn't combine runes to get the upper tier runes. You just had to pray to god that these would drop in game. The odds of this were on par with the lottery. I had 2 level 90 characters. I never saw any of the top 10 runes drop ever. 

16. Most items took up 3 grid squares in your inventory. A lot were up to 6, and some even used 8 squares. See point 1 again.

17. Diablo 2 had a RMAH too, but back then we just called it Ebay.

18. Because there was no auction house, everything had to be done by sitting in the Trade Channel either spamming stuff yourself or watching the spam from another person. Then you had to go into a game and use a trade window identical to the one in D3. Scamming was RAMPANT.

19. When Diablo 2 first came out, all sets and legendaries were the equivalent of item level 40 and below. Drop rates for i lvl 50-60 were 10%, and 60+ i lvls were just 5% in ""Inferno"" difficulty. And even then everyone just wanted rares because the legendaries/sets sucked. It was only later that they released legendaries/sets that were actually good. (Sound familiar? Not that it excuses Blizzard for making the same mistake twice. At least this time they didn't require an expansion pack.).

20. Gems/Runes didn't stack. You can imagine how ridiculous point 1 gets.

21. You had no innate town portal ability. You had to find a stupid scroll and use that to go back to town. The drops were frequent but it didn't change the fact that if you forgot to buy them or they didn't drop you were stuck. The only nice thing was that it was instant cast.

22. You had no innate ability to identify items except for finding these scolls like in point 21. That said, Deckard Cain could identify everything in your inventory instantly. I have to admit, this was pretty sweet. Fuck you Magdha.

23. Combining gems was far worse in Diablo 2. Each gem had to be individually selected, dropped into a little box in your inventory, then you can click combine. Then you have to click the new gem from the box, take it out, and select 3 other gems to repeat the process. The only good thing was that it was free, but just a royal pain in the ass.

24. 2 words: Maggot Lair. Imagine a 3 level dungeon with corridors that can fit no more than one person with no clipping allowed. Now fill that dungeon with monsters that can replicate, and put in a few doors that glitch and won't open. Now make it required to finish Act 2.

25. Act 2 had a final Boss that had an 'aura of freeze', meaning you moved and attacked at half your rate. He also hit like a truck and could stun. And as soon as you entered the room there was always a bit of a lag meaning by the time you knew what was going on you were either dead, or almost dead and unable to escape.

26. There was a mob in Act 4 that could cast thorns. This spell reflected something like 500% damage, but for melee only. It could INSTANTLY kill a barbarian before he even realized he was debuffed. It took 11 patches before it was fixed.

27. The PVP system in Diablo 2 everyone pines for was basically you clicking on a little button in the party window that turned on friendly fire. There wasn't any arenas, CTF, or anything. Just guys running around trying to kill each other. This was still far better than Diablo 1, where friendly fire was ALWAYS on, and if a monster killed you you dropped ALL YOUR GEAR. It was almost a blessing you could hack your entire character and get whatever gear you wanted.

28. MF switching, Bots, Spammers, Scammers, Griefers, ya, that all existed in 1999, don't worry.

29. You know how molten enemies explode in Diablo 3 on death after a few seconds? Well, Diablo 2 had that too. Except they explode instantly. And frozen enchanted monsters also exploded. Instantly.

30. Potions didn't stack. You had 4 slots for potions and that was it. Wearing certain belts would increase the number of potions per slot to up to 4, meaning a total of 16 glass bottles clinking around your waist but beyond that it would start taking up inventory space. 

**TL DR,** Diablo 2 was an awesome game but had a bunch of highly annoying game mechanics people forget about!",,False,self,t5_2qore,1346017676.0,,monk-europe,True,t3_yvckd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/yvckd/was_diablo_2_really_that_perfect/,
1342991776.0,423,self.Diablo,wzd1b,Compiled List of End-Game Ideas,bravetarget,542,119,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wzd1b/compiled_list_of_endgame_ideas/,"This is a compiled list of ideas (focused on level 60) that the community has thought of and discussed a lot over the last couple months.  Trust me, it's a good read!

**1.) Endless Dungeon**


*This one is pretty self-explanatory, but to add detail and incentive, mobs should eventually move to higher mLvls beyond 63 the further you go, this is to prevent someone who can easily handle any level 63 situation to not just endlessly go deeper (See Idea #7 for added difficulty).  A higher mLvl should also give higher drop rates of iLvl 63.  Additionally, each level should be small but still very random.*



**2.) Defense Mode**


*Not just a special event located somewhere, but where huge (like, really big) waves of monsters come to you instead of you always going to them. And you defend Tristram or something. Could be awesome and gives us something else to test our equipment/specs against aside from lvl 63 elite packs.*



**3.) Expand on Crafting**



*With the current crafting system you're just turning useless blues/rares into more (mostly)useless rares.  It's a very black &amp; white system and has absolutely no depth to it.  In Diablo 2 (sorry for referencing old games) they had the horadric cube which contained tons of random recipes that you could transmute with it.  Not only that, but there were Rune words and other things to create a more or less specific item.  Diablo 3 has literally nothing similar to the cube or rune words.*


*There needs to be more recipes that work similar to the staff of herding. Make account bound materials that you have to find, and here is the most important part: it has to be worth it! Keep in mind I'd much rather spend 50 million gold crafting something for myself with items I found myself rather than dropping 50 million gold on an item some lucky 12 year old found and put on the AH. You might think this is a little MMOish of a suggestion, but I say otherwise. If it's fun and gives us something other than the typical item hunt (endless elite pack killing) then why not?*


**4.) A Rewarding Item Hunt with more Legendaries**



*It's clear the reward for time invested into item hunting is verrrry low.  Not only are you feeling very unrewarded, but you are making little to no progress while doing so.  In essence, most players gain nothing by hunting for items in Diablo 3.*

*There are numerous ways to fix this without throwing off the balance of things.  For instance, giving the player a %0.000001 increased chance to find a legendary for every 1,000XP gained.  Then, when a player does find a legendary item, the bonus % resets back to 0.  This would not only reward you for playing in both long and short sessions, but also make wiping out huge waves of trash mobs actually mean something.  You would log out of Diablo 3 knowing that the next time you log on, you actually have a better chance at finding a special item than before.  Additionally, they could make it so every 250,000XP gives you a NV stack and then we can utilize the big empty XP bar at lvl 60 to track some sort of progress.*



**5.) Free Roam Mode**


*I'm not exactly sure why this wasn't included in the release build, but basically Inferno should work differently than other difficulties in the aspect of once the quest is completed you no longer have to go back and re-do it.  And ALL the bosses, enemies and waypoints that you've discovered are up and active on each new game.  This would include going between acts.  It might be strange trying to setup public games to work with free roam mode, but a possible fix is to just have the host select which boss they are on and players can join based on the current boss selected.*



**6.) Hardcore Duels (Spectating/Betting)**



*I realize PvP may not be out for some time, but when it does players should be allowed to duel with their Hardcore characters and there should be an entire lobby dedicated to browsing the current hardcore duels being setup between level 60 characters.  The way I imagine this should work is each hardcore duel should have a ""preparation"" period, where other players willing to spectate have a chance to see the upcoming duel listed in the lobby, and join it.  There could even be gold bets that players can make while the prep period is in session.  In order to keep from fixing the fights, the fighters should be matched up to anonymous competitors in a queue.*


*I mean, how awesome would that be to spectate hardcore duels?  Look through the lobby and see ""Wizard vs Barbarian - 5 mins left in prep"".  Join the 1,000 other spectators already in there, then place 10 million gold on the Wizard after inspecting each players gear.  Once the fight starts, everyones blood is pumping -- especially the fighters and the high rollers.  Then the Barbarian slaughters the Wizard who is now forever dead with all her gear surrounding her body on the ground for the Barbarian to choose from, and you're out 10 million gold.  I honestly feel like this would breath so much life into the longevity of Diablo 3.  Not to mention, collecting Hardcore player's Ears would be the most noble of achievements proving you farm for items like a real man.*


**7.) Insane Mode**

*Give every trash monster one random affix.  This could possibly apply to Bosses as well?  I just think it would be amazing to gather up a huge wave of monsters and see how many roll fire chain.  There are just too many fun possibilities to summarize here, but essentially, this mode would really take advantage of all the cool affixes that Blizzard designed.*



**8.) Champion Levels**



*This is a popular one that's been thrown around a lot.  I think this would make the biggest impact on rewarding gameplay post-lvl 60.  How I understand it should work, is after you hit level 60 you begin gaining XP towards champion levels.  These levels max out at 40 and are reset every 6 months.  The reason for the reset is to give a global Ladder and throw some competition in the mix of things.  Each Champion level you gain gives you a certain perk for your character or account.  These perks aren't necessarily going to make your guy more powerful than the guy who is still at champion level 1, but they will give you benefits such as:*


-Faster Town Portal/Identify casting

-Repair cost discount

-Shorter respawn timer

-Start new games with 1 NV stack

-Allow more than one follower to tag along

-An unlimited Healing Potion

-A helper picks up gold for you

-Access to stash from anywhere

-Mobile salvage option ([Nephalem Cube](http://www.diablowiki.net/images/f/f6/Nephalem-cube-tooltip.jpeg))

-Mobile vendor option ([Cauldron of Jordan](http://www.diablowiki.net/Cauldron_of_Jordan))

-Monster affixes are visually indicated above their head

-Vanity particle effects (smoke/fire/light/etc) surround your character

-Lower cooldown for Skill Swapping

-Enemies show on minimap

-etc.

*And again, you would lose all your champion levels (including perks) when the ladder resets.*

1339937618.0,425,self.Diablo,v6d79,"A Story from the Early Days of SC2 (Or: How I learned to stop worrying, and start waiting for a patch to come out before complaining about balance issues)",flagbearer223,708,283,363,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v6d79/a_story_from_the_early_days_of_sc2_or_how_i/,"A while ago in the game Starcraft 2, there was a massive change to a unit called Infestors.  I'm not sure if you've played the game or not, but some of the people that will read this won't have played the game, so I'll explain it as if you've never played.

Back before this patch, Infestors play a relatively small, but still important role.  They were expensive spellcasters for the Zerg, and they were mainly used for controlling positioning in a battle.  Infestors had two abilities which let them do this: Fungal Growth and Neural Parasite.  Fungal Growth would freeze a group of units for 8 seconds and do a, for all intents and purposes, negligible amount of damage over those 8 seconds.  Neural Parasite is a spell that gives you control over a unit for a few seconds (something like 12), then gave it back to your opponent.

Now, a while ago, Blizzard announced that they would be halving the freeze time of Fungal Growth, but boosting the base damage slightly, and giving bonus damage vs Armored units.  **Everyone** on /r/starcraft started freaking out about how useless Infestors would be.  Infestors were losing 50% of their effectiveness as CC units.  Now, instead of being able to hold groups of enemy units in place for 16 seconds, they could only do it for 8.  They became essentially useless for the role that they had fallen into, and pretty much everyone on /r/starcraft thought that they would become useless and would just become another Hydra (a Zerg unit that is basically useless except for in very specific circumstances).

So what happened?

The exact opposite.  These days, if a Zerg is playing in a professional SC2 match that goes beyond 15 minutes, you're going to see at least 3 or 4 Infestors on the field, and usually twice that number.  Infestors became killing machines, and there were two main reasons behind it.  The main reason that they became ""killing machines"" was the reduction from 8 to 4 seconds for the DoT/CC of Fungal Growth, which meant that the DPS of it had been doubled.  This meant that Terrans were no longer able to heal their units with Medivacs faster than Infestors were able to deal damage, which meant that Infestors now finally had a significant use against Terran.  A single infestor could kill a group of ~12 marines if they were clumped up in the correct way, and they usually were.

The second reason was the increase in damage against Armored units.  Zergs (and everyone else) were being absolutely trounced by this thing called the Protoss Death ball.  It was basically a bunch of middle &amp; end game Protoss units that were clumped up and attack-move'd towards an enemy, and for a while it was considered basically unbeatable.  This is a bit subjective, but I personally believe that the Infestor change is what killed the Death Ball as being standard metagame.  This is because most units in the Deathball were armored, and those that weren't were easy to kill once the armored ones were dead.  Because of the buff to armored damage, Zergs just had to land a couple of nice fungals to basically reduce the health of the enemy army to ~50%, and while it wouldn't be easy to win from that position, it was very much in the realm of possibility (which was an improvement over what was going on pre-patch).

So what's the moral of the story?  Blizzard isn't full of idiots.  At least in SC2, they make balance changes **only** when they have enough *quantitative* data to basically prove to them that a balance change must be made, and then they test it out ad-nauseam to ensure that it was the change they wanted.  I honestly can't see them having lower standards for balance changes in Diablo 3, and I think everyone is overreacting.  That said, I will admit that Blizzard does make some bad decisions every once in a while, but that doesn't mean that every single Blizz balance change should be met with as much anger as the /r/Diablo community has been showing.

**tl;dr:  People freak out about pretty much every balance change that Blizz makes, and pretty much every balance change that Blizz makes ends up making a decent amount of sense.  Wait for the patch to come out, try it out yourself, then make angry posts if you feel it's justified.**

**EDIT**:  To everyone saying that I need to stop ""telling them to not complain,"" you're entirely missing my point.  I'm ***not*** saying don't complain.  In fact, please do, it's good for the game!  I'm saying *wait* until you better understand and have tested the changes rather than acting like any of us can predict the exact outcome (because, honestly, we can't).

**EDIT 2**:  To everyone saying ""They're nerfing our damage,"" Blizz is also nerfing Inferno in general.  Keep that in mind.",,False,self,t5_2qore,1339961816.0,,monk-americas,True,t3_v6d79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v6d79/a_story_from_the_early_days_of_sc2_or_how_i/,
1348594941.0,423,self.Diablo,10gktu,A guide to the Infernal Machine (with pictures!),Fleme,505,82,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/10gktu/a_guide_to_the_infernal_machine_with_pictures/,"I do realize that there already are several guides (and videos) going around with info on how to combine the Infernal Machine. I ran a few tests on the droprates and hopefully my input here can be of some help.

**Post has been updated, see [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/10gktu/a_guide_to_the_infernal_machine_with_pictures/c6ddpwd)!**

**The Keys**

There are 4 keywardens you need to defeat in order to be able to assemble Infernal Machines although the one in Act 4 is someone you won't need to revisit for each machine as he's the one that drops the plan for it. Additionally, in order to be able to combine the machines, you will need a level 10 Artisan (Blacksmith). The combiining itself costs 12,000 gold.

I ran a few test runs to see about the droprates of the keys and noticed a pattern. I tried at MP7 without 5NV and found that at least on the first kills I was not getting the Keys off the wardens. I then tried at MP7/NV5 and found that the droprate still wasn't 100%. I then proceeded to test at MP9. Without 5NV I was not seeing a guaranteed drop on this difficulty either but when I got 5NV on MP9 I got a key every time. I realize that it might not be feasible for everyone to farm these at MP9 but regardless, I found that on this difficulty combined with Nephalem Valor you could get guaranteed drops.

**Act 1**

[Odeg the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/czna1.jpg) can be found in the Fields of Misery. There spawn point is entirely random - I've had him right on the waypoint, at both the entrance and the exit to the zone and a bunch of other places. Drops [Key of Destruction](http://i.imgur.com/78eQa.jpg)

**Abilities**

* Main attack is Spear Throw
* Has a triple-fireball attack
* Has Jailer

**Points of note**

If you're going on an Infernal Machine run and this key is the last one you need, you should choose the very last quest of the Act - 10. Return to New Tristram, because this is the only quest on which you can break into the Tainted Abode (more on this later).

**Act 2**

[Sokahr the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/bqn7E.jpg) can be found i the Dahlgur Oasis. Again, the position of his spawn is random. This guy drops the [Key of Hate](http://i.imgur.com/wMMsH.jpg). Again, make sure you get 5 stacks before you kill.

**Abilities**

* Sokahr is a Dune Dervish/Magewraith, so his main attack is spinning
* Has Missile Dampening on top of the natural deflection this mob type has
* Has Mortar &amp; Electrified
* Did not get a chance to find out whether or not he has other special abilities, have been in WotB every kill throughout.

**Act 3**

[Xah'Rith the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/XdSuS.jpg) can be found on the Stonefort in Act 3. Skycrown Battlements has actually been changed (I got 6 elite packs there instead of the usual 2-3) and Xah'Rith was waiting for me almost at the entrance to Stonefort. Very convenient to run, and Skycrown is actually a better zone now with the added elite density. He drops the [Key of Terror](http://i.imgur.com/ORe8M.jpg).

**Abilities**

* Xah'Rith is a Morlu Incinerator type of mob. This means he has the ability to teleport
* Instead of the Meteor Morlus usually have, he has some sort of Corpse rain.
* Has a freezing field type of attack. It doesn't freeze you like Frozen does but it will slow you down considerably.
* Has Illusionist

**Act 4**

[Nekarat the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/WpFBJ.jpg) can be found in Silver Spire level 1 and he's a huge ass. No, really. He's a terror demon type, which means he comes with the curse that mob type packs, which inflicts -75% to all healing effects for... 6-8 seconds. He drops the [Plan: Infernal Machine](http://i.imgur.com/hbfDO.jpg)

**Abilities**

* Terror Demon basic attack - frontal lightning
* Curse: -75% to healing effects
* Aoe damage over time fire attack
* Jailer
* Knockback

**Points of note**

As a barbarian I could not fight this guy face to face. I had to kite him and let sprint do the job mostly. By far the most annoying of the 4, but luckily you have to kill him only once. And remember, you still need your 5NV for this guy for a guaranteed drop and I definitely recommend it over having to do this dude several times.

**Assembly**

As mentioned, you need a level 10 Artisan Blacksmith to be able to use the [plan](http://i.imgur.com/ESm8j.jpg). When you do, you'll be able to [craft](http://i.imgur.com/L1iZK.jpg) the [Infernal Machine](http://i.imgur.com/f5cKb.jpg).

**Realm of Chaos**

As mentioned in the Act 1 part, the Realm of Chaos is found [in the house behind the healer](http://i.imgur.com/pwidA.jpg). In order to be able to break down the door, you will need to be on the 10th quest of the Act, specifically ""Return to New Tristram"". Shift-attack will break down the door. Inside, you'll find an empty room in which you can activate your Infernal Machine to create a portal to the [Realm of Chaos](http://i.imgur.com/c5KLf.jpg)/Discord/Turmoil, each of which will feature 2 bosses simultaneously.

In this example, Chaos, I faced an Uber [Ghom](http://i.imgur.com/y5p8H.jpg) and [Rakanoth](http://i.imgur.com/rqqaB.jpg), both with 88M hp and regular abilities. This was on Monster Power 9, with 5 stacks on NV and the loot was in line with that; [1 part of the Hellfire Ring](http://i.imgur.com/EWmJc.jpg).

I hope this guide helps at least someone and if you have questions, I'll try my best to answer. I don't know much about the lower difficulties, the only ones I tried this were on MP9 and MP7.

*Edit*: Added some revisions suggested by others

**Arcane Enchanted** - Monsters enchanted with Arcane Enchanted trait deal additional arcane damage and have the ability to summon orbs which fire rotating arcane beams

**Avenger** - When a Champion group imbued with Avenger arrives, the death of each group member imbues the remaining Champions with added power/size as they wreak their frenzied vengeance on the Hero

**Desecrator** - A monster with Desecrator trait creates a glowing void zone beneath the targeted hero that damages the hero. Desecration will activate a few seconds after it appears on the floor, giving you time to get out of the void zone. (Darksaiyan)

**Electrified** - A monster with the Electrified trait has higher lightning resistance, deals additional lightning damage and discharges sparks across the floor in random directions when struck.

**Extra Health** - This trait bestows the imbued monster with extra HP (+50%)

**Fast** - This makes monsters run, attack and cast magic faster.  Speed is increased by 40%, attack speed is increased by 20%, spell casting speed is increased by 10%. (KingBaconator)

**Fire Chains** - Champion backs are attached by a fire chain. The Hero suffers damage if he touches or even gets near one of the fire links.

**Frozen** - Monster with the Frozen affix can summon frost orbs that grow and eventually explode causing cold damage and applying a Chill and a Freeze debuff.  Imbued with cold resistance.

**Health Link** - Health Link reduces the amount of damage taken by the champion with that trait by linking his HP to that of all other Health Link champions in the area

**Horde** - Horde increases the squad of minions that spawn with a rare monster, crowding the battlefield

**Illusionist** - The Illusionist trait imbues a creature with the ability to create clones of itself at much lower health levels

**Invulnerable Minions** - Monsters imbued with this trait arrive with a squad of indestructible puppet minions and an expanded heath pool

**Jailer** - This trait gives monsters the ability to immobilize the Hero in a conjured prison

**Knockback** - Knockback allows monsters to push back the player a short/long distance with each connecting blow, whether it be ranged or melee. Also, slows player. (OMGBBQLOL)

**Missile Dampening** - Creatures imbued with the trait generate a reddish sphere around themselves. Any projectile entering this sphere moves 90% slower than normal

**Molten** - Monsters that spawn with this trait deal extra fire damage. In addition, they leave trailing pools of lava that deal fire damage over time. Any non-minion monster killed with this trait leaves a time bomb that will explode after 3 seconds, dealing large amounts of fire damage. Imbued with fire resistance.

**Mortar** - Monsters with mortar can lob several fireballs that deal splash damage on impact. Mortar lobs a burst of 3 fireballs towards the player, even over obstacles, but will always lob over a character in melee distance. (Darksaiyan)

**Nightmarish** - Nightmarish monsters have a chance to fear the player on hit and can be triggered from both melee and ranged attacks

**Plagued** - Monsters enchanted with Plagued leave pools of poisonous green goo around them. Imbued with poison resistance.

**Reflect Damage** - When you strike a Reflect Damage imbued foe with any attack, you suffer 20% automatic damage in return

**Shielding** - This trait gives the monster a brief period of invulnerability to all forms of damage.  Shielding mobs have green glow around them before they activate the shield. (Darksaiyan)

**Teleporter** - Gives the monster the ability to teleport to a nearby location

**Waller** - Monsters with Waller can summon earthen walls between the player and the monster, or sometimes behind the player to prevent escape. Waller mobs are different between elites and champions. Elite (boss with minions) create a box around the players to keep them in a general area, while champion packs create single walls in front or behind the player. (Darksaiyan)

**Vampiric**- This trait allows monster to (figuratively) feast on the damage they inflict to you by turning it into health for themselves

Major credit goes to [microxerox](http://www.reddit.com/user/microxerox) for spotting the song in the first place.


In the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/) there was much talk over the validity of this ARG, and whether or not it was just an Easter egg, glitch, or just a very coincidental event. There were a few main points made on this topic:

#1. ""The reflection is just a graphical glitch""

Thanks to [JpDeathBlade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s8b1p?context=3), and his handiwork with games, we can confirm that this is theoretically highly unlikely to be a glitch. Additionally, the sheer number of coincidences is too staggering to write it off as a glitch.

[SauciestBoss](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s9wfe?context=3) did some thinking on how the reflection could be replicated. His theory has yet to be tested. 

#2. ""If there were a secret level hidden in the game, it would have already been datamined and its assets examined""

This is the biggest issue, as in essence, it is fairly true. However, a [spoiler]cow[/spoiler] model *was* found in the files, and other various unused things were found. (spoiler is just for people who don't want to be potentially exposed to what this *might* lead to.)

[JpDeathBlade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s7qxp) has a good post on this.


Additionally, even if this is a wild goose chase and we are just being silly, if this gets enough publicity, Blizzard might add it in, much like the cow level rumors of Diablo 1 and 2.

It seems that the translations used in the original thread were not completely accurate, according to some French speaking users.


[Here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~echew/projects/ChineseMusic/concert/gaspard.html) are the poems, written in their original French language by [Aloysius Bertrand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Bertrand). There is, conveniently, a line by line translation to English right next to their French counterparts.


The main thing that started all this was the consistency Ondine had with the following pictures:

Our main goal at the moment is to replicate the picture of the reflection in the river. If it has been replicated and screenshotted, it will be linked to  -here-.


Here are the songs that accompany them. It is all actually one song, called [Gaspard de la Nuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit). Gaspard de la Nuit is old French for ""The Devil"":

All games are susceptible to botting, but Diablo especially so, and I think it's important to put the issue in the spotlight so that it gets the attention it deserves (from Blizzard).  Generating this amount of gold on a steady and constant basis -- on a massive scale from the large number of players assumed to already be using such programs -- is a huge concern for the economy and longevity of D3.

Bots ran rampant in D2 (absolutely destroying the game for anyone who refused to use one), but that was a different era with a different Blizzard.

Very important for Monks and Barbarians. For 1H weapons, can increase price by a huge factor. Sort by DPS with life on hit to figure out how to price.

**Cold damage bows/xbows**

Cold damage causes skills that don't have a particular damage type to slow mobs, which is very useful for kiting as a Demon Hunter. Can add a lot of value to a weapon. Sort by DPS with ""Bonus to cold damage"" to figure out price.

**All resist + Any resist**

Monks have a passive that sets all their resistances to their highest resistance. It makes sense for them then to go for gear that has All + Poison/lightning/cold resist exclusively, to max their overall resistances. So while All+Physical/Arcane will be in high demand by all, All+Poison will be in high demand by Monks who decided to go for max poison. So if you get a +70 RA + 55 Poison resist with Dex and Vit shoulder for example, it should sell for much more than an equivalent item with no Poison resist. Might take a bit of time to sell since there aren't that many Monks with a lot of gold who happen to choose poison/cold/lightning spec.

**+Armor**

Many people ignore but it is a very important attribute. Especially for Barbarians because they have a lot of +Armor% skills. To figure out price put in the other modifiers and sort by Armor in order to compare.

**Magic Find %**

Some people don't realize how valuable this is. It's very valuable. The max MF value is 20% for all slots except Amulets (40%). 20%/40% blues will sell well, and any yellow with 18%/34%+ will sell for much more than an equivalent piece without.

**Sockets**

Sockets add a ton of value to every item. Their value also increases slowly as people get higher tier gems. Consider each socket to be worth at least +50 of any stat.

Cross post from r/diablo3.",malfore,522,121,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/sqhuw/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/,"I submitted this to the diablo3 subreddit but I think it's been eaten by the spam bot.  Just thought I post it here as well in case anyone likes lore.  

I wanted to start at the beginning so that people will get an overall understanding of how the mortal world came to be and to get a better understanding of what is happening in the subsequent Diablo I, II and III.  I didn’t read all the novels and books so some of this might be inaccurate.  Feel free to correct me if I'm saying anything that isn’t true, but for the most part it should give everyone an idea of how things came to be.  


There are basically three worlds in the Diablo Universe, The High Heavens, Burning Hell, and the mortal world known as Sanctuary.  In the beginning, Sanctuary did not exist and neither did humans.  There was only the High Heavens and Burning Hell.  The two worlds battled each other endlessly for control in what is known as the Great/Eternal Conflict.  This war has lasted since the beginning of creation, and while each side would gain the advantage every now and then, it has pretty much been a stalemate.   


The burning hell was lead by the three Prime Evils, [Diablo](http://i.imgur.com/PisZV.jpg) and his two brothers Baal and [Mephisto](http://i.imgur.com/1kK78.jpg).  The High Heavens was lead by the Angiris Council, a group of very powerful Archangels.  There was 5 total.  They are:

•	[Tyrael - The Archangel of Justice (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/uN76t.jpg)   
•	[Auriel - The Archangel of Hope (Female)](http://i.imgur.com/izYCc.jpg)  
•	[Malthael – The Archangel of Wisdom (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/DQHx0.jpg)  
•	[Imperius – The Archangel of Valor (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/N9m3A.jpg)  
•	[Itherael – The Archangel of Fate (Sexless, neither male or female)](http://i.imgur.com/FEJ9q.jpg)


There was one more powerful Archangel that acted as an advisor to the Angiris Council, and his name was [Inarius](http://i.imgur.com/gEsTL.jpg) (Male).  Inarius was tired of the endless conflict with neither side able to win decisively.  He longed for a more peaceful world where there wouldn’t be constant conflict.  He gathered other Angels and Demons who felt the same way and created Sanctuary, the mortal world.  Using the powers of Worldstone that he stole, Inarius hid the presence of Sanctuary from Heaven and Hell.    


Humans were the off springs of Angels and Demons that lived in Sanctuary and were very powerful at first.  The first generations of humans were known as Nephalem, and had the potential to be even more powerful than either Angels or Demons.  Fearing that humans would become more powerful than him, Inarius modified the Worldstone to make each generation of human weaker and weaker, draining them of their innate powers.  He wanted humans to worship him, and created a relgion/cult called the Cathedral of Light.  The Prime Evils were the first to discovered Sanctuary, and attempted to gain influence over the population and recruit them as soldiers in the Great Conflict.  Not wanting to alert the high heavens of Sanctuary's existence, they formed a religion/cult called the Triune.  Both religion recruited followers and used them for their own purpose.   


A lot more happens before the events of the first Diablo, and they are told through the “Sin War” novels by Richard A. Knaak.  Basically the humans tap into their powers to fight back against the Demon and Angels.  Inarius is eventually defeated by a human named Uldyssian, the strongest human who lead a revolt against Inarius and the Triune (cult of the prime evils).  In order to defeat Inarius, Uldyssian tapped into the Worldstone and unleashed his tremendous power, so great in fact that it was going to destroy all of Sanctuary.  Once he realized this, he sacrificed himself to save the mortal world.  This is when the Agiris Council discovered Sanctuary and what Inarius has done.  They descended into Sanctuary and were going to destroy it since they viewed it as an abomination tainted with demon blood.  After all, humans were half demon as they were the off spring of Angels and Demons.    


Of the 5 in the Agiris Council, 2 voted no to destroying Sanctuary and 1 voted yes, with Malthael, the Archangel of Wisdom abstaining from voting.  Tyrael, the last to vote, was originally disgusted by the tainted humans and wanted to destroy it.  If he had voted yes, the tie would have doomed Sanctuary for destruction.  However, after seeing Uldyssian’s sacrifice, he voted no and Sanctuary was spare.  Tyreal was so impressed by Uldyssian’s act because Uldyssian had basically become all powerful.  He would have been a god, but at the cost of his world.  Willing to give up his power and his life for the lives of so many others was extremely selfless, and it moved Tyrael.  This made Tyrael see the good in mankind, and he would come to their aid many more times as the prime evil invade their world.  I forget the reasoning of why this was done, but the events of the Sin War were erased from human minds.    


This wraps up the pre-diablo I history.  If you guys like this, I can try and do Diablo I and Diablo II as well.  I didn’t realize how long this would actually take and wanted to do all of them in one go, but it’s a little too much.  I didn’t want to do all the research/work and then realized that no one really cares about the lore.  Let me know what you think, and there is plenty of stuff out on the web as well to read through if you want to do your own research.  Leave me any questions you have and I’ll try and answer them as best as I can.  

**TL:DR - The moral world, Sanctuary was created by an Archangel Inarius and hidden from heaven and hell.  They eventually find it though, and SHIT GOT FUCKING REAL**

Legendaries are extremely rare and killing 500 packs isn't enough to have a good chance of seeing one, and no amount of kills *guarantees* that you will see one. Individual results may vary, as they say!

**Edit:** Since many people are looking at their profile's ""elite kills"" stat, please know that it tracks the number of **monsters** and not the number of **packs** you have killed. To make the math work you will have to divide your ""elite kills"" value by 3-5 or so, depending on precisely how the game tracks that statistic. Also note that 5 stacks gives you a big boost due to the extra drop per pack, but a single run will not always be at 5 stacks, so even with 300 base MF you'll be seeing legendaries less frequently than once per 84 elite packs you slay. 

- - - - - - - - - -

**OP:**

A bunch of people have been researching the shit out of MF, and have come up with some very robust results. Here's a thread with way more info than you could want: http://www.diablofans.com/topic/57939-magic-find-and-its-efficiency-a-statistical-insight/

It's all very complicated, but the take-home conclusions are quite interesting: 

* Each item an elite pack drops has about a 0.05% chance to be legendary before MF is applied, and they drop at most 5 tems (with 5 stacks of NV).

* The math thus suggests you get almost exactly 1 legendary per 500 elite pack kills with no MF and no Npehlaem Valor. 

* Upping this to 300% base MF, 75% MF from Nephalem Valor, and accounting for the extra NV drop (which can be legendary), the math suggests you will get an average of 1 legendary drop per 84 elite pack kills.  

* At max MF, Rough math suggests that if you kill most or all trash mobs, about half of your legendaries will drop from them. If you kill about a third of the trash mobs you see, it'll be more like 25%. 

* Because 5 stacks guarantees you 1 rare per elite kill, very high MF causes a MUCH greater increase in the number of legendaries you see over time than rares you see over time. At 5 stacks each rare pack gives 1-5 rares no matter what MF you have, and that minimum of 1 means MF isn't giving you a huge percentage boost in rares seen. 

* Another little known fact is that the rare you get from 5-stacks is disproportionately likely to be 4 property, and no more likely to be 5/6 property or legendary than any other drop from an elite monster. Getting an extra drop from the monster means better loot over time, but any time you see just 1 yellow item drop from an elite at 5 stacks it is MUCH more likely to be 4 property than any other yellow item. 

* Legendary items are so extremely rare that you will not see many of them no matter what MF you have. You'll also see great variation - while one per 84 packs is much more than one per 500 packs, statistically you'll still occasionally see two back to back or go much longer than the ""average"" number of elite packs inbetween kills.

1349297020.0,395,self.Diablo,10w8nn,My two cents about Diablo 3 after 400 hours played.,pedward,742,347,279,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/10w8nn/my_two_cents_about_diablo_3_after_400_hours_played/,"For a long period of time, I have been reading about how people dislike this game. How this game has so many problems, how repeating the same level over and over again is somehow less fun than every other currently existing game. I will, in this post, detail my experiences playing Diablo 3, and deal with many of the issues people are having with the game.

1. ""I dislike doing the same thing over and over again, we didn't have to do this in Diablo 2, it was so much more fun!"" 
    - Diablo 2 was the second video game I ever got into, right after Starcraft, and I don't really know which game you were playing, but after my what seemed like millionth Mephisto run with MF gear on, I can honestly say that the D3 system of champ pack hunting is much more exciting.

2. The class and build diversity is too low in D3.
   - I love the class diversity. I found it incredibly annoying to have to relevel a new character every time I wanted to try out the new ""it"" build. I like being able to experiment, tweak things, become a god based on a few changes to my build or gear. The fact that there are more skills and runes than there were in Diablo 2 makes the fact that much more fun. 

3. There's no point to play with people, I can solo faster, but I like playing with people more, HALP!
    - I play with 4 people pretty much all the time, and while there is no benefit, I find the social aspect that it adds to the game out weighs your farming efficiency. Irrevocably if you play D3 like a machine, and not to have fun slaying massive hordes of demons, you're going to have a bad time.

4. The RMAH degrades the playability of the game! I can't break into the market because I'm not willing to spend money on the game!
    - False, I farm A3 on my demon hunter with ease and I haven't spent a dime on this game. If you put in the time and make a few friends, I guarantee you will be sucessful without using the AH. With the prices the way they are, you could easily farm A3 with any class with barely 10 mil in investments. Stop whining about how you can't beat the game in five minutes with crappy gear, and start earning your keep and doing the grind the rest of us are doing. Being good takes time, I can guarantee that the people who have insane amounts of gear and high paragon levels don't get there by whining about how they can't kill stuff fast enough. They take time to understand mechanics, tweak builds and create something they can put their mark on.

5. The drop rates aren't high enough to perfectly gear my character without using the AH! This is a conspiracy by Blizzard to take my money!
    - As a person who has given a lot of money to Blizzard throughout my WoW years, and buying every single one of their released games, I can honestly say that I believe that Blizzard doesn't need your money, they were trying to make it easier for you to gear your character, and give you an outlet to try and make gold. They also put the AH in the get rid of the JSP people who caused a lot of problems in D2. The AH is a humongous quality of life improvement for me compared to Diablo 2, and I don't think the game would be as exciting without it. 

6. The items have no permanence, they can roll any stats and therefore you cannot have perfect items.
    - I personally love this, this basically means that there will never be a perfect set of gear, this will always leave me chasing more gear, will always leave me hungry for some way to get a bigger edge than anyone else has. This personally drives me, and I enjoy it.

Overall, I really just love slaying demons. If you can't enjoy mindless killing for hours on end, then this is probably not the game for you. And, from what I've found, the people that truly enjoyed Diablo 2 are the ones still playing, because there is a lot of good in Diablo 3. I believe that Blizzard did release an unfinished game, but I personally think that it was a blessing because they've been able to tailor the game over the past months to EXACTLY WHAT IT'S PLAYER BASE IS DEMANDING! No other gaming corporation in the world would do this with such rigor. They have people trolling Reddit for great ideas that would make their game more fun and playable. I personally appreciate that Blizzard gave its player base a baby to develop so that the game would be perfectly suited for the people that showed dedication and kept playing.

I think Diablo 3 is one of the most fun games I have ever played, and if you don't agree, and want to keep complaining about how when you don't put All Resist on a DH you get one shotted, or how you can't stand in desecrating and arcane beams on your character the game isn't balanced right, then get out, I don't want you on my game.

However, if you put in the time and effort to enjoy the game and theory craft, and create new ideas, stay and play with me. I don't really believe in giving my gamer tag out in posts, but PM me if you feel like this describes you, or you have a similar belief about the state of Diablo 3.

TL; DR: Stop complaining, keep farming, and KILL MOAR DEMONS!!!

edit: spelling.
Edit: Rebuttals.

I didn't ever expect this post to be such a flame fest. I didn't even expect most people would read it, but I see so many negative things about this game being posted constantly, so I thought I'd lighten to mood a little bit with some positive feedback.

Yes, I understand there are changes that need to be made, yes I understand that there is a reason people complain. My ultimate goal is to make people aware that saying something is wrong with the game is easy, actually devising something to do about it is incredibly hard. 

If I were a game dev for Diablo 3 here are the changes I would make:
1. Guild system, immediately, guild perks for MF and experience, and bonuses for completing guild achievements.
2. Make crafting an easier solution to gearing problems.
3. Get rid of Reflects Damage, honestly the laziest mechanic in the game, creates multiple balance issues, and rapes most range characters.
4. Expand abilities that are fun. For instance, nerfing the WW barbarian is bad for everyone. Cut that nerfing bug out and just buff other builds and other characters.
5. Buff monks. Honestly, I don't play a monk, but they are getting the shit end of the stick right now.
6. Add a Paragon ladder, and a PVP ranking system.
     - Add PVP as an addendum.
7. Add an endless dungeon system where monster power becomes multiplicative, or at least scaling in difficulty. For instance If I start MP 5, the next level will be MP 10, then MP 20, and then... well I doubt you would make it that far.
8. Enhance fun, stop nerfing builds that are fun, and start making new builds viable. As a demon hunter, I would like to be able to use sentries and other such things that I can be inventive with.
9. Install a gold price floor. I know many people are like ""WTF, Y U WANT MAKE GOLD EXPENSIVE?!"" I want this because when the value of gold is less than the value of a dollar, Gold auction house prices sky rocket, making it impossible for new people to buy good items. If you set the floor, you will see the economy normalize and people will be able to make a better foray into the ALREADY NERFED TO THE GROUND INFERNO difficult by affording good items.

I am not naive, I understand Blizzard is greedy, but that does not mean that the purpose of the RMAH is made for harm. As I stated, I do not, will not, and have never used the RMAH and the game flows just fine for me. That being said, I have sold many items on the RMAH for a pretty profit and even bought my fiance a Kindle Fire from my proceeds. So, is it for Blizzard profit? Yes. Should you complain about a system that lets you profit from a video game, I think not, as it is a very rare opportunity.

Peace, I'm out!

* Bosses have a 20% chance to drop Blank Keys regardless of MF and NV.
* Blank Keys + Secret Tomes + Gems + 50,000 gold can be crafted into a key, e.g.: Flawless Ametyst Key, Radiant Emerald Key, etc.
* The gem determines the type of loot profile, e.g.: Treasure Bandit loot profile, Treasure Goblin loot profile, etc. or Armor priority, Weapon priority, etc.
* The quality of the gem determines the quality of the loot, e.g.: Radiant Star = 100%-150% legendary, Flawless Square = 0.43% legendary
* Allows players to find specific legendaries, e.g.: Looking for Set Armor? Use Ruby keys (Armor priority) instead of Emerald keys (Weapon priority)
* Chest content is unaffected by MF or NV
* Legendary loot only applies to the chest opener, everyone else gets rares

Problems this addresses

* Fixes pure MF chest runs
* Creates a way for gems to leave the economy
* Adds a gold and tome sink
* At time of writing Radiant Stars are at least 14m. Stars are 650k. Flawless Squares are cheap. I might pay 650k for a 20% chance at a Legendary. I would definitely use a Flawless Square for a 1% chance at Legendary.

&gt;*BattleTag is still intended to be your big overarching account-wide identifier that will follow you from Blizzard game to Blizzard game, but individual character identity is still obviously very important.""*(http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4175360512?page=2#40)

-----

Then just recently:

&gt;**[Lylirra]** There will only be two levels of friendships in Diablo III when the game launches: Real ID friends and BattleTag friends. Character-level friendships like you have in World of Warcraft won't exist in Diablo III, so if you want to another player as a friend, you'll need to add them as a BattleTag friend or a Real ID friend.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**[random bnet question]** Will it be possible to see only ""Barbaros, Level 6 Barbarian, in a Public Game?""
&gt;
&gt;**[Lylirra]** Not really? While you'll be able to see your own character name \(and while there will be situations when other players can see your character's name, too\), your BattleTag nickname will be your primary form of identification. It's what players will see both in Public Games and most prominently in the friends list.

This one is for those people who complained about repair costs in my 100k challenge :)

---

THE RULES:

All gold and gear must be removed from the target character

Buying gear from the auction house is allowed.

Selling gear on the auction house is disallowed. (too much gold/randomness)

Full inferno clear without skipping elites. (unless they have impossible affixes)

*To all you whiners about this rule loophole, how about a 50K gold penalty if you skip a pack? Seriously, some packs are impossible.*

---

THE POINT:

A fun challenge that makes the user balance buying upgrades and spending on repairs!

---

DISCLAIMER:

May not be feasible if you are not a demon hunter, or live in Europe (or use their AH) (higher prices)

I started by farming a few hundred gold from Haile's box in hell mode. :P
 
Act I, II, III finished! Act IV tomorrow @ 5pm EDT!

There are a bunch of different posts with links on how to do various farming runs. I thought I would make a consolidation of these, and 1 spot where we can all discuss various farming locations in Inferno.

**First, the options, sorted by general gear requirement to do them:**

**1) Royal Crypt Farming:** 

http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/ufe19/inferno_gold_farming_stats_to_400khr/

**Pros**: near-zero threat of death. Easy to get access to this location. 

**Cons**: could die from boredom. No chance at getting that lottery-ticket 30 million dollar item.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-500k gold/hr

**2) Act 1, Dank Cellar:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/ue2s4/dank_cellar_farming_numbers/

**Pros**: near-zero threat of death. Easy to get access to this location. 

**Cons**: Could die from boredom. Small chance at getting that lottery-ticket 30 million dollar item.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-500k gold/hr

**3) Butcher/Warden 5-stack valor farming**:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG5ju_GuBmw

**Pros**: Low gear requirement. Still relatively easy to get access to this location. Non-repetivive (relatively speaking) farming.

**Cons**: Highly fluctuating reports of success here. I tried it and got almost entirely garbage.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-400k gold/hr, but I have a hard time believing that. This is absolutely going to drop farther as Ah gets more saturated with higher ilvl gear.

**4) A4 Aspects farming:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ueqmv/witch_doctor_act_4_inferno_zombie_bears_farming/

**Pros:** Access to top ilvl weapons here. Chance to pull in that 30 million dollar 1650 dps 2her. 

**Cons**: Could die from boredom. 30 second runs are very repetitive. Very very streaky farming. You pull in so much gear that you can flood your AH account and ""get stuck"". 

**Estimated G/hr:** 400k to 2+ million/hr. **Note:** this is very hard to estimate, since it is so streaky. You do pull in 2-3 blues every 30 sec, so the baseline G/hr just selling these is around 300-400k gold. 

**5) Siegebreaker 5-stack NV farming:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ubxat/my_barbarian_act_3_inferno_farming_guide/

**Pros**: Access to top ilvl weapons here. Chance to pull in that 30 million dollar 1650 dps 2her.
 
**Cons**: One of the hardest places to farm, you need to be in the top 1% of geared people to do this successfully. Killing lootbreaker is easy, but getting Act 3 stacks of NV can be hard, considering how many tough monsters there are, elite or not. I'm talking Pestilence (green hand of death mobs), tons of ranged mobs, dragons from the sky, tongue spitters, etc... easier as a group.

**Estimated G/hr**: 400k to 2+ million/hr. **Note:** this is very hard to estimate, since it is so streaky, similar to A4 aspects farming. You pull in more yellows in this place, but way less blues, this could make it even streakier than A4 aspects in this regard. 

[**6) Inferno Ponies**](/spoiler)


[No guide on this that I can find. You can go into the diablo room, cancel the cutscene and then the staff can be bought - no need to actually kill diablo.](/spoiler)

[**Pros**: Could be the single highest Ilvl place in the game (inferno ponies). Could be easy to do (getting 5 stack NV will be cake at least, and this is one of the biggest time sinks in NV stack farming strats.](/spoiler)

[**Cons**: may be very very hard to do, in terms of the actual pony level. Comments in this thread suggest that inferno ponies only drop ilvl 50 gear. This could be a dealbreaker, and it makes no sense to me, unless blizzard just doesn't want pony farming to be what people do, and the pony level to be ""neat"" only.](/spoiler)

[**Estimated G/hr**: Completely unknown at this point.](/spoiler)

**7) Rakanoth 5-stack NV farming**

No guide on this yet, but it is something that has been milling about in my noggen. Rakanoth has upgraded loot tables. Certain classes can kill Rakanoth fairly easily, via gimmacky builds and what have you. 

Basically you would build up a 5-stack NV buff (this could be the harder part, but as we gear up this will be easier and easier), then go kill Rakanoth. Now a preliminary question would be this..... does Rakanoth drop better loot than Siegebreaker, because this is the most obvious direct comparison to this farming strategy. If SB/Rak drop same ilvl loot, then this method would likely not be a good choice, just farm the lootbreaker pinata instead. However, if Rak drops better gear than SB, then this could actually be the best spot to get the absolute highest ilvl gear with only diablo or inferno ponies as other options. As the AH floods with A3 level rares, this could be the ""next step"". Anyone know any answers on ilvl of Rakanoth vs Siegebreaker drops?

**Pros**: Could be the one of the highest Ilvl place in the game. 

**Cons**: Massive barrier to entry. Must be able to both kill rakanoth easily and to be able to farm A4 elite packs at a reasonable rate.

**Estimated G/hr**: Unknown. This could be the next step though, if it drops high ilvl gear, and siegebreaker runs start getting less and less profitable.


**Short Personal Opinion to spark Discussion**

So feel free and go ahead and discuss your best strategies for farming. I've personally been doing the A4 aspects a lot, and making great money. However, now that prices on the AH are dropping, even getting a 1300 dps 2-her won't make a whole lot of money. It's getting to the point where you need yellows, not blues, because yellow armor will usually sell better than anything but the most insanely high rolls on weapons! Heck, even a 1450 dps 2her will net less gold than geting nice rolls on some bracers/gloves/ring/ammy, etc. 

Siegebreaker seems like the next (or actually the) best place if you want to farm gear, but is it more efficient than simple gold farming? This is a perfect transition into....

**Deflation of the AH**

Also to consider is the fact that AH values are coming down and down and down, yet the chance to get insane rolls on this gear is obviously unchanging. I predict that there will be a point where farming gear will actually not be optimal, and farming gold will be the best way to get good gear. Obviously, if a lot of people then switch to gold farming, you will get less flood on the AH, and we'd reach an natural equilibrium where the two methods are equally valid, possibly slightly favoring magic finding, since there is a higher barrier to entry for MFing.

1337169487.0,377,self.Diablo,tptnq,My spoiler free notes on the Witch Doctor after beating normal.,FrankenstinksMonster,468,91,404,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tptnq/my_spoiler_free_notes_on_the_witch_doctor_after/,"The short version:  The witch doctor is fun, powerful, and very satisfying to play.

Rather than make this a complete review that might include my build, gear, etc, I'm just going to talk 
about the interesting points.

The witch doctor's resource is not as straight forward as it seems like it should be.  I mean
its just mana right?.  The mana cost on your spells, and your total mana pool, go up every level.  This
has two effects:
1) Attributes that add mana gets less useful - this is a really minor issue
2) Your mana regeneration gets slower and slower

The second point is what I noticed.  There seems to be an expectation that you will add some mana recovery
to your build, whether its from runes or gear.  I think adding a small amount of +mana on hit will 
be sufficient for my build, even if they don't count each aoe target as a hit.

I thought locust swarm was going to suck, but paired with a slow two handed weapon, 5 stacks of soul siphon, 
and the rune that makes it spread to 2 targets it is AMAZING.  Its like setting everything
on the screen ON FIRE.  It seemed like it would jump up to 15 yards away, so enemies didn't even have to
be close or bunched up for it to work - some enemies really scatter far apart though, but I would just use 
poison dart/haunt on those.  It has great synergy with the passive that reduces enemy damage when affected 
by poison and even has decent damage per mana for bosses.  My approach to most situations was soul siphon, 
grasp of the undead, locust swarm, pick up loot.  Pepper high health enemies with haunt and add poison dart 
to taste.

The gargantuan, which I named Francis, did much better than I thought it would.  Francis only died about 
6 times on normal and most of that was to some really bad rare/champion group.  There were only two bosses 
that killed him and even then it took long enough that I could recast him.  My problem was noticing I 
needed to recast since I wasn't used to him dying.  Dogs, on the other hands, die often.  I don't see myself 
taking them without taking sacrifice.

Haunt was great for champions, rares, and bosses.  The survival passives, particulary the one that lets you 
cheat death every 90 seconds, were very useful - I never died in normal, but the cheat death
passive kicked in several times and saved me.  I did have a lot of health from vitality and +health from
orbs though (I had around 2k life at the end of normal and +450 health from orbs).

Soul siphon continued to be overpowered throughout normal, but I can see how the proximity it requires could be
a problem in latter difficulties.  At level 30 5 stacks would take my dps from 220 to 420, which was nuts.

Acid cloud was dissapointing.  I tried to make it work, but locust swarm was always much better for aoe.

Locust swarm and haunt are great for times when you can't stand still.  The short range on locust swarm sucks,
but keeping poison up for 8 seconds per cast to reduce enemy damage (with the passive) is helpful.

I played with a buddy, who played a barbarian.  He and I bought the first Diablo when it came out not knowing 
what it really was, then took 2 days off to play Diablo 2 lan style, then yesterday off to play Diablo 3.  This
game did not dissapoint.  I got bored with saying 'wow look at that' in vent after doing it for ten hours.

Also, in the 15 hours we had we only spent 3 hours not playing due to server issues, which I thought was 
pretty awesome for the release day of such a popular game.  As a final vote of confidence, if someone

Hello everyone, this is the last installment in my Diablo lore explained series.  It has been a blast and I am so glad to see so many people enjoying my work.  I hope that these threads help refresh your memories or open your minds to the exciting story behind the Diabo games as we all look forward to the D3 release.  

###Opening Cinematic

At the end of Diablo II, Act IV, our heroes had just destroyed Diablo’s soulstone and meets up with Tyrael once more.  He informs the heroes that Baal, the last remaining Prime Evil has assembled a massive army and is now making [his assault on Mt. Arreat]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ7KgW_yi3E&amp;feature=relmfu), home of the courageous barbarian tribes.  These [barbarian tribes](http://i.imgur.com/NButc.jpg) lived for the glory of battle, and were considered to be some of the fiercest warriors Sanctuary had to offer.  This is why they were tasked with the important role of guarding Mount Arreat, home of the coveted Worldstone.  

###Diablo II: Lord of Destruction – Act V

Tyrael opens a portal for our heroes to the barbarian city of [Harrogath, the Last Bastion of Order]( http://www.diablowiki.net/images/7/7b/Sanctuary_World_Map.jpg) on the slopes of Mt. Arreat.  It is here that we learn that Baal has laid waste to the Barbarian lands of the north on his way to Mount Arreat.  Destruction and suffering trails in the wake of his army, and what were once great barbarian fortresses, now lies in ruins.  Harrogath is the last Barbarian stronghold, and is currently under siege by Baal’s Army.  Many brave barbarians have died to defend the fortress, and many more die each day as the siege continues.  Shenk the Overseer, Baal’s most decorated general, is leading the siege against Harrogath.  

If not for the Druid “Spell of Warding”, Harrogath would have fallen long ago.  The Council of Elders, which comprised of the Barbarian’s wisest elders, received word that Baal’s army was coming and that many of their brethrens had failed to deter his ungodly army.  In a courageous act of selflessness and courage, they sacrificed their lives to cast the “Spell of Warding”, a warding spell that would par passage to any hell spawn, including the Lord of Destruction himself.  Only one person survived the casting of the spell, Nihlathak, who struggles daily with the guilt of being spared and the grief of his lost companions. While the spell has worked so far, it becomes weaker and weaker as the siege continues.  Even in these times of despair, the Barbarians fought on without a hint of uncertainty.  

##Siege of Harrogath

Fearing the worst however, they had no choice but to reluctantly accept the help of the seven heroes [originally there was 5 playable classes in Diablo 2, the LoD expansion added two more classes, the [Assassin](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin) and the [Druid](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Druid).  This brings us up to a total of 7 heroes] (/spoiler).  While the barbarians joined the heroes on the battlefield, they did not see them as equals, but rather as a mere distraction for the demons as the barbarians were the real warriors.  This attitude quickly changed as the barbarians’ bear witness to the ferocity that the heroes employed on the front lines.  The holy paladin, zealous in his attacks, brought justice down upon the demons spawn with his hammer over and over again.  Bolts of lightning and thunder ripped through the sky, while raging hydras of fire roared from the very bowels of earth, decimating anyone who dared to face the powerful sorceress, commander of nature’s elements.  At times, the heroes even charged into hordes of enemies that the eye could not see the end of, but always emerged victorious.  Never once did they linger to gloat in their feats of bravery, for they knew that there were many more battles to come.  They pushed on and on, down the slopes of Mount Arreat, pushing back Baal’s army, until Shenk the Overseer himself laid before them, impaled with the Amazon’s mighty arrows.  The siege of Haggorath had been broken, and Baal’s advance towards the Worldstone came to a sudden and jolting end.  Or so it seems…

##Prison of Ice

Unbeknownst to the Barbarian tribes and the heroes, a foul and treacherous plan was un-winding in the shadows.  Nihlathak, unable to handle the grief of his companion’s sacrifice and the failure of his people to defend Mount Arreat, pondered endlessly on what they could have done differently.  He concluded that there was only one way, and stuck a deal with the Lord of Destruction.  In return for Harrogath’s safety, Nihlathak will give Baal the Relic of the Ancients.  This holy totem allowed anyone who possesses it to bypass the Rite of Passage at the summit of Mount Arreat, and be granted access to the chamber of the Worldstone.   With the holy totem in hand, Baal and his army proceeded to the inner chambers of Mount Arreat, known as the Worldstone Keep. 

No one knew that this had happened, until Nihlathak and [Anya](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Anya) were found to be missing.  Anya, the daughter of one of the Council of Elders, uncovers Nihlathak’s plan.  To avoid his secrete from being reveal, Nihlathak kidnapped Anya and imprisoned her in the icy caves of the Crystalline Passage.  It is not until the heroes rescued Anya that is information is revealed (The quest to kill Nihlathak, Betrayal of Harrogath, becomes available at this point, but it is optional).

So I believe I'm at about 220 total hours played. Most of that has been spent in inferno Act I farming and more recently focused on Warriors Rest running. In those 220 hours of playing I've found legendary items but like most around here, they were craptastic.

Yesterday after about an hour of Warrior's Rest runs, my 3 year old walks up to me and asks to sit on my lap. He loves the sounds of Diablo and will sit and listen for 20-30 minutes at a time. I made mention my sound was off and he would be best to keep watching his show. He insisted he wanted to be on my lap.

Zoom ahead 10 minutes and he's now spamming my left and right click for me and just smashing around on the rare pack in WR.

I'm a 100 hour Witch Doctor player that has progressed quite a bit through Act 3 and I think, like many others, that the WD class is broken.

The class requires a lot more money than other classes to go above 60k DPS thanks to the lack of dual wielding or other overpowered properties of a class (2h + offhand anyone?), and the skillset is broken beyond repair. The main problem of this skillset is the use of mana. WDs require 3 items (ceremonial knife, voodoo mask and mojo) with a mana regen affix and the passive Vision Quest to do damage, as the primary attack of the WD **consumes** mana.

[Vision Quest](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/passive/vision-quest) is the main passive of almost every succesfull inferno build, it requires 4 skills on cooldown to increase the mana regen by 300%. This passive right here is the main flaw of the WD, a (non-broken) class doesn't need 4 skills on cooldown all the time to have a primary attack, skills should be used when a player needs them, not just to put them on cooldown.

What we get thanks that passive is that many WD players including myself use 4 or 5 skills with **cooldown**, while only half (11/22) of the WD skills have a cooldown.

Pets are a joke, the dogs get 2hit in Act1 inferno and the gargantuan gets 1hit in Act2 inferno.

Another problem of the WD is the unnecessary difficulty of kiting. For kiting WDs have [spirit walk](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/spirit-walk), the ability to break snares and run faster which has a huge cooldown compared to [smoke screen](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/demon-hunter/active/smoke-screen)  and allows you to cover a much smaller distance compared to [teleport](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/wizard/active/teleport).

The CC abilities of the WD: [grasp of the dead](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/grasp-of-the-dead) and [wall of zombies ](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/wall-of-zombies)both have a casting delay and quite a long cooldown compared to [blizzard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/wizard/active/blizzard) and [caltrops](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/demon-hunter/active/caltrops).

The best way to fix Witch Doctors would in my opinion be:

* **TRIPLE THE BASE AND AFFIX MANA REGENERATION! ** 

This clears up a passive slot and fixes the cooldown issue and makes the other half of the skills for 4 slots viable again.

Other buffs (awesome but not necessary) would be:

* Reduce cooldown and shorten cast animation of Grasp of the Dead and Wall of Zombies (**only with the mana regen fix**)
* Increase duration / shorten cooldown of Spirit walk
* Make pets more tanky
* Make WDs able to dual wield (cheap damage)

*/rant, hope I didn't sound too cocky*

**tl;dr: mana fucks shit up increase the regen**

This rule takes effect immediately, but is not retroactive: existing threads are ""grandfathered in"".

This rule will be enforced by our faithful servant, GharbadTheWeak, who toils tirelessly to keep the subreddit free of memes and other junk. If you notice a post that makes it past Gharbad, please report it so that we can reduce his rations accordingly.

This [post you see on the front page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/11pxom/this_is_why_you_dont_go_afk_on_your_streams/) was a stream giveaway gone horribly wrong. I disconnected by going afk and lost all that legendary, but I still had more in my stash and did the giveaway anyways.

I use to play tf2 alot so I started the r/tf2trade reddit armory which helped thousands of new players. So I would like to continue the giving on r/diablo.

**The Rules: You have to be a viewer who is also a follower of the stream. You have to be NA-US and have a level 60 wizard (we want people to actually use this amazing set and not just sell it) we just do a random roll of all the viewers and the winner gets the ENTIRE SET.** 



I am estimating we should hit the 500 viewer mark at around 8PM so I will do the giveway at 9-10PM EST.  Best of LUCK TO EVERYONE


For those of you without a 60 wizard, I will be building a MP10 Farm-able WW barb set for 1000 viewer mark giveaway.   



**RESULTS!!!!**


**Congrats to MATTWGREENE for winning the entire set**

* There are ""center pieces"" which are the major part of the map, the meat so to speak
* There are ""terminator pieces"" which end the branch
* Each center piece is roughly a square
* Each center piece has exits on the same position
* I found 15 different center pieces in 6 runs
* Each piece is connected to another piece via wide part, which is always the same length

I waited for this game for years. I played Diablo 2 for about 5 years in total. When I was in highschool I would talk to my friend Chris about Diablo 2 all day long most days. Talking about new drops, new builds, what we each did the day before on our own, ect.

Since then I was waiting for Diablo 3. I didn't want Diablo 2 with some tiny improvements, I wanted Diablo 3 a completely new experience built on the same basic grindy/loot structure. 

Diablo 3 blew my mind, I wasn't expecting to like the game so well, I was expecting nostalgia to kick in and make me feel all grumpy about the changes, but I don't I love all of them. 

I think the only complaint I have about the game are the lack of low level sets because they are fun to collect.

Now hey, this is the day we've been waiting for, the release of Diablo III is near (or already here), and we're all super hyped for it hopefully.

We've got a lot of newcomers here, and we have a lot of ways here to interact with the community, as well as rules we are enforcing throughout the subreddit to keep the quality high.

Now, let's start with the fun stuff!



* **Setup your BattleTag and pick your class and region**

On our very informative sidebar you can set up your flair. This flair allows you to pick a class and realm you are on. The classes are self-descriptive, and here is a short list what the character combinations for realms are:

* *AM* - The Americas
* *EU* - Europe
* *AS* - Asia

We also have a reddit icon if you are not sure which one you want to pick. Once you have picked your flair, you can also enter your BattleTag (which you set up on your battle.net account page [here](https://us.battle.net/account/management/), and other redditors will hover next to your name, see your BattleTag and be able to add you to their friends list. We have additional information covering the BattleTags [here](http://redd.it/qyfqt).

* **Sidebar**

I just wanted to bring up, that most of our information is hidden in the sidebar, so just hover over ""Community Links"" or ""Miscellaneous"" and you'll see that we might just got the thing you need.

* **IRC**

We have a fairly active IRC community, and we welcome anyone to join our discussion-heavy channel. The information can be found on the sidebar and here:

[irc.esper.net #diablo](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=rdiablodweller&amp;channels=diablo&amp;prompt=1)

We are open to new members, but beware, after release we won't have a very strict spoiler policy. Check the topic for more information, as we also have various methods to link your nick to your battletag and let others search for you.

* **Mumble**

We also have a small mumble where some of our community members hang around and chat with each other. Diablo is very fun in a group of people, and here you can coordinate or otherwise talk about stuff that matters.

* **Steam Group**

A small steam group for steam aficionados has also been set up here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rdiablo

We will try to put most events surrounding Diablo in there in the calendar, but currently there's obviously only the release in the minds of everybody.

* **Spoiler policy**

We won't tolerate unmarked spoilers until at least one month after release, as was decided by community vote.

If you submit new posts, please mark your submissions with [S] and add spoiler link flair to it after it is posted.

Posts that aren't marked as spoilers will be either marked as spoilers or deleted, based on severity and if it's not the first time for an attempt to post unmarked spoilery information. That's the rule of thumb anyway.

If you want to tag a comment with spoiler information, just write your spoilers like this:

\[Tyrael kills Dumbledore on page 3](/spoiler), with the result being: [Tyrael kills Dumbledore on page 3](/spoiler).

**Please also report unmarked spoilers (either posts or comments) by clicking the *report* button below the post, so we can take appropriate action against it. Posts already marked as spoilers do not need to be reported.**

* **No images**

We enforce a no-images rule throughout the subreddit, as we've seen other subreddits to fall on their nose through overwhelming easily digestible content. If you try to post an image, please do so by posting it in a self post (text only) with additional information about it.
Should you want to post a ragecomic or meme, or in general not quite related content to Diablo, you can try /r/Diablofunny! If you post an image in /r/Diablo directly, our bot GharbadTheWeak will catch it and you will get additional information on what you should do next to let it reach the masses. Don't forget, we don't have a grudge on you or anything, but we want to keep this subreddit clean, and we've found that posting images in self posts encourages discussion. That brings me to

* **Rules**

An overview of the rules can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/diablo#Rules . Make sure you follow these, and you'll have a great time around here, I promise.

Thanks for reading this post, and I really hope you'll enjoy the game and of course this community!

So, I've been working on a way to reliably, QUICKLY farm A1 Inferno. For that, I needed to be very tanky, but I also needed TONS OF DAMAGE.

I couldn't find a balance between those two things - and the thing that always killed me when I switched away from a healing Mantra was that I just didn't have enough spirit to spam my less efficient healing without the defensive boost from Mantra of Evasion.

So. I went to the AH and I spent 1.2mil on a crazy fast fist weapon (1.62 attacks/second), I bought two +10% IAS rings, and I bought The Mind's Eye - unfortunately the most expensive one on the AH, since it was the only one with +5% to deadly reach AND a socket AND 50 dex AND spirit regen (in hindsight, I didn't need this. I seriously underestimated the effectiveness of this build at generating spirit).

So, what the fuck is this shit, Z, you ask.

Well, guys, I'm attacking at a base speed of 2.1 attacks/second. I'm using Deadly Reach (Keen Eye rune, obviously, yay +50% armor), and I'm using a shield in the offhand - that's 2.1 attacks/second WITHOUT the dual wield boost.

I use Seize the Initiative, One With Everything, and the shitty +62 life per spirit spent passive that I thought became worthless after Inferno.

But Z, that passive gives almost no healing!

Trust me, you have fucktons of spirit.

Now what, Z? What skills do I use with this crazy-ass amount of spirit I have now?

This was actually the hardest thing for me to figure out. I kinda felt like Monk had no really good spirit dumps. People tell me that Burning Palm or whatever that big single target DoT is is good, but I just don't like it. It feels clunky, even if chaining explosions through a pack IS awesome.

We have to have Sweeping Wind, and I personally like the 3 spirit/sec generation from that rune, so I kept that. I like to have a passive source of spirit while I'm kiting, and Sweeping Wind does that very, VERY well.

We have to have Breath of Heaven, and I think the +15% damage rune is the obvious one for this. Serenity is essentially non-optional as well, there's too much shit in Inferno that just Kills You Dead if you get caught in it - plus, Serenity is amazing if you want to go alpha strike a big, squishy, high damage unique.

But Z, I'm a monk. I can't alpha strike ANYTHING in Inferno.

Oh fuck yes you can. And you WILL. Why? How? Because we're going to take Mantra of Conviction with the double effect rune, we're going to hit Serenity, we're going to activate Mantra of Conviction, and then we're going to slam about seven Lashing Tail Kicks (Scorpion Sting) into some poor, unsuspecting elite's face at +48% damage.

But Z, Lashing Tail Kick? WITH NO KNOCKBACK? ARE YOU RETARDED.

Retarded like a fox, yo. So I needed a spirit dump with this build. I had so much spirit it was squirting out my fuckin' ears. I tried Wave of Light or whatever the bell droppy bullshit is, but it just.. didn't feel very cool. I tried Lashing Tail Kick with Sweeping Armada, which was AMAZING when I got penned in by accident but useless in the 90% of fights where I didn't make a really stupid mistake and get trapped in a corner. I tried Essence Burn on the skill I always forget the name of - you guys know what I'm talkin' bout.

And I was just about to say ""I guess monks just don't have a great damage spirit dump"". And then I tried, out of desperation, Lashing Tail Kick's Scorpion Sting rune, cuz I noticed it said ""replaces knockback"".

Well, it turns out that this shit is fucking AMAZING. It hits like a freight train, it stuns in an AOE, and it kills Horde/minion packs FUCKING DEAD. I can literally two shot most of the trash in A1 Inferno with this skill.

I'm a Demon Hunter, only I'm melee range, and I don't die in one hit.

Now, I'm a pussy, so I haven't tried this in A2. I suspect that I'm still too squishy - so at this point I've begun working on farming up a better set of defensive gear, again.

Where do I see this build going?

Ideally, I would really like to switch to Dual Wielding, but I just don't think it's defensive enough for Inferno. The extra thousand armor from a shield is a huge, huge deal, and it's MUCH cheaper to buy stats on a shield than it is to buy stats on a weapon - 1 handers with DEX and VIT go for a loooot of gold right now.

I think Act 2 is gonna be another really huge defensive gear check, but this build has one huge advantage: It farms A1 Inferno *fast fast fast*.

That said, there's a fairly high cost barrier to entry: +DEX +IAS rings are expensive as fuck, and high IAS, high DPS weapons are likewise, expensive as fuck. However I think this build has some really significant advantages over other monk builds.

TL;DR build pros and cons:

+ High damage output

+ Good at kiting AND excellent in close range aoe combat

+ Quite durable compared to most ""dps"" builds

+ Doesn't need tons and tons of VIT, since it stacks mostly mitigation and doesn't rely on dodge that much.

+ You only need like 8-10% crit from gear to keep Sweeping Wind stacked pretty reliably, thanks to how fast you attack.

-Very, very, VERY gear dependent. Finding gear that fits with your One With Everything *and* has appropriate stats can get difficult - or just be outright impossible. It took me days just to find some of the pieces I wanted. (I do, however, think that this is a flaw that most monk builds have. Monks just really need their gear.)

-If you run out of spirit, you die. I think this is true of most Monk builds, but it is especially true of this one. Spamming Mantra of Conviction and Lashing Tail Kick over and over is not only one of your main sources of damage, it also provides sustain from Transcendence AND mitigation in the form of constant mini-stuns from Scorpion Sting.

Whatcha think, gang?

The reason is simple. There are way too many rare drops. This can't be fixed until the expansion (and I'm certainly not touching this game until then anyway), but if we don't keep talking about this, it won't be fixed by then either.

What killed this game for me was spending so much time, not just ID'ing, but reading and evaluating all the drops I got, and figuring out how to sell them on AH. It's more of a chore and not exciting, when you know you will trash 98% of the stuff. This is a natural consequence of having too many drops per hour of game played.

1374057888.0,347,self.Diablo,1ih878,I feel that blizzard is wrong; an endless dungeon actually makes for great endgame.,whazfan69,479,132,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1ih878/i_feel_that_blizzard_is_wrong_an_endless_dungeon/,"First, to quote Wyatt Cheng:

&gt;What happens is players start… like it drives you into starting gameplay styles. We saw this some at release, where maybe you make a super tanky defensive build, which is effective, but not very fun to play. Yeah, I can beat something, but it took sixty minutes of kiting. Which is really fun and exciting the first time you do it, but isn’t something we really want to encourage people to do en masse.

&gt;But I think that the idea that there is greater challenge out there is cool. I think the idea of I want to test my character is cool. I think the idea of this game is too easy and I would like a great challenge is cool. So the desire behind those is cool, but the design of a dungeon, where every level is progressively more difficult, we found didn’t work.

Well, I take great issue with the details of this quote, in part because it starts off by first making a claim about what is or isn't fun, namely that tanky builds are boring and people have to faceroll to enjoy themselves.  Personally, I enjoy both styles, and would like both to be viable and rewarding within D3 (and I think it bears pointing out that the game had way more players when everyone was fighting for their life trying to beat inferno diablo).  Beyond this however, I feel like the scope of their prototype does not give the concept of an endless dungeon a fair chance to succeed, and so rather than just sit here and whine about it let me give you a version of an endless dungeon that I came up with over the last 30 minutes, and let's see where we can go from there.  This is not the first post on the topic, probably not the last, but it really bothers me how easily they wrote this off based on the contents of the interview.

**Idea #1:** Different boss fights every 10th (Xth) level.  Each level has a starting safe area where mobs cannot enter and you can theory craft the content ahead, swap out gear and skills etc, basically town.


**Idea #2:** Different combinations of preset (either hard set or easily determined before you get deep into the level) elite packs and mobs and/or specific affixes on various levels.  If you severely outgear the content/level, faceroll it with your build of choice, but if not, be ready to adapt your build and/or gear (grab a shield, throw in vit gems, change your skills, whatever) to clear the content.  Examples include:

- Levels where vast majority of incoming damage is fire based, or arcane based, etc...

- Levels where vast majority of enemies are hordelike, small and squishy but lots of small hits.  Maybe you'll want life on kill here, archon, melee reduction, exploding palm, whirlwind, etc..

- Levels laid with traps.  The game already has the ability for triggerable traps, how about ones that actually matter?  What about traps that can hurt enemies that we can trigger also, maybe this is the time for teleport or vault, etc... to really shine?

- Levels with elites / bosses that have quick enrage timers, and you really need dps because you're working against a clock.

- Levels where elites / mobs do insane burst damage, and you can't afford to not have strong ehp.


**Idea #3:** The endless dungeon scales with MP level, and MP level gets reworked a bit to scale damage more and hp less.  If you just really enjoy your faceroll build like the one you have now, you can take it to the endless dungeon and run it the whole way, just on an MP level that's a bit below your gear level.


**Idea #4:** Certain new legendaries only drop on certain dungeon level ranges or from certain bosses, and MP levels dictate their availability and/or odds of dropping and/or quality of rolls.  The goal should be to make the new content accessible, but also reward players for pushing the curve.


**Idea #5:**
Parties or individuals are given a certain number of ""wipes"" at the start of an endless dungeon, you can pause and rejoin your progress up to that point so long as you still have ""wipes"" left in your run.  A wipe in this case would be your entire party dying in combat, and the only way to respawn is to get picked up by a fellow player.  The big issue here would be that this rewards group play over individual, maybe there's a better solution I don't know.

**I think the point here is we need content that is challenging, and everyone has a different idea of what that is based on skill, time invested, gear level etc...  We need a mechanism that adapts to this reality better than Monster Power currently does.  Also, there are a lot of elements already built into the game that have been whitewashed by power creep.  I frankly don't even look at the monster affixes anymore, and I certainly don't care about static environment traps.  Maybe we can add a lot of variety to the game simply by finding a way to reintroduce these concepts through level design and/or de-randomizing the mobs and elites?  Either way, please god blizzard find a way to make this game interesting other than just new tilesets, random spawns, and itemization...give us a challenge, not more time trials!**

I memorized the location of that chest and quit the game, created a new warrior and entered the cathedral. Cue a few minutes of me wandering around trying to figure out where everything was, finally giving up on the search and figuring my pathetic child's brain was incapable of memorizing dungeons. Later on I'd read the manual and realize what randomly generated meant.

Diablo 2 had a great level of randomization as well, where you felt you were in a DIFFERENT place every time you played.

Diablo 3? Pretty much everything that actually matters in the game is always in the same damn place. A few randomly placed mini-caves or chests, but by my third character I knew exactly where to go for every single quest.

Hell, even in the quest in Act IV where you have to destroy the ""rifts"", they're always in the same location! (unless I've had the most bizarre luck on multiple playthroughs)

Blizzard clearly has a metric shit ton of experience handling a massive multiplayer game. So many posts on the official Diablo forums and on /r/Diablo highlight tons of things in Diablo that are a bit rough around the edges but are really polished in WoW. Given that Blizzard is the same company behind WoW, why exactly are there problems with Diablo III that seem rather like ""we're a new company! we don't know what the fuck we're doing?!"" in nature? 

Don't get me wrong, overall I've been pretty happy with Diablo III and as a follow up to my experience playing Diablo a decade ago, I largely have no complaints... *however*... when people talk about how smoothly things are implemented in WoW, I'm so curious as to why *the same company behind WoW* seems to have done a poor job implementing almost identical structures in another game from their stable? 

I feel like there's something I'm missing that can't simply be excused by ""but it's a new game"". 

Thoughts? 

Edited to add: Just so we're clear... I'm not comparing the actual story lines, content, or specific objectives of WoW to Diablo III. I'm more interested in and comparing how the same company behind a massively successful and popular MMORPG like WoW seems to have stumbled with implementing basic things (like a decent auction house system) that they've implemented with much greater success in another one of their games. I guess it would akin to watching Starbucks stumble launching a coffee shop; you'd expect some kid out of college opening a coffee shop for the first time to make a bunch of mistakes but you'd expect Starbucks to roll out that new location like a well oiled machine.

1342798632.0,353,self.Diablo,wvlml,Actually Playing Auction House Tycoon - My Story,tashinorbo,509,156,272,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wvlml/actually_playing_auction_house_tycoon_my_story/,"Approximately two weeks ago a friend and I stumbled upon a 6-prop recipe. It was easily our best drop of the day and, at the time, had a market value of 16m. This is how it began.

My friend wanted to sell it, it was a lot of money and he had his eyes set on new shoulder armor with a BIN price of 29m gold. The recipe would close the gap so that we could afford it. I wasn’t convinced that was the best use. 16m comes and goes and you might not even notice, but crafting, well crafting was a great unknown. Also intrigued by the possibility my friend agreed we should see what came of it.

The recipe was for boots and so we began to produce. We consumed the recipe and seeded 11m towards production. I keep stats on everything so I know that on that day we made 62 boots at a total cost of 8,213,496 gold. We apparently got very lucky and ended up with over 20m in sales. With this taste for gold we went full force into production and made 191 boots the next day. This batch wasn’t quite as good but we still turned a decent profit.

The next day things got a bit out of hand, and we produced 500 boots. Working out a system where I crafted and my friend sorted and filtered the good from the bad we spent over 5 hours managing our new cordwaining business.

This was the turning point for how things would develop. Dealing with that many boots was awful. We didn’t have the time to do a single MF run and couldn’t stomach looking at the AH after so many hours. We considered scaling back, or stopping production.

I had tasted too much possibility for gold to give-up though. I realized how much volume was required to be profitable and ride out the dry-spells, wherein you burn 20m on a product and get only a quarter of that in value. Instead I decided to try and hire people to help with sales. My friend, and partner, both thought I was crazy, but it was worth a shot.

With dreams of lots of gold I posted this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wfz10/goldman_scathachs_is_hiring/ on reddit. Hoping to attract 5-6 people to help me sell. I ended up with almost 30 responses that resulted in my hiring 13 people. While initially I was apprehensive about giving them items I had already resolved myself to do so. As it turns out each of them was incredibly nice and earned my trust rapidly. I have no doubt that if I had posted this on the official forums I would have been swindled but I ended up with a very good group of people that I’m happy to continue working with.

Having a sales force changed the nature of my production. I started to become more concerned with providing each of them enough boots to sell and less concerned with my bottom line. Thankfully, this is exactly the right attitude required to be profitable. Between the days 7/12/12 and 7/18/12 my team returned to me (and also themselves earned) cumulatively 57,806,888 gold.

That certainly isn’t all profit. I’ve made less money than that this week. But it radically altered the way I made money. Instead of relying on the rare valuable item I can now rely on steady streams of small money. The cumulative effect is much less risky and has made continuous crafting viable.

It occurred to me, at this point, that the system I was putting together had the potential to scale sideways too. And so I began seeking out, and working with, several other crafters in the same position as me. Too many items, not enough time or sanity to price them all. By distributing the work nobody has to actually spend too much time with it, allowing more freedom to play the actual game, but everyone earns some small stream of money.

So yes, D3 has actually turned into Auction-House Tycoon for me, but its actually quite fun and somewhat rewarding. I am continuing to try and expand to include more crafters and more sales people, to that end i created www.goldmanscathachs.wordpress.com (Scathach being the rare mob name you sometimes see, IE Scathach the Horrible).

At this point I’ve spent hundreds of millions of gold on crafting and earned tens of millions in profit. As well as spending tens of hours crafting, managing, and distributing money/items. I’ve learned firmly that crafting really isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme, but can earn gold. I would be happy to answer any questions I can.

And yes, I find the whole thing a little silly, but i'm having quite a bit of fun with it!

*Numbers given in brackets are guaranteed and approx. potential packs*

Select Quest 9, Pt. 2
  
1. Go to Northern Highlands WP, check the western edge for the watchtower. if it isn't there, reload. 

2. **[2-6]** Festering Woods WP: both dungeons. actually spend some time running around because you can get up to 3 packs outside and an event which is another pack

3. **[1-4]** Leoric's Manor WP: ~25 chance for packs to spawn in the manor itself, up to 2. Go through to Leoric's courtyard. 1 pack in the courtyard, 1-3 shrines, chance of another pack on the bridge outside the gate

4. **[2-8]** Cemetery of the Forsaken: ~25-50% chance of pack in the cemetery itself. Enter each crypt, kill the first pack you see, then TP and go to the WP again for the next crypt. You will wind up wasting huge amounts of time searching the entire crypt for the potential 2nd pack (every non quest-type crypt has one more potential pack), and half the time the first one will be around 30 seconds from the entrance anyway. The crypts can be rectangular which is the last thing you want for farming, so grab one and TP. If you are in a crypt and you find a door to a 2nd level, leave. that's the quest dungeon and there's 0% chance of elites on the 2nd floor, but there can still be one on the first it's just not guaranteed. I get this dungeon around 25% of the time, and half of those times I'll find a pack in there anyway.   
      
     50% of the time you'll get the Jar of Souls event in a non-quest dungeon. The layout of a jar of souls crypt is almost always exactly the same: a square with two intersecting paths through the center, where the event is. Do it with 5 stacks (which you will certainly have at this point if you follow this run exactly) and you'll get a rare.     
    
    &gt; [Maww] (http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b1xk3): *You don't need to stick around for it to finish. Just run up, activate the event, and keep looking around for an elite pack. After 1 minute come back and it'll be lootable.*   
     
     If you get the event with the wife whining about disturbed bones, accept it. **Totally ignore the unique (purple) ghost that spawns, hit the 3 markers, and he'll disappear.** Turn in the quest across the room and you get a guaranteed rare. **It takes less than 10 seconds.** 

5. **[2-13]** Northern Highlands WP: Go to the watchtower you found earlier. Kill any pack you see along the way. Enter the watchtower. This dungeon has the highest potential elites to area ratio in the game. You can get up to five packs in a minuscule area, ~~1 guaranteed~~ [edit: thanks to Eklypze808 for pointing out that it is possible, (but still unlikely) to get an empty watchtower] 0% chance of spawn on the first level. I may have gotten 6 packs one time but since I often wind up fighting two at once in this area who knows [edit: redditor mx9 mentions a potential 9 packs]. Very high chance of goblin spawn, and there are usually like 2 shrines that seem to mostly be fortune.

6. **[3-10]** Highlands Crossing WP: head north until you find the Cave of the Moon Clan.   
     &gt; [miveal](http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b1jmjl): *Also, there is chance for 1 pack near Highland Crossing wp (imo, about 40%) - it's small area, so looking around takes less than 30sec.*   
    
    I'd say it's worth checking. You'll usually pick up at least one other pack on the way in, I think there can be 4 in this area but you get 2 guaranteed. Don't waste time looking for them though. The cave can be in either the NW, SW, or SE quadrants of the map. You'll have to get a feel for it. The first level has 1 guaranteed pack and up to 2 more, same for the 2nd level, plus a resplendent chest (which is shit but w/e). High chance of goblin spawn on both levels.

7. That's it, reload the game. 

**[Rationale]**  
  
* The real benefit from doing shorter runs is that you're increasing the chance for a very good roll on packs/goblins/shrines for any given area you would have farmed anyway in a longer run. More reloads = more chances for an 8 pack Watchtower or 4 pack Leoric's Manor. From some discussion with a few redditors, especially Xenosync of the fantastic team that gathered a [huge amount of data](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vqm1u/act_iii_farming_day_4_final_report/) on drop rates, adding 1-2 more areas may make this run perfect. The question is, which areas are the fastest, and will consistently deliver the most packs.

**[Rules to Follow]**

* Totally ignore trash mobs to the best of your ability. I hardly touch them. 
* Town portal whenever its faster, like in the Cemetery. 
* Use some kind of speed boost. I use the monk's dash which allows me to teleport across the map and never touch a white monster. The DH has an arsenal of tools for this, and is ideal for these runs. I have a lvl 60 DH but she sits unused as I already play with a DH and the monk/DH combo is too good to not use.
* Only pick up rares, but check blues for perfect DPS rolls etc. Even if you're only making a few million a day total on the AH, salvaging/vendoring lvl 60 blues isn't worth the time, at all
* Some may disagree with this, but: totally ignore all containers, except resplendent chests (again, they're shit but they often drop gems which i can always use). Containers are no longer effected by magic find. Regular chests are worthless, anything with gold in it is pretty worthless too. you're aiming to find items worth over a million gold. spending an extra 5 or 10 minutes to break containers equates to a full run lost (20-40 rares) after only a few runs. it's not worth it. 


**[[My Typical 1 Death per Run Stats](http://imgur.com/MVwdn)]**

* I'm on Act III inferno as a monk and this run (Act I not act III) is very easy for me. You can get up to 40 packs this way, which is insane and more than makes up for the decreased chance of high level drops. You should be getting at worst around 2/3 an inventory of rares per run, at best two inventories (assuming you're using some magic find).    
  
* I'll use this section to point out that I can tear through this run with these stats, so if you don't have them don't worry, it is doable with far less, just lower your expectations for speed. Adding my DH friend to my party does not decrease my run times at all, in fact we tend to post the exact same times I do solo. The difference is that we get more packs by splitting up, which I detail [here](http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b0p97).   
  
* A tank/ranged party can do very well with this run. I wouldn't recommend any additional players unless they know the run and are dedicated to doing it properly. Lack of coordination (i.e. desynced town trips, players not skipping whites are kiting elites correctly will result in more deaths, a longer run, and therefore less rares over time. Co-op only makes sense if you're playing with people who know what they're doing.   


[**Alternative for Those with 200%+ MF**]  
  
* From Braindog and coelomate:
    
1. Start the ""talk to Aleric"" subquest before the festering woods
2. Get the checkpoint in the Warrior's rest
3. Kill the Elite pack in the Warrior's rest
4. Restart the game; you'll pop right back at the beginning of the Warrior's rest

* coelomate:
  
    &gt; At low magic find levels a regular run through act 1 is better. But at ~200% magic find you get a decent number of rares per kill and can kill that champion pack as quickly as every 20-30 seconds.
All of the data I've collected from myself and others suggests it is more efficient than anything else in act 1, because you lose so much time moving and looking for champion packs otherwise.

[**Additions**]  

* [gotreef](http://dd.reddit.com/user/gotreef):
  
     &gt; There has always been at least 1 elite on Cat lvl 3 for me. Additionally, excluding the WP location, the layout is essentially static. For 90% of my runs, the elite is somewhere to the east, towards the stairs to the 2nd floor which is basically a straight shot. I can only recall once where the elite pack was placed near the exit to the lower level (where the Jonaaaaar! event takes place).  
  
[**FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ASKING ABOUT WHY I DON'T CLEAR THE TOWER RIGHT AWAY**]  

* It's just personal preference, but considering the relatively high chance of a goblin/shrine spawn in the tower, I like to go in with 5 stacks. If you're part of the ""i've never even seen the tower and even one time i thought maybe i did i could tell there were no elites or goblins or chests in there"" demographic than just clear it right away if you happen upon it

CLARIFICATION: This chart is for SC-Americas, Level 60. YMMV for other levels. Another thing worth noting is that prices have been falling FAST so this will most certainly be outdated in a matter of days, if not hours.

Tried submitting this yesterday but this forum doesn't allow image only links. Basically the values inside the boxes are the Max DPS given the Max Buyout prices at the top of the columns. Helpful for figuring out what to toss/keep while farming. Bear in mind these do not consider any other stats, just DPS.

An interesting thing I noticed is that there is a striking correlation between attack speed and the minimum required DPS. Hope this is helpful for you guys, let me know if you have any questions! I plan to do this daily, so I'll prob put up another one tonight.

EDITED TO ADD: Does anyone know how to insert tables into these text posts? Nothing in the formatting help helped me...
EDIT #2: Thanks for all the love guys :D Really appreciate all the feedback, I like the Google Doc Idea as well. I also plan to expand it to include items other than weapons, they were just the easiest because of the accessibility of the DPS metric.

For a quick example check out the fiery brimstone link above. 

**Just click any item to view graphs and other stats.**

Features:

* Hourly price updates

* Tracks prices in both the gold and real money auction house

* Quick compare, on any item page there is a quick compare stat that tells you if that item is cheaper on average in the gold or real money auction house.

* Favorite an item and have it pinned to your own personal favorite category, where you can easily track all your items.

* Subscriptions allow a D3RMT user to ""track"" any items price and receive a website notification or an email when a price goes above or below a certain price. (Works on both USD and Gold price of an item)

* View graph data from various dates. The today, two and three day graphs show hourly price updates, where as the one week and on graphs average out the hourly updates into a single average for that day.

* The up or down percent tracker compares the current price to yesterdays average price.

Item tracking will be added at a later date once we decide how we wish to track the random nature of weapons/armor etc. For now, we're only tracking commodities.

Known issues:
The x axis on the today, two and three day graphs is hard to read. This is an issue with our graphing tools, for now just mouse over any point on the graph to see the proper date and time of that price update.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements you would like to see, suggest away!

I would like to take this time to clarify some points that are factually inaccurate and somewhat inflammatory. 

**1. You guys make boat loads of money from people watching you!**


There are 3 sources of streaming income. donations, ad/subscription revenue from twitch, sponsors.

To date I have received around $450 USD in donations, All of it went into equipment purchases such as a BLUE Snowball Mic and Avermedia Capture Card. I appreciate the generosity of those viewers and I try my best to not mention donations on stream. Some streamers have scrolling texts and messages that promote donations, but that's a personal choice that I am uncomfortable with. 

Sponsors, few people will receive actual cash from sponsors instead it is usually in a product endorsement format. I have contacted numerous gaming related companies and their offers are mostly product based. That is not to say that some of the top streamers don't have cash deals, but it's quite rare.

Ad/Subscription Revenue from Twitch, this is what most people believe to be the money tree of streaming. OMG we watch ads and you get revenue so We are PAYING YOUR BILLS. [Here's the my monthly ad income](http://imgur.com/mC7zElA), The prerolled ads come from twitch and I have hit the roll ad button once to test it. So we get 0 dollars from that. Feel free to run Adblock, I know I do. 

Now let's talk costs, Todd and I live in Peterborough/Toronto Canada, Unlimited bandwidth with good upload speed is fairly hard to come by, Bell only recently provided truly unlimited bandwidth with good upload, and neither Todd nor I have access to it. Todd is on cogeco, I am on start. The first 2 month of streaming Todd's monthly ISP bill was $600CDN due to the overage fees, and I currently pay about $150-$200 a month. Of course not all the cost is due to the stream, but 2MB/s UP for 15 hours a day adds up.


**2. If you don't make money, why do you guys do it?**

Because it's fun, and we enjoy helping players that are struggling with the game. Todd is a small business owner, I am a full time student that also carry a pretty decent paying job on the side. We are financially stable so we do not rely on the stream for money. Instead we stream because it makes the game more fun for both the broadcasters and the audience. Instead of grinding A3 alone for 6 hours a day, Todd and I can hop onto Team Speak and shoot the shit with our Mods and we can share the fun experience with our viewers. It usually takes around 10-15 hours to prep for a single educational Monday, we do the research, contact/invite guests, buy the possible parts on the AH, do the tests, tweak and optimize, complete the writeup document, and do the actual show. For Todd this is a daunting process since English is his second language. He has personally spent around 1.5B gold just in research and development for various wizard builds, the high PHYS-resist low LS archon build, budget CMs and the most recent Full Transformer sets took a lot of time, gold and effort.   

**3. Streamers Take Advantage of this Subreddit by Spam Advertising**

I have been a redditor long before diablo 3 released, I enjoy reddit because I can find people that are generally kind in nature and have civil discussions with them. I use to be heavily involved in the /r/tf2 and /r/tf2trade subs and started a community based projected called the Reddit Armory to help newer players there. Yes I do post to this reddit about once or twice a week on average, and my posts usually contain 1 link to my stream. That's usually for Educational Monday so those watching live can get the best deals on AH. The one time  I ""took advantage"" of this sub was for the purpose of charity, we raised $2000 USD for Autism Research and Child's Play, and I was immensely proud of this community.   

**4.Why Do People Watch Other People Play this SHITTY GAME?**

First of all I still enjoy D3 immensely and since most of us live in free countries we can play what we want. Now why do people watch streams? There's entertainment focused streams that do fun events and giveaways, there are educational streams that teach things, there are ""hero worship"" streams where people just drool over a guys ""godly"" gear. So each streamer has a different take and vision on what they want to do. Todd and I wanted to create a community where people can come and hangout, we wanted to share information and knowledge about the game and hopefully in the slightest way possible make this game better and more enjoyable. 

**5. Quit your bitching, No one is forcing you to stream, You attention seeking whore!**

This is true, it's nice to be e-famous and have many internet friends. However in real life ""I run a D3 Stream"" does not impress anyone. Any streamer disillusioned to think otherwise will run the risk of hubris and will eventually suffer a rude awakening. 

We are human beings just like you, therefore sometimes we do get emotional. My anti-trolling paragon level is pretty high due to wasting my youth on the interwebz, however for my partner Todd who has less exposure to trolls, accusations and insults appears extremely personal. I would like to say that our stream chat is one of the least moderated and most polite one I have seen on twitch, and for that I would like to thank everyone. It is discouraging sometimes when after all your hardwork, people still find the tiniest things to bitch at you and put you down. However we made the conscious decision of putting ourselves out there as semi-public figures , so we must also accept the consequences.  

**I apologize for this wall of text, it is my best attempt at conveying some clarifications and frustrations as concisely as possible, If you read through all of it, Thank You**

**TL:DR, Not All Streamers Make $ from streaming, in fact for most of us it's loss generating investment of time and money. We do it because it's fun and adds some flavor to the game. Having a platform to help a wide range of people is also very convenient. We will try our best to limit our posts in this subreddit, but I feel that our content contributes positively in a sea of ""GEARING HELP/IDEA!"" posts. People watch streams while they play games because it's fun to them and it's a free country. We need to vent sometimes because despite our best efforts the hate eventually has some impact. Thank you!**

There is currently an exploit that (at the least) allows you to see how many properties an UnID item has.,Kirushi,500,161,348,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wmvr8/do_not_buy_unid_items_right_now_there_is/,"EDIT MOVED TO TOP FOR VISIBILITY: This has evolved into people being able to fully identify UnID'd items including their stats (with small variation e.g. knowing its 170-200 str).  Cannot stress enough not to buy UnID'd items now or possibly ever.  

---

So I've long been of the belief of keeping things on the down low as much as possible, but this is already on the official forums and out in the wild and well, as some people believe, spreading it leads to fixing it more so I'll just explain exactly how it works.

Start a chat line, in party, whatever.  Link your item.  Follow that immediately with two special characters, for example ëë.  Then link the same item again (some of this might be extraneous but I know this works).  Put the cursor in between the two ë's.  Press delete three times.  Instead of deleting the entire [Archon Armor] it will just delete the [ and it will expose the item code.

The item code is a bunch of numbers and gibberish, it probably means something, some of it is probably encrypted, but at the very minimum you can find a specific part just before the name that looks like this:

528:528:0:0:7:0

the 528 will be some random 3 digit number, but that 7 is what you're looking for.  subtract 2 from that number, and this is how many properties your item has.  In this case 5. EDITED BECAUSE TYPING IS HARD

You can expect that until this is patched, at least a decent percentage of items that are being sold UnID'd will be known to be not 6 property items and well, thats awful, so don't buy them.  You can't do this from a link just in the trade chat from someone else.

As long as items don't change hands, this exploit does nothing, so lets try to keep it that way.

1340691398.0,339,self.Diablo,vm8oi,Endgame - PvE Endless Dungeon,Cyniae,452,113,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vm8oi/endgame_pve_endless_dungeon/,"After watching Athene and Kripp's videos on endgame, as well as reading other things on here, such as horde mode (jar of souls), I was trying to think up an endgame plan of my own.

The idea is similar to Torchlight, the Endless Dungeon. I realize this has been done before in other games, but here's the Diablo 3 twist I envision:

The endless dungeon unlocks the first time you hit level 60, and becomes available to all your characters. 

When you enter, the level you start on is the same as the level of your character, or wherever your ""saved"" progress is. The hook for lower level characters, is bonus exp for clearing the level, and thus an alternative leveling path. The higher levels will be reminiscent of Inferno in difficulty (61 = A1, etc.) until you hit 65. Every level 65 and above, the difficulty rises slightly from Act 4, as well as drop rates of higher level items, including set and legendary (very minor increases.) Since the dungeon will be completely endless, eventually there will be a brick wall level that simply can NOT be completed until Blizzard allows it through buffs or new gear. To prevent skipping of levels, the player can't move on to the next level until everything is dead, or at least the elites.

The levels themselves can be completely random (if Blizzard wants to design new areas), or they can simply re-use old areas/dungeons, but each level can be ANY random area/dungeon from ANY act, in order to keep it exciting, and if you remake the game you will likely get a different area. Each level will have some number of elite packs, and perhaps every 5th or 10th level will have a ""boss"", which again can be taken right from the game.

Saving can be done after every boss, or just every 5th or 10th level (or more), and if you leave the game all your progress is lost down to save. There will also be an NPC at the entrance which will allow you to ""reset"" your save so you can go back to a lower level if it gets too tough.

This will also allow a ladder system for pve players to climb and boast about. Not sure how resetting would work, but it's a start.


Sorry for the long read but I really wanted to get this idea out there since I didn't see anything about it.

##**Intro**

Hey guys, This is the build I used to solo hell as Wizard. I got tired of kiting everything, so I decided to experiment with a build that would let me stay in the thick of things, and mage-tank it. It's a really satisfying build to use, and it's a lot different than the way I see most wizards playing. It's worth checking out.

##**Pros/Cons**

+Unquestionably the best AoE build for wizzard

+VERY high survivability, and CC output.

+Can solo easily, but also provides massive utility to co-op play

+Very fun to play

+You don't have to kite things for half an hour

-Ranged units can be trouble

-Item dependent later on (what isn't?)

-RNG (Can be overcome with items)

-Requires high level skills

##**TL;DR** here are build examples

[AoE focus](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#dbYhXO!gVT!acYcaY)

[Single target focus](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#dbYRXO!gVb!acabaY)

##**The Basics**

The gist of this build is to stack as much attack speed and crit as possible, and use the Critical Mass passive to reduce the CD's of the rest of your spells. With good items you can literally cast long CD spells like frost nova, and diamond skin more than once per second.

~~As a secondary goal, you will stack as much HP regen/Life on hit as possible with **NO VITALITY** to make full use of the force armor rune.~~

~~The goal is to have enough HP regen to heal back 35% of your life per second or more, while having as little HP as possible, so attacks against you take down less of your diamond skin.~~

~~With zero +vitality, you diamond skin can take around 13 hits, regardless of how strong they are, before running out, which gives you plenty of time to reduce the CD and cast it again. This makes it great for bosses and single target, where you can just stand there eating all their attacks.~~

With the recent nerf to force armor, zero-vit-high-regen will no longer work. You will need some defensive stats from gear, including lots of vitality. HP on hit, and HP regen are still good options.

The nerf to force armor also makes this build a lot less viable for inferno (at least without a TON of top level gear), since you, and your diamond skin can now be one shotted, but it still works great in hell.

##**Required Passives**

* Critical Mass (Reduces your CD's by a ridiculous amount)

* Paralysis (Main nuke is high hit/second lightning nuke, so it porcs often)

##**Situational Passives**

* Glass Canon (You wont take any more damage due to diamond skin, so it's free damage, only use if you have good gear)

* Galvanizing Ward (If you need more HP regen)

* Arcane Dynamo (Makes Explosive Blast do 75% more damage)

* Evocation (More CDR, better if you don't have good gear yet)

##**Required Skills**

* Shock Pulse [Living Lightning] (Highest rate of attack so it procs literally dozens of crits per second, costs 0 AP)

* Diamond Skin [Crystal Shell] (This becomes your HP bar)

* Frost Nova [Cold Snap for single target, Deep Freeze for AoE] (Perma-Freezes enemies)

* Energy Armor (Force armor makes your diamond skin able to tank a ton of shots before it goes down) (Pre-Inferno, you can use pinpoint barrier for the extra crit, since you don't need the damage reduction as much)

##**Situational Skills**

* Wave of Force (""OH SHIT"" button + extra stuns...highly recommended)

* Hydra[Venom] (deals MASSIVE DoT with attack speed, great for champion packs and single target)

* Explosive Blast [Chain Reaction] (No cast animation, so you dont have to stop spamming to use it. With critical mass, you can cast this multiple times/second, best for AoE)

* Enchant Weapon [Force Weapon] (15% more damage, but honestly not that great in this build.)


##**Itemization**

Int, vit, life regen, resist all, and sockets are always something to look for on any item, but some items can't get certain stats...here's what to look for.

* Amulet - Crit chance, Attack speed, Crit damage

* Belt - Chance to freeze

* Boots - Chance to immobilize

* Bracers - Crit chance, Chance to knockback

* Chest - Nothing special

* Gloves - Attack speed, Crit chance(huge), Chance to stun, Crit damage

* Helm - Crit chance, Chance to fear, Bonus crit to explosive blast, Arcane power on crit (good for co-op, lets you spam high cost spells)

* Pants - Nothing special

* Ring - Attack Speed, Crit chance, Crit damage

* Shoulders - Nothing special

* Dagger(For fastest base attack speed) - Attack speed, Chance to CC

* Off-hand - **Increased shock pulse damage**, Crit chance, Extra damage

##**Followers**

Followers are mostly personal preference.

* Scoundrel - 3% passive crit, some CC

* Enchantress - good AoE CC's

* Templar - extra healing, and some CC

##**Tips**
* Try to peg ranged enemies with your first frost nova, so things don't get spread out. If you get them with the first one, it is easy to keep reapplying the freeze.

* For single targets, only use your nova, and WoF to stall for time for your Diamond skin to come back up again. Your CD's will be longer for single targets, so try to chain your CC's as efficiently as possible. Use them to interrupt telegraphed attacks.

* If you are in too deep, its better to stay and try to tank it than to run. Not attacking = no CDR, and your defensive skills are no good while they are on CD.

##**Theory crafting time**

With items I could buy on the auction house right now, I could get these numbers (If I wasn't so poor &gt;.&lt;)

Crit chance = 44.5%

Attack speed = 2.685/s

Chance to CC on hit

* Stun- ""up to"" 10.2% (Im not sure exaclty how much power surge gives)
* Freeze - 4.5%
* Fear - 5%
* Immobilize - 4.5%

Currently I am at 22% crit, 2.38 attacks/s. With 5% on hit CC, and I can almost perma-stun single targets, and I can perma-interupt bosses (Killed Rak on hell without him casting a single ability) 

With 44.5% crit, decent attack speed, and good on-hit procs, **even bosses can be permanently stunned** 

##**Conclusion**

Honestly I think this is the single best Wiz build that has been discovered so far. It has high survivability, and the most utility of any build I've seen. It is incredibly fun to play, especially the AoE varriant (you can spam Explode so fast, you run out of AP) and it doesn't take too much to get you started. Play it before it gets nerfed!

Let me know what you think, leave a comment with suggestions/improvements. If there is enough interest I can also make a video.

Thanks for reading.

Most people will aim to craft them with main stat (Dex, Str, or Int), but in some cases it may be wiser to craft the Vitality versions instead. Here's more:

* Several of these slots already have ""boosted"" or ""primary"" rolls. For example, current gloves can roll up to 300 Dex, and the new BoA gloves will be able to roll up to 330 on whichever stat you choose. Therefore, it may make more sense for DH or Monk to craft Vit gloves and hope for a 300 Dex / 330 Vit glove than crafting Dex gloves and hoping for a 330 Dex / 200 Vit glove.
* Vit is equally as useful, if not more useful, than mainstat in PvP and Uber hunting.
* If you play or plan to play multiple classes, crafting Vit allows nearly 100% of your crafts to have mainstat/Vit. If you craft mainstat, a much smaller proportion of your crafts will have mainstat/Vit.
* Vit-only amulet crafts can be used by all classes. For example, a 300 Vit, 95% CHD, 9% Crit, 9% IAS, +dmg, socketed Amulet would likely be both a DPS and EHP upgrade for most people.

Therefore, the best strategy is likely as follows:

1. Craft a few mainstat BoA items until you get a high DPS and mediocre defense roll (e.g. only has high vit, high AR, or a bit of both). Use this for low MP farming.
2. After you have this DPS-focused piece and want to focus on reaching BiS, try to craft Vit pieces for the slots your class has a primary roll (e.g. gloves for DH/monk/wiz/WD, shoulders for barb). That way, you can eventually reach the 300 Mainstat/330 Vit combo. Plus, all of your extraneous byproducts may still be quite useful for other classes. (e.g. a 100 Str roll on a Dex-focused piece is useless while a 100 Str roll on a Vit-focused piece could be used for a future Barb character).",,False,self,t5_2qore,1359687073.0,,,True,t3_17o1bn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/17o1bn/why_and_where_you_should_craft_vit_boa_items/,

1342583581.0,328,self.Diablo,wqpfp,The Scamming Techniques that everyone should be aware of,fatboo,472,144,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wqpfp/the_scamming_techniques_that_everyone_should_be/,"I have recently started paying attention to the trade channel on diablo 3. After spending a day or two there, I've noticed the amount of scamming acts (scamming other players, not botting).  I read reddit a lot so I have seen most of the scamming methods and was never a victim.  But 


(1) It really pains me when I think someone will fall for these tricks. Sure, you might say, if people are stupid enough to get scammed, it's their own problem.  But imagine someone who's not as keen at that moment, someone who spent tons of hours to farm his mere 5mil gold, makes a tiny mistake and loses all in 5 seconds.  Call me naive, but it pains me.


(2)I've talked to some scammers after calling them out.  It seems like they have enjoyed what they are doing a lot and claimed to be very rich.  This one guy told me he's sitting on 200 mil, all from scamming.  Another told me he just scamed 3 people and got 8 mil today.  Most of them are even still at act 1 or 2 inferno according to their profiles, less than 100 hrs played. I personally am not a wealthy player, though I have been sitting on 100 mil or so at one point (350 hrs played...).  But I hate to see these people getting so much gold with so little effort.  Sure, we get to enjoy the gameplay (farming?), but it's just not fair in my opinion.


(3) You might say, botters are much worse since they can put in zero effort and earn way more gold.  Yes, they are hurting the macro economy, causing inflation and such, whereas these scammers are hurting the other players in the community directly.  But at least botters are at the risk of getting banned (or at least i hope so, despite the general impression of blizz's inability to deal with them). These scammers, for all I know, will never get banned, or dealt with by blizzard. They are just sitting there and laughing at the victims' face.


Since there's no way to stop the acts of scamming, and it's really up to players to get smarter, I think it is good to raise some awareness of this particular topic.  I see a lot of posts on reddit telling stories about how they got scammed.  But never a list of known or popular scams.  I hope we can compile such a list, so less people can fall for them.  If you guys think this is something old and meaningless, go ahead and downvote.  But if you think this might just help some people when they are about to get scammed, please contribute and upvote.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr - I hope to compile a list of the various scams going on in D3. So people are more aware of them.  As it becomes harder to scam, the scammers might just consider playing the game as a normal player.

I'll start off, please feel free to contribute

(1) The unID peak method: Probably every redditor knows about it by now and not strictly a scam.  People are able to check the affixes (and the range of rolls) on an unID item. This includes the calculated Weapon DPS!
Edit: There are ways that you can check the exact value of the affixes.

(2) Fiery Brimstone Stack trick: I've seen most people do it with Fiery Brimstone(almost everyday).  They are able to use scripts to reduce the stack number before the trade goes through. Very easy too.

(3) Using scripts to take away item and hit accept: They do it extremely quick right before the buyer hit accept, it's got psychology involved too.  They might fail a lot, but it's quick and easy.

(4) Using scripts to swap items in trade window before accepting: Basically swapping the good item with bad ones.  Most of the time, it's legendary items that share the same picture (ie. andariel's visage)

(5) Trying to cancel trade to trick you into dropping the item: Only works if you drag your item instead of right clicking.

(6) Deleting zeros when trading for money: 24mil turns into 2.4 mil. Hard to keep track of all those zeros. Could be done with script too as far as I know.

These are what I can come up with, please contribute, thank you.
Lastly, if you are a scammer who's reading this, Do not downvote! :P

Stability of servers notwithstanding, the gameplay and graphics are very good and generally speaking most people are happy with the game. However, I think there's some major problems with the approach to how the game is presented to the player -- problems that I think will ultimately limit the replayability of the game over the long term.

I've probably clicked more 'x's to stop/abort dialogue than loot in nightmare, and i've bound 'esc' to my middle mouse button to abort cutscenes for bosses. What's become immediately apparent is that Blizzard suddenly thought they were Bioware and capable of telling a strong compelling story -- in the context of a highly repetitive hack'n'slash dungeon crawler. 

As an example: The Butcher. In Diablo, you crawl through a series of endless rooms and open numerous doors to discover monster packs that you gradually kill. Until you suddenly enter a room...its large, blood splattered...you walk in, and then the door at the other side bursts open! A unique monster model proceeds at you x2 speed, and voice dialogue triggers ""Ah...fresh meat!"". Holy shit! 

Contrast this with Diablo 3's approach to bosses. First, you typically step through a glowy portal/door (break in play). Then you take a few steps forward, and a cutscene takes over (break in play) ... you're exposed to a bad piece of james-bond villian dialogue trying to convince you this boss is dangerous, and which point you regain control of your character for 2-3 seconds before the boss encounter begins. 

The first rule of story telling is 'show, don't tell'. The approach Blizzard has taken for Diablo 3 results in a more nuanced story during the first playthrough, but is less emergent from the gameplay itself. 

How do the rest of you feel? I'm really resenting the storyline and its intrusiveness on subsequent playthroughs on alternate characters/later levels.

1337687641.0,328,self.Diablo,tz4ca,[S] The Butcher's return in Diablo III ,EreTheWorldCrumbles,546,218,592,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tz4ca/s_the_butchers_return_in_diablo_iii/,"I was just reading about the old Butcher encounter from the first Diablo and came across [this article](http://diablo.incgamers.com/blog/comments/the-butcher-is-back) that speculates on the iconic Butcher's probable return in Diablo III.  
  
I read the hopeful comments speculating on how his terrifying return could be handled tactfully and respectfully and then there are the commenters apprehensive toward referencing a classic encounter that is best left in our minds where it has the most power.  
Then I imagined how disappointed these commenters must have been with the unabashedly nostalgic and superficial fanservice that was actually delivered.  
That thread is kind of a microcosm of what Diablo was to people, and what they expected Diablo III to be... and they show how wildly off the mark Diablo III is in terms of presentation and recapturing the brooding and terrifying atmosphere that immersed people in the previous games.    
  
This feeling is pervasive throughout Diablo III with the whimsical and heavy handed treatment of bosses that we *ought to* fear. Even Diablo himself is rendered a dumb and incompetent villain by incessantly plotting and badgering the player with what comes across as insecure and childish remarks about how grand and unassailable his plans are.  
  
Granted if you play Diablo today you will undoubtedly find that it's not that scary, but it was a product of the technology and sensibilities of its time, and what players took away from it was what the game instilled in our imaginations... A serious and terrifying atmosphere. That's no fluke, and it's not simply because we were children; it's an oppressive and evil atmosphere that was intentionally constructed by Blizzard North.       
What feelings will players take away from Diablo III's atmosphere?    
Likely a sense of superiority due to the unassailable nature of our Nephalem birthright, and a *disrespect* for the incompetent and insufferable bosses we rightfully pummeled into silence.    
  
I love Diablo III, but... I know what it could and should have been, and so does everyone else who fondly remembers that horrifying encounter with The Butcher in the first Diablo. And we remember the fear, and consequently, the *respect* that the mysterious evils of the Diablo universe instilled in us.  

To quote a commenter on the aforementioned article:  
 
""What I envision is, through a door you enter a long corridor. As you do, the door closes and locks behind you (cue the creepy music, and dim the lights). The walls are lined with meat hooks; most have a skinned and disemboweled human body on them. As you get near the end of the hallway, you hear a young girl crying. The corridor ends to reveal a large room. The Floor is covered in a mix of dry and fresh blood. There are naked bodies with gaping wounds stacked in piles on the floor. In the center of the room lays a massive thick wooden table, its stained red.  Each corner of the room has a barred cage. In one of them a young village girl weeps. As you approach her you hear “Mmmm Fresh Meat”""  
  
And here's what we got:  
""meet... THE BUTCHER!""  
""Fresh meat!"" 
""Zombie flesh good, human flesh better!""  
Then we get an *encyclopedia* entry informing us that the original Butcher was not a special, intelligent, depraved demon who set up a human meat locker in a cathedral. There are actually lots of ""Butchers"" and it's just a demon overlord type.  
 
And that encounter is indicative of the depth of atmosphere in Diablo III.  
When Diablo came out, games were in a state where we were forced to fill in the blanks with our imagination. The graphics technology was limited, so in order to be immersed, our imaginations were assaulted through implication and deliberate guidance.  
  
It probably is more difficult to create a scary game today, because the worlds are explicit. In other words, little is left to our imagination, because the graphics technology does most of the work.  
You have to really try to create an immersive and scary atmosphere, and what irks me is it seems like Blizzard didn't even try. Far from meticulously constructing atmosphere and driving our imagination to dark places, they instead bashed us over the head with nostalgia, encyclopedic data, and megaphones through which bosses would literally explain to us why we should be scared.  
Diablo III is a really fun game that they should be proud of, but I sincerely hope some feedback reaches Blizzard's ears in regard to the artistic and creative application of their decidedly incredible craft.

1346959095.0,325,self.Diablo,zgpd0,After 1.04: A constructive look at some of D3's current problems,FreeGiraffeRides,420,95,349,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/zgpd0/after_104_a_constructive_look_at_some_of_d3s/,"Patch 1.04 was a great improvement to a promising game, and the Paragon system solved one of Diablo 3's biggest shortcomings. It's a much better game now. However, there are still a number of significant problems that need to be addressed. This post aims to identify several issues which are either very important, or else relatively easy to fix, and to suggest possible solutions.

**CORE ISSUES**

* **Environments** - Randomized environments have been a core feature of the Diablo series since the beginning. Contrary to Blizzard's pre-release claims, the environments in Diablo 3 are much less random, more predictable, and more repetitive than in Diablo 1 or 2. A typical Diablo 2 dungeon might have millions of permutations, while many Diablo 3 dungeons have only a half-dozen permutations or less. Static outdoor areas are particularly tedious. An ideal solution would be to add new tiles to the game, as well as a more sophisticated generation algorithm that builds parts of the layout out of small elements instead of just D3's huge screen-filling tiles. (cf. Diablo 1, 2, Path of Exile, and countless roguelikes. For a technical summary of how this can be implemented, see the dungeon section of [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcM9Ynfzll0).) **However,** there is an easier way to partially ameliorate this problem: simply add new layouts using the existing tiles, so that the Vault of the Assassin isn't *always* a big square ring, Sirrocco Caverns isn't *always* a diamond-shaped layout, etc. This would require no new assets (although it would be nice), but would simply make better use of existing resources.

* **Collision Detection** - Being ""meleed"" by a monster that is nowhere near you is bad design. It doesn't look right, it doesn't feel right, and it's not fun. It wasn't necessary in Diablo 1, 2, or many other games. There should be a ""sanity check"" on enemy melee attacks: If you are more than X yards away when the attack animation *lands* (rather than *starts*), it should not count as a hit. If this makes some monsters insufficiently threatening, then just speed up their attack animation, instead of giving them long-distance telekinetic punching powers.

* **Lack of endgame objectives** - Players need something to do in PvE, at the endgame, besides farming endlessly. This could take many forms, like an endless dungeon or wave-based survival mode. Whatever it is, it should be heavily randomized for replayability, and increasingly difficult so as to keep endgame players challenged.

-

**SOCIAL**

* **Incognito Mode** - The option to appear as invisible is a basic feature of almost every messaging service - except this one. The developers have mentioned concerns about whether this feature would desocialize players. This is the wrong perspective entirely; this feature is about basic respect for your customers' right to privacy, not about conforming to some ""vision"" of forced interaction. Mandatory visibility can actually discourage people from expanding their friends list. Steam's approach to this situation is perfect: If you ""Appear Offline,"" you can't see who else is online. It's your personal time, if you want to be left alone while you play, you deserve that right.

* **Matchmaking** - The matchmaking system is much less flexible than the named-game approach of Diablo 2, BW, or WC3. Sometimes matchmaking keeps putting you into the same game with an idle player, very frustrating. Also, it becomes useless for the 99% of your time you ultimately spend farming instead of progressing, when there is no way to identify farming partners for particular routes, class combinations, or similar gear quality. Instead, players should be able to create and view games with specific names. Allow players to decide for themselves what they want to do, instead of forcing them into a dysfunctional system.

* **Customization** - Diablo 3's artists designed many very beautiful armor sets for each class. You wouldn't know it, though, because almost all your time is ultimately spent with characters wearing the last couple tiers of gear. There should be a feature that allows a player to apply the visual appearance of a lower-level piece of armor to a higher-level one. This feature would add an enormous amount of visual customization options for players without requiring any new assets.

* **Custom Channels** - It would be very beneficial to the social aspect of the game if it was possible for clans, communities, and groups of friends to easily talk together in-game.

-

**MISC**

* Many players have decried that the story will never be fixed, and is a lost cause. However, there is a simple change that would improve it considerably: The very worst thing about Diablo 3's story, by far, is the Scooby-Doo level dialogue where major villains (Azmodan and Diablo) will constantly call you up to remind you of what you're going to do next by telling you you'll never do it. Such dialogue destroys their credibility as villains and undermines the tone of the story. But really, it's not intended to make the story good, it's just intended as an indirect tutorial for the dimmest players. So consider this: cut out those lines if the player has tutorial tips turned off. That's what those lines are, anyway (e.g., ""You'll never destroy the Rift Oculus over there! &lt;pssst- go destroy that Rift Oculus!&gt;"" - it just makes Diablo sound like an incompetent idiot.) A player who is experienced enough to manually turn off tutorial tips doesn't need to hear this, so skip it. This simple change would *vastly* improve the presentation of the story.

* **Video Options** - Contrast and Brightness sliders are needed, besides just Gamma Correction. Most players use Fullscreen mode, which defaults to a washed-out middle-contrast setting, and does not do justice to Diablo 3's beautiful artwork.

* **Resplendent Chests** should drop a rare for players with 5 NV stacked. This avoids any swapping or abuse concerns. It's not fun for resplendent chests to be garbage cans.

1338863425.0,325,self.Diablo,uldxs,Notes on playing a Demon Hunter in Inferno,not_a_haddock,410,85,414,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uldxs/notes_on_playing_a_demon_hunter_in_inferno/,"I think that a lot of people would benefit from the collective Diablo wisdom that we have all built up over the last few weeks. This post is a list of things that I have noticed and used to help me play in Inferno difficulty as a Demon Hunter. This isn't an exhaustive guide of everything you need to know, just some useful things to know if you're struggling.

**Gear**

As many people have noted, the DH does not necessarily need to stack defensive stats in order to survive in Inferno. Being ranged and having a wealth of escape skills, it is possible (and in most cases advantageous) to hit hard and fast while avoiding hits at all costs.

This means that the most valuable offensive stats are Dexterity, Attack Speed, Critical Hit Damage and Critical Hit Chance, in *roughly* that order depending on your current build. You can disregard Dexterity on your weapon, however: go for the highest DPS you can afford. If you can get some +Crit Damage on it too, great (this can be achieved with an Emerald in a weapon socket too).

In terms of defensive stats, there are three that stand out in my mind, and they are not what you might expect on other characters:

* The first is +% Movement Speed. This will really help you both kite and avoid projectiles. The cap is 25%, and the stat only appears naturally on boots, with a 12% max. This can be increased to the cap by wearing Legendary items such as Lacuni bracers, etc.
* The second is +Max Discipline. The glass-cannon DH really relies on defensive abilities to survive, and all of those abilities use Discipline. The most used ability is Smoke Screen, which costs 14 Disc to use. This is nearly half your base amount! By wearing an item with +8 Max Discipline, you can increase the number of successive casts from 2 to 3 (with Preparation this is 4 to 6). Furthermore, by maxing out your Disc (+10 on both cloak and quiver) you can achieve 4 successive casts! This will allow you a lot more flexibility in your defensive options and is something I really recommend to all aspiring DHs - it is not too expensive, either (I got my cloak and quiver for ~500k with decent Dex on both)
* Finally, Cold Damage. Any kind of Cold Damage will slow enemies, which is infinitely useful for a ranged character.



**Skills**

I don't intend on running through the nuances of every available rune (there are other places to find this info) - simply my thoughts on useful skills:

* **Smoke Screen** is pretty much a must-have in order to survive any non-trivial encounter. Most people use Lingering Fog (even post-nerf) because that extra .5 seconds often allows an extra few yards of escape or another heavily damaging shot. Also extremely useful for avoiding damage from Arcane sentries, Mortars, Desecration, Plague, fire floors etc etc etc. All rounder.
* **Caltrops** aid kiting and damage-dealing (depending on your rune). I have found the most success with the Stun rune when in a fix, though others swear by the 80% slow for consistent ease of kiting. ~~By loading up on crit chance, you can set down a 5-stack of traps with the damage rune and really nail a target: the crit chance is set when you lay the trap, not when it fires. This means that you can throw down five traps with 100% crit chance - and they proc often.~~ **Nerfed :(** The main difficulty is in getting them down at the right time and place.
* **Vault** is a great escape skill and fairly cheap in Disc, particularly with the Tumble rune which is what I recommend given that all of the others are pretty useless.
* **Preparation** is SS's partner in crime, allowing you essentially double your Disc in any one encounter. People debate the usefulness of runes, personally I use Backup Plan to make a third of my difficult fights that much easier, rather than being consistently slightly better.
* **Companion** is widely used with the Bat rune for Hatred regen, but I find that in most cases I can regen all the Hatred I need through a generator skill, opening a valuable skill slot.
* **Marked for Death** also has potential for Hatred-regen, but whenever I have used it, I find it a hassle - it's often easier and quicker just to fire another shot rather than add 12% damage to a single mob.
* **Impale** can do serious damage with the +100% crit rune, but is expensive on Hatred.
* **Rain of Vengeance** is a great offensive CC skill costing no resource with a decent CD of 30s. With Flying Strike you can stun even act bosses, which is extremely valuable and allows you to fire a few more shots off or retreat in safety.
* **Hungering Strike** is the primary of choice for a lot of DHs, given that it has the highest DPS of all Hatred generators with the Devouring rune. Combine this with the extremely useful homing-missile functionality (quite often I fire around corners or blindly towards the edge of the screen to wipe out mobs before they can touch me) for a great offensive skill.
* **Entangling Shot** is the more defensive alternative Hatred generator, for easier kiting and more shots before the mobs can catch you. Cold damage on a weapon can mimic this effect without using this skill.
* **Elemental Arrow** is great with Nether Tentacles. Slow-moving projectiles that act as AoE and can proc multiple times on the same enemy, while carrying the original crit chance that they were fired with... Perfect.
* **Evasive Fire** is a skill that I used early on then didn't consider again because it didn't feel powerful or useful enough. I've taken advice in this thread and trialed it, and with the 3-strike rune it makes a very good generator, the primary advantage being instant damage from range. Originally my concern over losing Hungering Strike was that I wouldn't be able to hit annoying ranged mobs like wasps, but EF is even better than HS *and* hits multiple enemies. I've also been told that it fires through thin walls, which I have yet to try but it sounds very useful. Not sold on the backflip just yet but in theory it synergises well with Tactical Advantage, which is nice.

The above covers all of the frequently used skills and why they're good. Now, onto passives:

* **Tactical Advantage** is the first passive available and one of the best. Smoke Screen and Vault get a huge boost by increasing their primary ability: getting you out of trouble.
* **Steady Aim** is essentially a free +20% damage boost if you play conservatively and keep your distance. However, the most difficult mobs are the ones that swarm you, so this passive is useless for them - this is my reasoning for ditching it in favour of TA.
* **Cull the Weak** has uses on a slowing build, but gets edged out in terms of usefulness by a few other passives.
* **Archery** gives a really nice damage boost, this time with no distance restrictions. In combination with Sharpshooter, the Crossbow boost can increase your damage hugely.
* **Sharpshooter** is found on a lot of DHs. ~~It is a lot more useful than it first appears, primarily because the crit damage is applied to projectiles and traps as soon as they are cast, which means that if you can fire 6 rounds of NT before the first one hits the target, all of those NTs have a 100% chance to crit, for every proc (can be up to 3 times on large bosses). Boom!~~ **Apparently this was nerfed in the latest patch! Might have better luck with other passives and stacking crit; time will tell**

Hello everyone, I’m glad you’re all enjoying my threads about the lore and stories of the Diablo series.  In my part 2 thread where I was explaining the events of Diablo I, I accidently revealed some information regarding Diablo’s 3 storyline.  I have decided to keep any references to Diablo 3 minimal as to not spoil it for others.  If do I reference anything, I will try and use a spoiler tag.  With that said, let just dive into the events and fascinating twists and turns of Diablo 2, and hopefully, ~~the Lord of Destruction expansion pack!~~ It got way too long, so I will be breaking that off into another post. The post was too long to all fit in the header, please check the comments for Act III and IV (I know asking for upvotes of any kind is wrong, but I'm not doing it for selfish reasons.  Please upvote that comment so others can see it easily. All these posts have been self posts, so I don't get any sort of Krama, well except your kind comments. Thank all!).  

###Prologue
    
At the end of Diablo I, our unnamed hero, [who has been retconned to be Adian, King Leoric’s eldest son](/spoiler), had become the Dark Wanderer.  He impaled the soulstone into his forehead and carried Diablo’s spirit within him.  He struggled with the demon and fought to control his own body, but Diablo was too strong and quickly corrupted our hero.  

*“Many moons have passed since I left the town of Tristram behind me. Since then I've tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth, and the twisted nightmares that have haunted my every waking moment. There’s something dark within me now; I can feel it, driving me towards the East, assuring me that my salvation lies within the ruins of ancient kingdoms. Though I know the way, I know not what perils will arise to hinder my journey, and as I pass through the first gate, I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind… forever.”*

###Opening Cinematic

The [opening cinematic for Diablo II]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0kPXdtz_c4) introduces us to Marius, a frail old man with a broken mind and soul.  He is hiding inside an asylum when Tyrael (Baal disguised as Tyrael) finds him and ask him why he did not complete the task he had asked of him.  He then narrates the rest of the opening cinematic, revealing that he was living at the Rogue Monastery when the demons attacked.  The demons attacked following the orders of Diablo/The Dark Wanderer.  Marius was one of the few survivors that were able to escape from the Rogue Monastery.  He sought refuge in a nearby tavern and smokes heroine to rid his mind of the horrible nightmares he has from the attack on the Monastery.  This is where he encounters the Dark Wanderer and it is revealed that our hero from Diablo I was losing the battle to control his body.  Diablo’s spirit summons demons from within him and kills everyone in the tavern, except Marius.  He is spared once again.  Compelled by Diablo’s calling, Marius followed the Dark Wanderer as he travels further East.

*""Why did I follow him...? I don't know. Why do things happen as they do in dreams? All I know is that, when he beckoned... I had to follow him. From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.""*

###Act I – The Sightless Eye

We are then taken in game and pick one of the 5 heroes to play as.  The story goes that the heroes traveled as a group, and slain the evils that the Dark Wanderer unleashed on the land.  We are always a step behind the Dark Wanderer, and never really catch up with Diablo until Act 4.  The player starts in the Rogue Encampment, a camp made by the survivors of the Rogue Monastery on the outskirts of Khanduras.  The heroes are tasked with clearing out the evils in the surrounding area and to save the last Horadrim, Deckard Cain (yayyyyy).  The passage through the Rogue Monastery must be cleared before we can travel east, as this is the only passage through the mountains.  However, it is currently being guarded by [Andariel , the Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg).  She was put here to guard the passage and keep anyone from following Diablo.  Andariel is defeated after traversing through the Monastery halls clearing out the countless demons, and we continue onward, to Lut Gholein.

###Act II – The Secret of the Vizjerei

We reach Lut Gholein and realize that this city too, is drenched in evil.  The air carries the smell of dead flesh, and demons lurk beneath the city sewers.  These monsters terrorize the citizens at night, killing and taking what they find.  After clearing out the sewers, the heroes consult with Lord of Lut Gholein and his Wizard Drognan to conclude that the Dark Wanderer is really Diablo and he is seeking the long lost Tomb of Tal Rasha, somewhere in the desert.  

[Diablo seeks to free his brother, Baal, from imprisonment]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkJRxBlZi70) and continue his reign on the mortal world.  In order to open Tal Rasha’s Tomb, the Horadric Staff must be reassembled, as this is the key to chamber in which Baal has laid dormant for over two centuries.  The heroes search the endless desert to reassemble the staff, and ventures into the Arcane Sanctuary, an ethereal realm, to find the where about of Tal Rasha’s Tomb.   After defeating [The Summoner]( http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Summoner) and finding Horazon’s Journal,  it is revealed that the tomb is concealed in the Canyon of The Magi.  

The heroes rushed to the tomb with urgency to stop Diablo from freeing Baal, but upon opening the chamber with Horadic Staff, they realize that they were too late.  Standing guard was one of the lesser evils, [Duriel, the Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg).  His icy attacks chilled our heroes to the bone, but by this point, they had grown strong [with some epic loot and rare magic find (OP as shit right?)](/spoiler).   After Duriel is defeated, the heroes enter Baal chamber to find Tyrael constrained by chains that once held the now cunning and sly Baal (it is said that when Tal Rasha plunged the soulstone into his chest and imprisoned Baal within him, he passed onto Baal all his intellect and knowledge).  The heroes free Tyrael as he reveals [what had happened merely days before]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgwRT5dLt8).  The Dark Wanderer and his follower Marius had entered the tomb to free Baal.  Tryrael descended from the Heavens to stop Diablo, and they fought with clashing lights and burning fire.  While the battle raged, Marius was drawn to Baal, his demonic voice urging Marius to with draw the soulstone from his chest.  Unable to resist, Marius freed Baal.  Tyrael grabbed Marius and instructed him to go to the Temple of Light in Kurast, where the gates of hell will open before him.  He must find the courage to enter through it and destroy the soulstone on the Hell Forge.  Frightened and bewildered, Marius fed the tomb with Baal’s soulstone fragment and headed toward the Temple of Light.  Now alone, Tryrael had to face a an almost fully recovered Diablo and a very angry Baal who has endured centuries of imprisonment.  This proved too much for the Archangel of Justice, and he soon fell to their combined power.  He was imprisoned here until the heroes arrived.  Tyrael urges the heroes to travel east toward the city of Kurast, to stop Diablo and Baal from freeing and reuniting with their eldest brother, Mephisto, The lord of Hatred.

1359736818.0,327,self.Diablo,17p8tr,Tal Rasha's set bonuses need fixing: Here's why. Please support PTR thread.,Coxis67,420,93,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/17p8tr/tal_rashas_set_bonuses_need_fixing_heres_why/,"Hey people. Wizard player here since launch. I have been advocating for a change in Tal Rasha's set for a while now. I'm no D3 expert nor theorycrafter, but one doesn't need to be one in order to know that there are severe problems with this set. I'd like to link you to my PTR thread first, so you can visit it and show your support if you agree with me. 

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7710222369?page=1

Tal Rasha's set bonuses:
2pc: Fire skills do 3% more damage.
3pc: Lighting skills do 3% more damage.
4pc: Cold skills deal 3% more damage.
Increases Arcane Power Regeneration by 2.00 per Second (Wizard Only)

I will post here the inconsistencies with the set.

1- This is probably the biggest inconsistency. Why was this decided, my mind cannot fathom. Every class out there has 2 slots which allow them to use class-only items. So do wizards. Every class-set out there makes use of these class-only slots, except... you guessed it, Tal Rasha's. For some unknown reason to us, Tal Rasha's helm is NOT a wizard hat. This means that it's the only set with only one class-only item, when the rest of them have two. This may not sound so bad at first, but when we put it in perspective, our class-set is denying us (and no other class) of our class-only affixes, which means our helm can NOT roll with +Arcane Power or Arcane Power on Crit. (Reference: IK: Mighty Weapon and Mighty Belt. -- Zuni: Voodoo Mask and Mojo. -- Natalya's: Hand Crossbow and Cape. Inna's: Spirit Stone and Daibo. Tal Rasha's: ONLY the Source.)

2- The set bonuses are not similar to those of the Triumvirate, Zuni Boots, SOJ (etc). The damage increase is not character-wide, but only to those particular elemental skills, which is ridiculous. We'd gladly take Zuni's 1st and 2nd bonus if we could.

3- The set bonuses from all other sets are better for their class (and even Wizards), especially if you compare to the closest set, which is Zuni's (130 int, +All Resist, 3rd is WD-only, not relevant). The part that should be an eye-opener is that many (if not most, I can't be sure) choose to use the 1st and sometimes 2nd bonus of Zuni's set, rather than Tal Rasha's. A smaller group chooses to go with Nat's 1st bonus, 7% crit. All of which result in a greater benefit to us than those of our own class set. The only other set that's almost as broken as ours is Inna's. Before you say it's worse... You guys -at least- get 130 Dex and you get both your class helm and weapon. We don't even get that. Monks are in a very bad place too. :(

4- The bonuses on Tal Rasha's and other gear, like Frostburn Gauntlets don't even benefit all of our skills. Hydra is one example (Don't get me started with Hydra... horribly broken skill. I have a couple bug threads on this skill too).

This is a list of Wizard elemental skills:

Spells that deal Cold damage:
Ray of Frost (215%, channeled, single target)
Frost Nova - Frozen Mist (160% over 8 seconds, aoe)
Meteor - Comet (312% + 72% over 3 seconds, aoe)
Blizzard (210% over 6 seconds, aoe)
Ice Armor - Frozen Storm (30% over 3 seconds, aoe)
Hydra - Frost Hydra (36%, cone aoe) -SINGLE RUNE- Bugged as it doesn't even benefit from the bonus.

Spells that deal Fire damage:
Shock Pulse - Fire Bolts (152% x 3, single target) -SINGLE RUNE-
Hydra (28%, single target) - -SINGLE RUNE- Bugged as it doesn't even benefit from the bonus.
Meteor (260% + 60% over 3 seconds, aoe)

Spells that deal Lightning damage:
Shock Pulse (105% x 3, single target)
Electrocute (90%, channeled, 3 targets)
Hydra - Lightning Hydra (64%, single target) -SINGLE RUNE- Bugged as it doesn't even benefit from the bonus.
Storm Armor (100%, single target)
Magic Weapon - Electrify (10%, 3 targets) -SINGLE RUNE-

Of our bonuses, the fire damage one is probably the biggest slap in the face. We only have 3 fire skills, one which is bugged. Summon Familiar doesn't really deal fire damage I think, as it doesn't proc Conflagrate. 

As you can see in the PTR thread, it has received a fair amount of responses and everyone agrees that it's severely broken. Please post in it and show your appreciation. I realize we may not achieve anything but I'd rather try than not do something about it. Thank you for your time.

~Coxis.

I've recently noticed that I don't need Force Armor in Act 1 or 2 any longer - which is great fun :)

Stats-wise I went from:
**18k HP, 20k DPS, ~75 allres** in the beginning, to:
**41k HP, 38k DPS and 175 allres** on Diablo (without Magic Weapon).

* **Always** equip gear with Magic Find right before an elite pack or boss goes down. Do the same for chests.

* Run speed is a must. 12% on shoes a minimum (worth dropping a lot of DPS for), but I tried some with 19% and suddenly the game was so much easier.

* Resistances seem to be useless in the amounts I've tried out (up to 450). I still get one shot without Force Armor. So, having to have Force Armor I rather get more DPS and run speed and thus get hit less.

* Have enough HP in Act 3 so that your Force Armor keep working properly. For me the magic barrier were at 32k HP. Some attacks will kill you through Force Armor though, learn what mobs do them.

* Diablo is easier with &gt; 40k HP, since you mostly can take a fireball (with Force Armor) if you mess up.

* Gold-wise, run through Act 3 on Hell with a max aoe build and you'll find so much gold. Do every side dungeon and loot every pot and corpse. I average around 500k gold for 1,5 hours just by looting gold and selling all items to the vendor. A few (very few) items are worth selling on AH, netting you even more.

* There's also a Resplendant Chest with 50% spawn rate in Act 3 The Keep Depths Level 1. There are three (3) different map layouts, and it takes around 10 seconds to check if it's the correct map. Just take the checkpoint and see if your map matches this layout: http://i.imgur.com/qjJLz.jpg

**Belial guide**
---------------------------

I grinded Belial for two full nights. That was possibly the toughest fight together with Diablo. There are two ways to go on that fight. For a wizard the hard part is phase 1 and 2.

One way is to have a lot of dps and just tear through Belial before he spawns his adds in Phase 2. I could not do that (my gear was way too bad) so I had to do the other way.

Second way is with Hydra (Venom) and Blizzard (Snowbound). I ran from one side of the arch to the other while kiting the adds. I did not focus on Belial at all, he will get down to 500k eventually and put you into Phase 3. Save your cooldown on Diamond Skin and Teleport past the adds when they get close to you, running to the other side of the arch. It will take some time, but after a while you'll get the running back and forth down.

Phase 3 was the hard phase before Inferno, but now it's kind of simple when you get the hang of it. Belial has got three attacks and the meteor shower. Always stand close to the right side of the arch. You can not take any hits in Act 3, don't bother stacking vitality or anything such. You decide which attack it is from the green circle on the ground.

* Attack 1 (green circle to the right of you): Belial will hit the ground where the circle is. As soon as it hits, run to where the circle was. The next two hits (one 1-armed and one 2-armed) will hit where you were standing originally. When those to hits have struck run back to your starting position.

* Attack 2 (green circle on you): Run to the right, FAST! Belial will strike one time where you stood. Get back to your original position but DON'T if there's a breath coming.

* Attack 3 (breath from right side to left): This is why you are standing on the right side. Belial will stretch a bit and lift both his arms to the side. You should already be running as far right as you can. If you do it right you won't take any damage.

* Meteor AOE: I start by standing out by the fence, and then move along the fence towards the left. Use teleport if you must and don't be afraid of standing out in the middle or close to him. Even under his arms are okay. Hurry back to your starting position, but be aware if the circle to the right of you appears, then you have to change direction to get to where he struck in time.

During all of this, your Hydra will kill him. Just put a new one every now and then, no worries. You will have to survive around 4 full laps with meteor showers.

My best tip is to go do him on Nightmare or Hell difficulty. Do Phase 3 without damaging him (remove your Templar) and keep doing it for 20 minutes until you have it down and not taking any damage at all. Then you will feel much more confident when you hit Phase 3 on Inferno.

12% run speed on boots is a must in Phase 3.

This guy do Phase 3 really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=A6ZrnR4TejE#t=89s

**Diablo guide**
-----------------------------

Alright, here's my quick and dirty Diablo-encounter guide :)

The fight was between 12 to 14 minutes long. You can't rush it too much.

I changed my build by adding Slow Time (Perpetuity rune), this made his fireballs more manageable. The damage dealers is Venom Hydra and Magic Missile with Seeker rune.

-----------------------------
**Phase 1**
-----------------------------

-- Attack 1 (one fireball toward you): This one hits the ground where you are standing doing massive damage and also creates an aoe with a wide area of effect. It's even bigger than the graphic circle on the ground, so don't get close. It is almost always a instakill if you get hit with it.

You deal with it like this:

* You are running and he misses you.
* You teleport away.
* You throw up Slow Time and smile at the opportunity to DPS the hell out of him with Magic Missile. 
* You have one of those rocks between you and he hit the rock.
* You use Diamond Skin, run and pray.

-- Attack 2 (multiple fireballs in all directions): This attack is easier to avoid, but remember that the fireballs have much bigger hit boxes than they graphically seem to have.

* You deal with this attack the same way as you deal with the first one.

-- Attack 3 (bone prisons): This is easy to avoid, always look at the ground! This attack is your friend since Diablo is standing still for a few seconds.

* Run around and take the opportunity to either DPS him (look at the ground, not Diablo), get to the other side of the map or heal up.

-- Attack 4 (teleport &amp; strike): This attack is annoying as hell but not that lethal unless you get his more dangerous melee debuff.

There's three different debuffs that you might get.

The first one increase the melee damage you get for a while, don't bother with it.

The second one reduces your healing with 50% for a while, run around to wait it out. The healing wells are not affected by this, they will always heal 100%.

The third one is the dangerous one. It puts a dot on you that will do around 3000 damage every second until it times out or you get to a Healing Well.

The teleport + melee attack will either:

* Miss you because you are running (run speed on shoes anyone?)
* Miss you because you teleport away
* Miss you because you dodge
* Do no damage because you use Diamond Skin, but might debuff you
* Do damage
* Do damage and debuff you

The tactics for Phase 1 is to keep one of the two holes with rocks between you and Diablo. Let your Hydra spew on him and lob your Seeker Magic Missiles around the rock. Be wary with angles so his fireballs don't pass the rock and kill you. When he teleports close, get away by teleport and be certain he'll throw fireballs after you. This is when Slow Time comes into use. The fireballs will be so slow that you can actually run back and dps him with Magic Missile while they are in the bubble.

When you get debuffed with the dot, Diamond Skin, Pot, Teleport to the Healing Well and stop it, then change side to the one with a full Healing Well. Rinse and repeat.

-----------------------------
**Phase 2**
-----------------------------

This phase isn't that hard actually. The dangerous part is to have your Shadow spawn on top of you and one shot you. When you notice that the shadow will spawn, throw down Hydra, Diamond Skin and be ready to teleport - anything to gain distance and then just kill it. It's very easy to kill, the Hydra will do it alone if you like to.

When Diablo is around, the most dangerous part is his fireball. Use Slow Time and Teleport to get from the top to the bottom of the map. Use the whole area and let your Hydras go to town.

-----------------------------
**Phase 3**
-----------------------------

-- Attack 5 (electricity-flame spew): Diablo roars flames after you.

* Always keep your distance and they are no trouble. Teleport if you have to run through them.

Compared to the other phases this is a cakewalk. DIABLO NO LONGER TELEPORTS! YAY! Just run back and forth and keep an eye on him on the minimap. Put out your hydra and let it grind him down. Teleport away from his new attack. Don't rush it, he'll go down.

Good luck!
-----------------------------

**After comments I had to try out Mirror Images some more and I have to say they are really good. I'd exchange Diamond Skin for them.**

1336321720.0,320,self.Diablo,t9tje,Diablo III Release - Survival Guide for Marathon Gaming,LethalFrag,444,124,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/t9tje/diablo_iii_release_survival_guide_for_marathon/,"I know many of us are excited for Diablo III's release and will be spending massive amounts of time playing as soon as the game comes out. Many of us have taken time off of work or will be spending every waking moment that we have available playing. I am writing this guide to help the community here at r/diablo get the most out of their play time.

For some background, I livestream for a living and have pulled many marathons and all night sessions playing video games. While this is considered unhealthy, there are steps you can take to optimize your bodies ability to handle the stress of being up so long.

**What you will need:**

- 1 gallon jug of water
- Apple/Orange or a 100% juice beverage of your choice
- Pre cooked, portioned or ready to eat foods.
- Healthy snacks, granola bars, fruit etc
- Caffeinated beverages

**1. Stay Hydrated**

Dehydration is the number one cause of making your body feel sluggish, without proper hydration all functions in your body decrease making you feel tired. Keeping a 1 gallon jug of water next to your gaming station will give you easy access to make sure you are running at 100%.

**2. Eat Smart**

Your body constantly churns energy to keep itself going, eating a small portion of food every 3-4 hours and snacking between that time will keep you motivated and alert. I like to pre-cook stir fries or other light snacks before I head into a epic gaming session for easy access. Lean protein such as chicken or sandwich meats are a solid way to keep your body fueled. 

**Get up and move**

While it's hard to peel yourself away from a game that you have been anticipating for over a decade, standing up and doing a few jumping jacks and stretching your legs for 2 minutes every few hours will greatly improve your energy and longevity while gaming.

**Sugar/Caffeine**

We all love energy drinks, mt dew, coffee and other things that provide us energy while we game. Moderation is key here. Slamming a 12 pack of dew in 6 hours will get you riled up to kill some demons, but 12 hours later you will be crashing.

As a general rule, I would drink 1 cup of coffee every 2-3 hours to stay awake. Caffeine is a beautiful thing, but if you get too much it will make you crash fast and hard. Using fruit juice to supplement your sugar levels is a great way to boost your energy as well as stay hydrated.

**Summary**

We all want to get the most out of our play time upon release. Ordering a pizza and grabbing a case of mt dew will be a great way to start the marathon. But after your first gaming session you will go to sleep feeling like crap, sleep longer and be less energetic when you wake up.

Plan ahead, do it up right from the first night on and you will be gaming hard all week.

This makes sense from a balance perspective and may be common knowledge, but was not the case in D2 as far as I'm aware, and I hadn't seen any discussion on it. I've only done limited testing on a monk so far, but it seems to just be tied to how big of an AoE something has; single target abilities do the full amount, small AoEs do a significant percent, and large AoEs do a negligible amount. It also depends on the rune, so runing a small AoE into a big one will reduce the life on hit/life steal per target. To give a rough idea of the values, here is what I came up with from some very quick monk testing with life on hit. I would assume that other classes see roughly the same reductions for AoEs of corresponding sizes. As a baseline, I did confirm that a normal melee swing as well as single target abilities (I used the first hit of Fists of Thunder) both applied 100% of my life on hit value.

**Way of the Hundred Fists (Windflurry rune)**

Hit 1 - 74% of actual life on hit value

Hit 2 - 9.5% (per punch)

Hit 3 - 49%

**Deadly Reach (no rune)**

Hit 1 - 85%

Hit 2 - 85%

Hit 3 - 74%


**Deadly Reach (Piercing Trident rune)**

Hit 1 - 85%

Hit 2 - 75%

Hit 3 - 49%

Lifesteal actually seems worse, or has additional calculations that I don't understand. With 1.2% lifesteal, a hit for 3141 healed for 7 hp using the first hit of Deadly Reach (Piercing Trident). Assuming lifesteal is reduced in the same way as life on hit, I would have expected a heal for ~38 hp instead. If anyone has more information on exactly how this works, I'd love to hear it! I'm also curious about things like the wizard's Healing Blades rune now; does it get the full 8% lifesteal, or is it going to be reduced by some AoE coefficient?

As the Witch Doctor stands against the ever-popular Demon Hunter:


* Less damage than DH
* Less survivability than DH
* More CC than DH


That being said, CC does not help against fast, mortar, invulnerable minions, reflects damage, vortex, or teleport, nor does it help against Lashers/general ranged mobs/leapers.


Another problem I see is ""successful"" clearing/farming strategies on the Witch Doctor.


Note: I am fully aware that these strategies are successful and result in items/clears/whatever it is that you're after.


""Viable"" Act III/IV Inferno strategies mostly consist of running into melee range to overrun enemies with the 5 seconds of survivability WDs are given using Zombie Bears, Spirit Walk, and Spirit Vessel.


This strategy forces the usage of a passive meant to save one from death, rendering the WD dead if they do not kill the targets, as Spirit Walk has already been used in the 5 seconds of DPS time.


Building tanky on the WD means that there is no significant damage output, so kiting is a must, but at no point can a WD turn and fight without dying.


Building glass cannon on the WD means that you get one-shot, so kiting is still a must; however, the WD is outshined in almost every way against ""anti-range"" mobs (mentioned above) by other ranged characters.


This next point is minor and is mostly fixed with attack speed: DHs and Wizards cast one shot and sidestep, but the WD's splinter animation locks the WD in place longer than DH and Wizard animations, making dodging harder.


All summons get one-shot.


Using the ""Viable"" DPS strategy, even if successful, will most likely get the WD killed, yet it sees more success than a standard WD kiting build, as the WD dies at a comparable frequency when played as a ranged class as intended; this is because less results are yielded when the WD is played normally, as there's less damage for equal risk.


It's still mostly possible to clear Inferno using a standard kite-splinter build, but the results are inferior to other ranged classes and even SV-Bears, which honestly doesn't feel like the way the class was meant to be played.


Even optimally, I'm unsure of whether all of Act IV can be cleared using a ranged build (Rakanoth, I'm looking at you). 


I'm missing the part where this makes my class ""too good"", and I feel like I'm being punished with the new patch.


Again, perhaps I'm just a bad player who's missing something, but I've put a lot of time and effort into trying to understand this class, trying different builds, and attempting to learn all the ins and outs of WD.

1337713139.0,314,self.Diablo,tznyq,Here's What's Wrong with Diablo 3 (Constructive Criticism),,500,186,477,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tznyq/heres_whats_wrong_with_diablo_3_constructive/,"Let me start by saying that I am enjoying the game so far, and this is not a 12 year old's whiny rant.  But here are the things I **think** could be improved upon in D3:

* 1)  I understand wanting to make the game hard, but if you want it to be hard *and* fun, you have to make players feel 'in control.'  Monsters with 5 attributes?  Great!  Monsters with 5 attributes that, when combined, make them invincible/unkillable (or make it so that you have to kite for 15 minutes)? Not fun.
       
To expand on point #1, I will list the monster attributes I think are FUN:  Waller (if you don't have some way to escape, you're probably dead, so save it for when you get walled), Morter (because you have to clump up or you are dead), Arcane Enchanted (dodging the lasers has a Mario-esque feel to it), Illusion (because it's just interesting, and can make AOE spells more fun and useful), Vortex (again, save an escape).  All of these have one thing in common: you can do something about them.


NOT FUN:  Shielding (""it's just invincible for most of the time?  so, there's nothing I can do but run?  ok...""), Plague/Molten for melee (""so you're saying... I can't fight this monster in melee range or I die?  ok..."")  The Extra health attribute is also not fun when it makes the fights draw on for 10 minutes.  I enjoy fighting beefier monsters, but within reason.  Same goes for Vampiric.  It just draws the fights out.  Diablo should be about killing lots of monsters, each one taking little time.  Not killing a few monsters over the course of 10 minutes.  That feels a lot more like an MMORPG I used to play....


So in general, the fun attributes are those that require us to **alter our behavior in order to avoid dying.**  But when that means our only choice is to run away, that's not fun.  EVERY attribute should be similar to the Arcane enchanted, where we have to adopt a new movement pattern or save a certain skill in order to avoid dying.  If the combination of attributes makes a pack of elites IMPOSSIBLE to kill, that's certainly quite difficult, but not fun at all as far as I'm concerned.  I think Blizzard could get more creative on the attributes and combinations of attributes, such that they can be extremely difficult but still doable once a player learns how to avoid the damage.  Learning to avoid multiple attributes at the same time could prove extremely fun, rewarding, and still extremely difficult.  But right now I find myself skipping certain combinations, and I can't imagine gear changing that much.


* Where's the mind control, where one of your allies temporarily grows to twice their size and turns on you, requiring you to stun and kill them (and then they snap out of it at full health.  hardcore people needn't worry)?  Diablo's shadow realm did a take on this and I think it's cool.  


* Where are the slow-moving projectiles that require you to stop what you're doing and dance?  Similar to Azmodan's fireball.  Remember Diablo's red lightning in D2?  That kind of thing!  We don't have enough of that from elite packs.  It's usually just unavoidable.

* Why isn't there a ""Summoner"" attribute, where the elite pack summons dozens/hundreds of weaker skeletons/zombies/etc and gives you a break from killing big fat elites with millions of hp?  Make it dynamic!  (People have pointed out that ""Horde"" is a variation on this.  I hadn't really noticed Horde being all that interesting, but I haven't seen it enough.  Maybe it is what I suggested here)


* Why not an attribute where the elites flash red for 2 seconds, then a reflective shield activates that reflects all incoming damage onto you?  In this case you are forced to run for a few seconds, but the difference between this and the current ""Shielding"" is that you see it coming and have to stop what you're doing to run.  Right now it happens randomly and your meteor or whatever is just wasted without notice.


* Another idea:  Give elite packs certain class-specific vulnerabilities to encourage party-play. Eg ""Takes +25% damage from Arcane damage"" (shit! we need a wizard), or ""Damage taken from arrows will stun this monster for 1-2 seconds"" (get joe in here with his DH!)  That's just one idea.  If you lacked the class for the vulnerability you could still kill the pack, but having that wizard or DH would just make it a little easier.  This would give everyone a little time in the spotlight and make them feel needed.  It's psychological.


Every single attribute should leave room for players to make a **choice** in order to stay alive.  And that choice shouldn't just be ""fuck this pack, let's skip it.""  This notion should not be forfeit when the attributes are combined.  It should just become more complicated.  Obviously, implementing this would be more difficult than simply articulating it in words, but Blizzard didn't even attempt it.  It's rather sad.  They just made inferno monsters have a TON of health and hit for a TON of damage.  Where's the fun in that?  There should be a dynamic beyond just picking your skills and grinding for items.


* 2)  Loot at low levels is boring.  Where's the Sigon's?  Where's the Treads?  Where are all the quickly-outgrown, yet still very fun, low-level uniques?  Why don't bosses drop guaranteed rares or uniques on your **first** kill?  I played through Normal, Nightmare, and Hell on my Wizard and never saw a single set or unique item.  I understand that's an anecdotal example, and I understand wanting to make sets/uniques very rare so as to not trivialize them, but within reason.


* 3)  What is the point of waypoints if I can't go forward to the next act or backward to a previous one?  Blizzard emphasized wanting to maximize players' time spent killing monsters, versus sitting in town or in the menus.  And yet if I make an A2 game and kill Belial, I have to make a new game if I want to fast forward to Diablo or rewind to the Butcher.  This is, in my opinion, extremely annoying.  I'm sure they had good reasons for this, but they're not good enough to justify the inconvenience to players.  Once I beat the game, I should be able to explore it freely without having to go back to the main menu and remake.


* 4)  Chat channels:  A lot has been said on this already, but creation of custom channels would be nice, no?  I get capping the games at 4 players.  That's fine with me.  But what's wrong with letting me chat with 8 friends at once in our own private channel?


* 5)  The auction house:  Why can't I access it in-game, for example at an auction house vendor?  I should not have to go to menus to do this.  This is a no brainer guys.

* 6) No in-game voice chat?


Ok, that's all I have for now.  There's a lot more to be said on these issues, and there are probably many more issues that haven't even occurred to me.  Please feel free to discuss the issues I listed or add to my list.  I'd like to know if I'm in the minority with my criticisms or if you all agree.

In this case I'd like to talk about the physics as well as relating other stuff.
I for one am still quite impressed here and now when I see a dead unit, e.g. within the Cursed Tower, slowly slide of the cliff and submerge into darkness. Or watching the spinning Crossbow of my DH smash into some walls after my hero got blown up.
Crumbling Walls, lots of exploding monsters and guts flying all over the place, corpses being dragged behind whirlwinds, skeletons smashed out of a monsters body (or vice versa and just the skeleton remains, as often the case with those digging worms) - it's all just pretty great to great at.

Of course this isn't just physics.
The amount of great death animations, smooth gameplay and physics, combined you just get this very nice general gameplay feeling.
That stuff also makes this game feel remarkably meaty and powerful.
You cannot even compare the impact of a Barbarians attack in D3 to D2. It's a world of difference.

And the nice thing is, the physics-freakouts are a negligible rarity, which I suppose means the polishing and optimization is quite good.
If you wonder what I'm talking about, in a lot of ragdoll-physics implementation in games physic objects get stuck in places they shouldn't get into and then freak out. A good example for that is Dead Space. When you take a Necromorph corpse within an elevator chances are high some arms and legs of it will twitch rapidly when stuck within the door.

So yeh, just always wanted to give Blizzard some praise for this and wonder if more people share my view on this.

On a side note, the physics engine in Diablo 3 is self made (at first they used Havok). Now Starcraft HotS is also going to use a new physics engine made from scratch which will allow for much cooler stuff than is currently available in WoL, really looking forward to that!

As someone who has played all of the blizzard games, like many I've been pretty jaded with the company lately. After burning out on WoW, and playing SC2 for less than a month and getting bored, all the news about Diablo III certainly was a shock. But after watching all the Jay Wilson interview videos, and actually hear their reasoning behind the changes they've decided on, things now make a lot more sense.

Looking back at when Diablo 2 first came out, I remember people complaining on forums about how the new battle.net was going to work being open and closed ladder systems. And if I recall, Diablo 2 turned out pretty damn good. It wasn't a perfect game, but the changes they made, made sense at the time. And all the changes to D3, at this current time, make sense. I get that with the online thing, there're people that are now not going to be able to enjoy the game. But the greedy part of me is going to love the hell of all the benefits of online-only. Disagree all you want, but I am going to buy and enjoy this game. :D


**UPDATE**: Really glad to see all the positive feedback about the game. I'm sure people will still flock to it in numbers once it's released. I still remember the days when people were saying how hard WoW was going to fail due to one reason or another, but not feeling deterred. I think one thing we can say for sure is that Blizzard is always in favor of change for the better. They may catch a lot of shit at times for making changes to systems people have already grown to love. For the people who can't adapt to change, there's still Torchlight 2; which in my opinion, will be a good game, and brought with it may innovations into the genre. But for me, Diablo 3 is going to be where it's at.",,False,self,t5_2qore,True,,witchdoc-americas,True,t3_j6xhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/j6xhj/am_i_alone_in_actually_being_happy_about_how_d3/,

Edit: A common argument about this states you can just go kill zombies in Act I.  I respond with this: there is a major difference between an infinite hit point stationary target and an inferno monster trying to eat your face.  It just isn't a good argument against this, please stop using it.

Edit2: Test Dummies would allow you to smooth out crit spikes and procs.  If I go kill 20 zombies in Act I I could see a long string of crits that is really going to skew my data.  But doing a minute long 'fight' with a TD will even those spikes out.  Seeing how procs behave is not just helpful with your own play-style, it also can find bugs (such as certain procs not living up to their listed chance).

Edit3: Guys, come on, it isn't like I am suggesting we add an npc that you have to use to change skills or a confirmation box when you are about to salvage blue items.  This would be completely like the AH.  You don't have to use it.  Sure it will help you decide on a build and make you a stronger player (just like the AH can) but you all sound like a bunch of 8 year olds that doesn't want the neighborhood park installing a sand box because you don't like sand near your tire swing or slide.  There is nothing wrong with taking the good parts of other parks (WoW, SC2) and adding them to our park.

Edit4: I am not wanting to find my dps.  Why are you all assuming this?  Oh that's right, because of your background with WoW.  We already have a read out for dps in our inventory.  I want it to compare how a skill changes with different gear or to figure out the math behind how dots and damage over time spells work.  Something that is hard to do when you use mobs outside of town.  You did notice that not all zombies are created equal right?  Some have more health than others (which could lend itself to them having different resists and armor as well).  We need something static we can use as a good control to number crunch this stuff.  How many of you who are complaining about don't make this like WoW go to websites looking for the skill mechanics behind something you want to use?  Do you think this stuff just magically appeared on these sites?  No, it took people a lot of time testing this stuff.

Diablo II, oh how I've given you hours of my life.
From ""I will purge this land of the shadow"" to Baal's pained screams as he died, it has been one super fun click fest. How many times did I re-roll over the years. The late nights of farming. One more pindle run. Another damn crappy druid torch. The eth bugging. The gasp of excitement every time a unique ring drops... shit another manald. Perming my games so I could mule. That one time I found a ber on my own in chaos sanctuary from a death knight. Getting banned for maphack. Running a bot for a few weeks just to see if I could and then getting bored because I had all the wealth I ever wanted at my fingertips. Logging in months later to see all accounts had expired, saying oh well and starting back up.
It's that itch, way back in your head, that you can scratch, but oh, you can't get rid of. I feel it from time to time, and D2 is always there, waiting for me to return.

1352853847.0,304,self.Diablo,135jc1,The possessed: A different take on the common idea of a shapeshifting new class.,Syreniac,385,81,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/135jc1/the_possessed_a_different_take_on_the_common_idea/,"[&gt;&gt;&gt;NOW WITH ADDED BATTLE.NET POST&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7004408324?page=1#1)

After seeing yet another post about how druids could work in D3, and whilst not agreeing that the game needs a druid, I do understand the passion for a class that can shapeshift. I also feel that the game could do with another class that uses strength, but pretty much every standard fighter-y archetype is covered by the barbarian.

So here is my attempt at a plausibly strength based class, that shapeshifts and has (in my opinion, of course) a unique flavour of its own. Most of the numbers are missing, but the concepts are there. Apologies for the long post, I got a little carried away with my ideas.

TL;DR: It's a person sharing a body with a demon **and** an angel, with two alternative forms where the angel and demon are allowed to take over the body of the human. The angel form vaguely corresponds to the druid's wolf form, and the demon form does likewise with the bear form. There's also a bit of summoning magic in there as well, and new version of Armageddon/Fissure. And Fist of the Heavens comes back.

&gt; **The Backstory.**

Tal Rasha was most famous amongst the Horadrim not just for his leadership, but for his selfless sacrifice to imprison Baal. Yet he was not the first; merely the latest in a long history of using the bodies of humans to contain the spirit of demons.

Millenia before the Horadrim and even the dark exile, demons and angels walked sanctuary together in peace. This could not last however, and Inarius and Lilith soon came into conflict, each rousing their followers to war. Eventually this would lead to the discovery of Sanctuary and Inarius's imprisonment by the Prime Evils, but the conflict was not stopped. Angels and demons still strode the world, and the Nephalem, made weak by the retuned Worldstone, could barely stand before them.

The Nephalem, or their descendents continued to be ravaged by these planar beings for years and the greatest amongst them tried in vain to undo the damage; even Imris, the greatest sage of the day, was lost trying to learn the lore of the Worldstone to save the Nephalem.

In their darkest hour, a select few of the Nephalem decided on a unthinkable course of action; to bind the rampant demons and angels within their own bodies. The myths grow cloudy at this time, and the exact events are unclear, but this much is known; within a few decades, all the supernatural beings left in sanctuary were bound in this way. In each volunteer, the Nephalem bound a single angel and a solitary demon, hoping that their conflict would prevent them escaping the host.

The Nephalem could not kill those carrying such burdens; to do so, would be to unleash the vengeful spirits back into the world. Instead, they carved out vaults deep beneath the earth, and imprisoned the possessed within them. Sealed far below, the nephalem believed that they would remain undisturbed, forever.

With the turmoil of recent events, most importantly the cataclysmic events at Arreat, a few of these vaults have been breached. Many of those imprisoned within died fighting to contain their charges, many were not so lucky. Those that remain now wander the world they once gave so much to save, hoping that once again, they will there in the darkest hour.

&gt; **Gameplay:**

The possessed have little need of dexterity, and intelligence is not important to them. What they need is the raw strength of body and soul to maintain control over the raging spirits within and put their physical mutations to best use. The abilities they use are drawn from the two conflicted spirits within themselves, one angel and one demon.

Their resource is called Essence, and they have two separate pools of it, Light and Dark, similar to a Demon Hunter's two different resources. However, the way each resource is generated is through spending the other (e.g. if you spend 5 Light Essence, you regain 5 Dark Essence). Instead of simply regenerating or degenerating like normal resources, the resources continually move towards being balanced (i.e. the one that's at less than half regenerates, whereas the other degenerates). Upon spawning in, each resource is already half full. This means that even if you had a build purely of spending one resource, you'd still be able to use your abilities, albeit not as efficiently as someone using a more balance mixture.

*Please, for the sake of the genre, and all that is holy, don't let your complaints about D3 lead you to promote D2's worst gameplay elements.*

D3's Auction House is a huge change to the genre.  By lowering the barriers of trade, players are selling (trading) shit that would have previously been vended, as it was far too time-consuming to sit in chat spamming non-ideal gear.  By allowing players to easily buy and sell great gear, it becomes less unlikely to find good gear on your own during progression, if you've been using the AH.

The problem is not the RMAH, as you can easily crush Inferno using 100k to 1M gold on the regular AH.

The problem is not entirely the mere presence of the AH, as the NA HC AH doesn't suffer from nearly the deflation of the softcore AH, due to the smaller player-base and less magic find (using it is far more risky, and MF swapping is even rarer).

The problem is not that ""drops are bad"".  It is statistics, and you are facing the same statistics as everybody else, and those that were in D2 for its random items.  It is now just more focused on random loot rather than pre-designed uniques and runewords.  

However, the hatred of D3 has gotten so extreme, and I think it is leading people to hype up D2's more annoying aspects.  Path of Exile, which is clearly aiming for the D2 crowd, has...

- Very limited respecs

- FFA loot

- Excessive inventory Tetris (i.e. bosses that drop 3x what can fit in your inventory).

- A pure barter system, that is going to be extraordinarily difficult to balance without massive inflation.  Orbs of Inflation.

- ID system; everything is unidentified, requiring non-purchasable scrolls to even see what affixes they have, which does not at all gel with the design of having 20+ blues drop from bosses.

Honestly, are these all things people missed about D2?  I suspect that they are holdovers out of pure myopia, and it hurts to see PoE take such an approach, when it could be better on D3 on the back of its gameplay systems and end-game mechanics, rather than by making the interface cumbersome and punishing experimentation.

I have noticed that over the past couple of weeks many people have been unsure of what will sell in the auction house. In response to this I refered them to this [outdated google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AoEU_oBnESrOdElTaVBhZTVFbEYwYzlqbHZJeXk1dGc&amp;amp;amp;pli=1#gid=0) (credit goes to  kolchin04 for creating this) that had values back from 1.0.5.

1361465810.0,295,self.Diablo,18yna4,"Dear Money,",I_Miss_Old_Diablo,530,235,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/18yna4/dear_money/,"Dear Money,

 Now that we've ignored your feedback for months and we aren't making as much money on the RMAH as we hoped, I would like to take a step back and discuss how we can molest your wallets more effectively.

 We've had an enormous amount of complaints since the launch. I speak for everyone at Blizzard when I say that you are loud and annoying and we hate you. We truly believe ""Every Dollar Matters,"" so I want to thank you for sharing your experiences in an effort to help us figure out how to be more subtle in our gouging. Your money makes it possible for us to continue developing Brother Kotick's vision of a micro transaction utopia, and we never take that for granted.

 The launch week of Diablo III was obviously a debacle. The positive was that we made nine-hundred trillion dollars, the not so positive is that you couldn't play the game. We were thrilled that Diablo III made all of the money ever (topping even our most recent debacle). We've been so floored by the response that we all took three week vacations in small island countries and bought BMWs with toilets built into the seats. Frank Little in accounting bought a lifetime subscription to Cherry Trees Weekly. Guy's weird.

 The launch had many challenges, chief among those being our insistence on always-online, our inability to properly gauge demand, our logistical incompetence in meeting demand and our unwillingness to spend the money necessary to ensure that we only ""double it"" when it comes to untested game mechanics, never to hardware infrastructure. However, I do not wish to apologize for the misstep--after all, it wasn't us who crashed our servers for three days straight. You did that. We will do our absolute minimum to conquer this for future releases if we feel like it.

 In response to the immediate and overwhelming demand for a faithful followup to Diablo II, the team did everything they should have done a month previous to allow players to play the game they paid for. Despite these efforts, you keep crashing our servers by your insistence on playing the game. Rather than address this directly, I'll just say that even as we work to drive you away from the game and into the less-hardware-intensive Auction Houses, it's a sure bet your hardcore characters will die from lag spikes and server outages. We hope that our actions in the past have demonstrated that above all else, we're committed to keeping you paying for anything we make, no matter how rotten and cynical it actually is. Have faith and you will be rewarded. With $5.

 We are not satisfied with only making nine-hundred trillion dollars; we want people to continue paying for Blizzard games for a very long time. The Diablo III team has made a passable, lukewarm and aesthetically pleasing experience. As such, our teams are working hard to fill in the gaps with all sorts of ancillary stuff. Kind of like how the frog DNA in Jurassic Park filled in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA and caused the dinosaurs to spontaneously change sexes. This is why Diablo is a woman. Because of the frogs.

 You've seen some of that work already in patch 1.0.7, and you'll see additional ""improvements"" with patch 1.0.8. On the game balance front, this update will contain changes designed to further treat this game like WoW. We know that the ""2 trillion builds"" we touted before launch was perhaps a bit optimistic, but we would realistically like to get that number up to five. Maybe six. Per class. Another topic we’ve seen actively discussed is the fact that better, more distinct Legendary items are needed. We agree. I have no explanation whatsoever for why a lot of legendary items have been useless for months, but Patch 1.0.8 will include new and improved Legendary items that are more interesting, more powerful, and more epic in ways you probably (hopefully) won’t be expecting, like extra frost damage or reflects damage back at attacker.

 We're also working on a number of features that already exist, such as chatting with your friends, joining their games and seeing their achievements. In addition, we will be constantly improving the auction house since we know that's like super duper important to you all. This is how your money is being used. Thought you should know.

 Regarding the real-money auction house, our primary goal for including this in the game was to provide convenience and peace of mind for those players who might otherwise turn to third-party services to buy items. Unfortunately that goal got lost when the guy in charge of itemization, Ned, had a stroke and the part of his brain that makes game design decisions leaked out his ears and into his cereal. Also, Ned has a hard time eating cereal anymore because the brains made him sick. Pray for Ned, please. 

Anyway, the RMAH was created to protect you. We needed to keep you safe from the big, scary black market sites that all of you would, of course, be going to for items you couldn't find in-game because of Ned and his bad choices. It was never our intention for you to feel like the auction house is mandatory, so stop feeling like that. What are you, an idiot? We did it for your own good! Now you understand and we can all move on together.

 One other common topic we’ve seen in the forums is the always-connected experience, and the perception that the online requirement is nothing but an ineffective form of copy protection that has already been cracked. While we’ve never said that this requirement guarantees that there will be no cheating or game cracks, we did strongly imply it was necessary because of all the cheating and cracks in Diablo II. Seeing that cheating and cracks still exist, we would like to divert your attention to this cute bunny: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Rabbit_in_montana.jpg

 Diablo III's always-connected requirement is necessary for, like, the integrity of the experience. If someone knows what that means, please email us. It's also necessary for us to support you playing with your friends (even if you don't have any), because we don't want you doing that yourself via a LAN. LANs are scary. A LAN once ate my friend. It's true. Look it up.

 I know many of you are also looking forward to patch 1.1, our arena PvP update, which will come out in maybe 6 more months. We wouldn't want to just flip the switch and let people just attack each other. That would be a disaster! Instead, the arena PvP we will provide will create a wonderful, controlled and constrained arena combat experience which will satisfy WoW players, which seems to be our primary demographic for some weird reason. For now, you can just accept brawling as our apology for the shit we stepped in.

 We're also doing some other things and stuff. It's going to be awesome. We can't give out any specifics but get excited!

 As always, we pretend to care about your feedback and do whatever we want regardless. Just think of us as Congress. The Congress of Fun™, Suck on that!

 Always yours my sweet, sugary doves,

 Mike Morhaime

Population 1: Rares that drop from boss kills with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks

Population 2: Rares that drop from boss kills with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks

**Sample 1:**

200 runs of Warrior's Rest Inferno with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks while only picking up drops that came specifically from the boss kill Data:

Rares found = 71

4 affix rares found = 41

5 affix rares found = 26

6 affix rares found = 4

**Sample 2:**

200 runs of Warrior's Rest Inferno with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks while only picking up drops that came specifically from the boss kill Data:

Rares found = 214

4 affix rares found = 131

5 affix rares found = 68

6 affix rares found = 15

Affix count was determined using the recent exploit found to view the item chat data again.

**Excel Spreadsheet:**  http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4cjjbij91xafua1

**Noteworty observations:**

* The boss kill never dropped damaged (grey) equipment (even with 0% mf).  This could suggest that the final elite kill drops from a separate drop table.

* The boss kill always dropped 3 or 4 equippable items (average of 3.5075 drops per boss kill)

* There wasn't a single 3 affix item that dropped.  Do they exist besides from crafts?

## Statistical Test to compare two population proportions:

H0:p2 = p1

HA:p2 &gt; p1

Where p1 is the true population proportion of 5 or 6 affix rares from boss kills with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks
and p2 is the true population proportion of 5 or 6 affix rares from boss kills with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks

alpha = .1

n1 = 71

n2 = 214

p1hat = (26+4)/71 = .4225

p2hat = (68+15)/214 = .3879

phat = (26+4+68+15)/(71+214) = .3965

**Test Statistic:**

Z = (p2hat - p1hat)/sqrt(phat*(1 - phat)*(1/n1 + 1/n2))

Z = (.3879 - .4225)/sqrt(.3965*.6035*(1/71 + 1/214))

Z = -0.5165

Z~N(0,1)

p-value = P(Z &gt; -0.5165) = .6972

Our p-value &gt;&gt; alpha, so there is not sufficient sample evidence to support the claim that p2 &gt; p1. That is, there is not sufficient sample evidence to support the claim that magic find (when applied to drops from bosses) increases the proportion of 5+ affix rares found.

## Other notes:

The same holds true for magic items.

If we assume that the proportion of 4, 5 and 6 rares are equal regardless of mf and the prportion of 1 and 2 magic items are equal regardless of mf then we can lump the data together and obtain the following 95% simultaneous bonferroni confidence intervals for affix proportions from boss kills (calculations in data spreadsheet above):

**Magic items:**

* 1 affix (0.0696, 0.1234)

* 2 affix (0.8766, 0.9304)

**Rare items:**

* 4 affix (0.5361, 0.6709)

* 5 affix (0.2650, 0.3946)

* 6 affix (0.0323, 0.1010)

## Still todo:

It's still possible that mf affects affix count from nv guaranteed rares or from normal mob drops.  I will be collecting data on that in the future.

Please let me know if I'm not thinking of something or if you see any erros in my calculations/thought process.
Also, if anyone else has any clean boss kill data or wants to gather some, that would help in shrinking those affix count confidence intervals and helping determine the actual values of those proportions.


## EDIT:

First of all I want to say thank you to everyone that has commented and brought up things that I had not considered.

I'd like to collect more data to get a more definitive understanding of exactly how mf affects drops and this conversation seems like a good starting point.  

I wish I could change my title at this point, but it is what it is.  If a moderator can change it to ""A discussion of magic find statistics"" I'd appreciate it.

I did a few more calculations and my data can only really say that, as a rough estimate, 234% mf leads to an increase of 8% or less (from ~43% to ~51%) for 5+ affix rares (keeping p-value below .05).  That is using the 0% mf proportions assumed in Stasis5001's post.

There is not nearly enough data here to rule out the situation described by Stasis5001.


I know I can't collect enough data myself and if anyone would be willing to do runs in the way I did for my data collection to help get a larger data set it would be beneficial to everyone.  If you collect any data, please message it to me here on Reddit and I will compile it into a google spreadsheet for everyone to see (If I get enough data I'll post it in a new topic).  

Here is an Auto Hot Key script I used to quickly copy the item chat data to notepad:

http://www.mediafire.com/?9zbtfi07jxmhtlg

The script is written for playing in windowed (fullscreen) mode with an open text file named ""Items found.csv"" as the first window selected on alt-tab.

I just watched about 7 people cycle through my SK game because of shielding/mortar minions, the original players even had 3 stacks of NV. 

It's just stupid to have minions that are so impossible the game empties, and if people manage to hang around and whittle them to death it'll cost them thousands in repairs, probably 15-30 minutes of game time, and for no added benefit that would make the effort worth it. 

The point of the game is to be challenging, not cause people to leave. How about shielding minions can't move when they're shielded, and invulnerable minions move extra slow? Make shielding/invulnerable susceptible to elemental damage? At least something because right now it's not even close to fair. 

I just left a game where I they had extra fast also, which meant I couldn't outrun them *and they could melee me while I was running away from them*, I couldn't tumble away from them, I couldn't SS away from them, I couldn't attack them.

In Diablo 2, I remember the following rewards from completing quests. There are probably some that I forgot: 

* Imbue a weapon of your choice at the blacksmith. You would find a good quality white weapon and the blacksmith would make it rare, with a good chance to roll great stats.

* Gain a skill point 

* Gain 5-10 stat points

* The Horadric Cube, which could be used to open the Secret Cow Level, upgrade items of a lower tier to a higher tier, craft different items, upgrade gems and so on. Pretty much the same functions that Haedrig and Covetus serve.

* Mephistos soulstone which, when smashed, had a high chance of dropping great runes and gems.

* Adding a socket to an item.

* Adding your own name to an item.

* Receiving a scroll of resistance that added a permanent +10 to all resistances.

* Receiving a health potion that added a permanent +20 HP.

* Sometimes quests would give you a rare item. One would give you a rare ring. 

* And of course the different followers.

Now, all of these mentioned rewards were given at each difficulty (normal, nightmare, hell). So, while all of these rewards weren't always  useful, they were definitely fun and made the quests so much more interesting to complete. There was even a point in making a character just for certain quest rewards (like the added sockets, smashing mephistos soulstone and imbuing a weapon at hell difficulty). These rewards were also sometimes used when trading. Like ""You get the drops from destroying mephistos soulstone if you boost me"" or something similar.

Those type of rewards made the gaming experience much better and more interesting. You actually looked forward to completing certain quests because of the rewards. Now it feels as if you need to get through, so you can farm the highest difficulty :S

I just don't understand why they would not include any real quest rewards. Thoughts?

Expectations around end game content should not be the same. However, we have all discussed ways to improve the end game that wouldn't fall into WoW/MMORPG end game content.

Random events stand out to me as the biggest end game content failure in Diablo 3. The rewards are not good enough, their locations are too defined, and there are not enough of them with varying degrees of rarity.

Why varying rarity?
--------------------
First, I think rarity is more important than challenge. All can be difficult, and sure, the most rare can be the most difficult. But that doesn't mean difficulty variation has to be dramatic. We need to experience common random events with below avg rewards, rare events with good rewards.. and extremely rare events with amazing rewards. This will keep us feeling satisfied and excited when the most rare events happen.

Why better rewards?
--------------------
There needs to be an incentive to do the actual event, when it is found, other than just looking for elite packs and goblins like we do everywhere else in the game.

Why random locations are important?
--------------------
A random event does not require a physical location. It does not have to be a door that opens in a structure that always exists on the game map. It can be an NPC that opens a portal, which can happen anywhere on the map. This is so important! Having an NPC that can spawn anywhere on the map means that bots and full-time farmers are not hitting the exact same zones over and over. It also means that legitimate players are experiencing as much of the map as possible. As far as implementation, here's no reason that an icon can't show up in a zone after a certain amount of time, letting the player know that a random event is in the area. This doesn't have to show up on the map, it could just be a friendly notice. It shouldn't be instantaneous, then people will just waypoint around the map then creating a new game. Maybe after you kill an elite pack in the zone?

Implementation
--------------------
For simplicity, Blizzard can leave the current random location events alone and create a new category for these random NPC/portal based events (Legendary Events or whatever). Entirely new content that does not have map limitations and can be added on without dramatically changing existing infrastructure.

Once the template is created, they can drop in new art.. monsters.. scripts.. stories.. etc. into this system. There's no reason this can't be done, and it is a step in the right direction for a dungeon crawler like D3.",Idea,False,self,t5_2qore,False,idea,,True,t3_vzy9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vzy9k/one_end_game_content_solution_in_response_to/,

I took the criticism ""its too dark"" heavily in the redesign, hopefully it's better on the eyes.

If you noticed, it practically mimics the battle.net interface we've been shown.

Cons: the first time you load, you will need to download 900kb of data. This is primarily because of the background image, and the fact that reddit only accepts png images for use... (which is really dumb).

So, shall I migrate the theme over? Or should we keep the current theme? Have a suggestion?

EDIT: What is your internet speed? D:

-------

Based on the majority of comments, I'm in the process of transferring it over. The current theme will be backed up.

A chart that displays each act and difficulty. The yellow portion is what I'm guessing is Blizzard's ideal leveling curve.

Note that at 30% or less, +exp and +%exp no longer functions.

Expanded explanation;

This chart provides you with how much experience your character will receive when killing monsters in certain areas. The ""Min"", ""Mid"", and ""Max"" columns represent lowest, average (rounded), and highest monster levels in the act. So if you are level 50 and kill a level 50 monster, you get 100% of the exp, change your level to 60 when killing the level 50 monster and you get 0% of the exp.

* char level +10 or more of monster level = 0%
* +9 = 1% (+exp effects nullified)
* +8 = 5% (+exp effects nullified)
* +7 = 15% (+exp effects nullified)
* +6 = 30% (+exp effects nullified)
* +5 = 45%
* +4 = 60%
* +3 = 70%
* +2 = 80%

We don't need a ton of ""Are you nerfing inferno?"", ""X class is bad, are you going to buff/nerf"". I know it is going to get asked regardless... and probably answered. 

If you REALLY have to know something pertaining to your class try something like ""It feels like my monk must be built in a very specific way, and I need very specific items to progress in the game, is there any way this is going to be addressed in the future?""

By making chests respond to MF from NV stacks and Paragon levels ONLY, this will eliminate the desire to gear-swap but still give us a reason to open chests!  Hope Blizz are listening...

They were saying that he was a liar and were demanding proof. To me this sounded completely possible, and even sounded like a very cool challenge. I bought a set of gear with 100K gold and ended up with 33K DPS with 7K HP (this was actually expensive day 1). I also took the challenge a step further, deciding to do a complete Inferno clear without skipping any elites. 

I streamed the entire run, resulting in a nice 15-hour video of demon hunting. There were some pretty cool elite kills (phasebeasts,oppressors,soul lashers). Only 2 elite packs were skipped, which I considered impossible. I also compiled the all of the boss kills into one video:

**Mega Extremely Super Duper Fuck You Edit:**

So Blizz implemented a game creation limitation within a certain amount of time. After some testing, it's been noted that I can do at max maybe 10 runs for any single group every so often. This obviously kills the method I was using to get people back on their feet. IF someone has a suggestion as to where I could possibly start helping people again and not meet the limitation, please mention it in a PM to me. As of this very minute I am not proceeding forth with anymore group invites sadly as they seem extremely pointless in the long run. IF something becomes available and is brought to my attention I'll happily resume my ""helping spree."" Sorry for anyone that didn't receive help, very sorry. :(

**READ THE ABOVE EDIT BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER, THANK YOU.**

I'm planning on staying up all night to help those that've lost characters tonight and might need any waypoints or a quick SK &gt; butcher run in normal to attempt to catch up easier. All you have to do is add me and send me a message with what you need done and I'll do my best to get that shit done.

**These are the people helping thus far:**

AngryPanda#1272 (50+ baba)

Bowlthizar#1549 (50+ WD)

LN8#1107 (35+ wizard) 

------------

**edit:** feel free to spread this around, the more people I can help after blizzard's fuck up tonight, the better. I know it's not much, but if it helps even a couple people I'll be happy. :)

**edit:** I went to eat with my gf after helping a person so this was actually cut short as I passed out afterwards because i'm a fatty. I'll be helping people all throughout today/tonight to make up for it. Sorry to anyone I didn't help last night.

**edit:** How I'm doing this. I'm just killing ZK over and over all day. Add me and join on me. First come first serve or until people are 25. From here they are on their own. It takes ~9 runs to go from 24-25 if anyone is curious, thanks to d3luxe in game for this info. 

------------

**Important Edit #1:** I apparently have something to go to tonight so I will unfortunately not be capable of doing this until maintainence hits tonight (if it does). Instead, a player by the name of LN8 has offered to take over if he can get high enough to do so. Due to this, if I can i'll be leveling him to 40+ so the helping can continue throughout the night. I might be doing this more on tuesday but highly doubt it will continue on wednesday due to personal limitations on how many times I can beat ZK's face into the stone floor. ^_^

-----------

**Important Edit #2:** I am done for today, I have to leave for something that came up and will possibly be picking this back up tomorrow sometime in the evening if enough people need help still. If I don't hear back from enough people then I'll probably stop and go back to playing my baba as per normal. Here's some interesting stats for today: 

I've made 940k helping people.
I've gained 3 levels since I started the other night immediately after the lag.
I've acquired 3 legendary items during the runs and given away every rare I found as well as any blues that may have been good.

*hopefully anyone that reads this see that there are things to gain from helping others.* :)

Here are a few ""rules"" I can't shake off, even though that tiny rational part of my mind knows they are obviously and utterly false:

* **The harder the champ pack, the shittier the loot** - You're on your regular farming run and suddenly a champ pack, harder than it has any right to be, wakes you out your trance. By killing you. You race back. And die again. Now that thing is gonna get it. With an odd sense of satisfaction you kill those champs ... and they drop a single ilvl58 rare.

* **Finding bad legendaries is worse than finding no legendaries at all** - Not only is it more disappointing than christmas, it *feels* totally unlikely to get another one any time soon.

* **When your friend fiends a legendary, you expect to get one soon, too** - Because this game is nothing but fair, right?

* **Legendaries drop in clusters** - There are days when you find a legendary behind every other corner ... and then there are days when you don't find any at all. So finding one early after starting playing increases your chances of finding more.

* **The vendor is out to scam you** - Wait, that rare I just vendored looked kinda good. Better check the buy back tab. Nah, it's crap. Or was it? Better check again.

* **Can't quit now, there's bound to be a good drop in this next part**  - Sometimes I feel 90% of the game's appeal is [gambler's fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy).

Therefore we had around 2000 Unid Ammys. So this past weekend we did a fundraiser with those unid ammys, and [some full kits that we built](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/15aebb/childs_play_autism_charity_auction_2000_unid/).  


The end result was astonishing, together we raised $1836.8 for the two charities, Child's Play and Autism Research. 

Here's the breakdowns, we received $1,392.81 through the [chipin donations](http://charityauction.chipin.com/charity-auction), around $900 of which were pure donations, and the rest were payments for set auctions and ammy auctions ($160 for a barb set, $120 for a wizard set, 5$ charity uber carries and some other stuff as well). We also received about 1 Billion in game gold for auctions and raffles. Instead of selling them on the RMAH and having Blizzard taking a big bite out of it, I decided to convert it to cash myself by buying the gold with $444 USD for a grand total of $1836.   

Top Three Donors:

Vincent W.: $409 USD

Issac K. $222.22 USD

Jason P. $90 USD


The final amount was evenly divided to the two charities with 918.4 USD to each.

I was able to donate directly to [Child's Play](http://charityauction.chipin.com/charity-auction), and [here is the receipt](http://i.imgur.com/vQ4OM.jpg)


[Autism Research Institute](http://www.autism.com/) only accepted donations from US Paypal, and my paypal is Canadian. So I ended up [gifting the money to Archon the Wizard](http://i.imgur.com/IASp9.jpg) (He streams purely for Autism research and this whole charity event was his idea). Archon donated the 918.4USD on my behalf and here is the [receipt](http://imgur.com/vQ4OM,Rmc9g#1). 

I am very glad and proud that the diablo 3 community both on twitch and this subreddit were able to unite and make this charitable act a reality. So to celebrate this accomplishment and to reciprocate the acts of generosity and kindness I will be giving away 5 MP10 Barb Sets each valued at 150M Plus. These giveaways will happen through out the day on www.twitch.tv/cdxliv One will occur exactly at 2PM EST which is 5.5Hours from this post so you don't need to spend too long waiting. 

Once again, I would like to thank everyone who participated in this charity event, all those people who farmed for Ammys, all those who bought raffle tickets and donated, and of course my moderators who ensured the donations ran smoothly. You guys are awesome and you have made the world a brighter place. 

P.S. I gave away 2 sets, and started having some connection issues so one my mods is taking over the stream till later and he will give away a WD and Monk set, the other 3 Barb sets will be given out when I can stream again. Technical Difficulties Suck.

Edit: Cross-posted with another good guide, check this one out too: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vgckk/act_1_elite_farm_route_guide/

Here's what I do, and I believe it to be close to optimal. Please let me know if you have tips or feedback though! 

**Statistics:** 1 run takes me ~35 minutes, including vendoring. I've averaged a bit under 1 ilvl 63 rare per run, and LOTS of gold, ilvl 61-62 rare armor, excuisite essences, and perhaps most interestingly rare rings and amulets.

I use a wizard with wormhole teleport to move quickly speed and 195% base MF. I use a shield to minimize ""oh @*#(^#"" moments and still kill fast enough

**item Pick-up philosophy:** Too many trips to town can kill run speed. I pick up all ilvl 61+ items, all blue items (easy to figure out vendor/sell/AH), and ignore all rare weapons and most rare armor under ilvl 61.

**Guide:**

Step 0) Start a game using ""The Imprisoned Angel - The Cursed Hold"" quest per a normal butcher run. Once the game starts, WP to the northern highlands and run west. If the watch tower didn't spawn (25-50% spawn rate dungeon with 1-6 elite mobs, 0-1 resplendant chests, and 0-1 treasure goblins) re-make the game. If it did spawn, we'll come back with 5 stacks (since treasure goblins respond to stacks). 

Edit: here's a pic of what to look for. It's often a bit further from the WP, but always on that western edge: http://i.imgur.com/dNOng.jpg

Step 1) Go to the festering woods. There are 2 guaranteed small dungeons with a champion pack in each. You should find at least 1 champion in the area. Town portal out and way point back in-between.

Step 2) With 2-3 (probably 3) stacks, go to the cemetery. There are 3 small dungeons each with 1-2 champions. Since they might only have one, leave (town portal -&gt; waypoint) as soon as you kill the first). This gets you to 5 stacks. Clear all the tombs even if you get 5 early. 

Edit/update: A commenter says you can get guaranteed rares from the mini-quests in the crypts with 5 stacks, so consider saving them for after you have 5 stacks as well. 

Step 3) WP to leoric's manner. Run through the manner (0-1 packs) and outside. The courtyard has a guaranteed pack.

Step 4) Butcher run as normal. You'll get several packs, maybe a goblin or two and the warden and butcher drop well enough to be worth killing.

Step 5) WP back to the northern highlands and clear the watch tower.

Step 6) Optional - go to each other WP and check for very close / obvious champion packs.

**A note on large areas:** As far as I know, most large areas spawn with 1-3 champion or elite packs. For that reason it's rarely worth searching after you've found one. Even if on average each has 2, it takes a long time to run around an entire map if you find nothing. 

**But what about act 3?**

I'm still not sure what the actual efficiency of act 1 vs. act 3 will be. Act 3 is **SO** much harder that it will always be slower and riskier. The drop rates are also only marginally better. I think the overwhelming majority of players, even those who have cleared inferno diablo, will now see the best returns on their times running act 1 at blazing speed.

2. edit Character, Character level, Monster level;
3. edit all equipment stats, you don't have to sum anything together, simply enter them as you see on your item (except for gems, add stats from them to the item stats);
4. check that calculated values (gray tables) match what you see in game;
5. enter stats from a new item to the right of current item stats and note how your survivability and damage changes;
6. optionally, edit formulas in the gray tables, to account for various buffs (e.g. for enchantress +15% armor skill, edit U9 to ""=T9\*1.15"" and W9 to ""=V9\*1.15"");
7. optionally, press ""Diablo → Rank equipment"" from the top menu and those two colors, to the right of item names, will change, to reflect how good each item is at defense and offense.

1340305400.0,281,self.Diablo,ve8l7,A Diablo 3 Item Primer,DelphicProphecy,362,81,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ve8l7/a_diablo_3_item_primer/,"After seeing quite a few people worried and confused about the stat changes to Attack Speed and possible future changes, I decided to write up this summary of how items work in Diablo 3.

The important thing to know about items is based on the following three terms:

* Item - What the item is, as well as its iLvl. This is also where base damage and base armor are stored. If you look at the white version of an item, you can see its base values. Item type also determines what affixes an item can get.
* Affix - Called properties in the crafting window. Blue almost always 1-3 of these. Rare always have 4-6 of these. They are things like ""of Pain"", ""of the Lion"" and ""Cruel"". In addition to primary affixes, there are secondary affixes with lower stats, this is why rings have half the stats of amulets.
* Mods - Affixes are actually a collection of one or more mods. For example, there is a +Dex mod. There is also a +Dex affix that has only a +Dex mod associated with it. There is however a +Dex/Vit affix which has 2 mods associated with it, one for +Dex and one for +Vit. Basically, a mod is always only one additional thing where is an affix can be a grouping of things.

Since legendaries can have stats outside the range of normal items there Legendary Affixes and Mods that go outside the range and restrictions of the normal ones that rares can get.

Here's how an item is built when it drops. Some of this is informed guessing so if you know that it works differently for certain, please feel free to correct me. I will be using gloves here as an example because it is a relatively simple item to work with.

* **Step 1**: An item type is chosen randomly based on the iLvl drop range and chances of the area. This includes both the category of item (gloves in this example) and the item type (name and iLvl). So if the game has decided to drop a pair of gloves it would then choose which gloves to drop out of all possible gloves in iLvl range 50-63 (assuming inferno act 1)
 * All possible gloves: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/gloves/#type=common

 * Stats determined so far: iLvl, Base Armor (the lowest armor value in the range on the link above), possible affixes
 * If you look at the crafted items you'll notice they have a single armor value instead of a range, this is the base armor value.

* **Step 2**: Now the magical nature of the item is determined. This is the part where your magic find comes in. A calculation happens and the item either stays white, becomes magic (blue), rare (yellow) or legendary (orange). The higher your Magic Find value, the higher chance of the item to drop as magic/rare/legendary.
 * If the item is white, it gets an armor bonus or some of the static bonuses such as ""balanced"" attack speed bonuses that white items occasionally get.
 * If the item is blue, it gets assigned 1-3 affixes randomly based on iLvl. The iLvl of the item is the maximum level of the Affixes assigned to it. Affixes are likely weighted that it is more likely to get a Affix level closer to the iLvl.
 * If the item is rare, it gets assigned 4-6 affixes randomly based on iLvl. The iLvl of the item is the maximum level of the Affixes assigned to it. Affixes are likely weighted that it is more likely to get a Affix level closer to the iLvl. Ilvl also affects how many affixes an item gets (higher iLvl items can have more affixes).
 * If the item matches a base item of a Legendary (all legendaries have a white item that they are based on) then the appropriate static and random affixes are assigned to it.
 * Affixes are restricted by item type.
 * Stats determined so far: What the item will have a bonus to, but not how much.
 * For our example, lets say a pair of iLvl 61 gloves has dropped with 4 affixes chosen as follows: Dex, VitDex, Haste (Attack Speed), DR (Armor)

* **Step 3**: Once the item has had its affixes chosen, the mods that belong to those affixes are applied, randomized and combined

 * Dex affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 130-149
 * DexVit affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 39-124 for the Dex mod abd 39-124 for the Vit mod
 * Haste (Attack Speed) affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 6%-7% for the attack speed bonus mod
 * DR (Armor) affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 286-322 for armor bonus mod
 * Stats determined so far: All

* **Step 4**: Mods are combined into a single value
 * Total +Dex range becomes 169-273 which is a combination of two separate random rolls, one from the Dex and one from the DexVit affixes

Whew! That's a lot of random number generation. Fun fact, each unique item also has a ""seed"" value which is used to calculate each random value. 

So now you're probably going. Okay, so what does this have to do with blizzard changing items? Here's the breakdown:

* When Blizzard nerfed attack speed, they reduced the range of possible attack speed bonuses on the Haste and HasteSecondary affixes. Quivers have a ""built in"" attack speed bonus similar to armor or damage which was not affected. This is the same reason you can't search for items by armor/damage/attack speed (for quivers) on the auction house. This may have also caused the haste value to be ""re-rolled"", so if before the range was 14-15 and you had a 15 the range may now be 6-7 and you may have a 6. If this were any other stat with a larger range I'm sure they would not be able to have made this change so quickly/easily.
* When Blizzard improves legendary items they will likely make a number of changes. Remember that legendaries have a different set of affixes that they chose from for their ""special"" stats and also have a normal set of affixes too. http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-gauntlets has a few static, a few random special and a few normal affixes. What will likely happen is that blizzard will do one of the following:

 * If they chose to change the range of existing special affixes then those item values will be re-rolled affecting older items. This likely won't happen. Instead they will likely:
 * Change the ""blueprint"" of legendaries to use new better special affixes. Any new legendaries that drop will use these new better special affixes which may have a different set of mods or a higher range of them. Old items will not be affected as they will still have the old affixes assigned to them.
 * Change the ""blueprint"" of legendaries to have additional special or normal affixes. Any new legendaries that drop will have these additional special/normal affixes. Old item will not be affected as they have already been generated.

As you can see Blizzard doesn't really have control over existing items because which affixes were assigned to them and the range of values on those affixes is based on their seed value. Any change to these may re-roll the item and ruin it. They have to be very careful with item changes for this reason. They can change the ""blueprint"" of an item, but that only affects new items that drop because once an item is created it's very difficult to modify an entire database of items and add affixes to it without changing the previous affixes and possibly forcing the item to re-roll its values (possibly ruining it).

This is a bit complex, I know, but I figured the insight would be helpful for people trying to understand how the Diablo item system really works. Hope you enjoy the read. Questions Welcome.

(Edit) Additional Notes:

* You can only have one affix of each type per item. There are also likely other limitations that I'm not aware of.
* All 2 stat affixes such as DexVit, IntStr, etc... are actually one affix so you can only have one of these
* Affixes levels are ""up to"" the iLvl of the item and are likely weighted to be closer to the iLvl but not necessarily at it

I block them all day and am still flooded. I even receive messages now. Its crazy! 

Blizzard doesn't even filter out www.insertGoldSite.com addresses! This needs to be fixed asap! Simple solutions that I cant believe aren't implemented yet:

1. Auto block any www.*.com messages
2. Stop spammers from being able to type walls of text so large that you have to actually scroll up to block and report them.
3. Make a level and/or account age limit before allowing access to public channels.

There are several other ideas I can think of, such as allowing users to create their own list of words or symbols they want filtered and blocked. For example, If I put a $ sign in my filter, auto block any message that would have a $ in it. But man, these accounts need a permaban if 100's of people are blocking and reporting them, and it needs to happen quickly.

If there is something BROKEN then thats totally different. Force Armor was being used in a way that wasn't ""thought"" out by the developers, even though it was completely legitamate and in the ruleset for wizards, the developers failed to see how Force Armor could be used in a specialized build, and therefore had to fix their mistake. This is a legitamate fix worthy of calling Blizzard and saying ""Hey guys, this is OP, even we are saying its op because im sure you didnt think of using force armor in this way"". So they fixed it. 

Same thing with Critical Mass. (Who the fuck are these game designers anyways? They're awful??)

However, one of the arguments against legendaries being any good at the moment is that they have a set of predefined stats (with random ranges) and that they can't then ever be better than the predefined ranges on those stats.

I present to you a Cluckeye legendary bow with double dexterity!

[Diablo 3 Game Guide item page for Cluckeye](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/item/cluckeye)

~~Assuming this potential holds for all stats, there exists the possibility for a legendary to roll extra damage, attack speed, or other good stats too, at least making them less potentially behind magic items than previously thought.~~

Update: As others are clarifying below, it isn't as I thought and I didn't really get double dexterity.

The item has two base stats:
&gt; +(92-101) Intelligence

&gt; +(27-100) Dexterity AND Intelligence

&gt; +1 random property


The Dex + Int stat is not the same as, and coexist with a Dex modifier. The random propery I got was pure dex, which did not already exist on the item!

Thanks for clearing that up folks, it helps my understanding of how item stats are generated and hopefully does the same for more people :)

Thoughts on game.,,526,254,295,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wnduv/diablo_inferno_down_with_2h_dps_barb_thoughts_on/,"Disclaimer: Throughout this post, my usage of 'hardcore' does not refer to Diablo's hardcore mode.


D3 is a game for hardcore gamers. When I'm feeling extremely critical of Blizzard, or getting riled up from a thread filled with sarcastic rants, I remind myself how few hardcore RPGs exist these days (Demon's Souls stands out, and is brought up regularly in the forums/reddit). Creating a game that is difficult in all of the right ways is a serious challenge. Diablo 3 is already a better game than what it was 2 months ago, and it does have a long way to go. But this thread was not created to bring up all of the areas that need to be improved with my own little twists. I want to point out what I've learned from playing this game, specifically in terms of having fun.


It's a hardcore game
----------
The trend in the industry is to dumb everything down so that it appeals to the casual player, where challenge takes a serious backseat (i know i know, tons of UI/mechanics have been dumbed down in D3). As far as difficulty, I think too many people are comparing the D2 character grind years after launch. The game for most of the regulars involved getting rushed by your friends, having decent gear waiting for you at lvl 70 or so, and being able to farm Mephisto to some degree 4-8 hours after deciding on what your character was going to be. That's not to say we still didn't' have ""natural"" characters that relied only on gear found in the game, experiencing the full challenge of progression from normal to hell.

I am relieved that D3 exists. I am a hardcore gamer, and the majority of the elite packs are enjoyable. There are combinations that are bullshit and very demoralizing for everyone, especially melee, but it's a challenge that is going to be further refined in the months to come.

tl;dr - I'm relieved that a game was released in 2012 for hardcore gamers.


Character Build
----------
Pick a character and style that fits your personality and stick with it. I'm a 2H DPS barb, and it doesn't have to be as expensive as most people say. The biggest problem is that people are not prioritizing gear stats correctly. I can't speak as well for ranged classes, but all resist is the #1 priority for Barbs. I think people struggling with Inferno have a tendency to still look for their primary stat first (strength) rather than survival stats. You can dish out decent DPS with the right skills/passives even when a lot of your gear doesn't have strength. Maybe some of your pieces are 70+ AR, 100vit and nothing else. Maybe some are 70+AR and strength. In time, you can start upgrading pieces to be AR/str/vit… then eventually AR/str/vit +MF or +piece specific attributes like crit or crit dmg.

The same goes for weapons. Lower damage high LOH gear is where you should start. You can also find amulets and rings that give LOH and not many other stats for cheap. When it comes to barbs, and probably most classes, there's this perspective of entitlement when it comes to gear. ""I MUST HAVE STR/VIT/AR AT A MINIMUM"". Well, that's a great combination of stats and will be expensive, but you can survive Inferno with lower expectations. Or, in fact, have higher expectations as far as stat rolls but with less diversity on each piece.

tl;dr - Look/shop for blue gear that is high all resist and high 1 stat if you're poor and are looking to progress. Mix/match, maybe your pants are all vitality and your chest is all strength.


Farming
----------
Magic find. NV stacks is a great addition to the Diablo series, but it is not enough. I currently have 97 base MF with my follower. Once I have 5 stacks, I'm finding 2.5+ yellows on average per elite pack. Farming is so much more productive now. Finding 1 yellow from a pack rarely happens and 3 is quite common. If farming is boring because you are not finding enough loot, get more MF. Once I could afford to buy MF for certain armor pieces, this totally changed my farming experience.

For my personality and 'real life' responsibilities, I don't like farming more than 2 hours per sitting. That's my limit. Having some MF makes a farming session very productive and provides a greater level of satisfaction. A lot of my frustration had to do with spending hours farming and not finding any legendaries… not finding valuable rares… etc. Committing to some MF, and going back to farm act 1 inferno when I was weaker, totally changed the enjoyment level for me.

tl;dr - Items still need some work.. legendaries are boring.. etc. etc. but as far as getting value out of your runs, do not underestimate the need for MF just because we have NV stacks.


Conclusion
----------
Blizz still has a long way to go, but Inferno has been so much more satisfying for me than D2 Hell was. When I compare the overall experiences, I'm happy with what Blizzard has done. I'm optimistic for the future of Diablo 3.


EDIT: There have been a lot of posts questioning me for calling this a hardcore game. I don't think the definition of 'hardcore' is universally agreed on. It can mean skill requirement, time requirement or a combination of both. It can also vary depending on how competitive you are. One good example that someone brought up was early WoW PVP, and the hours required to earn Grand Marshal or Warlord. Also, just because you can buy your way into faster progression doesn't make a game any less demanding.

EDIT 2: I've had my ass handed to me from using the word 'hardcore'. I regret using that word, but I meant it from the perspective of time investment along with the difficulty of Inferno compared to typical games these days... and the shift towards dumbing things down and making gaming easy. I guess I did not make that clear enough. I'm 31 and gaming for me started with the NES, back when games were often 'fuck you' challenging. I miss it. I appreciate what Blizz is trying to do and understand how challenging it is to make all of their existing, and new target audiences happy.",Barbarian,False,self,t5_2qore,1342486536.0,barb,,True,t3_wnduv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wnduv/diablo_inferno_down_with_2h_dps_barb_thoughts_on/,

bored. I'm not at the ""end"" yet myself (Farming Act 1 inferno), but I have a long list of things I want to do.
And they are going to keep me occupied for a long time.

1) You know there are 4 other classes you can level to 60 and attempt to beat inferno with, right?

2) Being able to barely beat Diablo inferno, and having the gear to put a beatdown on everything you encounter in Act
IV inferno are two vastly different things. I look forward to doing timed speed runs of each act of inferno
and constantly trying to beat my record.

3) I wanna try out weird builds with every class, which will probably require long periods of time gaining
weird gear specific to the weird build. All-thorns Monk. Ranged Barbarian. Melee Wizard.

4) PVP. Just because it's not out yet doesn't mean you can't start collecting gear for it. 

5) Beating inferno with a hardcore character. First I gear a softcore character well enough that he has little
risk of dying in Inferno Act IV. Then I play a hardcore character until it has the same stats as that softcore
character and beat inferno on hardcore. This will take a LOT of time.

6) Unlock Whimseyshire on all difficulties.

be, but it's not the game for you because these things are what it is about. ",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,barb-americas,True,t3_uy372,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uy372/bored_with_diablo_3_here_are_some_ideas_for_you/,

My ""screw this game forever!"" attitude has changed to ""maybe Blizzard can win my attention back.""

So what's that going to take?  For me in particular, the things that will seriously make me reconsider Diablo 3, from most to least important:

* 1) Re-designed Legendaries.  These are definitely happening, and if they're good, it's gonna go a looooong way toward making the item hunt more exciting.
* 2) Higher drop rates through the 1-59 grind.  I'm not a ""hardcore gamer"", and I originally quit long before end-game because I played all the way to Inferno difficulty without **ever** seeing a Legendary/Set Item.  The low drop rates KILLED my drive to play.  That really needs to change.  Legendaries/Set Items dropping somewhat regularly is a key part of what made Diablo 2's item hunt a blast ..  see Torchlight/Torchlight 2 for how to do item droprates correctly.
* 3) Game creation.  I want Blizzard to ""open up"" the game world so that we can jump between Acts and actually use the waypoints that we've unlocked.  Give us free range over Sanctuary, because the current system is absolutely asinine.  Nothing makes the game feel more disjointed and broken up than this 'feature'.  This is really, really, REALLY important to me as a player.
* 4) Achievements for finding Legendaries/Set Items.  I'm a collector.  There isn't enough storage space to hoard all the Legendaries/Set Items, so provide me Achievements for them.  ""Collect all Unique Rings!"" with checkboxes for each one, for example.  Do this and I give you my soul.
* 5) Avatars in the chat lobby a la Diablo 2.  I don't really care much for e-peening, but I think it promotes a healthy game environment to be able to easily see other players' avatars from the chat lobby.  It 'populates' the server, even if superficially.
* 6) It'll never happen (so arguably I shouldn't include this at all), but some additional development to Act 3 and 4 that would bring them up to par with the polish of Act 1 and 2.  I loved the events and atmosphere in Act 1, but the quality (and quantity) slowly dwindles as the game progresses.

For me, the above points are the ""bread and butter"" of Diablo, and can (if properly executed) overshadow any other of the numerous flaws the game has.

What about you?  Let's try to keep our 'wishlist' to things that can realistically happen.  ""No more AH!"", for example, probably is never, ever going to happen.

EDIT:  Some pretty awesome feedback happening!  Could probably do without the ""Fire Jay Wilson, delete the AH, give us offline mode"" stuff though..

Crafting is finally relevant.  More areas of the game are worth farming than ever before.  Higher MP levels are finally worth playing for reasons other than ubers.  Monks got some well deserved love.  PvP is finally an option and every bit as fun as we expected it to be.  I'm not sure what lies ahead in the 8, 9 and 10th patches but given the quality of 1.03-1.07 I'm sure it will be outstanding.

All that said, the single biggest improvement left to make is to introduce story free mode.  I don't want this to be a half assed auto skipping of dialogue and cutscenes.  I don't care if this is the only change made in 1.08, it needs to be done correctly.  You need to **throw the entire existing game structure out** and start fresh.  When I create my story-free game I need every single waypoint of every single act available.  I need every single major boss (anything with a purple name) to be alive.  I don't want to even think about seeing a cutscene or line of dialogue.  When I zone in to kill the skeleton king he'd best be alive and ready to die.  No clicky clicky to start the fight bullshit.  Cydea and Asmodan better not say one single word to me as I'm working my way through act 3.  Etc.  Every purple boss needs to be revisited with any sort of story caused obstruction removed.

We've been forced to sit through every cutscene, every boss animation, every boring line of dialogue, vanishing waypoints, single act games for 9 months now.  Enough is enough.  I'm not sure why you decided to take a game entirely based on slaying hordes of demons and finding epic loot and turn it into some sort of lame story based rpg, but the player base has spoken.  We don't care about any of it, it's a hindrance, a burden on our enjoyment of an otherwise glorious game.

While you're at it, remember to add the elite kill drop bonuses to the purple-named bosses, and add them to the list of things that give a nephalem valor stack.  The bosses you designed are cool.  Their dialogue isn't.  If this is the only change in patch 1.08 I'll consider it a smashing success and I'm sure most of the community would agree with me.

Thanks for continuing to make D3 awesome,

Is the current level 60 grind getting you down?  Are you annoyed that you could farm with MF, but it’s probably better just farming gold and buying the plethora of auctions that are cheaper and better than anything you are likely to find, even if you do magic find runs for 2 weeks straight? Are you sad that the “hey look, I found an upgrade!” is basically gone, due to the way the AH “spoils” that adrenaline rush of finding your own gear? Are you sad that you are level 60, and are bored of the current endgame?

Are you sad that the game is so easy that it basically functions like this:  Grind and push nonstop until you hit inferno. Now farm there for the next 5 years.

Go make a Hardcore character. Seriously. Go do it and never look back.

**The normal mode auction house is the biggest problem with Diablo III. It is the root and source of all evil.**

Holy crap, anyone that knows me has just had a heart attack. You are talking to a guy that had 35 million gold in WoW, all from AH gaming. I have written countless articles on Auction house for both WoW and Diablo. I live and breathe the auction house. And yet, here I am, telling you that the AH is everything that is wrong with Diablo. 

The thing is, Diablo II was fun because you grinding for upgrades. Typically, anything you equipped was something that you found. Sure, you could trade for stuff, but basically, gear was the currency of the game, and to get currency, you had to have it drop for you. That created this psychological response anytime gear dropped, and that’s why you played the game. Diablo III has taken the heart and soul of Diablo II and turned it on it’s head.

Current Diablo III endgame revolves around farming gear, trying to sell it for dirt cheap on the auction house, just so you can purchase an upgrade off the same auction house.  If Diablo III was Diablo II, we would enter inferno with a 500 dps 2h weapon. We’d really only be able to upgrade that item if we could get an upgrade to drop. Act 1 item drops with 600 dps would actually mean something. You’d find a 600 DPS with 30 int, and instantly equip it. A week later, you could find a 600 DPS with 80 int, and you’d be pleased as punch, and equip that. Eventually, you may eek out enough gear to beat the Butcher and his enrage timer. Then you would start farming Act 2… **and those drops would mean something.** Each time you get one of those drops, you get this spike of adrenaline in your brain, and you love it. You love playing Diablo, because you love getting these micro upgrades.

With the auction house in Diablo III, instead this is what happens… You hit level 60 and save up 50k gold so that you can buy a 1250 DPS two hander that you have no business equipping, but it made available to you because all the competition with people like me that already beat this game and have been farming inferno for weeks already, undercutting eachother, until an ilvl 63 very very good roll item is only worth 20-50k gold… which you can earn in about 6 minutes farming jars in royal crypts. 

So now, all those micro-pulse mini-moments of exhilaration from tiny upgrades found yourself… are gone. Instead, you skipped 18 steps in the upgrade process, and your reward? You can now go farm siegebreaker in act 3 so that maybe…. Just maybe… you can sell an item for 50k gold yourself. Wow… where’d the fun go?


**Where the fun is**

The fun is in hardcore. Sure, you’ll die, and lose everything now and then. Sure, you’ll randomly die from aspects out of your control, such as lag. I did last night. It felt like a waste of my time.

The trick is changing that mindset. 

Here’s what happens in hardcore..

People die. People lose gear. They need to buy more gear. This means that the hardcore auction house is constantly being cleaned out of higher tier gear, leading to much slower deflation. If you can manage to get to 60 and get to a decent farming spot, the gear you farm will actually sell well…. Probably for a long long time. 

**There are other markets.**

There are markets for level reduction gear. This is a MASSIVE stat in hardcore, whereas it’s a niche market/fun stat for people twinking their toons in normal mode. In hardcore, getting a 600 dps 2her at level 45 is insane. 

There is a market for + experience gear in hardcore. People are constantly remaking their characters, and + exp gear is really good to level up with. Not only that, but if they die, it leaves the economy, ensuring people can’t just buy 1 set and be good for the next 10 years.

There is a market for gems. Good lord is there a market for gems – and socketed items. A level 13-40 weapon with a  socket might as well be a lotto ticket, because you can sell it for TONS. 

There is a market for vitality!! So many classes in normal-mode couldn’t give 2 craps for vitality. Hardcore is obviously different. Vitality is a huge stat, as is anything with mitigation. Since more stats are “worth value”, more equipment is worth value, thus more stuff you find along the way will actually have buyers at the other end. 

**Conclusion**

If you want to play in an atmosphere where the entire market is saturated with top level gear… where you farm for weeks and maybe get a 1300 dps weapon, but it only sells for 50k gold… where the endgame seems so boring, because the actual best strategy is to break jars open and take the gold inside, just so you can purchase an upgrade at diluted cost, negating any “eureka” moment that your brain desires… then go play normal mode.

If you want an atmosphere where the auction house is constantly being drained of items, so that everything you find has value… where staying alive and getting to late-game farming spots…. And farming those spots… is extremely lucrative… where skill is HIGHLY rewarded if you can get there and stay there…. Then play hardcore.

You may die. You may lose everything you had. But you will learn. And you will get better. And you’ll have a LOT more fun doing it than you are currently having breaking open jars for coins.

Play hardcore. And don’t look back.

/edit

**The typical comment I expect, and my retort... lets change everyone's mindset**

**Comment:** 

I don't have fun losing my best gear and tons of time played due to an unfortunate lag spike, disconnect, bug, or ridiculous enemy combo. For some people, this is an additional thrill, but for me, it would be depressing.

**My response**

Exactly. I was of this mindset too. I mean... right up until I decided to write this article. 

Just last night, on my first foray into hardcore, my first death ever (at level 25) was due to lag. It was beyond frustrating. I literally swore off hardcore.

Then I thought....

What else am I going to do? Am I seriously going to do siegebreaker runs, or jar gold runs for the next 2+ years of my life? Is that why I play this game? So that I can be turned into a robot so that blizzard can make money off me in the RMAH when it comes out? 

Instead, I can change my mental mindset. 

Dying in hardcore means I get an opportunity to learn from my mistake and get better. I get to twink out my character (I personally find that fun) for a few levels, fairly cheaply. I get to work towards upgrades myself. Maybe I'll farm normal difficulty siegebreaker, and he'll drop upgrades for me that actually mean something. Sure it's only normal mode, but those upgrades are, you know, actually upgrades!

I will gain satisfaction, not out of keeping a character and playing it for 10 years on the same farming run over and over... I will get satisfaction on every single micro-hurdle I pass that was farther than the last one that I passed. 

I won't be able to cheese content by making a 70k dps witch doctor that just zergs stuff dead but dies itself, and trivializes content by doing so, because it's SO SO efficient at doing that. I will actually have to play the game. 

It's just a mental mindset that needs to change, and I will have fun with this game again. I'm already bored with level 60 normal mode, and it has been a few weeks... and this is from someone who played diablo II for 10 years. The AH is the entire reason why, and hardcore is the complete and utter solution.

Diminishing returns was not an apt solution.,HamletEJ,483,208,418,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v6r50/the_ias_nerf_was_correct_diminishing_returns_was/,"I have a feeling this won't be too controversial once all the ""don't nerf me, bro"" settles down, but just to point out a few things.

To review what everyone knows already: IAS was massively overbudget.  With 1400 (e.g.) Int, 15% IAS was equivalent to another 225 Int, and could be stacked on top of Int on gloves or jewelry.  In addition, it not only improves DPS, but increased all proc rates and LOH effects, and helps mobility.  The only downside is that some builds (Blizzard) don't benefit from it.  But in a build optimized for it, the scaling was out of control.  Anyway, this is what you know already.

The most common rallying cry is that some sort of diminishing returns mechanism would have been better.  My main point is there is that this is nothing but an attempt at bargaining--there's no design justification for it.  DR setups are properly used where things scale in a nonlinear way.  %-based mitigation/avoidance is a standard example from both WoW and Diablo.  If you let them scale naturally, the marginal benefits grow out of control as you take less and less damage.  So they're typically scaled to cause EHP to grow linearly, which is much more controlled at the top end.

But IAS scaling was perfectly linear already.  The problem was not that once you had too much, the marginal benefit of further IAS grew without bound.  The first piece of IAS you equipped gave a benefit far beyond its budget.  Further pieces of IAS gave an equal benefit.  There's no particular reason for nerfing the later ones but not the earlier ones.  

Basically, it's very clear that IAS ranges on gear should have been lower from the outset.  The only reason to be unsure about making this simple correction now is that changing already-existing items would have been technically difficult (they rarely do this).  But given how much of a mess it would be if they don't make the nerf retroactive, it seems they found a solution.  So we're getting to where we should have been the whole time: different bonuses in the same budget being roughly balanced.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_v6r50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v6r50/the_ias_nerf_was_correct_diminishing_returns_was/,

I'm REInvestor and I'd like to teach you the basics of how to profitably farm the AH. I don't use macros, I'm not a hacker, and I'm not especially smart; I basically just have too much free time. If I can do this, so can you. This is a bit of read, but in it, I share just about everything I know about how to make money on the auction house.

---

There are many strategies for profitably arbitraging the AH, but I am going to teach you my primary technique which has allowed me to earn an absurd amount with very minimal effort.

I started with 250k on the night of 5/28 and I now have 13m + 5m in auctions/inventory plus I've geared up a bit ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Ijj5S.jpg)). I have not kept detailed track of the hours because you don't really need be going all the time. I'm not sure how many hours I've spent doing this, but I would estimate it at about 20.

###How Much Time Does This Take?###

Unlike farming in-game, you don't need to be actively in the game to make a lot of money at this. I am on reddit or using the computer for other stuff and then occasionally alt-tabbing back into the game to check on things. Here's a rough estimate of the time I spend:

* 5-10 minutes picking up inventory
* 5-10 minutes pricing/listing the inventory
* 5-10 minutes over the course of the next two hours alt-tabbing back into D3 to check the auctions and list new items

Over those two hours (75% of which I spent redditing), I can expect to net typically 250-750k. Not bad right?

Now, having said that, you're gonna have to invest some time into learning the market. I can now price my stuff super fast without researching every piece which saves me a lot of time, whereas a newbie will need to research heavily at the beginning so they don't overprice. Nonetheless, I think this is the most profitable way to spend time in-game (not the most fun for everyone, obviously), and is something that even people with low level characters can do.

###Focus on Bargain Armor###

I have dabbled into more specialized markets, but this is the core strategy that got me started: buying cheap, high-value armor and flipping it quickly.

We've all seen those 1d12h listings on the first page of search that are just insane, but by the time you check the item and decide to buy, it's already been sold. We're mostly buying from people who got something in the game, don't want to spend the time researching a price, and just throw it up for anywhere from 5-40k.

My sole effort is to locate those items then flip them quickly. Pretty simple right?

**Here's What We're Buying: Just-listed L60 armor priced under 40k with at least 2 useful affixes in decent quantities stats and high armor ratings.**

**Useful Affixes:** STR, DEX, INT, VIT, ALL-RES, MF, GF, &amp; IAS. [Definitely read this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uiyoy/list_of_item_properties_that_are_very_valuable_to/) for more. It doesn't count if the item has say str + dex, but nothing else. You basically want one offensive affix + 1 defensive/bonus affix to make an item desirable.

You generally don't want to buy an item with just one stat and a specific resistance (physical or fire resistance, for example); they just don't sell for much. What you really want are items with synergistic stats. So, DEX with VIT or MF, STR + IAS, INT + ALL-RES, and so on. These are the items that people will actually be looking for and will sell for much higher prices.

Do not buy an item if it says 1d10h or less. You only want 1d12h or 1d11h. The good deals will go quick, so if it's been on for an hour, then it's not a good enough deal to flip.

Also, make sure to select a generic character type if you don't have a L60 character. Otherwise, you'll only see gear at your level (although this strat is probably doable to a certain extent at the lower levels too).

###Minimum Armor###

These are the rough minimum armor levels that I need to see on an item before I'll buy it. Anything less, and the value declines markedly. I might still buy something that is a little less if it has awesome stats, though.

* **Boots:** 500

* **Bracers:** 400

* **Chest:** 675

* **Gloves:** 500

* **Helm:** 675

* **Pants:** 675

* **Shoulders:** 525

###How to Sell the Items###

Your goal is to sell the item very quickly, so you can sell something else. The prices you see of most items are too high. Try to price it so that it is a no-brainer for someone looking for the type of item. Ideally, I want to be the top-rated item for the common buyout limits (100k, 200k &amp; so on). If everything else is listed for 200k, but they haven't sold in two hours, those prices are too high.

Search for similar items to yours. If you've got some boots with 75 int, and 100 vit, search for boots with 50 int and 75 vit with a max buyout of say 200k to see where you stack up. If you've got better stats and more armor than everything else, price a little higher, or a little lower if in the opposite situation.

You're gonna have to spend some time going through a few pages of auctions to get a feel for a proper price. Just remember that if you price too high, you're gonna have to wait 1.5 days to get that auction slot again. It's far better to be too low than too high.

When you list the item, list the buyout at whatever price you've determined, then the starting bid price at something about 30% lower. This is in-case it doesn't sell, you could still sell it at the end of the auction and not have to use a new auction slot to list it.

###Items I Avoid###

* **Belts.** I honestly haven't explored the market to know enough about why this happening, but nearly all of the belts available list strength (and often a lot of it), but the market for belts with strength doesn't seem to be there. I have bought and sold a lot of belts and it has been only marginally profitable for me.

* **Rings &amp; Amulets.** There are absolutely ways to make money with these, but you need to become more of a market specialist which is not worth the effort to me.

* **Class-Specific Items.** Wizard hats, mighty belts, and so on. The market for these is smaller and it has not been worth the effort. Again, if you specialize, you can probably make money. Be careful when searching chest armor and helms as if you're searching for a DH &amp; WZ respectively, their class items will dilute your results and cause you to make a bad buy. 

* **Weapons (Sort-of).** The market for weapons is much more efficient in my experience. DPS is (to a certain extent) the end-all, be-all which makes comparing/valuing weapons very easy for the layman so prices are more efficient. I have definitely made money flipping a few weapons, but finding deals has been time consuming for me.

* **Offhand Items.** Immediate comparison of items is basically impossible with mousing over each item to learn its stats. Until Blizz makes it easy to sort items by other stats than armor/price, offhand items are just too much effort for me to be interested.

###Other Tips###

* **Don't Buy More Than You Sell.** By the end of last week, I had four mules full of shit that I had bought for cheap. I ended up partnering with some redditors to sell it off for me, but I ended up losing probably a million gold. Once your inventory is full (10 or so items left in your stash with all auction slots loaded), only buy something if it is a screaming good deal.

* **Don't Get Greedy. This is a Volume Game.** If you think you could probably get 200k, but you know absolutely it'll sell at 125k, list it for 125k. An unusable auction slot could cost you several million depending on the volume you're doing. I'll price stuff so low sometimes, that I've tried to buyout my own listings on occasion. Remember, 90% of the items you see on the AH are priced too high and will basically never sell. 

* **You'll Probably Lose Gold Sometimes.** I've bought things out when I shouldn't have. The worst was what I thought was a screaming deal on a 2h axe for 3m. I hadn't really studied the market and it seemed like a good deal, but I ending up having to list it for 2m to get rid of it. And yet, I've still made a huge amount of gold with minimal effort.

* **Don't Hesitate.** If you see a rare with a really high armor rating for 10k when the next item has way less armor, buy it immediately. You don't always hit homeruns, but it's really damned hard to lose money on these.

###Other Thoughts###

* **Depreciation is Coming.** I foresee even more massive depreciation coming with the inferno nerf and the ability to cancel auctions. First, there are just going to be more l60 items over time and even more once people can farm inferno easier. Then, you've got the fact that most auctions are priced to high currently. That will change, and the supply at lower price points will increase dramatically, further lowering prices.

* **There Are Probably More Profitable Strategies.** The strategy I use requires little thinking and little market knowledge. A strategy that requires detailed market knowledge could potentially offer higher returns

* **Grinding the AH for IRL $ is Dumb.** The $ price of gold is already pretty low and will get insanely low once the RMAH opens up. Don't think you're gonna do this as a business.

* **I Do This For Fun.** I don't really enjoy grinding inferno or smashing pots over and over. I get a certain thrill from playing the market. Having said that, I see nothing wrong with just farming the game, even if it might not be as productive/hr.

* **Useful Threads.** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/umboa/auction_house_and_farming_how_are_people_already/c4wp4zv) are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tuubt/auction_house_tips/) more [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tw16q/guide_to_the_auction_house/) on the subject which could be helpful.

Right now, the things that kill you the fastest in the game are:

* Desecrator
* Arcane Enchanted
* Plagued

These can typically be avoided, and you will die to these only when you get blocked, CCed or a brainfreeze in one. 

Now there is a relatively small % of players who are so fragile they die to a lot of other things, and a small % of players who are so tanky they don't die at all. 

For everyone else, they die mostly to these ground effects. This makes the game boring. It means you can ignore 95% of the damage in the game, and you only have to pay attention to boring things on the ground. 


&gt; Elite Skeleton Archer shooting an arrow at you? 

lol, come at me bro

&gt; Puddles of lava on the floor

I think that Blizzard should make an effort to increase insignificant damage and decrease ridicules damage. I think the game will be more exciting if it made sense to try and avoid many different types of damage, not just stuff on the floor.

I'm sure by now, all of you have noticed the mind-blowing amount of dead villagers inside ruins. Sure, they give free loot, free gold, maybe even a rare if you're lucky, at least they're good for *something*.


But has anyone ever stopped to wonder how a simple towns-woman got THREE FUCKING LEVELS DEEP INTO AN ANCIENT CURSED CATHEDRAL? HOW MUCH DOES ONE HAVE TO FAIL AT LIFE TO GET ONESELF FUCKED SO BADLY?


Seriously, what the fuck, lady? A series of meteors come crashing down from the sky, into where else but the motherfucking Tristram Cathedral, The Skeleton King Leoric is PMS-ing in his grave, zombies are rising from the ground, there's a vile plague ravaging your people,  and you somehow decide that the logical course of action to take, is to GO INSIDE? Did the armed, semi-competent, guards in New Tristram not make you feel safe enough? Did the ancient creepy cathedral that once housed the Lord of Motherfucking Terror himself look safe and secure from the demon hordes? 


Don't get me started on Dead Adventurers too. A neighbouring village is burning, your fellow townspeople are flipping shit, and everything is going to hell. How much of a retard do you and your friends have to be, to decide that the rational thing to do is EXPLORE THE FUCKING METEOR CRASH SITE?



I know what Sanctuary's problem is. They're not at the mercy of angels. They're not in a vulnerable location. They're not being threatened by the armies of Hell; Sanctuary is populated by fucking idiots.

**Insatiable Void**

Once your jeweler learns the cut, he will be able to use an ""Insatiable Gem"" to socket an ""Insatiable Void"" into an item. 

""Insatiable Gems"" drop randomly in the world. As you feed materials into the gem, it slowly grows in power. The materials that you feed into the gem determine how it will grow. For example, placing green gems will grow it in dexterity, yellow gems will grow it in intellect. Placing gold into the insatiable gem will increase it's gold find, grey items will increase armor. White items will increase it's pickup radius. Blue and yellow items will increase its magic find, and feeding in legendary items has unknown effects. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell how much an insatiable gem has grown in power before it is attached to an item.

You can continue to feed items into an unsocketed Insatiable Gem indefinitely. At any time you may seek out your jeweler and have him attach an insatiable gem onto an item, and it will imbue that item with increased stats based on the types and quantities of items that have been fed into the gem. Once attached, the gem creates an ""insatiable void"" on the item - and you can continue to feed items into the void to add stats to the gear (at a slightly lower rate of return than before it was attached.) HOWEVER, attaching the gem to an item prevents you from selling or trading that item to another player. The gem can never be removed. 


**Chaos Orbs**

We all get into ruts sometimes, and need a reason to mix things up. Chaos Orbs are meant to break you out of your rut by giving you a reason to try a different playstyle, without requiring you to buy an entirely different set of gear or play a different class.

Chaos Orbs drop randomly from mobs, and alter the behavior of your spells or provide a new passive ability. Chaos Orbs cannot be traded or sold, and are ethereal - meaning they will dissappear over time. Orbs will drop with a random duration between 2 and 4 hours of playtime. There are 2 types of orbs: Universal, and Class-specific. You can only equip 1 of each type at a time, and in addition to your equipped orbs you may only carry 1 of each type. (Example: You have 2 orbs equipped and 2 in inventory, no new orbs will drop for you.) Class-specific orbs will only drop for the class you are currently playing. 

**Some examples of Chaos Orbs:**

**Universal:**

* 10% chance to cast a duplicate spell that uses a random rune variant
* Your crit chance is increased by 10% of your critical hit damage
* Killing an enemy increases your run speed by 1% for 5 seconds (Can exceed cap) but damage you take is increased by your run speed.
* Access to abilities from other classes
* Magic find reduced to 0, gold find increased by double your magic find.
* All attacks do AoE damage equal to double your pickup radius.
* Gain 50% of thorns damage as healing


**Wizard:**

* Meteor strikes land instantly
* Each cast of Magic Missile also casts Arcane Torrent: Death Blossom
* Ray of Frost now penetrates all targets

**Barbarian:**

* Frenzy now hits all targets within 10 yards
* Weapon throw no longer costs fury, instead generates 2 fury
* Call of the Ancients: Summoned Ancients now last until killed (they inherit your baseline armor, resist, and HP)

**Monk:**

* Attack speed of Crippling Wave increased by 100%
* While Sweeping Wind is active, each enemy you kill adds 1 second to the duration of Sweeping Wind
* Lashing Tail Kick: Hand of Ytar &amp; Spinning Flame Kick no longer have a spirit cost

**Demon Hunter:**

* Your Rapid Fire can now be channelled while moving
* Entangling Shot has a 10% chance to activate Fan of Knives: Crippling Razors at the impact site
* Bola shot now detonates instantly upon impact
* All hatred generating attacks have damage increased by 250%, but now cost half the hatred they would normally generate

**Witch Doctor:**

* Toads generated by Plague of Toads persist for 10 seconds, up 50 active
* Travel speed and damage of Spirit Barrage increased by 100%
* While Angry Chicken is active, each enemy you kill adds 1 second to the duration of Angry Chicken

When a chaos orb expires, you receive the buff ""Lawful"", increasing damage, armor, and resistances by 10%. Lasts until you equip a new chaos orb.

In order to equip a Chaos Orb, you will need to complete a quest by obtaining a chaotic organ from each Act end-boss: The Butcher, Belial, Azmodan, and Diablo. These are a 100% drop chance at MP1 and above. This will inscribe you with a band of chaos, adding two new inventory slots where you can place Chaos Orbs. 

Edit:

* Each time you die while a Chaos Orb is equipped, you lose 20 minutes from its remaining duration.
* Chance for Chaos Orbs to drop fluctuates based on what you have out of 4, at increments of 25%. (If you have 4 of 4, 0% chance to drop. If you have 2 equipped but none in inventory, +50% chance. If you have none equipped or in inventory, +100% chance.
* As you feed your insatiable gem, you CAN see the quality as it grows from grey, white, blue, yellow...legendary? in color.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The build: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#alRXQO!dbY!cbbaYY  
  
**Pros**: Makes most packs feel easy, very easy to gear for, survivability  
  
**Cons**: Lack of those OMGWTF-DPS numbers from no force weapon/familiar. 

  
When I had dinged 60 originally -- I was so lost about wizards.. what weapons were better, 
what spells were efficient, what the heck should I be using my arcane on?!  I ditched it and 
started a demon hunter.  I began farming inferno ponies/some of A3 -- and as I started a4 on my DH -- I was one shot by every damn thing in the game, and when they come out from an invuln (stealth/landing from flying and striking) state... I was over it and wanted to try to abuse force armor so I went back to my wizard.  
  
This build is a twist on the existing  Venom Hydra/Blizzard core that many wizards are already utilizing in inferno; I have experimented with other builds, but this build has safely taken me through Inferno A2-4, including Diablo with the exception of Rakanoth where I had utilized Guardian Familiar.  
  
I honestly have almost no issue with ANY sort of affixes in A3/A4 and if I do die, it's 
typically just me playing a bit greedy, or throwing MF on too early prior to the pack dying.  
(this doesn't include soul lashers.. f those guys.)  
  
I have tried all sorts of various builds, and actually REALLY enjoyed the Wave of 
Force/Illusionist build, which trust me, I tried to find a way to incorporate in what I was 
doing; it unfortunately didn't click well.. but it inspired me to tweak a few things around!  
  
You can find VODS of me using the build at http://www.twitch.tv/drizoid (I mention below as well, I've taken on every affix, and they're hardly a challenge with lashers as an exception.) -- I also try commentate on everything I'm doing and offer pointers whenever I can.  (***TO CLARIFY, I HAVE 59K UNBUFFED DPS -- but have done this at 35K without an issue).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**SKILLS:**  
  
* Hydra (Venom Hydra): As most wizard builds, this is the crux of your damage.. For the amount of arcane utilized vs DPS processed, it makes you wonder why meteor costs 45 arcane, or whatever it actually does.  It slings projectiles at your foes, while throwing down acid pools which also continue to tick on mobs.  Utilizing blizzard to bundle minions together with a hydra will take care of all of your AOE needs.. regardless of what your gear looks like.  
  
* Blizzard (Snowbound): I tried to get rid of this skill.. I tried to find alternatives... I attempted to utilize temporal flux+arcane hydra+arcane orb in hopes to squeeze in Wave of Force but the lack of venom hydra, the lack of survivability, it all just didn't click well.  This skill allows you to kite.. is it the most enteratining way to kill things?  Maybe not, but its super efficient, and allows you to bundle most packs together to allow Venom hydra/pools to do their work!  I've had people ask about the increased blizzard radius, and the chance on freeze (20%) -- they both really didn't work out for me.  I felt like, for increased radius, it would have to be 2x as much, and even then, I can't spam it if the mob is fast (Blizzard costing 20 vs increased radius costing 45..) -- and chance to freeze 20% doesn't seem efficient at all when you can just lay down a lane of blizzards for 60 AP.   Additionially, I've heard people say you need to max movement speed.. I run around with 11% --  from boots, and that's it.  If mobs are running faster than you through spammed reduced-costing blizzard+teleport, you've got bigger problems that run speed won't fix.  
  
* Magic Missle (Seeker): This is amazing.  Sure, I don't use a fast 2h.. but that's okay.. what makes it golden is being able to throw missles at weird angles while kiting, around walls, throwing stuff out there without worrying much about where it goes because it'll typically connect (even connects sometimes if I throw it forward and they're behind me) -- it's really really amazing in inferno.  Let me repeat, I use a 2hander (with only IAS coming from jewelry+gloves) -- and it's still super efficient.  Hits for 40k-100k, makes boss fights/champion packs a joke while blizzard and hydra round them up.  People have asked why not Piercing Orb -- because the oscilation is weird, and it has a god awful casting animation.  It does great damage, and it's really nifty in IAS 1h builds -- but it was painful to try on a 2h and honestly, I don't need more AOE -- Blizzard/Hydra fit the bill, and im killing non-hampion packs/elites without an issue.. I needed a single target spell with great range and flexibility to clean up champion/elites/bosses, and MM-Seeker fits that need.  
  
* Teleport (Fracture): This skill is part of the reason why I can farm/quest so easily in inferno.  Using illusionist as a passive allows me to constantly kite with force armor, as I typically won't be one shot and bounce around whenever I get hit.  With Fracture, the mirror images allow the break of jails, it gets you over walls, jump from high/low terrain, and even over molten/desecration/poison pools.  Often, the mirror images will eat attacks, giving you even more time to aoe/position/seeker missle.  This spell along with others made inferno less frustrating and much more enjoyable.  
  
* Diamond Skin (Crystal Shell): Because sometimes teleport with fracture isn't enough and makes reflect damage easy to deal with.  I've had people tell me diamond skin is worthless in inferno, but I disagree.  Having both Ds (Diamond Skin) and Telefracture with cool-down reduction from evocation is amazing.  It allows me to bait vortexes, take hits on purpose to trigger illusionist, and generally gives me an 'oh shit' button when I see those damn spear chuckers/oppressor charges, etc.  Utilizing this in order to trigger illusionist, or force vortexes is it's main strength, but generally it's fantastic all around to give you a huge buffer with force-armor (usually an additional 2-3 hits).  
  
* Energy Armor (Force Armor): This is what makes a wizard a farming/inferno clearning machine.  You need to get your resists/health to make force armor effective and avoid being one shot by most things.  Certain things may still one-shot you, but you learn to avoid their melee attacks, or whatever they're doing to insta-gib you.  This unfortunately will not help with poison pools, molten, desecration, or fire-chains as those tick down and do not deal large chunks of damage (that's what teleport/fracture is for).  Additionally, this allows the reset of teleport (through illusionist) over and over and over, and with diamondskin, gives you a huge health buffer every 15 seconds!  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
**PASSSIVES:**  

* Illusionist: This is what makes the build so viable in inferno.. because you shouldn't die in one hit to most things, your teleport(fracture) will reset every time you're hit (and if it's not, wtf you're too tanky!) and allow you to escape jailers, box walls, move from high/low terrain+blink for health globes and generally just play effectively.  Unless I'm going against a waller/jailer I will use my teleport typically whenever it's up to create distance as I know I'll be safe if I get hit to use it again.  
  
* Evocation: This puts teleport/diamond skin on a shorter CD.  Could you do without it?  Maybe.. but there have been so many clutch moments I've waited on my CD to come back up for either of those skills and that hair of a second has made the difference.  I wouldn't use anything else.  
  
* Glass Cannon: This skill is somewhat optional -- I feel like since you're losing some damage from buffs, this probably should be used to make some up on the back end, but you could totally use something else -- and if you do, and have success, let me know! (I always love suggestions!)  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**FOLLOWER:**  
  
This is obviously up to your play-style, but due to the heavy kiting, I perfer, and really recommend enchantress..  Sure, she can be a bitch sometimes -- when she polymorphs you instead of the enemy, but her reflect shield+force wave+polymorf CC has really helped deal with A3/A4 (I love watching spears bounce off me because of her shield!).  Her force-push back pushes them back in venomhydra/blizzard, and that's always helpful.

I must say that I generally do not mind the overall story of the game. I like the idea and premise etc. 
What I find disturbing while playing it over again and again, is the endless 'conversation-pop-ups' from bosses during an Act (especially Azmodan and Diablo are truly annoying, and not at all scary). All the bosses say somewhat the same: ""So you defeated X, but you will never defeat Y!"" and then the cut-scenes.
The cinematics is always Blizzardingly mindblowing - but the ingame cut-scenes, not so much.

Watching the 2008 gameplay trailer, made me realize, that ingame cut-scenes are the main problem with the feel and atmosphere of the game. In the 2008 gameplay trailer, we get a subtle feel of an ominous threat awaiting, when the barbarian arrives at the tomb. A distant scream from an unknown terror, forces the bridge in front of the barbarian to crumble. Later in the hallway we see a dark shadow of a giant beast in the background, and the guards express their fear of what is to come. (The events leading up to Skeleton King in Act 1 in the final game, have some of this, and is perhaps why I love Act 1 so much compared to the other Acts).
The 2008 video's grand finale is the giant Seagebreaker crusing through the wall without any warning, and the fight is on.
There is no pause and fading to black, followed by a cut-scene with black bars in top and buttom of the screen, where the boss taunts you with the typical ""Mwhahaha you will never defeat me!"". Its a direct flow of gameplay, where the boss takes you by surprise.
This was what happened in Diablo 2, where you would shit your pants after opening the zeals and releasing Diablo, as you would not know exactly where he was. But you knew that he was somewhere in the map, waiting to kill you.

In Diablo 3, I almost get a feel that the game developers don't care about the bosses and boss fights. Their main focus seems to be on the Elite packs.
By the way - how many people had not hoped that the Bosses would have more advanced phases and mechanics in the later difficulties? Again in the 2008 video, there is a surprise element, after defeating the Siegebreaker, when the hoardes of skeletons are summoned as a last stand...

Since Blizzard is so focused on dealing with their costumers requests of tweaking and balancing the ingame mechanics, perhaps we could all ask them kindly to also tweak and balance the ingame story feel and flow?",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_uvxmw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uvxmw/watching_the_2008_gameplay_trailer_made_me/,

Why do these awesome, unique monsters create a sense of disappointment rather than excitement? The simple answer is loot, the loot from them sucks. Therefore they are a waste of time, therefore we are disappointed to find them in our runs. Now, we could easily say “make them give good loot!” and BAM, solution solved, Band-aid applied. Yes this makes them less disappointing to find in our run, but it doesn’t create any more “value” for the player. The “Giving better loot” solution would give us a status quo solution similar to that of resplendent chests giving similar drops to elite and champion packs. It increased the value of getting resplendent chests, but it did not increase their value above status quo. Status Quo being: Elite and Champion Pack like drops. We can do much better than simply making Purples drop better loot.

Because Purples are more rare than elites, their loot should be better. It’s intuitive that the more rare an encounter is, the better the drops should be. Some Purples are very rare, some are not, the loot table should reflect the rareness of the mob. Great segue! Loot Table, Purples should have specific loot tables, similar to bosses in D2. For example, Bussaw(sp) in A3 Rakkis Crossing could have an increased chance to drop a Maximus. Now you’re asking, “but people will just farm these specific purples!”, well so what, if Blizzard balances the drops correctly, this isn’t an issue. Additionally, the rareness of certain purples is an internal mechanism that reduces the efficiency of farming rare purples. These unique loot tables increase flexibility, complexity and randomness of loot runs. I feel like we could all use a bit of complexity in our loot runs. I’m looking at you Alkazier.

Now that drops have been improved, how can we make purples even better? I feel that purples should have a “world boss” feel (Those that play MMOs know what I mean). You say to yourself “OH SHIT LOOK AT THAT THING!!!” and it owns you. I feel like purples should trigger a response of fear, and a response of calling everyone on your friends list to come help you kill and share in the loot of the purple fight. 


How can we make Purples more challenging? Well obviously increase their health and damage. Additionally, we can add affixes such as minion spawning, Hero CC (similar to siegebreaker’s grab) ect. I feel like Blizzard can make purples the challenging bosses we never had (or don’t have anymore).


TL:DR, Purples rareness does not reflect their loot. They are lame to find, instead of awesome. Give them specific loot tables and quality of loot. Scale loot based on rareness. Make them WTF hard.

Before you start reading, let me show you this [Goblin Lore](http://www.d3lexicon.com/conversation/lore-bestiary-treasure-goblin): 

&gt; Abd al-Hazir
&gt;
&gt; Some devious little goblins have been robbing our merchants! When pursued, they simply open portals and disappear with a most aggravating chuckle. The peasantry seem to believe that the goblins serve a great demon lord known as Greed and, furthermore, that their portals lead to Greed's domain! A ludicrous notion, truly.

---

Imagine crafting this ring:

**Greedy Goblin Ring**

- Account-Bound
- 180 to 200 of stat of choice (STR, INT, DEX, VIT)
- Extra Health from Globes increased by [Paragon Level x 200]
- +1% Movement Speed
- Increases Pickup Radius by [Paragon Level divided by 4]
- 3 Random Attributes
- Magical Goblin power to automatically pickup potions, gems, tomes, pages.

---
.

**Mechanics of Getting the Greedy Goblin Ring**
---
.

---

**IMPORTANT: Craft the Staff of Herding first!**

Covetous Shen needs to borrow your Staff of Herding in order to craft your ring.

This mechanic will also make it harder for botters to abuse the Greedy Goblin Ring system.

---

**Collect the Recipes for the Goblin Machine**

Collect this|From
:---|:---
1 White Dust Bag|Treasure Bandit (White Bag, grey skin)
1 Gold Pixie Dust Bag|Treasure Goblin (Gold Bag, grey skin)
1 Brown Pixie Dust Bag|Treasure Seeker (Brown Bag, red skin)
1 Grey Pixie Dust Bag|Treasure Pygmy (Grey bag, gold skin)
Plan: Goblin Machine|Giant Teddybear Keywarden at Whimsyshire

- % Chances to drop: Same as Keywarden Keys. Requires 5NV, and chance to drop depends of Monster Power.

---

**Craft the Goblin Machine**

- Teach Plan: Goblin Machine to the Blacksmith
- Craft the machine using the required Dust Bags.

---

**Open the Goblin Machine in the Room of Avarice**

- Start the Quest ""Act 1: Return to Tristram""
- Go to Leoric's Manor, 2nd Floor, big room. There is door there that used to be not openable. Destroy the door, and go inside.
- Right-click the Goblin Machine
- Click the Portal to Greed's Domain.

---

**Uber Boss Fight: Greed and the Butcher**

Kill Greed and the Butcher.

After the final kill, there is a chance to drop One or All of:

- Ore of Voracity
- Ore of Ravenousness
- Ore of Insatiability

---

**Craft the Greedy Goblin Ring**

- Buy ""Plan: Greedy Goblin Ring"" from Squirt for 2,000,000
- Teach the plan to the Jeweler
- Put the Staff of Herding in your inventory (Required to help Covetous craft your ring)
- Craft one of these rings: 

---

**Your choices**

- Greedy Goblin Ring of Strength
- Greedy Goblin Ring of Intelligence
- Greedy Goblin Ring of Dexterity
- Greedy Goblin Ring of Vitality

---
.

**Uber Boss Greed**
---
.

Greed and Butcher will be in a special version of the Act 4 Rakanoth Room.

- Greed is one giant Goblin, and you can clearly see from here the terrifying Goblin's face.
- Hitting him has a chance to spawn Goblins. You should see a lot of them popping out.
- He is Arcane, Jailer, Frozen, Vortex, Knockback, Fast
- He will randomly create Gold pots around the room.
- Did I mention Arcane?

You will be tortured with sights of Goblins Teleporting out.

---

.
**EDITS**
---
.

I wanted to expand the mechanic, so that when you portal to Greed's Domain, you'll be put in a symmetric map with a special theme -- it's a treasure world -- it's hellish but full of riches.

In this map, activate 4 beacons. When you activate a beacon, a Purple Elite appears along with minions (kinda like in Diablo 2). 

After opening the 4 beacons, a giant castle-sized chest appears in middle of the map, and a portal. Go to the portal, so that you'll go inside the castle chest, and fight Greed.

The world: 

You will see Goblins sorting our treasure. Goblins with no bags. If you aggro them, they summon animated weapons, and portal out.

    Ok guys I think I'll play the game a bit for now, I uploaded a new version just for a couple small changes:    
    
https://sourceforge.net/projects/diablo3itemwall/files/0.2.1/    
    
    -0.2.1
    --Added a bit of height to the cropped boxes  because some items were getting choped off
    --Added the .dll files and everything that py2exe produces when it compiles the code, because some people      
    were missing the .dll
    --You can just download the .exe of download the .rar which has the accompanying files (the .exe is in the dist folder inside the rar)

    I really want to continue on this, but to be honest I should be writing my master thesis right now so I can't promise too much, but please keep the feedback incoming, ESPECIALLY if you have any good idea about how to detect the item boxes inside the images :D


	*edit3 : Version 0.2 (lol) is out :)
https://sourceforge.net/projects/diablo3itemwall/files/0.2/    
    
		Now the images are pasted in their relevant position, but the screenshots REALLY need 
		to be taken in the correct order for this to work
		You can take a screenshot with your details page open (AFTER the screenshots of the items) 
		and it will be added to the WallImage, 
		if you don't and there are only 13 pics in the folder, there's no problem :)

	Here's what it looks like now:

	I wanted to post a picture of my gear and long story short I ended up writing a little script 
	to make the process much faster and easier.

Big thanks to  [sed- ](http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/diablo-3/diablo-3-bots-programs/360293-item-screenshot-montage-generator.html) whose code I used as a basis for this.    
    



		How to Use
	* Download the executable or the script 
		(You need python and Python Image Library (PIL) to run the code)

	* Go in the game and take screenshots (hit *Print Screen*) of your gear
	* You MUST:
	*    Be wearing the gear when you take the screenshot
	*   Take the screenshots in a specific order which is:
	*      Shoulders,Gloves,LeftRing,Weapon ~ Helmet, Chest,Belt,Pants,Boots ~ Amulet, Bracers, Right Ring,Off Hand
	*      Basically, you need to take screenshots of the first column of gear, THEN of the second and then of the third
	*      The need for this is because the script crops pictures at a specific percentage of the image width (pattern recognition proved to be too much for a Saturday project)


		
	These screeshots are saved in Documents\Diablo3\Screenshots.
		
	We need to put them in a folder with the executable, I suggest making an empty folder inside 
	the Screenshots folder and drag the new screenshots in there.   
	Be careful, if there are more pictures that the 13 items of your gear the final image will be messed up.  
		

	Now we have 13 screenshots and the executable/script in the same folder (with no other images inside it)
	all that's left is to run the executable (double click the .exe) or run the script.  

		

	Give it a couple seconds and you'll see the Item Wall image in that same folder.  

		
	It should work for most aspect ratios, if it doesn't work for yours please contact me and I'll patch it :)  
		 
	If you guys want I can upgrade it to expect a screenshot of the ""Details"" page.  
		 
	You can get the script here:

My thoughts so far on the game.",DirtySyko,385,128,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/txuac/at_level_60_just_entered_inferno_my_thoughts_so/,"I know some of the things I'm going to mention are currently being discussed, but I thought I'd chime in as well because if we want anything to be changed we have to keep bringing up the issues.

This game is amazing, I'm still having a blast with it, and I plan on playing more and more, but I think for this game to have real longevity there has to be some major tweaking and changes being made. Here are some of the big flaws I believe this game has that can hurt it in the long run:

* Itemization. It's being [talked about](http://diablo.incgamers.com/blog/comments/end-game-items-broken-legendaries-much-weaker-than-common-magic-items) a lot right now, and for good reason. Let's keep talking about it. We do not want viable magic items in Inferno. I don't think we even want them in Hell mode. We want cool Legendary items to seek. I am level 60 now, I want to know there's all kinds of cool Legendary items that await me, but as it is right now there is no excitement to be had or thrill for seeking out a Legendary or Set piece. I don't necessarily think they should be the end-all to items in the game, but I do believe they should always be an upgrade to a blue, and in most cases even to rares. I like the idea of rares having a chance at being better than Legendaries, you just have to get really lucky... But, it doesn't seem like you have to be all that lucky to get a magic item or rare that will out perform the rarest items in the game. Not a good system.

* More Affixes on items, both in variety and how many you can have on an item. I could be misinformed here, but isn't the max number of affixes 8? It doesn't seem like a high enough limit. I'm not sure if there should even be a limit. I do know that placing a cap harms the value of items if you get a bogus affix. Affixes like Gold radius pick-up just take up the place of having another useful Affix, but I want the chance to have all the useful Affixes I'm looking for an item, as well as the item having Gold radius pick-up. Sometimes you will get trash rares, I'm OK with that. I'm also OK with getting class specific rares that have stats totally unrelated to your class. I like the randomness. I just think removing the limit of Affixes gives your items more value, because even if you get that class rare Demon Hunter quiver you could very well get every single affix you want on it as well as some unrelated affix like a bonus to a Witch Doctor ability. It won't matter, because you have everything else you needed. But, since we have a cap, any time you receive a bogus Affix it greatly diminishes the value of your item, and people just want to have items with a huge list of Affixes because it's just cool to have, even if there's a lot of not-so-useful ones. And of course, more variety in the list of potential Affixes items can have.

* Give Act bosses additional mechanics/random mechanics in the later difficulties. Anyone in Nightmare, or especially Hell and Inferno, realizes the real challenge comes from elite mobs. In Hell mode I haven't really had any trouble with any act bosses. The Skeleton King isn't any more challenging in Normal than he is in Hell, he just takes longer to kill. We have incentive to kill bosses thanks to the Nephelam Valor buff at level 60 (Diablo in Hell dropped me 3 rares and 6 magic items at 5 stacks of Valor) but there is no challenge in it. My party of 4 didn't even come close to wiping on Diablo in hell mode, but we certainly wiped numerous times against random packs of elites. Act bosses, both minor ones and major ones, need extra mechanics. Preferably random ones. This is a game all about randomness, right? Why not at times have the Skeleton King spawning with Frozen and making the ice balls explode around while fighting him? Or other times have the Skeleton King vortex you to make his hammer swing ability harder to avoid? Even better would be if bosses got their own unique random mechanics. Let Diablo rain Meteors from the sky at times or at other times spawn little fire demons who run at you and explode for big damage. If they do not make changes to the boss fights people will do exactly what Blizzard didn't want and just start farming them. With a full stack of valor you will easily get 2 - 4 rares, and eventually everybody will be very comfortable with the bosses mechanics and they will be farmable.

* Make the Auction House better. This is a pretty vague statement, but if there's one thing I'm not too worried about it's the Auction House. I already have a feeling Blizzard will continue to make changes to it and improve upon it. The former 3 things on my list are what I'm worried Blizzard won't change, or won't change enough. My one wish for the AH is to let us see the stats of an item after we have sold it. I've already sold a million gold worth of items on the AH and I would love to see the stats of those items again, because I can't remember everything they had. I sold a wand for 400k, and I can remember the basics of the stats it had but I'd like to know for sure, so I can remember how to structure prices in the future. It seems like a very simple thing to allow users to do, so I'm not sure why you can't do it.

That's enough ranting. If you took the time to read I appreciate it. I'm going to go back and play some more D3. If there are people who feel differently about this I'd love to hear your feedback. It's hard to tell if it's just the vocal minority who have these feelings or the majority, because the minority is always the loudest.

1337463671.0,257,self.Diablo,tv6pr,A PSA About Loot and You: Why You're Not Seeing the Drops You Want,Thesreyn,340,83,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tv6pr/a_psa_about_loot_and_you_why_youre_not_seeing_the/,"Skip to the tl;dr at the bottom if you want, otherwise feel free to have a read!

So there's been a lot of comments and threads about the state of loot drops in Diablo 3. The common complaints are that class specific loot isn't dropping, or is dropping with pointless stats, or that items are crappy with mismatched stats, or are lacking in stats... The list goes on, but the underlying theme is that people aren't finding the loot they want.

Let us get one thing out in the open very early on:

**The drops you are getting are intentional and effective, it is the way we process rewards that does not match up.**

I'll take a step back now and explain this. In many other games, and Diablo 2 is the best example (being so relevant to this game but also a prime example of how rewards in most video games work), players receive rewards for playing. These rewards increase the power of your character and provide incentive for playing as well as bragging rights and the ability to do higher tier content (unless you're a Wizard. Fuck yeah Energy Armour :P).

Now in games like these where there is a low population, limited interaction between players, and/or it is just plain single-player loot drops need to be tweaked to provide rewards on a reasonable basis. Let's look at an example from Diablo 2:

A given player has a maximum amount of time that they can play. Take the upper bound of that maximum amount of time and you have what is essentially an upper bound on the amount of times a person has access to loot, here-after referred to as *Loot Instances*.

The amount of Loot Instances a player in Diablo 2 has access to is actually fairly limited, even for the most efficient player in the world. Loot drops have to reflect this lower cap on Loot Instances available to a player, and this is done by increasing the chances of a particularly useful or rare piece of loot. In Diablo 2, players saw a lot more useful and powerful drops in their Loot Instances because they had a lower overall cap on the amount of Loot Instances they had access to.

In Diablo 3, this system is flipped on its head, shaken about, then twisted into a Gordian Knot.

Diablo 3 gives every single player access to a mind-boggling increase in the number of Loot Instances they have access to (though this access is somewhat restricted). The most obvious comparison is looking at Diablo 2 Co-op versus Diablo 3 Co-op: In D2, players killing mobs had one Loot Instance, shared amongst up to as many as 8 players, whereas in D3 players have access to their individual Loot Instance and restricted access to as many as 1-3 more Loot Instances.

These changes alone vastly increase the number of Loot Instances a given player has access to. Thus the game must take into account a very basic economic principle: Saturation.

Consider if the drop rates of Diablo 2 were maintained while the number of Loot Instances increased linearly. Items would lose an enormous amount of value, because there would be so many more of them; statistical probability states as much. Thus the market would be saturated with amazing loot very quickly.

In order to prevent this from happening and to maintain the desirability of rare items, the game must prevent saturation. How does it do this? Well it could lower drop rates, and it most certainly will have done that for certain items (such as Uniques and Legendaries), but in some cases this won't work, and this case is where the Developers of D3 have stated the best loot is to be found:

Rares.

Those wonderful yellow items that we see a ridiculously large amount of. But they don't excite us like they used to. Back in Diablo 2, seeing a yellow drop practically guaranteed an upgrade for one character or another, or could be useful for twinking and/or trading. Drop rates for these items however, have not changed. So if we apply what we've discussed so far to rare items in Diablo 3, we see an increase in Loot Instances without a decrease in drop rates, a sure-fire way to cause saturation of rare items. If the power of rare items was maintained, you would have saturation of powerful, desirable items and the overall value of these items would go down, effectively tanking the economy.

So how does the game fix that? It's quite simple really. It uses our old friend the Random Number Generator (RNG). When a rare item is created, it is done so with a number of stats. This varies based on the type of item and within each of these stats the RNG is used again to generate hwo powerful that particular stat is going to be. This is why you can see rares for level 30's with 5 Intelligence and a Socket (most definitely not an upgrade).

Unfortunately, this still won't bring the players' overall access to great items down to a sufficient level. If rares roll only specific stats (such as Intelligence and Vitality for Wizard gear) then you're still going to see an increase in really good drops in Loot Instances, and an overall decline in the value of these items. Diablo 3 is uniquely suited to combatting this problem by allowing every class to use (almost) every item.

When a pair of pants (for example) is rolled, it can have a variable number of stats and those stats range in power. By allowing any stat on any item and more importantly, **(almost) any combination of stats on any item**, Diablo 3 accommodates for the vastly increased number of Loot Instances a player has access to, by making it vastly less likely for a player to see a ""perfectly"" rolled item, something that is absolutely beautiful for a single class, like a +Int, +Vit, +Crit, -CC item for Wizards or Witch Doctors.

*BUT THESREYN*, you may exclaim, *I PLAY WITH FRIENDS ALL THE TIME AND WE STILL SEE CRAPPY LOOT*.

Well my friend, I know it's a bit convoluted, but you actually have access to far more Loot Instances than just those you and your party members play with. Far more. Far far more. Far far far far fucking more more more more more. Why?

The Auction House.

The Auction House gives every player restricted access to billions of Loot Instances across millions of players. For a nominal fee, you can acquire the sort of loot you're looking for because it **is being generated**. Just not by you. But you ARE generating desirable items, they just might not be desirable for you.

We can liken this to the fundamentals of a town. A Baker produces plenty of baked goods, but they are not the only thing the baker needs. If they were, the baker wouldn't enter into the economy. The baker needs other things, like stoves, so he trades his baked goods to acquire currency to purchase stoves from the Small Appliances Man. And occassionally the Baker might like to splurge and get himself a yellow stove with +Heat and -Chance to Burn.

Where have we seen this sort of thing before? In a lot of MMO's. World of Warcraft is a nice example. Plenty of Loot Instances that players have restricted access to, beyond their own personal Loot Instances (and party Loot Instances). The reason we don't notice this in WoW, is because the game economy is fundamentally built this way and has always been so. In Diablo 3, we're making an enormous transition from not only the way loot is handled in Diablo 2, but the way the **entire genre** handles loot.

**So what does this mean for us as players?**

The most important thing is for players to realise the differences. Diablo 3's loot system was made with the increase in access to Loot Instances (restricted or no) and the Auction House in mind. Players are expected to make use of the Auction House. It is entirely possible for a player to try and acquire all their loot from their own drops, but it will be far more difficult to accomplish than it was in previous instances of the genre (and previous versions of Diablo).

We, as players, need to understand this. We need to change our focus from getting excited about the prospect of an upgrade for ourselves, to excitement about finding a powerful item that could be valuable to someone else.

This means that the old-school style of having a bit of a sigh when you picked up that perfect Baker's Stove on your Lumberjack is gone. That item's value to you is **increased** from what it has held in previous instances of the genre, and we need to recognise and make use of that.

The system is by no means perfect. It felt GOOD to pick up an awesome item for your character, or an alt and it still does feel good. But now it's far more rare. It doesn't quite feel as heroic, picking up that Stove from your stash, rather than pulling it from the dead carcass of Lightning-Enchanted Fire Immune Dune Bugs. And the Auction House interface itself needs to be made MUCH more powerful, intuitive and fluid. A tutorial on how it works is a must and I can't believe this was an oversight.

Overall though, what Blizzard has done is created a thriving, loot driven economy that takes into account the enormous increase in access to Loot Instances that Diablo 3 gives to a player. This will require some adjustment on our part, and perhaps some compromise with Blizzard about drop rates and the way certain items are rolled, but the game has only just come out, so we must give both Blizzard time to monitor the economy, and ourselves time to adjust.

It does kind of screw those who don't like the Auction House though...

**tl;dr: Increased access to loot via more drops and the Auction House necessitates lowered drop rates and randomised items that could be anywhere on a scale of terrible to godlike, in order to prevent saturation of the economy with awesome stuff. We as players need to adjust and Blizzard needs to monitor the economy carefully and adjust accordingly.**",,False,self,t5_2qore,1337481356.0,,wizard-americas,True,t3_tv6pr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tv6pr/a_psa_about_loot_and_you_why_youre_not_seeing_the/,

I'm guessing the guy inspected my gear and wanted me to join his game.  He asks to join mine to ""show me something.""  I figure what's the harm and invite him in.

He friend requests me and I accept, thinking I'll go along on a run at some point.  He messages me for the next two days asking me to join up, but I'm generally doing runs with friends at the time.  I finally tell him I'm game to run and he invites me into a full game.

Edit: The guy who originally found the weapon and put it on the RMAH for 250 euro had rent to pay. I don't think he'll ever forget the mistake of not waiting if he hears how much its going to sell for. Hoooly shit, I feel like vomiting on behalf of this guy.



Edit: Rumor has it it was sold for 40 billion gold (12400 euro), though the buyer and the mods of his stream says it was bought for 7500 euro.

1340773036.0,258,self.Diablo,vo5kn,15 tips about general Diablo 3 gameplay,killswitch1968,365,107,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vo5kn/15_tips_about_general_diablo_3_gameplay/,"I started making a list of cool things I wish I knew when I started playing. They are in no particular order and I hope you find it useful. A lot of this was gleaned from Reddit and I tried to link to original articles when I could find it. 

1. Not only can you compare different rings by holding alt, but you can **equip** a ring as well to the the other slot by holding alt and right clicking. This works for dual wielding (thanks Zeheve).
2. There are lots of other emotes on your Numpad that aren’t currently bound, like “retreat” and ""Attack!"". Find them in the keybindings menu. 
3. You can bind a button just for moving instead of the all purpose left mouse move/attack. Though sadly you can’t rebind left mouse to anything but default.
4. Salvaging a socketed item gives you the gem back. For free. (Thanks [Nusent ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tv453/til_you_can_get_your_gems_back_for_free_by/)
5. You can right click the potion bar to select a different grade of potion instead of dragging one from your inventory.
6. If you ever accidentally drag a skill off your hotbar on accident, causing you to lose your Nephalem valor, there is a work around to lock your skillbar. Turn off elective mode in your game settings! This won’t make you lose your Neph buffs either.
7. If you are a demon hunter and find yourself at 0 health from the Smokescreen bug, just equip and unequip a piece of armour with vitality/% life and it’ll fix it quick without being forced to die.
8. Pushing escape ends an entire dialogue tree, you don’t have to push space or click the little xes. For **non-skippable** scenes that don't have pop ups (ie. Tyrael and Imperius before Iskatu, Cow King) hitting space bar will skip each conversation bubble providing the key is bound to ""Close All Windows"". Alternatively you can walk away from the dialogue just enough so the character models are out of screen, then come back it'll finish instantly. Thanks The_Auryn!
9. If you are wondering what the stats of an item you sold in the AH were, don’t send the cash to your stash right away when it sells. Send a message and shift-click the item in question. You don’t even have to send it to someone. Then you can see the stats show up in the chat bar and hit print screen to save it.
10. In Act 3, raising the catapults, you don't have to help raise the first and second ones at all, the meters still climb even through the guys are getting killed, and you still get the exp! Note at higher difficulties (ie. hell) the meters stall more and can stop completely. (*Some people are reporting problems, I tested this June 27th and it still works on Nightmare/Hell, Inferno not tested*)
11. There are 4 types of treasure goblins and they all have different drop rates. Bandits drop more crafting books, &amp; Seekers drop gems. I haven’t heard the difference between Pygmies and regular Goblins yet.
12. if you die multiple times, your rez timer will go up. If you want that to go back to 3 seconds, 2 minutes is the magic number to wait in town to try that elite pack again!
13. It seems like followers contribute very little to damage, but they have a different set of rules for stats. Followers get 2.5 times the attribute from primary stats! Weapons are a bit different. They only do 20% of damage from a primary weapon for their autoattack. But their abilities - like the non-CC ones - get full the damage! That said it’s probably better focusing on dex/int/str + vit than a high DPS weapon on your followers.
Finally followers do contribute to Magic Find, Gold Find, and Experience/Kill but only at 20% of their total. [reddit link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vf9kc/give_your_follower_some_love/) Click [here](http://imgur.com/swCcj) to see how much more important stats are to DPS!
14. Curious if a bid on the AH is a true bid or just the seller’s crazy starting bid price? Click bid and it'll say if its the ""Starting Bid"" or ""Current Bid"" (Thanks TheUberhaus!). (Much easier than what I had before: if you are forced to give an increased bid, then it’s an actual bidder’s bid.)
15. Maximum movespeed is 25% from items alone. Even if you get more items that go above that you'll cap at 25%. **Passive** movespeed bonuses also cap at 25% like the Monk's fleet footed. You'll need legendaries to get above 12%, which is the maximum blue/yellow boots can offer you.
16. (Bonus I remembered!). If you are salvaging a bunch of items you don't have to click each item and drag it to the blacksmith. Just click the anvil/salvage button and your cursor will change to a hammer, then click each item you want to salvage in a row. Rare items will generate a confirmation popup but hit Enter and it'll salvage without having to click Yes.
16. Ack one more! %Life is interesting. It **does** stack (increase the bonus by x %) with any +vitality items you have, but it does **not** stack with other %Life items you have. So just like armor and resist, it's good to have both as they work synergistically.",Discussion,False,self,t5_2qore,1340833771.0,secrettome,monk-europe,True,t3_vo5kn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vo5kn/15_tips_about_general_diablo_3_gameplay/,

Some suggestions from the comments:

* Support more than 4 digit whole numbers. *Current:* 1-999 | *Improved:* 1-9999

* Support more than 5 digit decimals. *Current:* 0.1 to 9.9 | *Improved:* 0.1 to 9999.9

* Option to Ignore the Stats brought by gems. e.g. If someone searches for a 90 VIT Chest Armor, do not include the ones socketed with 3 Amethysts.

* Hovering on items should compare them to my selected character, just like in-game. A lot of money has been wasted buying weapons perceived to improve your DPS, only to discover in-game that the weapon decreases your DPS.

On Selling:

* Hovering on Sold Items Gold should show the item. Right now, we work around this by Shift-Clicking the Gold Payment so that the item link will appear on the General Chat, and then we click the item link to show the item window.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/t35sv/cash_out_profit_table_from_the_d3_forums/c4j6oxb

**I am first and foremost a gamer. I do NOT plan on botting D3 anytime soon. I'm going to thoroughly enjoy this game i've waited years for. I love video games, especially MMOs and for the most part, keep my main account separate from any other botting accounts that I might use. I just use bots as a means to add some supplementary income.**

I am far from the biggest person out there, and I don't make millions a year doing this, but I make some pretty substantial side income for little to no effort on my part. Botting really is not for everyone, as there is a high level of risk (which grows every day); not for the faint of heart. I can share some horror stories and huge losses if you guys are interested.

All I ask is that you keep an open mind about this and don't instantly down vote in to oblivion. Ask anything you want - methods, how this type of industry/economy works, what methods to use, hardware setups, how to get in to it, risks, BOTTING in general, ways companies detect botters, etc. 

**Background**
I actually started my virtual item selling in D2 days with D2jsp about 10 years go. Botting was ""relatively"" newer and not as widespread then, so not a whole heck of a lot of people did it. Setup wasn't always the easiest, so i think that deterred a lot of people from doing it as well. After a few weeks/months of getting concepts and script writing down, i ended up with a few d2 accounts that would farm items nearly 24/7. I had every kind of epic, rare, set item imaginable....times 20. I think i was up to 10 or so mule accounts. One day while bored of D2, I thought back to how a buddy of mine got a Wurmslayer (Everquest) as a birthday gift from his parents. The sword I think ended up costing them $250 bucks due to it's rarity at the time. I figured what the hell, and posted some of the rarer D2 items I had and went to bed. The next day I woke up and noticed every auction I put up already was bought out. That's where my journey began.

I soon moved on to hardcore as the items sold for 75-100% more, and I got in the routine of waking up in the morning, posting auctions for the items i botted overnight, then transferring the items to buyers in the afternoon, over and over. The entire process was maybe a hour or so worth of work a day; which I was easily had time for as a student. Items sold anywhere from 3 bucks to upwards of 30 or so; which equated to probably 20-50 per day -- which wasn't to bad for me since it was barely any work at all. Once D2jsp no longer was safe to use (IE: detectable), I started using mmbot, which farmed Pindleskin non stop. I started ramping up my production, and had 14 bnet keys i rotated through to avoid the ""too many games in a hour"" detection, which of course was automated. 

Fast forward to WoW. Up until about 5 months ago, i used to have 10-15 accounts botting at any given point on my computer. Even with gold at .5-.65 per 1k, having that kind of army made quanties add up fast, you could easily make a few k a month with 1 computer and little effort -- especially having a bot that could harvest nodes, send them to an alt, log on that alt, and post them on the ah. It was 100% automated. 

Selling virtual items has come a long way, especially in the past 5 years or so. No longer is it really taboo to spend real life cash to buy items, it's more and more common. Methods in which to sell, and the methods in which to avoid getting your accounts banned (detected or otherwise) have also evolved greatly. Things like avoiding ""Warden"" (blizzards built in anti-cheat software) are only part of the risk now, and losing at least some accounts is just part of the cost of doing business. Ironically enough, i keep reading posts saying there will be no botting in D3 because Blizzard has learned from the past. To an extent, they have, but for every measure blizzard takes to ensure a bot free environment, there are three new countermeasures to get around it. It's a never ending battle; botting will exist for as long as their are video games out, whether people choose to believe it or not. 

Obviously, there are many other games in there that i've botted and sold virtual currencies and characters on, but I really don't feel it's worth mentioning unless someone asks specifically, i just picked ones that were relevant to most. I think many under-estimate what bots can do today. I'd say the average wow player encounters at least 3-5 bots per week in some fashion and have no idea that it is in fact a bot. I've been a member of underground botting/farming operations and have used countless bots for every game imaginable. Furthermore, I have a good insight and details about how some of the really big farming companies and websites (those making 100k + a month). I truly believe that what the majority of the gaming population knows about botting is only really a tip of the iceberg.

So there you have it, my somewhat brief introduction. If you want an idea how RMAH and botting is going to affect D3, or if you want even more details, check out that link above, i've already answered a few questions some had about this subject. Anything other questions you have about this somewhat secretive world, or bots, or i guess anything related, by all means, ask.

**edit**

I want to add my take on botting in D3. First and foremost, there won't be as many spam bots in D3, that's for sure. It might happen to some extent, but not anywhere near the D2 rate.

In terms of actual bots, they will exist, but nothing will be mainstream for 6 months or so (at least a safe one). It's true that while D3 is instanced its much much safer to bot than in most other games  (safer since most botters are banned via player reports). However, fear not, Blizzard knows this and has other methods of detecting botters in a multitude of ways outside of player reports. Besides their anti-cheat software ""Warden"", I believe they have forms of pattern detection. Obviously, I can't say for certain since they would never disclose information like this, but from my personal experience recent with WoW botting it seems to hold true. Most likely, they have ""triggers"" that will flag a particular account if a certain criteria is met - such as playing for 24 hours straight constantly farming the same areas. In short, Blizzard has learned from the past and are going to have great counter-measures in place to prevent D3 botting and economy exploitation.

A little background on my personal experience with Diablo 3 before we get started.

I have 400 hours played.
I have cleared Inferno.
I can farm all of the acts, but i now prefer farming Act 2.
I have killed 12,707 elites so far.
I love this game and I'm looking forward to future expansions and patches.

This is a general collection of opinions that I think would enhance the game. These opinions are intended to add variety and alleviate the frustration of unavoidable deaths and the general unfairness of some rares/champions.

**Desecrator**

* Limit to 2 or 3 active desecrators per monster.
* Add elemental variety (cold, arcane, poison, electricity)

**Electrified**

* Increase the damage
* Increase the range
* Decrease the abundance
* Add elemental variety (fire, arcane, poison, cold)

**Fast**

* Remove from inherently fast and/or kiting monsters.

**Fire Chains**

* Add elemental variety (cold, arcane, poison, electricity)

**Frozen** 

* Prevent consecutive freezing. Frozen targets should be immune to frozen to prevent unavoidable freeze deaths.
* Add elemental variety (Fire, arcane, poison, electricity)

**EDIT:** for clarification.

&gt;**For example and entertainment purposes only:**

&gt;Fire bombs: Looks like Frozen but is red, grows and then pops, deals fire damage.

&gt;Poison poppers: Looks like Frozen but is green, grows and pops, deals poison damage over time and slows you.

&gt;Ball Lightning: Looks like Frozen but is blue, grows and pops, deals electric damage and drains mana, fury, arcane and discipline.

**Invulnerable Minions** 

* Remove from inherently shielding, invisible/invincible and burrowing monsters.

**Molten** 

* Lower the damage (completely insane right now, bordering on broken)
* Add elemental variety (cold, arcane, poison, electricity)

**Mortar** 

* Add elemental variety (cold, arcane, poison, electricity)

**Nightmarish**

* Prevent chain fearing
* allow 1 second of immunity between fears
* add diminishing returns or a cooldown

**Plagued** 

* Increase damage
* Add elemental variety (fire, arcane, electricity, cold)

**Shielding** 

* Remove the CC immunity from shielding
* Remove from inherently shielding, invisible and burrowing monsters

**Reflect Damage** 

* Should not be constant (~25% downtime)
* Should be a visible indicator of some kind. 

**Arcane sentries**

* Add elemental variety (fire, poison, electricity, cold)
* Prevent the combination of Horde + Arcane
* Different elemental sentries could do different damage, provide different debuffs (such as slow or damage over time), have different lengths and rotate at different speeds.

In conclusion; i think some of the affixes are semi broken and could use some fixes. Some affixes need buffs, some need nerfs and/or alterations. I don't want this game to be too easy. I loved the challenge i faced while gearing up to beat the game. That being said i don't consider instant and/or unavoidable deaths to be difficult, just discouraging. I really enjoy the difficulty but these affixes are not adding difficulty, they are simply cheesy and need some work to make them both challenging and exciting. 

Thanks for reading.

While I was grinding out levels, I thought it'd be pretty cool to actually get P100 from Diablo's death on Inferno MP10.  So I did a little math and figured out how much experience to leave myself as a buffer.  The tricky part was that the shadow clones do give experience, so I only had a few tries to complete the entire fight before a shadow clone would've leveled me up.

I've never played an MP10 game before today, and as you can see by my chat log the first 3 attempts didn't go too well.... haha.  But the 4th time was the charm and it worked out great.

I realize this isn't a ""world's first"" or a ""record time"", heck I even decided to drop 40k dps for an off-hand with high stun %, but it was definitely an accomplishment for me.

High quality rares are much cheaper than they used to be. After that you should start working towards building a [Hellfire Ring](http://www.diablowiki.net/Hellfire_Ring).

In August they nerfed the hell out of elites making the question not if you can kill them, but how fast you can.

[Paragon Levels](http://www.diablowiki.net/Paragon) came out: after reaching level 60, your exp goes toward these levels. Each level grants +3% magic find, +3% gold find, +3 to primary stat, +2 to vitality and +1 to secondary stats. The magic find cap on gear/paragon levels is 300% (not including monster power or nephalem valor stacks). This makes magic find less and less important to have on your gear as you gain paragon levels.

[Monster power](http://www.diablowiki.net/Monster_Power) is the difficulty of monsters (more health and damage) in exchange for XP, gold find, magic find, and more items/demonic essences dropping. [Here](http://www.diablowiki.net/images/4/41/Monster-power-bonuses2.jpg) is a chart displaying what this is all about. All acts MP1+ are the same difficulty now and have the same chance to drop i63 items.

[Demonic Essence](http://www.diablowiki.net/Demonic_Essence) is a BoA item used to craft i63 BoA equipment. They drop off of elites and treasure goblins.

Two new shrines were added to the game:

* Empowered Shrine – Increases resource regeneration and reduces cooldowns
* Fleeting Shrine – Increases movement speed and pickup radius

PvP was released in February. You can only fight players in the Scorched Chapel; speak with Nek the Brawler to enter.

EVENT DENSITY!,gryphian,337,81,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/17933i/mob_density_event_density/,"I think that mob density just kind of contributes to 'the grind'. You'd feel like you're getting options with increased mob density, but you're not at all.

What happened to gamers who actually like immersion? Why aren't we going in that direction AT ALL?

The game could definitely do with more dungeons and events rather than just more mindless elites. I mean events with serious rewards... not throwing 1000 gold at you...

New events can spawn in acts in inferno only.

Here are just a few examples:

* Khazra Tower: a 5 leveled dungeons with purple bosses(increasing in difficulty) on each level, as well as a resplendent chest on each level. Throw in some random gobs and elites. Final level is Bonebuster, a purple khazra demon who basically is an uber.



* Skeleton Pit: a 2 level dungeon that is packed with hordes and hordes of skeletons. Massive amount of skeletons between you and level 2. After managing to fight your way to the bottom is a purple uber cultist renamed to a necromancer. Upon killing him, the event finishes and a stone door opens  where zombies pour into the room. You have to fight your way through a hallway of zombies in order to reach the exit, because the entrance has now closed.



* Arcane Portal: Single level dungeon. Takes you to a confusing dungeon with various levers and doors. There is a total of 7 locked rooms, each with elites in them, except the 7th, being occupied by a purple Subjugator.



* Burning Pit: Similar styles of the hall of agony, this place is very visibly gory and filled with torture devices. This place features 4 special mobs. Molten Fallen, Fire-themed heralds of pestilence, and fire obelisks that summon burning spiders. This place will be a test of fire resistance for sure. Close to the end, an event is triggered where the entire place is going to be swallowed by lava, and you must run to the treasure room and escape. If you fail, then you die and the dungeon is sealed.



These are just a few examples. Of course it would take much longer to implement these new types of things, but I think it would be well worth it to keep this game alive for quite a while.

Give us some awesome new drops that are not associated with game-changing, risky, new mechanics. I'm talking rare and Legendary dyes, which can be traded, an ONLY drop off of monsters.

SFX dyes that add cool effects to your character, like setting a certain piece of armor on fire with Hellfire Dye.

I paid good money for the CE and haven't used the wings since launch week. I'd have pre-ordered the digital edition of SC2 to get the ""blade"" wings as well if it weren't for how goofy the method of equipping them is.

Communication.
It's the key for people to understand the developers. It allows us to follow their thought process and understand their iterations in their design. It lets us see that they are trying, what they are trying. It allows us to know how they feel about the state of class balance, fun, and progression (though, I think maybe the silence might be telling enough.)


The dichotomy between how well the WoW team communicates and how badly the Diablo team communicates is grand. Both teams have projects on the ptr. What does the WoW team post on the forums?


[WoW Blue Posts](http://imgur.com/a/BRLos#5)


This is just since the 16th. That's 3 days worth of stuff addressing concerns, classes, balance, abilities, fun,  and most importantly, addressing the community. This quantity (and quality) of dialogue has been maintained since the PTR dropped. 


Ghostcrawler, the lead designer has also taken to Twitter in the last few months and answers as many questions as he can while he is there. We may not always like the answers, but at least he is effectively communicating. 


Also within the last few days we've gotten a Dev watercooler/Coffee with the Devs (if you are of the European persuasion),  the equivalent of the Diablo Blogs. 


Now I will give you what the Diablo 3 team has posted in the last three days:

-A post about how the main developer is stepping down

-The main guy's boss telling us to stop picking on him (and the cross-post of this on reddit... from a Blue)

-Nothing about classes or design (minus the post about CC and dmg to Elites) since the 12th when the 1.0.7 blog full of changes was posted.

-Known Issues with PTR and Friend Invitations.


So overall, I believe there is a massive disconnect between the developers and the community. The channels for dialogue are easy to access and are incredibly beneficial (seriously, GC has been doing this since the Wrath Beta, why would he continue to do it if it didn't work?) to not just the community, but the Devs too and yet they are barren.


I think at this point the D3 team is afraid of the community because of how vehemently passionate we are. We all wanted this to be an amazing game, and many, many got something that was less than desirable, had no end-game, etc. (I could go on and on about the things that were/are wrong, but I think at this point it's just preaching to the choir). 


We expected these great things because Blizzard was open with their intents and clearly misjudged the amount of resources and effort to allocate correctly. Because of this a lot of things were scrapped, weren't shipped, failed at launch, etc., and the community reacted very negatively and very loudly. 


Each time something they've planned hasn't come to fruition, the community's reaction is the same, so while I do hate the lack of communication, I can understand why they would be wary about sharing things that they are planning on doing in the future with a community that will lambast, excoriate, and demonize them.


But I do believe people truly want to love this game, and are trying to remain hopeful, but are time and time again let down. How many more lackluster Patch Notes will it be until they give up and stop caring? That's the part that Blizzard should be wary of. When people stop complaining  not because they have been placated, but because there is no one left that cares enough to complain. 


**TLDR**; D3 Team needs to take a leaf out of the WoW Team's book and open up/broaden the lines of communication between those who make and those who play the game.


PS. If I have to type community or communication one more time I will stab my eyes out.

I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that Monster Power is a huge step in the right direction.  However, so far one of the most common annoyances from players in the PTR is the fact that lower acts will not be able to reward the best loot even at monster power 10 in the current system.

Many comments in other posts have recommended having MP increase the level of the enemies slain in lower acts.  Obviously the details would need to be worked out by the blizzard wizards(Say, having a MP of 3-4 causes act 1 enemies to be level 62, act 2 63... or whatever they think works best), but I think there is a large consensus forming that we are a bit disheartened that it looks like we are still going to need to continue to farm act 3 to maintain maximum efficiency.

I would like to reiterate that there are really no new ideas in this post that haven't been said in various posts/comments already.  The purpose of this post is to create one central location for supporters of this idea to discuss this change out of hopes that it gets noticed by the right people at blizzard and can be worked into 1.05, or a patch soon after.

Thank you for your time everyone, and I hope we can get this change to make it through so everyone can go back to enjoying other parts of Diablo 3 that we miss so much.  :-)

For more information on the current specifics of how the monster power system works check out [this interview with Jay Wilson and Wyatt Cheng](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/22/diablo-3-patch-1-05-interview-with-jay-wilson-and-wyatt-cheng/).

**IMPORTANT EDIT: The interview seems to have been stealth changed at some point.  There seems to have been a change in the monster power mechanics.**

&gt; How will it affect the distribution of items? Like, can you find item level 63 stuff in earlier acts if you crank up Monster Power?

&gt; WC: You can get item level 63 stuff in all acts of Inferno when Monster Power is on. The moment you go into Inferno with any kind of Monster Power, all monsters become level 63, and they can now all drop item level 63 stuff the same way that Act III and Act IV Inferno do now. However, cranking up Monster Power beyond MP1 does not further increase your chance of getting 63 stuff.

I thought to myself ""hmmm, a bot would love this"" so I put it up on the AH for 5 mill. Sold within the hour! Wondering how much more I could have gotten.

So yeah, they may screw up the economy, but they give some of it back for items that no one else would buy;) Be creative when determining the value of an item. Some items look pretty bad when we consider our own character, but another play-style might consider it ""best in slot.""

Here are some things that aren't ""cookie cutter"" stats but particular classes find them very valuable. Please add your own ideas!

**Follower amulets with magic find** - THESE SELL FOR A LOT. DO NOT SALVAGE UNTIL YOU HAVE COMAPRED TO OTHER SIMILAR ITEMS ON THE AH.

**Witch Doctor items with pickup radius** - Witch doctors use a passive called ""Grave Injustice,"" the radius of which depends on your pickup radius. If you find a piece of gear that is otherwise pretty good, but has pickup radius, do NOT discount the value of pickupradius as a junk stat. Witch doctors covet it.

**Blue rings/ammies with life on hit + magic find/gold find/all resists -** Last night, the most expensive thing I ended up selling was a blue amulet with 300 life on hit and 60 or something all resists. 1.5 million. I was about to salvage it before I looked at its stats.

**ANY item with ~17+ MF:** Everyone wants to have a magic find gear. If you have an item with decent stats and ~17% magic find, keep it! If you have an item with 17-20% magic find KEEP IT. Even if its other stats are pretty crappy. Now, if it has otherwise GOOD stats and 17-20% magic find, the thing will sell for millions. ANY item with 20% MF will sell for a decent amount. Some people simple MF switch and therefore don't even care about the other stats

**Weapons with two of the following: life on hit, crit damage, socket -** This is probably obvious to most of you, but those are basically the stats people look for in weapons. Getting one with main stat and vit is obviously nice, but weapons are unique in HOW MUCH crit damage you can socket into it/roll, and the same goes for life on hit. I sold a 700 something dps one hander (not much damage) with 500 life on hit, a socket, and 70% crit damage for 10 million. In retrospect, I probably got ripped off (it sold quick). Now, I got lucky and had all three of those stats, but you can see that the ""dps"" stat isn't the end all be all stat for weapons as some people make them out to be.

**Helms with MF AND a socket:** These sell FOR QUITE A BIT. If you can find a helm with ~15% MF AND a socket, then you can socket a topaz for a total of 30%+ MF. Same goes for amulets with 30%+ MF (even if it's blue and doesn't have much else). I can't give a good price atm, but check auction house and you'll see what I'm saying.

**Shields with high block chance -** Should sound obvious, but to many people, block chance is ALL that matters (at least, it's the first thing they look at, and without a high block chance, they won't even consider everything else). If you roll a high level shield with +block%, hold on to it:) A sacred shield with ~24-30% block rate can get HUGE amounts if its other stats are even just mediocre:)

There are many others, but I read a post today of someone claiming to have NEVER found anything worth 300k+ in his 100 hours of playing. I find this very difficult to believe. If anyone has other ideas, please post them below and I'll edit them into my comment:)

**Edit:** Never played witch doctor, so I mixed up my spells. It's ""Grave injustice"" (the passive) which relies on pickup radius.

It occoured to me then that a sort of Infinite Jar of Souls mini-game could be incredibly rewarding and a good little warm-up/cool-down for a hard days farming.

I envisioned it with a format similar to the zombies minigame in CoD that gets so much love. After each clear there's a a brief respite, and the enemies become greater in number and strength as you progress through each wave. A few things would need to be tampered with (I peronsally would take potion quantity out of the mix and limit usage either by wave or on pure CD), but overall I think it would fit quite well into the mix.

This would also add a great little way to compete amongst friends as well as the general populace :).

EDIT THE 2ND (Electric Boogaloo?): To further clarify, I am not talking about an in-game event where normal things like ""dying"" or ""loot"" would come into play. How I envisioned this was as an entirely seperate mini-game that you could ""port"" characters that you've farmed up over to. That way, dying in this game mode allows HC chars to not vaporize, and its not a free-farm mode either.

But Blizzard have really polished this game and there is a reason behind a lot of their design.

In D2 there would be a constant boss run grinding, the same thing over and over, negating the need to do anything else but boss runs for items.

Act bosses in D3 don't drop good loot, instead provide the function of stopping us from progressing the next Act where better Tier items drop.

The loot that drops in nightmare act 1 is not as good as the loot that drops in nightmare act 4. There are many different Tiers of loot and to get that loot you have to reach certain parts of the game on certain difficulties.

So the point of these bosses is to give you a challenge to earn the right to farm loot from champions/elite monsters in the next act. When you get into Hell mode you will likely find that you need to get new items before you can challenge the act boss and earn the right to the next Act. 

Once you're in the next act you can farm away until you feel strong enough to take on the next boss. Eventually earning the right to fight in ACT 4 Inferno will grant you the possibility of finding the best items in game.


&gt;&gt;&gt;***EDIT***&lt;&lt;&lt;


For those of you who are a bit pissed about this system. Blizzard also created a buff which you get at level 60. Every time you killed a Rare or Champion your Valor buff stacks. This buff increases MagicFind. 

This means that you can still get lots of rare items from bosses. But you need to kill some Champions and Rares first. Effectively forcing you to include other parts of the game in your boss runs.

Blizzard are a canny lot, they realised some of you may be pissed and so still gave you the opportunity to get good loot form bosses, but you first have to defeat some Champions and Rares which ALSO give you good loot :)

Let me paint a picture...  You rush your butt through this difficult dungeon, defying all odds of surviving a bunch of elite packs, only to make it to the treasure room where there's a fortune shrine, 2 standard chests, and 1 resplendent.  You look at your 5 stacks, hit the shrine, put all your magic find gear on (you know it doesn't do anything... but just in case), then go to open the chests and nothing but 5 level 58 blues pop out.

It's probably the most disappointing part of Act 2.  Like, what's the point of doing the timed dungeon if the reward for actually completing the (usually difficult) quest is less than if you just killed all the elites in the dungeon?

Please correct this.  I honestly don't care if MF doesn't work for Resplendent chests, I understand why that was changed, but then for the love of biscuits give us a different chest type for this quest (you did it for Mysterious chests...), or some other reward for this mission.

It is fun to try and get through the dungeon unscathed, and you have a sense of victory when you're able to do it, but then at least give us a better reward than if we intentionally fail the quest to just farm the dungeon instead.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_w4s66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w4s66/timed_dungeon_in_act_2_disappointing_after_mf_nerf/,

As we know, this is easier said than done for many people that are fresh into inferno.

The difficulty lays in killing elite packs for many players. Today I discovered an easy way to stack valor buff, in the halls of anguish by letting [cultists complete their ritual that looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/3Yyux.jpg). What it is is 4 cultists, 3 surround 1 of them, and seem to cast fireballs on the one in the middle.

When the channeling is complete, the one in the center turns into a champion, and killing him gives you a Valor count even though there is just one of him in the pack! Now noting the fact that you should run into a few of these cultists, those of you whom struggle to kill elite/champ packs in Act 1, or simply just don't want to spend lots of time getting their stack by killing tough groups, I recommend that you let these guys finish their channel, and take out the lonely champ.

Now obviously some of you may have decided to wait out what happens with these guys and discovered this for yourself, but for those whom haven't - there ya go :). 

happy hunting!

Edit: The key is 3 surrounding 1 (forming a triangle). The surrounding ones shoot fireballs at the one in the center, the one in the middle taps his staff. This is different to the groups whom all stand around  tapping a staff together, and all turn into a non-champion possessed thrall.

Well, as you will see from my armory profile below, I have a decently geared level 60 of each class ready to head for Diablo in hardcore.

Also should I try to stream this attempt? I do not know how to stream though. Perhaps one of you guys already knows how to stream. Maybe we could get 4 redditors together and stream a team event. That sounds like it could be awesome. If any of you know how to stream and want to try to make a 4 man team of redditors for this Diablo attempt let me know. I would be so down for that.

One year ago today I registered the domain and started molding the site into what it is now. Without /r/diablo and the tremendous support from the Diablo 3 community, the site wouldn't be what it is today. This post is just for me to say THANK YOU to all the players out there who've provided feedback, reported bugs, and helped me figure out all the math to make things work.

Originally I considered doing some sort of giveaway, but [as some of you already know](http://www.reddit.com/r/d3up/comments/1faauv/testing_some_ads_and_moving_out_west/), my life's pretty fricking crazy right now. So I decided to take a trip down memory lane and go back and see what the site looked like between it's creation and now. It's come a long ways...

Here's 2 flickr albums with a bunch of screenshots. 

- [Early D3Up and it's evolution](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/sets/72157634123713387/)
- [The ""Build"" Page and how it's changed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/sets/72157634110673310/)

Here's a brief rundown of the history, talking about some of the images:

1. This was [the first ever live version](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462521/in/set-72157634123713387) of D3Up.
2. I'll bet you didn't know that [D3Up originally started as an item sharing site](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462375/in/set-72157634123713387)? A place where you could just create items, save them and share links... 
3. [Build's were added in the first few weeks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9034169869/), they didn't do too much in the beginning.
4. With the [first compare tool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462229/), you had to manually create all the items and then use this screen to select them from dropdowns... what a pain.
5. Because it was so difficult and time consuming to compare, I came up with the [simulation tool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9044684270/) that made comparing items a lot easier.
6. The [headers were created](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042461993/) on the top of each build to help identify who you were looking at. 
7. For the first 3-4 months of D3Up... you had to create your builds by hand. The API wasn't released and syncing your build wasn't even an option! The [first sync tool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9034169459/) was released in September of last year and things have only gotten easier since. 
8. In october of last year, the [entire build page got a makeover](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9034168697/) and looks pretty similar to what it is now today!

It's crazy going back and looking through all this stuff, seeing the evolution of the site. Since last November, not much has changed besides bug fixes and feature improvements. This year has been relatively quiet because I've been hard at work on V2 of D3Up. I've been talking up V2 for quiet some time now, and I hope it doesn't disappoint :)

If you're interested in more regular site updates (atleast once every couple weeks), check out /r/d3up. I try to limit my posts on /r/diablo to only really important things and fun things. Also, feel free to reach out to me for whatever reason! My emails on the top of all the pages :)

- Made a video sharing your thoughts on the site... THANK YOU
- Listened to my IRC ramblings... THANK YOU
- Told a friend about D3Up... THANK YOU

It took me 623hrs 58min to hit 100... I NEVER rolled any other toon besides my WD.


I didn't put much emphasis on efficiency, I never used a hellfire ring except on my follower, and I took out the ruby in my helm at lvl 87.  I believe that shows in the retarded amount of time it took me to hit 100.


I REALLY suck at economics, and every attempt to ""flip"" an item has failed miserably.  Hell, just a week ago I lost 25mil trying to flip a 1 handed weapon with 1d 12hrs left on sale, which I bought in a panic thinking it was way underpriced.  I was wrong.  I never used the RMAH.  The only reason I have decent gear is through good-old-fashioned time and luck.

As you can see, I'm about to get my ass reamed by a reflect champion serpent, who will take me off my plvl100 high horse and remind me what a bitch I am.


For every one of you who argues that hitting plvl100 isn't impressive, go ahead and show my account as proof: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/AveryF86-1142/


So what's the plan now?  Seeing as how I've only ever played a WD (who will always be my main squeeze), I want to get all characters to lvl60, and then completely cut the AH out of my life, sharing drops between my characters.  It's not like I have any clue what I'm doing on the AH anyways, and from what I'm hearing from the devs they're headed in a more BOA direction which works great for me.  If I feel like I'm just not progressing I'll allow myself to play my WD to find upgrades for my alts, so I don't know if I'll be allowed to say I'm ""self-found"" considering I've used the AH for my Doc.


Anyways, I would like to say a big THANK YOU to r/diablo, without you guys I would be (even more) clueless.  Also, thanks to patch 1.0.8 for making 90-100 fly by.  You guys are awesome, fuck the haters, send me a friend invite and we can be diabros.

I was on my cell phone and for the life of me can't find it again. Sorry man, whoever you are, but it's a great idea.

Basically, I farm normal for lvl 10 gear, and I don't identify it. I take it into act1 inferno and drop it right as the elite/champ/boss drops his loot. They pick it up, ID it, and are like wtf...sometimes blaming blizzard, and the shitty game they made. 

I try goading them into posting the ""bug"" onto the official forums so I can get a few extra laughs later, but so far no luck.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I really appreciate the amount of time you put into this, but I think you may have made an error in your testing that lead to an incorrect conclusion. In short: I don't think the damage is actually bugged, I think you died after one pulse of DOT damage when naked and were comparing it to multiple pulses of DOT damage when fully geared.
&gt;
&gt;Basically, you can get a really low pulse of DOT damage as you exit the damage field. That's going to be the single-tick of it, and is what you would need to find to get a proper value for Molten, Plague, and Desecrator. As far as I have found, the normal damage display puts three of these together (As long as the target is actually in the DOT long enough to have three happen, otherwise it displays the total value it reached).
&gt;
&gt;So what you have found is the base value, naked, for the three DOT fields, and all three were one-shotting you. I know when I tested to verify this (Against the Hell Warden, since he's guaranteed molten) my health was only around 4k, which is below the lowest damage number you would expect from a DOT for naked at 90% mitigation. Let me do the math for them:
&gt;
&gt;Molten: Naked: 5986 (Expected: 21000) (*3: 17958) Gear: 2100
&gt;
&gt;Plague Naked: 5702 (Expected: 17000) (*3: 17106) Gear: 1700
&gt;
&gt;Desecrator Naked: 12643 (Expected: 42000) (*3: 37929) Gear: 4200
&gt;
&gt;You'll note that it's about 3 times less damage than the expected result for each of them. Since you only survived 1 pulse of each (When the normal result had 3 added together, damping the random), there's likely to be some variance involved accounting for the difference. The expected was calculated at 90% mitigation.
&gt;
&gt;So again, thanks for all the work, but I think this flaw invalidates your results.




Good Evening,

After seeing complaints regarding a ""Stealth Buff"" to damage, I decided to do some testing. 

**Method**
Take 10 hits of damage in full gear and 1 hit of damage naked.  This was repeated for the following effects.  Tested in Breeched Keep level 2.

* Soul Lasher Attack
* Frozen
* Molten
* Plague
* Desecrator
* Arcane Sentry
* Wall of Fire


**Armor and Resistances In Gear**

* Armor: 7105 (69.02% reduction against mLvl63)
* All Resist: 802 (71.85% reduction against mLvl63)
* No reduction against Melee/Ranged Attacks


**Armor and Resistances Naked**

* Armor: 292 (8.48% reduction against mLvl63)
* All Resist: 7 (2.17% reduction against mLvl63)
* No reduction against Melee/Ranged Attacks


**Soul Lasher Attack**

* Naked: 68092
* Gear: 6600
* Reduction: 90%


**Frozen**

* Naked: 62443
* Gear: 6000
* Reduction: 90%


**Molten**

* Naked: 5986
* Gear: 2100
* Reduction: 65%


**Plague**

* Naked: 5702
* Gear: 1700
* Reduction: 70%


**Desecrator**

* Naked: 12643
* Gear: 4200
* Reduction: 67%


**Arcane Sentry**

* Naked: 68035
* Gear: 6600
* Reduction: 90%


**Wall of Fire**

* Naked: 13362
* Gear: 13359
* Reduction: 0%


**Analysis**

* Additional damage reduction from armor alone is 66.4%
* Additional damage reduction from resistances alone is 71.22%
* Additional damage reduction from both armor and resistances is 90.32%

Soul Lasher, Frozen, and Arcane Sentry Damage was in line with expected damage reduction.

Molten, Desecrator, and Plague Damage only appears to be affected by one source of damage reduction.  Experimental values are closer to the expected reduction of only armor, however the expected reduction of only resistances is within the experimental error.

Wall of Fire does not appear to be affected by any sort of damage reduction.

1340748066.0,240,self.Diablo,vnhw3,Clearing up some misconceptions about inflation and deflation on the auction house (a quick economics lesson!),zirconst,349,109,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vnhw3/clearing_up_some_misconceptions_about_inflation/,"Various commenters and streamers have been discussing inflation in the economy of Diablo 3, but I think there's a lot of misinformation being spread that I'd like to try to correct. Keep in mind I'm simplifying some more advanced concepts here for clarity.

**What is inflation?**
Inflation simply means a general rise in the price of goods. When people talk about ""gold inflation"" in Diablo 3, what they mean is that they perceive items in the gold auction house as generally rising in price.

**What is deflation?**
The opposite; a general decrease in the price of goods.

**How are average prices (values) determined?**
While anyone can list any item for any price, the true value of an item is determined by simple supply and demand. But what does that mean exactly?

The **demand** curve refers to the price points buyers are willing to pay for a given item. There are more people lower on the curve, naturally. Virtually everyone would pay 1000 gold for a 1000dps 1h weapon, but almost no one would pay 100m gold. The demand curve itself can be affected by various factors, more on that later.
.
The **supply** curve refers to the price points sellers are willing to sell their goods at. 

The intersection of these two curves is the 'equilibrium price', or the true value of a given item (type). If quantity sold is ""q"" and price is ""p"", the equilibrium price is the point at which q*p is highest. All things being equal, markets such as the auction house gravitate toward the equilibrium price. This is fairly intuitive, but important later.

**What affects supply and demand?**
Demand and supply curves can each be shifted left or right. When demand moves to the left (less aggregate demand), prices decrease. When it moves to the right, prices increase. When supply moves to the left (more aggregate supply), prices fall. When it moves to the price, prices rise. Here are some examples.

Aggregate demand INCREASES (prices rise) in Diablo 3 when...

* The supply of gold among buyers increases (gold is generated 'from thin air' all the time, thus this is constant)
* More people start playing the game
* People get more geared, decreasing the chance of FINDING upgrades and making the AH the superior option for upgrades
* Certain types of items become more desirable via patches (for example, crit)

Aggregate demand DECREASES (prices drop) when...

* People choose to shop at the RMAH
* People stop playing the game
* People become geared to the point where they no longer need upgrades
* The supply of gold among buyers decreases (via transaction costs, repair costs, combining, etc.)
* Certain types of items become less desirable via patches (for example, attack speed)

Aggregate supply INCREASES (prices drop) in Diablo 3 when...

* People farm and craft more items (this is also constant)
* More people start playing the game
* The rate of items being farmed/crafted is increased/made easier via patches and/or new farming routes

Aggregate supply DECREASES (prices rise) when...

* Suppliers choose to sell on the RMAH
* Drop rates are decreased, craft costs are increased, ITEM farming spots are nerfed
* People stop playing the game

**What does this have to do with gold inflation and the value of items?**
Inflation is not as simple as ""there's more gold, therefore prices are rising"". As you can see from the small list above, there are both inflationary and deflationary pressures being applied constantly. Though more gold is constantly being produced (leads to higher prices), there are also more items being farmed (leads to lower prices). 

Also, keep in mind that supply and demand curves exist for specific markets and types of items. Some people point to very high-end weapons rising in price as an example of inflation, but this rise can be attributed to a number of factors:

* Decrease in ilvl63 droprates from Blizzard
* Increase in # of sellers using the RMAH
* Increase in # of people seeking high-end weapons (eg. more people reaching late Inferno)

Meanwhile, in other markets, such as attack speed rings/gloves, you have prices dropping as a result of the attack speed nerf by Blizzard. All attack speed items have decreased in value primarily because their demand curve has shifted left. Additionally, 700-800dps 1handers and 900-1000dps 2handers have had consistent deflationary pressure for reasons such as:

* More people reaching lategame Inferno and seeking more powerful weapons (eg. demand for weaker weapons is lower)
* Continuously greater supply of these weapons, now farmable in all acts, relative to the # of people needing them

**Conclusion**

Though this is a basic overview, there are some points you should take away:

* Just because prices on SOME items are rising, doesn't mean this is a trend that will continue forever, or that all items are experiencing price inflation.

* Investing in items as an alternative to gold is not necessarily logical. Even in the real world, the price of fixed-supply commodities like gold fluctuate in value considerably. Diablo 3 items are NOT fixed supply (more are produced every second) and are definitely not immune to fluctuation in value.

* The constant influx of gold to the economy via farming (vendoring items, dropped gold) is to varying degrees counterbalanced by gold sinks such as repair costs and transaction fees as well as a continuously increasing supply of items.

* The RMAH does not necessarily cause pure increases or decreases in price on the GAH. Though some suppliers left the GAH (decreased supply -&gt; higher prices), so did some buyers (decreased demand -&gt; lower prices). Time will tell how this pans out.

1340171896.0,243,self.Diablo,vbewf,Data from my entire Act 2 Inferno run as well as predictions for the future,Jipptomilly,312,69,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vbewf/data_from_my_entire_act_2_inferno_run_as_well_as/,"So I've been running a ton of Siegebreaker runs on my Monk, but after the new patch put ilvl63 items in A1/2 and since dying is so awful, I figured I could kill champ packs twice as fast in A2 and decided to do a full clear. I switched from my tanking LoH setup with a shield to a 2-hander setup with thunderclap and conviction aura since A2 post damage nerf should be a joke.

* The run took about three hours. I cleared out 35 champ/elite packs and all three bosses.


* I had about 34k damage with the BoH buff and 17% base magic find.

* The first four champ/elite packs dropped zero rares.

* The fifth champ pack dropped three rares.

* The 31 champ packs starting from the fifth dropped a total of 51 rares giving an average of 1.645 rares/pack upon receiving my fifth stack. If you include the first four which gave none, I averaged 1.457 rares/pack over the whole run. It would take just over ten champ packs before I averaged one rare/pack at this rate.

* Out of the 57 rares I received from champ packs and the bosses, **none** of them were ilvl63. I think this was just a fluke though, there is a 9.76% chance of not getting any ilvl63 rares out of 57 given a 4% drop-rate. I did not keep track of rares dropped from regular mobs and treasure goblins, but there were about 20 of these total, and one of these **was** ilvl63.

* I died thirteen times - five times to one champ pack, two times to two other champ packs, once to two other champ pack, once to banelings, and once to regular mobs (those big guys that hide behind their arms + those skeletal axe guys that do too much damage).

* I ended the run up about 60k gold after spending about 100k on repairs. I really wish I kept better track of this information, and I'll be more detailed next time.

* I saw ONE resplendent chest in the cave where you get liquid rainbow (the NPC was actually there).

* I skipped almost every bonus cave I saw. I think next time I'll clear everything.

* I potted every time I needed to to prevent death and ended the run with two more pots than I started with (only mentioning this because it can become a gold sink for people who can't heal themselves).

* I didn't keep a single rare or blue to sell on the GAH - they were all crap. I did make about 100 exquisite essence though which will put me way up on gold. I also got maybe 30 tears which sell for way less and zero brimstone.

**Predictions:**

* Boss runs are crap now. Maximizing the number of champ packs you kill after getting five stacks of valor seems to be the way to go. I think farming five stacks in A1 and then doing ponies with guaranteed rare drops and a good chance of at least one ilvl63 rare might be a good idea.

* Considering that I made 160k gold in the entire run and then spent 100k of it on repairs, I think gold find might be a more valuable stat on gear than magic find now. I spent most of the run with 75% gold find from valor, but you can pretty easily get another 100% on gear. Since most of the ways of making gold have been nerfed, I don't think it's a stretch to think that gold may rise in value. Sqeezing out an extra 20% gold find on a few of my pieces would have resulted in tripling my net gain of gold over the course of the run. It's definitely something to think about.

* If the 1.1 patch introduces a single great craftable legendary then Fiery Brimstone will probably skyrocket in value.

-If you want to combine chipped or flawed gems to a normal one it will cost you about 500 gold. Since the auction house offers you normal and flawless for about 400 gold there is literally no point to using this recipy. You're better of selling them to vendor or putting them on ah (where no one will buy them)

-There is no point to disenchanting items 99%. For example, if you disenchant an item on normal you get a piece of dust that sells for 14 or 15 gold on the AH. Since the blues themselves would sell themselves for 100-200 to a vendor you would waste money disenchanting items yourself.

-Crafting is useless (at least so far for me). I've spend about 35.000 gold in upgrading and crafting items themselves, but they mostly end up terrible. Again, you're better off buying something nice from the AH at half the cost with twice the stats. I realize that this might change when you get a higher level (I'm not maxed yet) but that shouldn't change the fact that it is relatively useless in lower levels.

-As is obvious by now, legendaries are relatively weak in comparison with blues and rares most of the time. It makes no sense that a legendary I would find has less benefit that the rares and blues that pop up all the time.

Basically, most of this has to do with the AH, but it still makes for an odd playing experience. Everything else about the game I like but the above points just render half of the crafting/gem/item system void.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,barb-europe,True,t3_tvy3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tvy3s/the_economics_in_this_game_are_weird/,

1339554588.0,238,self.Diablo,uz3qc,Demon hunter here: I'm surprised nobody's talking about the resource of space with respect to difficulty for different classes. So here's my take.,cvet,385,147,376,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uz3qc/demon_hunter_here_im_surprised_nobodys_talking/,"As a DH, my main resource is space. I almost never run out of hatred; I can usually pop Prep if I don't have any discipline. Even if I'm out of both of those resources, If I've got space, I've got all I need to get by.

As many others have mentioned, there's basically no other way to play the class on inferno other than aiming to avoid just about every hit. I have read testimony of many people on r/Diablo stacking resist+vit gear only to find they still die incredibly fast. If this is correct, there's no real reason to do anything but try to avoid hits and do as much damage as you can. And if this is the main inferno playstyle, the DH needs to be able to create space to be an effective class.

I'm currently in A2 inferno and having massive amounts of trouble staying alive (big surprise!), despite a good mixture of DPS and damage mitigation. I should clarify: I have little trouble with large groups of mobs and most blues/yellows. I have an enormous amount of trouble with those mobs who take away my ability to create space without leaving me any recourse. Vortex, Jailer, Fast, and the seeming non-impact of Caltrops/Flying Strike/Cold damage against the hardest mobs. (note I haven't included Waller or Arcane, as I find these interesting/challenging because one can react to the situation).

Let me be clear: I'm not asking for a buff, and I do think that mobs should have wide abilities to limit space creation (this makes it challenging, i.e. fun). But I don't quite understand the logic of creating at least one class (DH-- perhaps Wizard and WD too?) entirely around avoiding hits through creating space and then having mobs that make it *impossible* to create that space reliably, even at max hatred/disc. 

**Example**: I ran into a blue pack of those snakelike things that can turn invisible: Vortex, Jailer, Plagued, Arcane. This kind of combination leaves my class with very few options. If I get too close, I'm vortexed in. I'm stopped from keeping sufficient distance by the jailer. When I am vortexed, it's right into arcane/plagued. Even when I wasn't being pulled into a deathtrap, SS didn't always go off in time to stop me from getting one shotted (my ping is &lt; 100).

Simply: I don't call this challenging, because there isn't much that I, the player, can do to avoid it. It's not a matter of skill, just whether the mobs will ""decide"" to vortex me three times in a row. When mobs with only 1 movement-impairment affix roll, I generally have no problem. But when they stack, the *fundamental* way that my class is designed to survive is completely obviated (yes, obviated).

**Potential fixes**: 

* **Jailer**: I love the idea of truly random affixes (i.e. I don't want to see them say ""no jailer + vortex""), so perhaps more skills could remove jailer-- how about vault? Or the length could be shortened.

* **Vortex**: I'm not really sure what to do about vortex: perhaps cap the range at a fairly small level and put a more noticeable animation in with a small ""wind up"" to allow players to avoid it. I don't mind dying if I miss my chance to avoid, but it seems like there's very little (if any) warning at the moment

* **Fast**: Fast is really a death sentence because it never turns off. I suppose this is the idea, but I think fast mobs should be somewhat more susceptible to CC than normal blues/yellows (less length reduction, etc). This would create a really tense battle where missing a CC would lead to instant death, and the goal would be to keep the whole pack CC'd while retreating enough to both do damage and regen discipline.

If you've gotten this far without downvoting me into oblivion, I'd love to hear how the class you play uses space as a resource. I don't have much experience with the other four classes, so I'm really interested to hear if other players (including other DH's) find similar problems with space-management and mob ""difficulty.""


**tl;dr** Space is a resource, and I think part of the reason the game feels unfair at times is because it unfairly restricts your ability to create space.",Demon Hunter,False,self,t5_2qore,1339556333.0,dh,demonhunt-americas,True,t3_uz3qc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uz3qc/demon_hunter_here_im_surprised_nobodys_talking/,

Well, I decided to change that. I didn't want to give up video games, but I wanted to exercise more often. So! I combined them into [this!](http://i.imgur.com/cR36s.jpg)

I do not think I have ever made a better decision in my life, ever! Now I walk 2mph while I play my games. I am clocking in at over 21 miles a week and every day I feel better about myself. I am losing weight slowly and at a safe pace. This is something all gamers should play on, all the time.

The primary components clock in at under $350 ([desk](http://www.ikeafans.com/home/modular-desks-ikeas-jerker-is-undisputed-king/) and [treadmill](http://www.ebay.com/itm/CONFIDENCE-FITNESS-NEW-ELECTRIC-FOLDING-TREADMILL-W-PRO-TRACK-MOTORIZED-BELT-/330723563855?pt=US_Cardio_Treadmills&amp;hash=item4d00a9194f)) and it is very easy to do. It does not effect your ability to play games or use a PC if you walk the proper speed. I have found that somewhere between 1 and 2.5 MPH is perfect, depending on the task.

[Also. This.](http://shechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/kitten-goodness-12.jpg?w=500&amp;h=333)

Edit: I have stared a new diet also. I am not neglecting that part of weight loss. This is also not my only form of exercise. I run a few (3+) time a week and am doing other things like using the dumbbells you see. Push ups, sit ups, and and using a total gym. This is just a way to turn the gaming part of my life into part of a total fitness and weight loss program instead of it being counter to my over all goals.

1342654409.0,233,self.Diablo,wsdig,Your precision guide to gearing a fresh Inferno Barbarian,accaris,319,86,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsdig/your_precision_guide_to_gearing_a_fresh_inferno/,"A lot of people liked my post [in this topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wr5lf/wizards_in_inferno_get_in_here_and_share_your/) on what exactly to search for when you're building a fresh level 60 Wizard to take on Inferno (beyond Act 1.) So I decided to make a similar guide, this time for a tanky Barbarian. Unlike other shopping guides, this isn't a ""how cheap can I possibly beat Inferno"" guide, but more like a guide for what exact stat thresholds give you the best bang for the buck. My imaginary budget for this one was 2M, just like with the Wizard guide (which wasn't even as optimized.)

The obvious goal of a starter Barbarian is to stack a lot of defense, get a decent 1-hander, and run up to things and smack them in the face. If you want a shopping guide for the more popular Whirlwind spec, sorry, but that's not my territory (and it's much more expensive.)

**What to search for:**

* Helm: Helm of Command - 80 Vit - Socket (250k or less.) The 8% Block chance is a huge boost in survivability. A similar rare helm with 40 All Resists is approximately the same price.
* Chest: 75 Str - 100 Vit - 50 All Res (150k or less.) Look for sockets to extend the life of this chest.
* Legs: 75 Str - 125 Vit - 45 All Res (150k or less.) Same rule about the sockets. Although you could lower the Vit here to get 60+ res for the same price, the vast amount of extra life is better.
* Shoulders: 100 Str - 80 Vit - 60 All Res (150k or less)
* Boots: 80 Str - 70 Vit - 60 All Res (150k or less.) There's a 100k line between 70 and 80 Vit in boots.
* Belt: 100 Str - 75 Vit - 60 All Res (120k or less.) Bump up the Str much past 100 and you're looking at a 50K price difference.
* Gloves: 70 Str - 70 Vit - 60 All Res (75k or less.) Here, you sacrifice a little bit of DPS and life to get more res, for an insanely cheap price.
* Bracers: 75 Str - 75 Vit - 60 All Res (120k or less.) Again, those odd numbers in Str and Vit save us a little cash.
* Amulet: 90 Str - 90 Vit - 200 Life on Hit (200k or less.) We're sacrificing All Res here to boost Life on Hit, which is essential, as Amulet is one of the only slots you can get it on.
* Rings: 60 Str - 50 Vit - 30 All Res (200k or less each.) If you want to switch it up, substitute All Res for 120 Life on Hit.
* Weapon: Anything with 800+ DPS with a socket. (200k or less.) Choose Rare only, so that you can filter out secondary properties and get something with a primary stat. Prioritize Daggers, followed by Swords, then Mighty Weapons and Axes. We're going to buy a Radiant Square Amethyst to put in the socket, which is another 170k. 
* Shield: 70 All Res - X Block % (100k or less.) You can find Sacred Shields--the highest block shields in the game--with over 20% block for chump change, and these are fantastic for any barb.

Some thoughts:

This stuff is NOT underpriced. I didn't buy only the cheapest stuff, nor did I buy the best stuff for my price range. I stuck to middle of the road only. You can come out even better than I did if you're diligent. Prioritize items with not only Str, Vit, and All Res, but also stuff that has Dex (which gives Dodge), Int (which gives All Res,) Armor, and Life Regen. 

Just remember that you're not the Hulk in this gear. You can tank damn near anything, but some stuff might still give you trouble, like Plague/Molten/Desecrator or guys that run away constantly. I would use Berserker Rage as well, just to get a DPS boost, or, drop a little Vit for Str if you think you can afford it.

5. Find an actual useful rare, drink a glass of water.
6. If your merc dies, 10 burpees (thanks for the tip yashi, will add that to my workouts)

I think a lot of the suggestions are fun and would make the game better, but they won't fix the economy. 

The reality is this: In softcore, NO VOLUNTARY ITEM SINK CAN FIX THE ECONOMY. 

People compare the hardcore economy to the softcore economy and talk about how much healthier it is. There isn't nearly as much item inflation there and you can easily sell your drops on the AH. They therefore conclude that because Hardcore has an item sink (hardcore permadeath), if softcore had an item sink, the economy there would be healthy too, right? Wrong. The key fact of the hard core item sink is that it is  1) Completely Involuntary and 2) TAKES THE VERY BEST ITEMS out of the economy. Nobody ever chooses to permadie in hardcore, and when they do, their very best gear, the stuff they are wearing, is destroyed forever.

Now compare that with softcore item sinks. Basically, every proposal I've seen makes the problem WORSE, not BETTER. That's because they all take the WORST items, stuff that won't sell on the AH and would be vendored anyway, then turns them into a shot at the BEST items. So you would get a huge influx of even more high end loot, which enters the economy and is never destroyed, devaluing the average drop even more.

One key thing about softcore is that EVERY CHARACTER'S POWER STRICTLY INCREASES FOREVER. Every gear slot, in every single character, only gets better over time. Nobody ever trades an item in a slot for a worse item voluntarily. That means that if there's an item sink, nobody is going to willingly destroy their best gear. They'll only destroy the worst gear, or the second worst gear, and they'll only do it if there's a shot at upgrading the gear they already have - again, meaning more item
inflation.

Think about it. If there was a gear sink that required you to permanently destroy your best item (or even have a 10% chance of destroying it) for only a shot at a better item, would you take that risk? Would anyone? On the other hand, of course people would sink items that can't sell on the AH or are vendor anyway - but sinking those items doesn't improve the economy. 

TL,DR: Voluntary item sinks can only make the economy worse. Only forced, involuntary sinks (ie, Hardcore permadeath) can have any permanent effect on improving the economy.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_14khcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/14khcw/item_sinks_cant_ever_help_the_softcore_economy/,

1338788508.0,229,self.Diablo,ujshh,[s][Guide][Barbarian]Just beat Diablo Inferno. Sharing Gear and Build + tips on getting there.,mvtsc2,332,103,198,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ujshh/sguidebarbarianjust_beat_diablo_inferno_sharing/,"Hello all,

I realise similar content has been posted here before but if anyone finds it useful then I feel I've helped.

First I guess some people want proof and what not....

http://i.imgur.com/kEcq1.jpg AND 
http://i.imgur.com/3FbaY.jpg

Build: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/barbarian#WVPkgS!beV!acZcYc

Stats - War Cry not active:
http://i.imgur.com/JVabb.jpg

(Can't see move speed in Adventure stats - 12%)

First up, a few things. I could (and should) have beaten Diablo with stacks. As you may be able to tell from the ""your items are getting beaten up"" graphic on the proof photos I did have a few failures... twice with Diablo on sub 25% HP on third form.

Secondly, there is almost 100% a better rune than Demoralize on Threatening Shout to be using if you solely want to be beating Diablo, such as Falter for the shadow clone. May even be a better skill.


**Build**

So, to go through the skills.

**Frenzy w/ Sidearm** - great damage output and ratio for Life on Hit. Smite and Maniac aren't bad rune choices.

**Revenge w/ Provocation** - Just... standard, nothing much to say other than good luck healing without this.

**Wrath of the Berserker w/ Insanity** - Increases damage output, incoming damage avoidance with dodge bonus and increased healing through Life on Hit with the attack speed increase. Also immune to Diablo ""cage"" attack with it up, is a long cooldown but you can get through the in between parts with some care, kiting, potions and health globes / wells.

**War Cry w/ Impunity** - Again pretty standard, tons of damage reduction.

**Threatening Shout w/ Demoralize** - Even more massive damage reduction. I was taking Demorlize as stopping the ranged mobs from running all the time is pretty damn useful.

**Furious Charge w/ Dreadnought** - Pretty great utility. Kiting, dodging key attacks, closing down ranged enemies and healing with damage when Revenge just isn't coming up. The chance of Revenge not being available after being hit ten times is less than 3%, but at times it feels like it's nearly 100%, and at those times this is a godsend.



**Items**


I'm 99% sure I picked up everything I listed here on the AH rather than finding myself, possibly a sad statement on the game but making money is the best way possible however you can do it, pretty comprehensive list of farming methods: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ufn8u/inferno_farming_spots_discussion_butcherwarden/. 

One key point missed off is buying and selling items on AH or other places, can be a goldmine.

Every item here could be improved upon or bettered in some way, some drastically so. If you just want the quick guide to items: Res &gt; Vit &gt; Str. Some mixture of bonus Armor, Life on Hit, Block, Attack Speed, Physical Resistance and Damage reduction from Melee/Elites between all your items is key.

**Helm (of Command)** - I'd call this a pretty key item due to the massive damage reduction you gain from a block, however any other socketable helm with good All Resist and Vit/Str would do. A ""perfect"" barb helm would most likely be a socketable Helm of Command with great Resist All, Str, Vit and bonus +% life.

**Shoulders** - I'd say they're fairly crap, I don't like them, one of my weakest gear pieces. Fantastic Str but I'd prefer it if the Vit and Str were swapped, the Res All were higher, the Dexterity was Intelligence and there was some bonus Armor or Phys Res or Life %.

**Gloves** - I do and don't like these, brilliant defensive stats, but as Gloves are the only non Jewelry item armour piece that can hold a +Attack Speed stat without being a legendary it's a shame this hasn't got any. If I could get my hands on a brilliant pair of Sage's Grasps with the three random stats being Str, Res All and Atk Spd I'd be delighted but in my opinion this isn't an item slot that HAS to be legendary, the best gloves in the game could very well just be a rare.

**Ring 1 - Justice Lantern** - I don't want to keep chucking around the word ""required"" (especially when I'm still looking for better versions of these items myself) but this item is unfortunately one of those. Although according to battle.net a Justice Lantern can only be rolled with two additional stats this one has three, and they're all fairly crap. Give me all resist and a socket any day.

**Weapon** - I sold a 1050k DPS blue for this and I'm a bit unsure (I also made 1mil in the process though...). Unless you have mad Life on Hit jewelry you need a good Life on Hit weapon. This isn't really it. DPS could be higher, life on hit could be higher, could have strength, could have attack speed bonus for even more DPS, could have a socket...

**Boots** - I fucking LOVE this item. LOVE IT. Got it dirty cheap on AH, could still be better, +Armor stat is on the lowest end of the scale for these and the randomly rolled Vit stat isn't anything to write home about. The +Arcane could have also been better, I believe I heard the random stats on legendaries can supplement the innate stats so even more bonus Res or Armor would be awesome. Also, if you've not been playing for a while with +Move Speed boots you HAVE to get some in my opinion. It may not be a measurable stat for damage reduction and what have you but it makes kiting and dodging far easier along with the nice quality of life bonus of just getting anywhere quicker, doesn't hurt when you're chasing down treasure goblins either.

**Legs** - Just some really good legs, yet again the could be better spiel can be applied here. Did the job for me though.

**Belt** - Item you must simply own #3 - String of Ears. Okay rolls on random stats but you are really only buying this item for one of it's utterly broken stats.

**Chest** - Loads of lovely resistance and a tiny bit of Strength. Could be better and oh christ I'm bored of saying it now...

**Amulet** - I paid 2.3mil for this and would happily pay it again. Mad life on hit stat and one short of a perfect res all stat. Great bonus defence stuff and a socket. The reason for the ruby gem is I was replacing an amulet with over 100 Str with this one. Jewelry is, in my opinion, the HARDEST armour pieces to get perfect rolls on due to the wild range of bonuses you can get on it. A better amulet than this could have bonus damage, bonus attack speed, bonus armor, bonus % Life, bonus strength... Just try to (between your three jewelry items) get a good mix of all those lovely things as getting them all on one item seems pretty much impossible.

**Bracers** - Bought these a while back also for their brilliant defensive stats. Could be bette - *boom*

**Ring 2** - This bad boy I picked up a while back off the AH for not that much, great bonuses to key stats AND THAT ATTACK SPEED! If I were to remove one item of armor then removing this ring results in the biggest decrease to my damage output, more so than the 200+ Str shoulders.

**Shield** - THE STORMSHIELD - The final ""must have"" item. I picked this up off the AH and could probably sell it for 5x what I paid. Yes you can get stormshields with over 30% block chance and yes you can get ones that don't have Dexterity and have something more useful instead but this really is such a good item and I can't see myself replacing it for a long, long time.

I'll talk about Diablo, farming and general stuff as a comment but as one final point to make here...

To the people who upvoted the ""I'd rather Kripparian's videos were text"" posts, fuck you. This took too long to type.

**PS: This is ONE (albeit it fairly popular) way of managing to be a barb in the very end game sections, however it is not the only way, nor is it the ""right"" way, I'm sure many many others builds work with different items that work better with that build, as I said here, not one item I own is perfect and I managed to down Diablo so if you don't want to follow the cookie cutter approach then by all means keep going with your build**",SPOILER,False,self,t5_2qore,1338791443.0,spoiler,barb-europe,True,t3_ujshh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ujshh/sguidebarbarianjust_beat_diablo_inferno_sharing/,

After nearly a month of constant testing and statistical analysis (I logged all my runs in each specific area in act 3 - exp, time, and elites). I used these stats to build the most effecient run possible. After testing and tweaking the run, I compared it to the all famous Alkaizer run. The outcome was the same every run: Around 20% on average more exp per hour then doing the classic Alkaizer run (Which I also ran through quite thoroughly and in the same fashion). Check out my short video, which I explain the run and share some of my findings. Feedback would be awesome!! Cheers guys!

HAD TO BREAK THE POST IN HALF, LOOK [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u9hcd/lets_share_some_information_about_skills_that/c4toxfw) FOR MORE!

Barbarians : 

1. Wrath of the Berserker breaks most CC that are on you and make you immune to them for the skill's duration.
2. The relentless passive allows you to use revenge without proc. beforehand. (this one allowed me to survive for very long periods with less than 10% health)
3. Furious charge breaks jailer. Leap attack does not. (update: doesn't break it, you move to where the charge ends but you are still jailed.)
4. overpower can be activated during whirlwind without breaking the whirlwind
5. Using revenge will interrupt some long attack animations. It works extremely well on the minions at the end of act 1 that wind up the big red hammer that hits for a ton.
6. Using furious charge while ice balls explode prevents freezing.
7. The barbarian passive superstition says you will take 20% less non-physical damage (This includes arrows and other similar ranged attacks). The way it works is you will take regular damage from non-physical attacks yet you have a 20% chance to absorb the attack taking no damage from it. It will average out to 20% less damage but it is not as consistent as the tooltip states.
8. While leaping in the air you can dodge frozen orbs. It is a good way to avoid them but it is hard to time correctly. 
9. Lightning monsters can proc revange
10. Revenge can also be procced by environmental damage, like the flame jet things in A3 that don't hit too hard but tick very fast.
11. The ancient spear(?) attack when used on a treasure goblin trying to open a portal will yank him away and close the portal.
12.  You can recharge frenzy when you hit destructable items (doors, vases etc)
13. If both Ignore Pain and Relentless are active then you're invulnerable (50% + 65% = 115% damage reduction for up to 7 seconds with rune.)
14. Destructible objects count as targets for Revenge healing and Furious Charge healing and cooldown reduction runes.
15. Both ground stomp and leap with stun rune will stun bosses in Inferno.
16. Ignore Pain can also be activated while stunned, frozen, etc.

Demon Hunter : 

1. Companion uses the DH's crit chance, meaning it benefits from Sharpshooter, but doesn't remove the buff. If you don't do anything, your pet will crit 100% of the time. Not useful, but funny to watch.
2. Smoke Screen breaks CC
3. The thunder bola rune allows to stun bosses under hell difficulty. 2 demon hunters can easily stun-lock a boss this way
4. The bonus damage on the Demon Hunter's Entangling Shot rune: Shock Collar scales with attack speed.
5. each projectile shot has its own crit chance. Meaning that if you have sharpshooter and has 100% crit chance and you fire elemental arrow (with nether tentacle rune). Each shot fired before the first shot hits the enemy (+1 second) will hit with 100% crit chance even if the first shot already crit'd.
6. The elemental arrow's lightning and tentacle rune is very effective against an immobile missile dampening rare, because they will hit him more times. 
7. Demon Hunter's can vault through a lot of spell abilities such as succubus flame orbs.
8. Demon hunters smoke screen gives +15% movement speed
9. Caltrops with Jagged spikes: When an enemy steps on more than one spike, the damage stacks on too of each other. Thus it is possible to be dealing +100% weapon damage while additionally still attacking for your own weapon damage.

Monks :

1. Activating the Monk's Sweeping wind refreshes the ability's timer and maintains its current stacks. Useful to retain max charges while moving to the next pack of mobs.
2. thunderclap breaks jail
3. dashing strike also breaks jailer
4. Seven Sided Strike allows you to go invul for ~1 sec, allowing you to dodge the freeze explosion and other stuff.
5. Blind resets the monsters animation, making it very useful against mobs with a slow attack animation (big friggin' dudes in act IV for example). Also works against bosses
6. Fear (last rune on BoH) also does so, but does not work against bosses. 
7. Mystic ally inherits the monk's defensive stats
8. When activating inner Sanctuary Mobs near you (basically on the Area of pretection you summon) will get feared for about 1 second.
9. Serenity does not only makes you immune to CC-effects, as stated in the tooltip, but also breaks ANY CC-effekt such as frost and fear. Also, it can be activated where other skills are unavailable (such a certain bosses' grip)
10.  You can recharge sweeping strike when you hit destructable items (doors, vases etc)
11. Monk: using Dashing Strike on a mob you're in melee with makes you jump behind the mob. As during the flight you're immune and afterwards behind the mob this means you manually dodge an attack. With slower hitting mobs like Mallet Lords you can manually dodge every single attack while having barely any dps downtime. (on certain mobs, this might not work, such as Act 1 boss, or dark berseker)
12. Serenity can be activated even while frozen. Helpful if you're looking at imminent death because of it.
13. Combination Strike applies an invisible buff that stacks. Using any spirit generator will reset the stacks, so you can use spirit generator 1 at the start of a fight to get a stack up, then proceed to use only spirit generator 2 for the remainder of the fight. As long as you don't go more than 3 seconds without attacking (so the stacks drop off), you will continue to do 16% extra damage.
14. Way of the Hundred Fists' second hit counts as a single hit for the purpose of life on hit and (probably) procs like chance to fear/stun/etc. The hits can crit independently, but these crits do not seem to trigger Sweeping Wind.
15. Dashing Strike doesn't automatically apply the damage/root. It does a fairly slow weapon attack targeting the position where the enemy was when you dashed. If they've moved out of the way they will take no damage and not get rooted.
16. Exploding Palm's damage does not scale with monster HP as more players join the game (need to retest this to make sure the latest round of hotfixes haven't corrected it).
17. Mantra of Conviction's Submission rune can't crit, but the % weapon damage scales up from the base 12% with things like crit chance and crit damage.

1315861662.0,226,self.Diablo,kdh50,Some Feedback on the Beta after having played the 5 classes.,BobDoom,255,29,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/kdh50/some_feedback_on_the_beta_after_having_played_the/,"
I am writing this up to provide some reading material for the people who didn't have the chance yet to try it out themselves. Hopefully it will keep you busy, and bring you 5 minutes closer to the release, or your beta key!

Before going into my impressions of the 5 character classes, I'd like to give a little disclaimer about all the video content going around. I think some people are under the impression that the game is ridiculously easy, with monsters not even touching Health pools, and everything dying in 1 hit. Most of the vids of people kicking ass are lvl 10+, who are most definitely wearing gear crafted by the blacksmith (The blacksmith is the source of the best gear in the beta). This is the same for example as dropping a difficulty in D2. Let's say you can clear nightmare, but for fun, you decide to play normal... suddenly everything dies without ever touching you.

The game is not that easy the first time you go through. Monsters do hit you, and if you are not careful, they will kill you in a few hits. For the beta, that is lvl 8 or less. (Normally you kill Leoric around lvl 8-9). My opinion was that it was not very hard , but that it was right for the beginning of the game, and I died once or twice. (to an Arcane enchanted monster, and a bunch of harvesters exploding all at once). We're in act 1 on normal, I didn't expect it to be hard. And even though it's not hard, it's still incredibly fun.

Also, a few features I was not too aware of even though I followed every source of information on D3 for like a year, are those Massacres and other ""special rewards"" (I don't have a name for them). I was aware that killing a lot of monsters in a row would provide a reward, the bigger for longer kill chains. Now, these things rock! You want to perform them! 
Massacre : 10 kills minimum, 40 xp at 10 kills... 100 kills is around 1k exp.
Mighty Blow : 4+ monsters kill in a single attack, exp starts at around 5-10, It's not as rewarding but still nice. It's a nice feeling to know you crushed many mobs at once, and get exp for it.
There are a few others, for example when you use the environment to kill monsters, like crushing them under the wall, or destroying a lot of objects at once. (The wizard is particularly good at that)


Barbarian :
The barbarian was my first character in the beta, as I am a long time fan of the D2 barbarian. The barbarian was fun from the very beginning, lvl 1. You start out with Bash, and the sound effect of the attack, and dead bodies of monsters flying off from the impact is very satisfying. You feel the strength of the barbarian, and you can see how much weight he puts in his blows. The only problem with that is that it only strikes 1 target, so you have to wait for lvl 4 to get cleave, which is equally satisfying, but kills multiples ennemis at once. For the duration of the beta, cleave is probably the move with which to replace your normal attack with. I used Leap attack to initiate combat, or to jump to the next pack. The ability I used to spend fury on was either Hammer of the ancients, or throw weapon. HotA is , imho, awesome. It's got a nice little AoE in front of you, it's quick and hurts a lot. Plus, the monsters fly way off.
Beta cons : The problem when your barbarian gets too strong is that leap attack doesn't recharge (10 seconds) before you clean everything close to you, which means you can't keep your kill combo going since you can't reach the next pack of mobs. You can stutter step-micro with Throw Weapon, but that doesn't always work. I am expecting this problem will disappear with stronger opponents and/or furious charge and/or sprint.

Monk :
People have been saying that the monk starts boring, and it kinda is, until lvl 6. (So basically, a big 20-30 minutes). It becomes incredibly awesome when you get Dashing Strike, which is your first skill that allows you to zip around. For a mere 10 spirit (out of 200), you can dash and strike to another monsters. If you use dashing strike on empty air, it actually only moves you a little, but if you actually target a monster , you can cross a whole screen. This allows you to chain combos for as long as you managed to have 1 monster in the screen. This is just mad fun. Combined with my beta-favorite spirit generator, Deadly Reach, The monk became a great character. I felt a bit bad, because I had more fun than with my barbarian...
On the other hand, until you outgear ennemies, the monk did feel more frail than the barbarian, but that was probably only a result of my gear. I feel that Dashing Strike is a core skill  of the monk, granting him the speed he needs to take advantage of the battlefield and enemy positions.

Wizard :
The wizard is also fun right from that start. From the beginning, you can spam Magic missiles, and this only gets easier when you level up. His arcane power recharges really fast, and it's not until you get spells like Electrocute or Arcane Orb that you have the ability to run out of arcane power. His pool is quite shallow, though, you only have 100 AP (while arcane orb costs 35, for example). Being in the middle of a pack without AP is definitely bad, and you get mauled while all you can do is shoot your tiny wand. Thankfully , it recharges fast and you can then use a spell like Wave of Force, that got me my record Mighty Blow with about 40 skeletons being destroyed and flown across the room at once. Electrocute is also incredibly fun. You can hold it and watch lightning fork away and destroy monsters. My personal favorite for now, but I didn't try Disintegrate. Arcane Orb packs a huge punch, but with my current gear I can't cast more than 3 before being out of power. Shock Pulse is definitely boring it its vanilla version, it's simply not satisfying. It's going to need a rune or something. I would discuss about the wizard's frailty, but with the Templar taunting if I ever reached 75% and the fact I had enough destructive power to kill most creatures before they got close, it'll have to wait for the real game. I feel like the Wizard is the *easiest* character in these low levels, because you have the safety of range, and a great array of AoE spells that are all satisfying. Overall, tons of fun.

Demon Hunter :
The demon hunter is also fun, but it's a bit more difficult to play. You have to play more strategically, or outgear your opponents. I think the cause of this is that the demon hunter has to wait a little bit for a skill that has a decent AoE. The vanilla grenades don't seem to pack enough punch for their AoE and difficulty in aiming them. The bola shot is really fun, though, once you get it. And this is where I had a dilemna. When I was dual-wielding crossbows, I had tons of fun shooting lots of arrows, but I was firing too fast for my Hatred regeneration, eventually running out. Also, Stuff like bola shot, which are semi-costly, didn't do a lot of dmg, since they were fired from some pretty weak 1 handed crossbows (weak because the blacksmith recipe doesn't give really strong 1 handed crossbows). So , a solution was to use a big 2-handed Crossbow/Bow, which dealt a lot of dmg, but fired quite slowly. I had to switch my other skills to compensate for this. With a slow weapon, Evasive Fire, which doesn't cost much and makes you do a backflip that costs 4 discipline (out of a pool of 30) when enemies are too close were awesome. I didn't feel like I had to use that skill with dual crossbows, because I could more easily spare shots for straggler and monsters who got close. I didn't play enough with the demon hunter to go into more details, but right from the start I can see very different skill choices simply based on weapon speed, and I personally find these kinds of decision very interesting.

Witch Doctor :
The Witch Doctor is also a character that benefits from gaining a few skills to be more fun. The zombie dogs are nice tanks, but they deal 1 dmg per hit with no gear. Needless to see, you don't kill anything with that. The other first skill is poison dart, and that's single target. It does good damage, but it's not visually satisfying. There's no knockback, no explosion, just a mob dying in a green mist. (This is my personal opinion, remember!) The Witch doctor started getting much much more fun when I got Zombie Charger. I started being able to score some nice 10-15 kills mighty blows, with the green zombie running forward and decomposing, killing multiple enemies at once. It's visually entertaining too, and the sound is nice. I also have less play time on the Witch Doctor, so I don't want to talk too much about him yet. The Spirit spells looking interesting, but since the spell selection is limited and the zombie charger packed more punch, even though the range is quite short, I found it more fun to move forward close to the melee, and summon chargers, than to hang way back and haunt enemies. Haunting worked too, but it was a bit more management and less destruction.

Finally, at lvl 10, you unlock your first passive skill, which allows you to check the fabled passive skill menu, and you get to read them all. I saw a leak of those, but they are nothing like the real thing (or current beta thing, I guess). They are very flavory, unless the generic stats booster that I had seen before. Most of them are unique to the class you are playing, and so many of them are good that I don't really know how 3 will be enough.

She was so f**king excited. She played slow, in wonderment of the scenery and monsters. Never rushed through anything. Didn't even realize the Auction House existed. Crafted all her own gems, armor and weapons.

And I felt jealous. Because being here and reading the general discussion on the Blizz forums can sometimes paint a nasty picture. And you forget how much fun it actually is to roam a dungeon, and cover the walls with exploded hell-beasts.

This is a personal rant, I know. But playing with my sister tonight reminded me of how much fun this game really is. Even with all it's problems.

Congrats Blizzard, on a job well done.

The biggest complaint I've gotten about [D3Up](http://d3up.com) is that it's to tedious/boring to manually enter your character into the build calculator. Well, with the release of Character Profiles on the D3 Armory, it just got a whole lot easier! Scanning your armory profile can now automatically fill out your character's items. I've also rebuilt the ""Item Builder"" and changed how choosing skills on your builds works, all of which you will find below!

Character Imports from Battle.net
---

***[GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/110/9/8/Good_News_Everyone_by_martynasx.jpg)***

I've created a script that scans your character on the armory, converts it into my data format, and automatically generates all of your gear for you. 

How do you use it? Simple.

- A) **New Builds** - Create a new Build, and enter the URL of your Character Profile in the ""Profile URL"" field. After you hit save, you'll notice a button in the upper right of the build page that says ""Copy from Battle.net"". Click it!
- B) **Existing Builds** - Login and head on over to your build page, then click ""Edit"" in the upper right of your build. Enter the URL of your Character Profile in the ""Profile URL"" field and save. Head on back to your build and next to the edit button you'll now see a ""Copy from Battle.net"" button. Click it!

Now, make sure you are using the right URL from the d3 armory, this is what mine looks like:

- http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Jesta-1121/hero/1963090

Notice it's the FULL path that shows in your browser, including your profile name and your hero # on the end. If you're looking at one of your specific characters, it should be the URL you're viewing.

It will automatically create items and equip them, or simply equip them if you've already created them previously in the system. It does a full compare against the stats you entered on each item vs what your profile says, so don't be alarmed if it recreates some items for you (if they were slightly off).

I believe there are still some bugs with character imports, but I need more data to help find them. So go ahead and import your build, and feel free to use the Feedback tab on the side of [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) to let me know how it works! My email address is also on the top of the site, so feel free to reach out with an email if you prefer.

Skills on Builds
---

I finally got around to redoing the ""Skill Chooser"" for your builds. Instead of just displaying them on the page, there's now a button at the top of your skills tab that says ""Change my Skills"". You have to click on this to get the skill change menu to open up now.

Once you click it, you'll notice now that instead of 2 different boxes (one passives, one skills), you now have 3 boxes for your passive and 6 boxes for your actives.

The reasoning I broke this appart is I wanted you to be able to control the order your skills appear in. In the previous version, it would arrange them in the order they were in the drop down list, and that just didn't make as much sense. Sometimes your most used skill would be on the bottom, and a buff would be on the top? Didn't make much sense, so now YOU get to choose the order!

Another thing you're going to notice is the ""Save"" button at the bottom of the list. Skill's don't save automatically anymore, you have to choose to save them. The reason behind this is two fold:

- 1) The old method was super unreliable.
- 2) I found myself changing my skills to see what would happen to my build, and it would automatically save... so then I had to change it back. I wanted to just SEE what would happen when I changed skills. So now, you can turn skills on and off without it automatically saving them to your build to see what happens.

The save button also publishes your current DPS/EHP stats to the database. So if you need to update them on the list pages, just hit save on the skills and it will do it for you!

Item Builder

I rewrote the Item Builder from the ground up, and you'll notice a few improvements and a few new features.

The first thing I want to point out, if you choose ""Set"" as the quality of the item, another drop down menu will appear that asks you which set this item belongs to. By specifying a set, it will gain the set bonuses from that set, and be factored into your build. Yay, no more plugging those stats in where they shouldn't be!

The second thing is, I've moved as much data into the preview tooltip (on the right) as humanly possible. Armor on armor pieces, DPS/Damage/Speed on weapons, and Armor/Block Chance/Block Value on shields. Tabbing through the fields should work the same as it always has and hopefully it makes it a little easier to see what goes where.

Next up, +Min/Max damage ranges and +Elemental Damage. I've gotten dozens of emails asking about where to put ""+90-218"" damage for say an offhand, so I wanted to make it more simple. In the attributes selector, you'll now find the following stats:

- +Min/Max Damage
- +Min/Max Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage
- +% Damage
- +% Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage

The first two are used for damage ranges, the ""+120-540 Arcane Damage"" or just plain ""+150-300 Damage"". These are the stats you primarily find on Rings/Amulets/Weapons. The second two are used for the ""+3% Damage to Arcane"", like you find on the Tal Rasha's set pieces. I haven't implemented the math yet for elemental damage, but that's coming soon.

The text boxes for the Min/Max fields are a little wider and if the ring says ""+6-12 Damage"", simply put ""6-12"" in the textbox for it. Don't add the + or anything else, just the two numbers with a dash between them.

In closing...

Ugh! Brain hurt... too much coding...

Hopefully this update will give everyone a little break and make it easier to use the calculator itself. It kinda blindsided me yesterday when all of the sudden they released their profiles, so I scrambled to throw it together last night. I figured it would of been part of today's maintenance (which didn't happen anyways). Oh well!

As always, please let me know if you find any bugs! I'll be playing with these changes for the rest of the night and fixing bugs. I've gotta run out for a little bit after I post this, but after I get back home I'll be be hammering away on the site for a few more hours. Just drop me a line or post something on the feedback tab and I'll get back to you ASAP.

1343589736.0,230,self.Diablo,xcpeh,Why Blizz is being silent: a Wow story,silentcrs,475,245,292,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/xcpeh/why_blizz_is_being_silent_a_wow_story/,"So Blizzard has been quiet.  Annoyingly so.  It seems like they've abandoned their community.

However, they've done this once before: the World of Warcraft launch.

When Blizzard launched Wow, they hoped to have a million players in one year.  They had that in the first couple of weeks.  Servers crumbled.  Maintenance was every other day.  People couldn't beat certain content because it was bugged or impossible (I remember getting my ass handed to me in the Barrens by a lightning kodo that would kill in under a second; when you killed him his corpse continued to walk around you).  Queues were rampant.  When the login servers were down, not only could you not play, you could not log in to the forums to find out what was going on.  At one point, everyone went naked on the character select screen just so the systems wouldn't have to load your armor twice.

Blizz went into lockdown mode.  No talk about content.  Very few posts.  People were complaining left and right and a lot of us (myself included) began to feel Blizzard didn't give a crap amount of the community.

Fast forward to today.  Blizzard still has millions of players playing a 7-year old game.  They've had many, many content updates and new players continue to try Wow.  They've addressed a majority of the issues and shattered records.  It took them time from launch to get to a stable point.  I would estimate about 6-9 months.  But once they were there, the CMs came out of hiding, communication improved and players were able play the game from a company they loved without having it go down every other day.

Blizzard time doesn't work like other game developers' time.  Most developers would love to have steady releases annually and move communities from one game to the next.  Blizzard expects their games to be played for 10 years or more, so they figure they have more time to develop them after launch and correct their flaws.

Some common retorts I expect:

Q: Wow is an MMO with a monthly subscription.  Diablo is an ARPG.  What reason does Blizzard have to improve it after launch?

A: A couple of things.  There's the obvious monetization of the RMAH.  I'm not going to deny it and that's what a guy like Kotick looks at.  However, the larger reason is the stain on Blizzard's record.  Quiz: how many games has Blizzard released that continued to suck a few years after?  Answer: none that I can think of.  The only games that were truly terrible were titles they never released (Ghost, that horrific Warcraft cartoon game from the same guys who did the Zelda CDi titles, etc).

Q: If they went through all of this with Wow, why did it have to happen again with Diablo?

A: That's a good question.  I don't know why.  Personally, that's the part that's ticking me off the most.  Maybe they felt the titles were independent enough that they couldn't learn previous mistakes.  I disagree.

Q: Activision has rotten Blizzard to core!

A: If Kotick had his way, Blizzard would be releasing annual Wow expansions on the dot, Diablo would be selling you legendaries directly and Starcraft 2 would have pay-to-play tournaments.  The fact that none of this is happening shows that Blizzard still has a modicum of independence from its corporate masters.",,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,True,t3_xcpeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/xcpeh/why_blizz_is_being_silent_a_wow_story/,
