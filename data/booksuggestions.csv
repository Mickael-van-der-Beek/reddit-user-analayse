The recommendation doesn't need to have all these elements I just don't want to be reading an action story with no thought needed or a textbook with no action =)

My favorite books/series of all time (of which, I've read them all) would be the Ender series, Dune series, and Foundation series.  Just recently read all of the Wool series, The Darkness That Comes Before series, and The Book of the New Sun series as well (just to give you more of an idea of the types of books I am looking for).  Any and all recommendations would be much appreciated!

You all have been seriously diligent in recommending such fantastic books that met the parameters of what I was looking for.

I've been reading a lot of older sci-fi, and a lot of 19th-century fiction lately (weird combination, I know, to jump from Ubik to the Scarlet Pimpernel to the Call of Cthulu), and now all my Goodreads recommendations are more of the same. I'd like to read something recent (as in, 21st century recent) that is eloquent and thought-provoking, raw and modern, and set in our current world/plane/universe. Foreign fiction is perfectly wonderful (I'm in the US). I'm a lady, in my late 20s, a voracious reader, and not afraid of a mere few thousand pages. 

So, what are the best fictions you've read recently? No short stories, please--I'm looking for an engrossing novel. Thanks in advance!

I knew what I was getting into with _The Terror_ by Dan Simmons, and I really should have expected it in _Exquisite Corpse_ by Poppy Z. Brite. But not ALL serial killers are cannibals, you know? I was just blindsided by it in _Dreams of Joy_ by Lisa See. I'd forgotten how bleak she writes.

This shouldn't be a difficult request, since there are many books out there that do not contain the consumption of humans. And some of those books are highly readable, I am sure. I've just been having a rough time lately with cannibals popping up in my reading selection. 

I really read anything, as long as it holds my attention. I like: memoirs, fiction of all kinds, including sci fi, some fantasy, horror, and the occasional mystery (usually with serial killers, but I'd better stay away from those guys just now ... this has been affecting my sleep). My Very Favorite Books of All Time are: _The World According to Garp_, _Ender's Game_, _The Remains of the Day_, _Fingersmith_, _Kavalier and Clay_, _The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_, _1984_, _Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates_, and _Oryx and Crake_. 

I read obsessively, and when I ask my FB friends, I usually just get suggestions I've already read. That makes me sound snobby. Really I'm not at all. I just really f*cking like to read. I eat books.

My Problem With Horror: I don't think the genre has anything to offer me, i.e. I could never find a book that changes the way I look at life. I appreciated King's novels for their storytelling, but I could not find anything there. Why I think I may like it: Some fantasy seems to cross easily into Horror, and there has been good fantasy I read.

* Mystery/Detective: I never read anything in this genre since I was a teenager. Why think I don't like it: I suspect the book is just a more or less elaborate ""who did X"". Why I think I may like it: There may be books where the puzzle is intellectually stimulating.

* Crime: Pretty much same as above

* Western: Read some YA stuff back in early teens, haven't touched since. Why not: I think its overly idealized historical fiction. Why I think I may like it: I don't know

* Romance: Never read any, don't really want to. Why not: I think romance is to relationships what porn is to sex. Why I think I may like it: I don't. If you can change my opinion on this my world will turn upside down :)

---

Bottom line of what I look in the book:

1) I want it to show me something, a new perspective, a more in-depth view of something, a possible future, a possible past, etc. Moralizing is *good*, even better if it's backed by an effective argument.

 2) I'd like it to do 1) with a degree of skill. I don't care for simple prose, I'm not in this for speed-reading

I just thought this way of phrasing the overall effect might produce interesting suggestions that I haven't already read.

Blood Meridian - Cormac McCarthy

Last Exit to Brooklyn - Hubert Selby

The Tunnel - William Gass

The Painted Bird - Jerzy Kozinski (sp?)

Wonderful, Wonderful Times and The Piano Teacher - Elfriede Jelinek

That said, I read a ton so it's annoying for me to always lug around my library or - even worse- throw them out. 

I think this is win-win for publishers. 

EDIT as of 5:58 PM EST- Thanks for the thoughtful responses. I totally understand that getting a ""free"" digital copy is essentially giving away a copy of the book. I get that that strategy in the short term seems like it is completely irrational for a company to do so. 

But here's the thing - if bookstores want to survive, they need to understand that a physical book is an inferior good solely based on technological merits. The way I see it, more and more people will get an e-reader and/or tablet and get digital format books because, like i said before, it's simply more convenient to hold your library online and in one device. Furthermore, more digital integration can allow authors to live update passages of their books instead of writing a forward to the book every so often. 

I still love books, but only due to sentimentality. I don't think book stores can survive using the current model. What I think should happen is that publishers go back to the old school model of making carefully crafted, limited edition versions of books that are essentially collectors items. Additionally, they should throw in the digital version because it's simply more convenient. And does it really cost that much to convert a book into an epub/ebook format? I find it hard to believe that producing a digital format of a book costs something more than a few pennies given the type of technology we have today.

But I didn't really find anything I was super interested in. It's not necessarily that I want a whimsical fairytale (though I did love it in stardust), it's that I want a fantasy book/series that has some sort of romance in it. 

The problem is, every time I combine the words ""fantasy"" and ""romance,"" The only things I see are Stephanie Meyer, Cassandra Clare, Suzanne Collins, and a bunch of ""supernatural/paranormal"" vampire hunter type stuff. I'm not really interested in any of that (for the record, I have read the hunger games trilogy and I've also, unfortunately, wasted my time on twilight.. So I know it's not really for me). The only exception so far has been The All souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness; and I think it's because the protagonist is an adult and she's actually somewhat intelligent and independent. 

So I'm looking for some fantasy books that have romance in them, not necessarily as a main theme, just there as one extra thing for me to root for. I've read from Tolkien to Vonnegut to Raymond Carver, and I currently do have Neverwhere and American gods and I plan to read them soon, but I'm just in the mood for more like stardust right now.

Nowadays, I keep books in my car to read while having a solitary lunch out or waiting at an appointment somewhere.

Sorry For the bad title, I'm not from England or America and right now in 9th grade, so don't blame me for my grammar or my vocabulary.

I would like to see things from other perspectives and I want to read quotes which help me to understand life better and sharp me and make me a better/ more intelligent Person. I hope you understand what I mean...  Books where you think, if I had read that earlier Life would be so much easier and I wouldn't care so much what over people think about me  or something like that...
The book you suggest me, shouldn't be any instruction-books, or Tutorials etc. It's good if they have a story and in these should be remarkable quotes like ""We accept the love we think we deserve"" or something like that. That would be also fine, but not just one remarkable quote in the whole book and it would be also good if it's a book I can find at my local library. :) And for the genres, it shouldn't be any fantasy, Sci-Fi book. It should go more in the direction real life, but it's fine if there is an unrealistic adventure. I've heard Stephen King and Stephen Hawking have some good books, but I don't know their books really or what they are about, I just know King and Hawking are big names in the book scene (shame on me).

I'm going to try to cover the bases here of what I've read:  

* Keep the Aspidistra Flying by Orwell

* Animal Farm by Orwell

* The Invisible Man by HG Wells

* We by Yevgeny Zamyatin

* Feed by Anderson 

* Lord of the Flies by Golding

* Meeks by Julia Holmes

* Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro

* Battle Royale by Takami

* Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

* The Hunger Games by Collins

* V for Vendetta by Alan Moore

* Blindness by Saramago

* Super Sad True Love Story by Shteyngart 

I have a feeling I missed many more, but I think I hit the big ones. Based on this list, which books would you suggest I've forgotten or need to read? I'm hoping to explore new authors rather than more from those on my list. (For example, I have Absurdistan by Shteyngart, but I've yet to read it.) If there's a glaring absence from the current list of authors (such as The Wanting Seed by Burgess), I won't harass you for suggesting it. 

Last two things: 1) I'd prefer to stay away from YA, but again, I won't harass you for suggesting it. 2) I'm planning on purchasing the following:  Ready Player One, The Long Walk, and The Iron Heel.

But I've been running into a few problems with any that I pick up of late. For instance, a lot of adult horror has weird sexual side stories and characters. Pedophiles, incest, rape and other fetishes I don't rightly care for. I also have been finding a lot of 'horror' around where I live has to do with real things, maybe because I'm in the backwoods of Florida south. 

But I want honest to God supernatural stuff, dark is fine, violence is great but horror isn't a serial killer or cannibal to me. Those things strike me more as thrillers or mysteries, I want ghosts, demons and monsters.

I love Lovecraft, I've read every single one of his stories, even the bad ones and some of his poetry, he's my ultimate horror writer. Any writers, modern or otherwise that are like him I will read so suggestions toward that is appreciated.

I'm a bit meh toward Stephen King, personally. Read a lot of his books when I was younger and just didn't really feel ever scared or excited when reading his work.

Extra points if the book takes place in or is based around an asylum or hospital, those always creep me out especially well. Children are also always freaking creepy.

I also love historical settings and stories, period pieces I guess you would call them? Not really sure.

I forced Lolita down my throat last week because I thought it would make me worldly, but alas, I hated the experience which isn't what reading should be about. Now i'm thinking of starting the Lies of Locke Lamora next, if I can get my hands on it. 

Things I like and want more of: cool magic systems, parallel universe stuff (dark materials), survival or fighting back in post poc/dystopia (tomorrow series, HG, Divergent).

Favorites: ender's game, into the forest by hegland, stardust, tomorrow series by marsden, divergent, hunger games, harry potter, eragon series, dark materials series. No icky romance/twilight stuff.

I hate to post all of those because what I like has mostly been YA and I am now official *sigh* an adult. I just enjoy reading for leisure, not to challenge myself - i know thats bad... which is why i'm looking for more. I don't really like politics within my fantasy (to an extent).

I'm looking for non-fantasy books that explore similar themes or have similar style of G.R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, in the likes of: 

* moral ambiguity: multiple point of views on of the same matter, often on opposite sides, that let connect both with the heroes and the villains
* interesting characters: characters avoiding clichés, making decisions based on their own desires and ideas and not based on the reader's expectations. Characters we can understand even if we disagree with them 
* narrative style that defies conventions and assumptions: the death of some of the main characters added to Martin's book a sense of fragility, tension and surprise, giving them a more realistic taste.

Any suggestions?

I'm not going to read it for a while, because I've got so many books to read already, but I just want some suggestions so I have a good idea of what to look for when I get the time. I'm very interested in this idea of the main character gradually changing as the story goes along. 

The only examples I can think of right now aren't from books, though. Beware, there are **Spoilers**. I'm thinking of something like District 9, where he slowly turns into an alien. Or one of the first sections of the game Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, where you control a guy working for Charlemagne, and he gets infected, transforming as you go through the level into some sort of zombie thing. Or Shadow of the Colossus, where Wander slowly gets possessed, and gets paler over the course of the game.

I just like the idea of someone being on a mission, and having this thing changing them, putting a time limit on it or just generally making it harder. And they persevere, pushing past the limit of whatever this thing is, finishing their mission regardless. I'm sure there are tons of books about normal illnesses, but I'm not really interested in that. And I'm not that interested in zombies, either. I guess plague stories are okay, if they handle it in a clever way. I don't know if there's much left that fits, but I'd be glad to look into anything if there is.

Edit: I realize now that the desire for this type of book might stem from the book I'm reading now, called *The Santaroga Barrier*, by Frank Herbert. Herbert has a few books that deal with something like this: possession, addiction, transforming of the self through instruction or living conditions. That could be another way to go, I guess, but I'd prefer that the transformation be a negative thing.

Thank goodness he started writing again several years ago.

I read mostly non-fiction, and classic fiction (i.e. primarily pre-1900 fiction), so our reading habits don't have much in the way of overlap.  I have turned her on to H.P Lovecraft given why she loves Stephen King, and she enjoys it, but I think Lovecraft's stories might be a bit too similar to each other for her taste, though I personally can't get enough of them.

What she really likes about King's stories is how he deals with the psychology of his characters.  Favourite King novels of hers would be like *Gerald's Game* or *The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon* where they are essentially about a character's internal psychological breakdown.  She also loves *The Stand* not for it's supernatural or outwardly scary aspects, but more for the social commentary of how a post-apocalyptic society might organize itself with no law.  Lastly she is big on the *Dark Tower* series which is unusual for her because she is decidedly not in to any other fantasy novels at all.  I'm not familiar with this series so it's hard for me to say why she likes it.

I didn't mind Prometheus last year, but it was hardly a classic. So the hopes that Ridley would someday really take us all back to that level of offworld suspense were somewhat dashed too...

So are there any other sci-fi novels out there that sound like my thing and meet these criteria?...

- Real human characters in the nearish future, not too advanced from the present. 
- Believable, practical alien threats
- Nothing quasi-mystical, just straight up technology and physical conflict
- Deep space (Mars or beyond)
- Isolation
- Suspense/action
- And maybe a kickass female heroine too, if I'm really lucky!

I feel like this is a long shot...

- Modern (i.e. not ""On The Road"")

For example, there are parts of ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman that sort of fit the above.  Books similar to ""American Gods"" (though not by Neil Gaiman -- I've read those) are welcome.

**Edit:** 
    All - thank you for the recommendations!  I've picked up samples from all suggestions on my Kindle.  I look forward to reading them.  I'm starting with Panic by Jeff Abbot due to the free six chapter sample on Amazon.

One major theme I can **not** believe I forgot is:

- Travelogue/Travel across the United States to weird locales!  This was a fundamental theme I was looking for (and was very prevalent in American Gods).

I also realize that modern can be interpreted in a few different ways.  I actually mean modern in two respects: (1) written recently and (2) takes place within the last 20 years or so.

Thus, for those three days, I'll be doing absolutely nothing unless something goes horribly wrong.

In light of this, I need a suggestion for a book or series that can keep my interest for the duration.  As a caveat, the environment I'll be in won't allow me to bring electronic devices - I'll need a physical book, so keep scarcity in mind please.  :)  Here are some of my likes in literature:

I'm looking for Sci-Fi or Fantasy.  I've read all the Song of Ice and Fire books up to date - love them!  I've read a lot of Clancy (not all - dude's prolific), and I like them quite a bit.  Peter F. Hamilton's space opera books fascinate me - but I think I've read most of his stuff.  I've read pretty much ever R.A. Salvatore book ever written (exception of the Clerical Quintet, which I may bring with me, as I think I have it in hard copy).  If you recognize my username, you'll know that I love Anne McCaffrey's books.  I have read the ""Sword of Truth"" series, and while I liked some bits, the political message within and the author's tendency to beat a dead horse did nothing but piss me off.  I've read ""Snow Crash"" and thought it was fantastic, but I've had difficulty getting in to other Neil Stephenson books.  I've read a good deal of the Star Wars expanded universe books, but the ones I enjoyed most were the Rogue Squadron series.  I'd love to read a ""Witcher"" book (the games were awesome), but I doubt it would take me ~30 hours to finish.  I've read the Harry Potter series, of course, and loved it - but I've loved the fan-fic ""Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"" at least as much as the original book series (check it out if you've never heard of it).

So, that's a good sampling of my sci-fi/fantasy likes.  What have you got?  :)  Thanks in advance!

Edit:  Wow, some great looking recommendations in here!  I think I've got my mind made up for what I'm going to bring with me, but don't let that stop you from keeping the awesome recommendations coming - I go on reading binges, and it looks like I'm in for a doozy...  :)

I've been to therapy, treatment programs, taken medication and I still feel as lost as ever.

The main issue is that I feel completely lost in my life and hopeless about making any improvements. I think about suicide all the time.
I feel hopeless about my life, potential and future, and I look at nearly every aspect and period of my life with pesimism as dark and hostile. 
I am deeply depressed and my mind only serves to make me feel worse in every situation I put myself in. I am incredibly self-critical and bash myself and my character whenever I can. Tied in to this, I have a very deep-seated hatred for myself.

I have terrible anxiety and tend to catastrphise situations. Despite the fact that I can socially perform very well in some situations and can seem like a very sociable person, I have very crippling social anxiety. I have never had a girlfriend, I find it incredibly hard to get close to people and I tend to think that acquiantances of mine dislike me and don't want to spend time with me because I can be socially awkward in one-on-one interactions.

My self-worth is nearly entirely built on what I think others think of me. 

I can not solve any problems in my life. I feel as if my problem-solving ""toolkit"" was removed from me some time ago and I have immense difficulty trying to complete the smallest tasks. I am very avoidant, and I leave things to be done until the last minute or not at all, only because I have such huge difficulty trying to complete things when I set aside time to do them. 

This isn't a thing that fluctuates. When I'm not busy and not in the company of others, my mind is flooded with these horrible thoughts and worse literally all the time. It's so exhausting. I just feel like a piece of shit walking around day after day. I have no creative outlets. I try to write or be creative with something and end up just abandoning it because I hate the product.

I just have this massive bunch of horrible insecurities that I spend all my mental energy on convincing myself that they are true. I have 0 self-esteem, even if I try to present myself in a different way. I don't feel that I can talk to anyone I know about this. I've tried, but it doesn't end up changing anything. This is why I thought that I would look for book recommendations


This is kind of just an incomplete grocery list of things that keep my down and perpetuate my shitty mental life. I've been this way for 4-5 years.


Can anybody recommend books of any sort that could address some of these issues or offer me any guidance?


Alternatively, could anybody advise me as to a more suited subreddit to post this text to?

Or something on Feline psychology?",ODBC,34,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i9d30/i_just_got_a_new_beautiful_kitty_any_books_out/,"As the title states, I am the proud new owner of a beautiful black kitty cat. I have grown up in a household of dogs my entire life, but this cat fascinates me like nothing before. I have read books (and currently am reading one) about the psychological make-up of dogs; it goes without saying that I have also read guides made to teach about the different breeds of dogs' different characteristics and advice for their training.

So I have a need to buy books (PLURAL!!!) that revolve around these three topics:

* **Cat psychology. Their quirks. Literary works (like Poe's essay about cats' reasoning capabilities) that fascinate as well as stimulate the reader about feline life. [Melancholia's Dog](http://www.amazon.com/Melancholias-Dog-Reflections-Animal-Kinship/dp/0226465780) is a scholarly work examining the tie between depression and dogs in everything from Wittgenstein and Freud to Kafka and Homer.**

* **The *BEST*, most reputable Cat Guidebooks. Like ""dogs for dummies,"" but a more enlightening version. Something to help train my kitty to shit in the litter box, but also what I can do to help her be comfortable enough to walk around with a leash (potentially; I would love this) or even just cuddle in bed when I read.**

* **In addition to a general training guidebook, I would love to have a book that focuses on *Human-Feline Communication.* I am beyond fascinated with dogs and animals generally in their ability to communicate with emotions, language etc. So ideally this cat book would consist of helpful pointers (e.g., for dogs it helps to squat low to their level when you want to see them) and also theory (e.g., dogs think you're less predatory when you squat down to their level).** 


So please reddit, help me find some cat books! I have an Amazon gift card burning a hole in my pocket! This has been and will forever be my favorite subreddit community. You have never failed to interest me and to provoke my curiosity about subjects I thought I knew, but actually had still more energy to learn. Inspire me to help my kitty cat kit cat kitty catty kit! 

edit: I am a moron. reddit = cats.

So my baby's name is Lady [the title] **Binx** ""The Sphinx"" Abby [for my beautiful black rescue great dane who passed away not too long ago] ""Ghost"" (GoT) *My Last Name* [no personal info].

Lady Binx ""The Sphinx"" Abby ""Ghost."" Hell yeah. She's the greatest thing on earth. 7 weeks old. Fully black with the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen on an animal, including the human species.

**So now that I think about it, a book solely on the Ancient Egyptians mythology and general culture in relation to CATS would be fascinating and would be read like a starving man eating a plate of Thanksgiving dinner. Please add this request to the other bolded ones!**

I will add pictures momentarily!

Looking for something in the vein of what I wrote in the title of. Not too long ago I read Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" (and right after that rushed in and got ""Monarch of the Glen"" and ""Anansi Boys"" and read those aswell) and something similar to that - is very much what I want. Though Mr. Gaiman's supernatural beings are deities - it's not necessarily the rule of what I'm interested in, it can be anything from vampires to pixies or whatever.

Also a big help in describing what I'm looking for can be videogames  like Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. It's very interesting with vampires having clans, sects, hierarchy and other stuff. I'm aware that this game was based on tabletop games in the ""World of Darkness"" setting, but unfortunately I'm forever alone and doubt that anyone would play those with me (also english isn't my native and unlike books - tabletop games rarely make it to translation, which doesn't bother me personally but would potentially alienate everyone else).

- Goodkind: Could not read more than a couple of pages of this, I felt the writing was terrible and amateur.

- Dragonlance: Same, cheesy writing, too long.

Many of these I am pretty much planning on reading again once i buy them on my kindle (Don't hate.

During the peak of the Fukushima Accident, I've read these two articles:

1. [Seniors urged to eat Fukushima rice to help farmers, protect young people](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/03/20/national/seniors-urged-to-eat-fukushima-rice-to-help-farmers-protect-young-people/)
2. [Japanese seniors volunteer for Fukushima 'suicide corps'](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-31/world/japan.nuclear.suicide_1_nuclear-plant-seniors-group-nuclear-crisis?_s=PM:WORLD)

I am not really sure how to describe it, but I am really curious to what kind of culture that gave birth to these kind of people. They seem to take altruistic self initiative to solve their people's problem (making it a better place?). Because they feel that it is their responsibility? 

I can understand if a person does the sacrifice or even a few. But they seem to do it because it is the normal thing to do, the logical outcome and something of the expected, not the exception. Just like if a woman in Germany with a stroller getting down from a bus, you can always expect someone to help her.

I think I am confused about this and my mind requires some untangling. I would like to learn about the culture that created the Japanese folks in the two articles above. Please recommend a few books about it, thank you.

        
**Edit:**

After doing a little research, I stumbled upon the term [Bushido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushid%C5%8D).
Using that as a reference keyword, I found these 4 books that I guess might help in my learning:

I have finished reading Joe Abercrombie's series (don't know the name of series) starting with ""The Blade Itself"", I like Robin Hobbs, Patrick Rothfuss, David Eddings, Brandon Sanderson and similiar authors typically, but am having trouble with finding new books as I prefer books that are a-typical but am just looking for more books as I tend to read quite a bit.

I've queued up Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks but would appreciate if anyone could help me with finding more.

As ashamed as I am to admit this, I've never finished any book, save for one, ""Holes"", by Louis Sachar, which I read back in elementary. There was also ""Cat and Mouse"", by James Patterson, that I got into in college and *almost* finished, but fell short when life got in the way.

Though now I've come to a point where I want to give reading another chance.

I don't really know what to start with or what level I feel comfortable with, in terms of genre and difficulty, respectively. I do know, however, that I'd like a book that's relatively modern and easy to read. Any help?

EDIT: I just wanted to say thanks to all the people who took the time to help me out!

I'll start!,boughsmoresilent,28,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1frpvx/poetry_recommendations_ill_start/,"I've been on a huge poetry kick. It's hard to find books of poetry that aren't ""Best Of"" collections of famous poets. For instance, I have *Selected Poems of W. H. Auden*, but I feel the reading experience is radically different when compared to books of poetry. That said, selected poem collections and poetry anthologies are totally welcome as recommendations here!

Some of my suggestions:

- [If There is Something to Desire](http://www.amazon.com/If-There-Something-Desire-Hundred/dp/0307272257/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370490319&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=if+there+is+something+to+desire) by Vera Pavlova, translated from Russian to English by her husband Steven Seymour. Sparse, personal poems that may not appeal to everyone.

* [Donkey Gospel](http://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Gospel-Poems-Tony-Hoagland/dp/1555972683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370490481&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=donkey+gospel) and [What Narcissism Means to Me: Poems](http://www.amazon.com/What-Narcissism-Means-Me-Poems/dp/1555973868/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370490481&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=donkey+gospel) by Tony Hoagland. Tony Hoagland is my favorite poet at the moment-- highly recommended!
* [The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay](http://www.amazon.com/Selected-Poetry-Vincent-Library-Classics/dp/0375761233/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370490554&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=edna+st.+vincent+millay) - I particularly love her sonnets.

I'm an aspiring writer and the novels I have in mind follow a time line I've never seen done before in books. It's been done in tv and movies before though, so I would imagine there are books out there that do it too. I'd like to get a feel for how other authors have presented their stories, and take some pointer from the pros before I go in blind.

Anyways, I'm looking for books where in every chapter, part, or section, the same event is retold from the POV of a different character. Basically, event is written from the POV of character A. In the next part the event is written again, but from the POV of character B, which adds more details for a better understanding. Then in the next part it is told again from the POV of character C which introduces plot twists and more information. So on and so fourth, until the story is finished.

I'd prefer a fantasy book, but sci-fi is acceptable, and I am willing to pick up other genres for the sake of variety. No non-fiction, please. Other than that, all suggestions are welcome.

The Handmaid's tale   
The Giver   
Fahrenheit 451    
The Hunger Games

If you don't know any good dystopias, I need to know which King book I should read next. I know he has a lot of great ones, but I've only read the Stand, Carrie, and Cujo. I'm not sure which one I should read next, so any suggestions with that are good too.

I'm a HUGE lover of books, and the ongoing book list I've been choosing from has basically dwindled to two or three books.

I have nothing against them, but everyone has their own preferences, and I have never been able to get through Victorian literature.

I wanted to talk about this guy, Jorge Luis Borges.

He is an Argentinean writer and he recently got a Google Doodle for his 112th Birthday (he died already). He is mainly a short story writer, although he did a bunch of different things. I thought the Reddit community would really love this guy. 

Let me share some details about Borges and recommend some of his stuff:

- He wrote a short story about an (almost) infinite library, that contained every possible 410-page book that could exist. http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html

- He wrote a short story about a guy that could not forget anything, ever (http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/borges.htm)

- He published his 1st translation at the age of  9 (Wilde's ""The Happy Prince"") and translated (and transformed) most of the works of Poe, Wilde, Hesse, Kipling, Faulkner &amp; Whitman. He said (from Wiki) ""translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid.""

- Borges ""created"" one of the five ""actually existing"" copies of Abdul Alhazred's ""Necronomicon"" when he created an entry for it while he worked in the University of Buenos Aires (the Necronomicon is a fictional book mentioned in H.P. Lovecraft's works. Borges was a fan, so he created an entry for it. Years later, occult fans looking for an actual copy found the entry that Borges left in the UBA.

- He was very critic of long works, stating: ""It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.""

I just wanted to share with Reddit an author that may go unnoticed to the anglo speakers, but that is a huge must for people who like short stories. He was one of the masters of this craft (in my ranking only Poe comes close), and all his short stories are profoundly phylosophical, and mystical to a point. For TL;DR haters, his longest work ever was 12 pages long, and people have called him the most important figure in Spanish literature since Cervantes.

We didn't read a lot of classic literature in middle or high school except Shakespeare, but I really enjoyed the plays of his that we read. The only other one I do remember off the top of my head is ""A Separate Peace"" by John Knowles, and even though everyone disagrees with me, I hated that book.

I don't want something incredibly dense and hard to read (so, NOT Shakespeare ;) ), but whenever those ""which books of these have you read?"" lists go around, I can check off maybe two of one hundred.

Then of course there's *Old Man's War* (and the rest of that series) by John Scalzi. I *love* the boosts they get to their abilities in addition to their more mundane military training. Joe Haldeman's *The Forever War* gets into some of the same thing. There are so many weird similarities between those two books, even though they differ so much in tone.

Even the Harry Potter series touches on this somewhat, with Harry and his classmates learning new skills and training themselves.

My city's gotten a little nippy, and so has my finals week. I need some serious, grade-a surreal-to-unreal-to-hyper-real literary crack. 

I love Rushdie's **Midnight's Children**, Sussana Clarke's **Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell**, All of the Earthsea books (especially the first), Nicholas Christopher's **A Trip to the Stars**, Paulo Coelho's **The Alchemist**, and Jim Crace's **The Devil's Larder**.

Each of the above books are, to me, a flood. **Midnight's Children** hits me with endless sentences. **Strange &amp; Norrell** has endless footnotes that fill up the world. **The Wizard of Earthsea** and **The Alchemist** always seemed to overtake me with their narratives. **A Trip to the Stars** hit me with a sense of constant disorientation. And **The Devil's Larder** held me hostage. It felt like I'd been tricked into eating cold soup, as it felt like steaming stew when I ate it.

So I don't need an escape or an adventure. I need an overload. I need to be broken by a book, to be held captive by something I can't quite understand. 

Please, please, help me.

Thank you so much for reading.

**P.S.** I'm also looking into **Infinite Jest** and Thomas Wharton's **Salamander**, so if anyone would like to give their take on either book, that would also be great.

To cite some mainstream examples (which I've read all/almost all of), Harry Potter, Song of Ice and Fire, Discworld, and Sabriel (Abhorsen Trilogy) all do an amazing job of this.

I apologies as I don't have a very solid definition, but the kind of books I want to read are those with beautiful scenes that resonate after you've put the book down.

That might be a completely subjective thing, so I'll use popular writers as a personal reference in case anyone can see the common thread.

**5 whose scenes I loved:**

Marquez, Kurt Vonnegut, Yukio Mishima, Tolstoy, and Hemingway (half the time, e.g. The Sun Also Rises).

**5 on the other end (although I still like their books in other ways):**

Phil Roth, Herman Hesse, James Joyce after Dubliners, Nabokov, and Hemingway (the other half of the time, e.g. A Farewell to Arms (except for the end)).


I don't know where modern literature technically starts, but I've honestly read less than a hundred books from the last 3 decades, so if you name something after the 80's I probably haven't read it.

I've always been curious about them, but I've never really gotten into them because I'm a guy. I have read only two books that I liked, one I enjoyed and one I can't remember the title to. The first is [Highland Vow](http://www.amazon.com/Hannah-Howell/e/B001HN35I8/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1361001742&amp;sr=8-1). I can't quite remember the names of the characters of the other one, but the protagonist was a girl with red hair who wore a purple (I think) dress on the cover. The love interest brought her out of her comfort zone by playing games. I distinctly remember one where he pretended to be a pirate captain and he had just captured her. He also belonged to a club of rich nice guys? Something like that? The other men there seemed like they were the stars of their own novels.

Anyways, these books both seemed like they were part of an ongoing series where characters know each other. I like that, and I love fantasy. Also the books I would like to read have to be engaging in terms of story. So any suggestions would be great. Also if anyone can find that second book title for me, it's driving me crazy.

**Edit** I remembered the name of that second book I mentioned above. It's called [To Distraction](http://www.amazon.com/Distraction-Bastion-Club-Stephanie-Laurens/dp/0060839104).

* The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, by Michael Chabon (Love Chabon. I have read pretty much all of his stuff).
* Middlesex, by Jefferey Eugenides
* Seven Types of Ambiguity, by Elliot Perlman
* Freedom, by Jonathan Franzen
* Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell (This one is perhaps an outlier, as it is very experimental and has elements of sci-fi. The voice, the writing, and the characters are what I loved.)

I was hoping that maybe he could give reading a try again to fill some of his time.  

He has always claimed to be a slow reader, but I'm wondering if part of the problem is if the types of things he was required to read back in school contained themes of things he didn't like too much.

I'm looking at the kinds of television shows he likes to watch for guidance.  For example he likes Castle, The Good Wife, and Law &amp; Order.  Not totally familiar with these shows myself but thinking the are of the crime\mystery\legal thriller genre.  

Now I did see there was a spinoff series of books from the Castle TV series but find their ratings on Good Reads to be a little risky for a first book for him.  Don't know if books in these genres are generally rated lower, but something around 4+ stars would probably be a safer bet.  I don't want to give him a book and have him not like it because it was something half the people who read it didn't like it.  

Other things that I think would be a turnoff given how he approaches movies and tv:

* Excessive violence, especially gore
* Doesn't like historical settings
* Doesn't like futuristic settings
* Doesn't like excessive foul language
* No to magic, occult, horror, secret orders

I would also add that it's probably a good idea to have a writer who sticks to a pretty basic reading level.  No clever prose or advanced vocabulary.  Last thing I need him to do is quit a book because the words make him feel stupid.

EDIT: one more thing on my big list of requirements.  Need something that starts off pretty quickly since I'm only probably going to get one shot at convincing him to give reading a chance.",,False,,t5_2ryqe,False,,,True,t3_1b6rs3,http://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1b6rs3/reluctant_reader_crimemysterylegal/,

Another element comes from 14 by Peter Clines - This book gets really weird... and I like it.  From the book and others it sounds like the weird stuff from 14 is similar to HP Lovecraft's work - Is it?  Should I get Necronomicon? 

Related to that is David Wong's John Dies at the End....which is the craziest book I've ever read and I loved it.

Can anyone recommend an interesting read that tries to address the impact that this new powerful medium/information age is having on our minds, emotions, habits, social interactions and family life?  A book  that will help bring perspective and balance back into our lives.

 

(Fiction or non fiction will work so long as it is an enjoyable and not too taxing of a read.  I have read Brave New world and some Marshall McLuhan.  They were both interesting but would prefer  something more timely and geared to the layman reader)  A  fun dash of conspiracy theory never hurts to keep the pages turning.

Up until a year or two ago, I read fantasy almost exclusively.  I'm not a huge reader by any stretch, but I do like to read on my lunch break and on the train to and from work.

After deciding I would like to read a good Crime OR Spy novel, I picked up Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy...  and put it down within about 120 seconds or so.  Within a couple of pages, I was completely lost as to what the fuck was happening (and it was just basically an introduction chapter; no 'spy stuff' had even started happening yet!).  I figure maybe the author's writing style wasn't to my taste?  I'm not sure; I just know I couldn't follow and found his writing style to be less straightforward than I'd normally like.

So yeah, I don't know if I'm just being a child about this (or maybe I should be reading some of his other books prior to Tinker, Tailor?).

What do you guys suggest?,zimmertr,21,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/o61l9/i_need_a_new_epic_fantasy_series_to_read_what_do/,"Last night I finished up reading the newest book in the Sword of Truth series and I’m looking to move onto another epic fantasy series. I’ve already read A Song of Ice and Fire and absolutely loved it. Well, except for the last two books, they started to feel quite rushed. As for the Sword of Truth, well, I’m not sure how The Omen Machine got published, lol. I did, however, like the romance aspect of it. I’ve also read most of the Lord of the Rings series, but couldn’t finish the last book. I just couldn’t  get into it. 

Basically, here are the things that I’m looking for in a new series. Obviously not all of them need to be fulfilled, but this is what I’m aiming for: 

* Romance, Relationships, Passion, etc. (I feel like love and lust in a novel or series really build character development and when books have this in it they really interest me.) 

* Length. (This isn't a must I guess, but I would prefer the series to be quite lengthy. I wouldn't hesitate to read a trilogy or anything, but I definitely like it when there are 10+ books in a series, ya' know? )

* Politics, World Affairs, etc (This is one thing that I absolutely loved about ASoIaF. The political aspects were amazing and I also really liked the world problems and how there are characters that never meet or know anything about each other but are seemingly interrelated. EG Daenerys and Cersei from ASoIaF. Both were very key characters but never really met or anything.) 

* Multiple Viewpoints (I know that many writing professors have always told us that there is one thing to never do when writing fiction: change viewpoints often. But this is something that I, personally, really love when it is done correctly. I really liked how ASoIaF had 100's of characters. 

* Impending doom (ASoIaF is another great place to draw examples for this bullet from. The threat of what is lurking behind the wall, the dragons that are being unleashed on the world, the influence that the gods have, etc. These make a story really interesting to me. ) 

* High Fantasy (Along with the aspect of romance, this is another one of the bullets that I would certainly like to fulfill. I like dragons, wizards, races, magic, swords and other weaponry, etc)  

* Adult (I don't really want to read Narnia or some other seemingly young audience novels. I would like it to be aimed towards an adult audience and have a more mature themes.) 

* Not Moral or overly religious (This is one thing that I didn't like about SoT. Richard was really annoyingly moral and was constantly making ridiculous decisions in order to preserve his integrity. Characters like The Hound and stuff from ASoIaF are amazing in the concept of non-prudent behavior.)

* **EDIT 1** I would also prefer the author to not be a misogynist. Terry Goodkind's portrayal of women was exceptionally annoying. They couldn't do anything unless a man helped them. lol

* **EDIT 2** Cinematography (While I understand that turning fantasy stories into movies or television shows is quite difficult and pushes budgets sky high, I love watching movies after reading books, even if they don't ""perfectly"" mirror the exactly storyline. A Game of Thrones is some of the best TV I've ever watched. And, of course, we all know The Lord of the Rings movies are amazing even though Peter Jackson is a bit of a tool. lol)

I know these key points seem awfully demanding, but I'm sure there is something out there. Thing you guys can help? =]

Recently I started reading. I used to read when I was younger, but I would read Harry Potter and the such. Now the first book that I started reading was 1984, and I enjoyed it. After that I tried reading Anna Karenina, but it felt kind of boring, and I figured it was because I was still a newbie at books and couldn't really appreciate it. Meanwhile lurking the internet, I found ""The Man Who Folded Himself"". This book blew my mind, it was an incredible book for me.

Now I don't know what else to try. I want something with a somewhat challenging plot, but not something that I will easily get bored from as Anna Karenina.

After playing the phenomenal game Kentucky Route Zero, I'm really looking for some more stories that take place in a magical, Southern Gothic style. While I might consider Cormac McCarthy's *Blood Meridian* to teeter into that category, the kinds of stories I'm looking for are more akin to two non-book related pieces of media. So I'm going to describe the two pieces of media that define this self-made genre in order to help your suggestions along. 

**Looking for something like**

**Carnivale** A very underrated and phenomenal HBO series about a traveling carnival that has a mythic and religious presence that slowly reveals itself throughout the course of the show. Magical elements include avatars, satanism, telepathy, mysticism, ghosts and rejuvenation. [Check out the extensive mythology for more info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_Carnivàle)

**Kentucky Route Zero** The aforementioned point-and-click game that started me on my quest. Tells the story of a mysterious trucker who must travel through the mythic Kentucky Route Zero, an underground impossible tunnel, to deliver his goods. Mythical elements include fantastical creatures, ghosts, non-Eucldidian physics, time travel and spacial deconstruction.

If you could help me find novels similar to these pieces of media, I would be so grateful. Hell even just a good Souther Gothic novel (not Cormac McCarthy please, I'm a completist) would be very appreciated.

The only problem is, ""True Crime"" is a genre that is inundated with schlock. There's so many crappy novels by C-list writers that don't really tell you anything you can't just find on the internet.

Part of what I found fascinating about ""In Cold Blood"" was that Capote cared a lot about the people. His heart went out to the people who were affected by the crime, but he also understood that the killers weren't faceless monsters, but they were people too.

I also love how ""inside"" Capote got to the case. He wasn't just writing what the cops would let him know. He was working side by side with the detectives, and it showed in his book. 

One book I'm thinking about picking up is *The Good Nurse*, about Charles Cullen. I heard an interview with the author on NPR and it just seemed like he was deeply invested in the case. Is the book any good from people who've read it?

She started picking up more Kyra Davis novels, eventually working her way through the whole ""Sophie Katz"" series. Despite the heroine being annoying, she enjoyed the books overall. She also loves the ""Castle"" tie-in novels.

Recently she's tried to find some new things in the same vein to read.
