(further explained inside),Hokehs,570,113,517,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/1abfe9/how_would_modern_american_football_players_fare/,"While it's only my opinion, I see American football players as some of the scariest (scary good that is) athletes in the world today.  When I see someone like [Julius Peppers](http://alexbowles.edublogs.org/files/2009/06/julius-peppers1.jpg), who is 6'8, 287bs, and can run a forty in 4.68 seconds, I realize he is stronger, bigger, and faster than most men around.  I'm curious what a modern athlete of his caliber could accomplish in the ancient world, lets say Rome, or Gaul, or Germainia, or Caledonia, something along those lines.  Were there athletes of that size/speed in those days?  I'm sure there were some barbarians of his stature but I don't know much about that time period.  I'm under the impression that the average Roman was around 5'6-5'7 and about 125lbs.  Even someone like Tom Brady is 6'4 and 225lbs.  I wonder if he could be as talented chucking around a pilum like he is the old pigskin. 

I suppose what I'm asking is in a warfare standpoint, and I understand that the brawn of the barbarians wasn't much of a match for the organized and regimented nature of the Roman military, but the question still jumps around in my head.

1350589870.0,392,self.HistoricalWhatIf,11pfv8,"I got carried away answering ""What if Mexico had agreed to ally with Germany after the Zimmerman Telegram"", and then OP deleted it. So I am sharing my answer with you anyway. ",Salacious-,451,59,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/11pfv8/i_got_carried_away_answering_what_if_mexico_had/,"Mexico, still bitter about the Mexican-American war of 1846 and eager to stamp out the revolution of Emiliano Zapata (who Mexico suspected was being aided by the United States), receives the Zimmerman Telegram, unintercepted by British Intelligence. Having their army already mobilized and fighting in the North, Mexico drafts their own version of the ""Schliefen Plan"" which aspired to capture huge grabs of territory and then sue for peace before their foe realizes that they cannot hold the territory. They secretly agree to an alliance with the Central Powers and begin receiving shipments of weapons from Germany as well as funds to buy weapons and supplies from America, ostensibly to fight Zapata.

The US, though increasing production of war materials in order to sell to both sides (well, mainly the British), has not mobilized or prepared its forces for war. Although beefing up its naval presence, the number of troops remains pitifully small. 

1918: Mexico launches an attack, seizing the US naval shipyards in San Diego and the main commercial hub in Los Angeles before the U.S. is even aware of the attack. Arizona and New Mexico are quickly taken; the few forces on the border with Mexico (ironically, there to help capture Zapata) are captured or killed in the first few days. Mexican forces march up California and are stopped at the head of the Salinas Valley, cutting off their march to San Francisco. In Texas, border towns are quickly overwhelmed, as is San Antonio. The Mexican army bypasses the capital of Austin and instead heads straight to Houston, hoping to cut off supplies arriving by sea. Texas, notorious for its independent nature, quickly rallies the militia. Houston is torn apart by brutal, street to street fighting. Mexico sets fire to the city, hoping to burn out their enemies. 

The government in Washington is taken completely by surprise. Saboteurs cut railway lines and telegraph lines throughout the country, having had time to infiltrate across the porous, lawless border ahead of time. Initial reports had mistaken for the invasion as a domestic troop revolution, because Mexico's soldiers were armed with US weapons and had made counterfeit US military uniforms. Washington moved quickly to lock down remaining troops in the country, hoping to stop the spread of the non-resistant revolt. This significantly slowed their response to the invasion, allowing Mexico to solidify its gains. 

4 days after the invasion began, the Senate officially declares war on Mexico. The Mexican Ambassador, who had remained behind in Washington so as not to raise suspicions, is arrested and hung from the White House portico. The Senate simultaneously passed a mandatory draft (Although not necessary, as recruitment offices were overwhelmed by volunteers), and declares war on Germany and the other Central powers.

Naval forces from San Francisco, Oregon, and Washington mount a counter-offensive as the garrison in Salinas continues to block movement into Northern California. Amphibious landings manage to retake sections of Los Angeles, San Diego. Furthermore, forces land in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and begin fighting up the Baja Peninsula. 

In Texas, reinforcements arrive by rail (where possible) and by sea from Louisiana and Florida. Both sides commit the majority of their forces to the Battle of Houston. Galveston is retaken and becomes the beachhead for forces arriving from the East Coast. 

After 8 bloody days, Houston is retaken and Mexican forces retreat to San Antonio. Well supplied and fortified, they manage to fend off all attacks from pursuing militia. Directed by German military advisers, they dig trenches and await the main force of the U.S. military. Mexico tries contacting the US government, offering peace in exchange for holding territory in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. The US government doesn't even respond. 

**2 weeks after the invasion**: Mexican forces remain in control of New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Nevada, Colorado, and California. US forces have manages to retake most of Los Angeles and San Diego, although Mexican guerrillas saturate the hills around L.A. In Texas, Houston has been utterly destroyed but retaken; the Mexican Army has settled into San Antonio, awaiting a longer battle. US forces have been stopped in Baja Mexico at Santa Rosalia and have also become entrenched. The first battalions of US Regulars arrive in Texas from other states. After a devastating first assault on San Antonio, with casualty estimates as high as 25%, U.S. forces decide instead to encircle the city and starve them out. 

**1 month after the invasion**: US forces defeated outside Santa Rosalia retreat back to Cabo San Lucas; resupply and reinforcement efforts are hampered by German U-Boats, who have been diverted from the war in the Atlantic to aid Mexico. Mexican forces in California, cut off from the South, make their way into the Central Valley of CA in order to resupply from the many farms in the region. They are doggedly pursued by US forces, and employ a ""scorch and burn"" tactic, devastating the region. Minor skirmishes take place up and down the state. In Texas, Mexican forces in San Antonio show few signs of running out of supplies. The US Army brings in heavy artillery and begins non-stop blasting of the city. 

**2 Months after invasion**: Mexican forces in California are destroyed at the Battle of Fresno as they try to make their way into the mountains and join up with forces in Nevada. US Troops push through Arizona and New Mexico before being stopped at Albequerque by entrenched Mexican forces. In Texas, the U.S. army continues its siege of San Antonio after repeated, failed attempts to break through Mexico's lines. Mexico employs chemical warfare (from Germany) with devastating effectiveness. US troops begin bypassing the city and fighting their way into Mexico, retaking the Rio Grande and occupying Matamoros. US Marines land at Veracruz and take the city with almost no resistance. This becomes a hub of landing more soldiers and spreading through Southern Mexico. Indigenous peoples in the Yucatan rise up against Mexico and join US forces, establishing their own independent nation on the Yucatan Peninsula. US troops from California begin pushing into the Baja region while simultaneously pushing up from Cabo San Lucas. The peninsula is taken in a matter of days and the army invests Hermosilla. 

**3 months after invasion**: San Antonio finally falls to US forces when Mexican forces run low on ammunition and attempt to break the siege and retreat toward Mexico. The government of Mexico sends envoys to the United States in order to negotiate a treaty. An angry mob, goaded by journalists pushing for punishment of Mexico, lynches the envoys. President Wilson issues a statement declaring that the United States can no longer consider itself safe until Mexico's government falls. US forces have seized all of the border states of Mexico as well as Sinaloa and Durango. Much other Southern Mexico has seceded and many major coastal cities have been captured. US troops move slowly toward Mexico City, hampered by the lack of infrastructure in arid Northern Mexico. Railroad tracks are laid at a breakneck pace. Reinforcements stream into the country with no end in site. 

**4 months after invasion**: Western Mexico secedes and allies itself with the United States. Mexican forces surrender en masse as the US marches toward Mexico City. The US has recognized the independent countries of Yucatan and Oaxaca. The government of Mexico recalls all remaining forces to Mexico City to man the defenses. Washington still refuses to negotiate terms of surrender until the government has fallen. Planes come into widespread use, being used to drop propaganda and threats into Mexican cities. Angry mobs set fire to large sections of the city, and soldiers are forced to abandon their defenses to put down the revolt. Government officials try to flee and are captured on their way to Puerto Vallarta, where a U-boat waited to take them to Germany. The President of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, hangs himself in the presidential palace, and Mexico City is taken without a fight.

**5 Months After Surrender**: Much of Northern Mexico, as well as the east coast of Mexico, is annexed by the United States. The State of Mexico is all that remains of the Country of Mexico. The Nation of Sinaloa runs across the western coast of Mexico, Oaxaca takes up much of southern central Mexico, and the Nation of Yucatan covers the Yucatan Peninsula",,False,,t5_2si7z,1350590348.0,,,True,t3_11pfv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/11pfv8/i_got_carried_away_answering_what_if_mexico_had/,

Imagine that we take roughly ten thousand people from the present day and transplant them to a primeval Earth, say, six thousand years ago.  The one important catch to this scenario is that on this Earth there aren’t any humans.  There are the same continents we’re used to, the same climates, and the same flora and fauna (and of course there would be more of these two); the only difference being that humanity is noticeably out of the picture.  No villages, no farms, no nascent cultures, nothing.  It’s essentially an Earth coming out of an ice age and ripe for civilization.  Therefore on this Earth there would exist roughly the same conditions our ancestors were privy to at the beginning of their civilizations, except that in this scenario there are no ancestors, just the select ten thousand I previously mentioned.  That being said…



These ten thousand people (equal parts male and female) would represent the pinnacle of human knowledge in all fields; they would be engineers, architects, doctors, nurses, chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, craftsmen, plumbers, electricians, writers, musicians, artists, historians, farmers, businesspeople, etc.  Essentially they would embody all of the knowledge gained during our thousands of years of civilization.  And transported back with them would be a bookshelf, maybe thirty feet long and eight feet high, which contained within it books that run the gamut on all the aforementioned professions in a very succinct and precise fashion.  And that’s it.  Maybe they’d be sent back with a few fur rags so they wouldn’t die from exposure but that’s all they would get.  Every other thing they wanted they’d have to make literally from the ground up.



So essentially the question I’m pondering is how long it would take these people to attain a level of technology we’re accustomed to today if every THING that we take for granted was taken away from them.  No tools, no houses…not even a cleared patch of land for planting – or domesticated crops to plant.  They would essentially have to progress from the Stone Age to the Information Age starting at square one.  Their one advantage in all of this – and it’s a big one – is knowledge, for it’s this knowledge upon which our society is based, and there wouldn’t have to be as much struggle or trial and error.  But would they put their nose to the grindstone and get to work?  Would they fall into some ridiculous autocracy despite the historical precedents they are sure to know about?  Would some dick try and burn all the books to prove a point?  Or would they recognize all of the faults in our present society, and use their collective wisdom to make a utopia?  Would they set up a market economy or would they try some collectivization scheme?  Or perhaps they might try one and move onto the other.  Would they skip from stone tools to steam engines?

And I suppose I apologize for all that text

The second plane, departing from New York City and headed towards Los Angeles, struck the Kiryas Joel Synagogue 15 minutes later.

* Does he strike military targets or civilian?
* If he deploys does he use a bomber or wait until the V-2 will be ready to launch in a few months?

Personally, I feel that Hitler would use one as demonstration strike then bluster and threaten to attempt a peace settlement.

Let's say that the Black Plague didn't really have an effect in Europe and as a result, the Renaissance didn't appear. Because of this, Europe's overpopulation and famine delayed many great inventions such as the Caravel(Invented ~1450 C.E.).  
With Europe still in the Middle ages, Asia thrives because of the need for goods over in Europe. Because the Silk Road is too much of a hassle for Asian merchants, China/India develops the Caravel and tries to reach Europe via the Pacific Ocean. Through this, they ""discover"" America and colonize it. Let's say that Asia develops the ""Europe syndrome"" for colonization and seeks Gold and other incentives. How do any of you think this would effect relations with native cultures i.e. how did Asia's mentality view people of other cultures/races compared to America's genocide of Native American tribes? How would a hypothetical China treat its American colonies compared to Great Britain? 
  
I understand this might not be the most logical question, but I've been pondering the instance of a history where Asia parallels Europe in America's colonization.

This got me thinking - Which empire do you believe was most likely to (or even possibly could have) controlled the whole world. I know this is a seriously unlikely 'what if' so ill include a couple of basic conditions to narrow it down.

1. I don't mean every square inch of land on the planet I mean controlling the institutions of countries who had the potential to strike back. For example the British Empire would needed to have controlled countries such as France and Russia but not necessarily Madagascar, central Africa etc.

2. Take the empire at the height of its power and factor in previous territories. So, using the British example again, you can use the notion that they never lost control of America and thus had crown rule in India at the same time as they controlled American colonies.

3. Be as creative as possible - I want to hear some outlandish stories. If you can make an argument for a remote tribe in Iceland I want to hear it. Extra point if you can make a convincing argument for the French! (British joke!)

To me this is a very interesting question, i see three main options;
  
it's totally removed from history and no one ever hears of it - i think this is unlikely for a couple of reasons, Europe would notice if all the Jews suddenly vanished; certainly it's very unlikely that ALL Jews and Jewish allies would be killed, portions of the Jewish population had already been 'set aside' after the failure of the ""Schlußaktion der Berliner Juden"" (Closing Berlin Jew Action), and it's worth noting that a popular and peaceful protest caused this [more here](http://www.rosenstrasse-protest.de/texte/texte_stoltzfus.html) an important exert;
  
&gt;Joseph Goebbels, in his role as the Nazi Party Director for Berlin, decided that the simplest way to end the protest was to release the Jews. Goebbels chose not to forcibly tear Jews from Aryans who clearly risked their lives to stay with their Jewish family members, and rationalized that he would deport the Jews later anyway.  
  
Had they been victorious then either these Jews would be quietly forgotten about or quietly murdered, maybe with their German family... but then those Germans and children of Germans and friends, etc - this would not be an easy situation for the Nazi party desperately trying to maintain power under the pressure of a pax-victorious.  
  
It's almost certain that it'd be a fairly well known event, even those involved are bound to blab - retrospect can be a cruel thing.  
  
So the party would have two options, hold back questions until it's far too late and everyone simply has to shake their head and say 'a terrible thing' much like the most English do about many genocidal wars of aggression we've been involved in on every single continent... Or to say 'we did a good thing!' presumably by downplaying their brutality and emphasizing that they were forced into it - much like how we explain away dropping nukes on cities full of civilians and carpet bombing the inhabitants of Dresden.  
  
The stated desires of the Nazi party was to return all Jews to Palestine once the British Imperialists had been kicked out - personally i think they'd certainly have done that as a great excuse to engage in a protracted war in the middle east, it's unlikely the german people would be up for another war so some excuse would be found; most people over look the fact that Germany pretended to be acting in self difference when it started all it's invasions, even going so far as to stage an aggression on the polish boarder (IIRC?) and this wasn't so much due to international pressure but because propaganda was super important to get the will of the people supporting the cause - so some excuse would be found  ( maybe protecting the jews from muslims, similar to the allied excuse for the last seventy years of middle eastern intervention) 

this would be important of course because controlling the middle east oil was very obviously going to decided who was the economic superpower of the century (in actual history america and britain do this)  
 
I think they'd try to push the line that almost nothing bad happened and what did was for the good of everyone - certainly as the nazi's wouldn't trust the Jewish state with nukes like america did, they'd be a large Nazi occupation in Palestine which presumably would have the Palestinians treated even worse than they are now and would radically change the face of Zionism; Israel as more of a giant prison for Jews  than a self-autonomous Jewish run prison for Palestinians...  for a start the Knesset wouldn't exist and the other Rothschild gifts obviously wouldn't have been made so it'd be a much poorer and less influential nation - and even the presence of successful and vocal Jews in America would be greatly diminished on the world stage, yet of course there would be pressure and statements from around the world and questions inside the german population - now free from the stresses of war and ready to demand liberty and progress, just as any peoples at peace tend to do.  
  
So which is it?  Do they try to deny it, try to pretend it wasn't that bad or shake their head and say 'how terrible, such a shame...'

Over the course of the month, all 7 battleships and the rest of the fleet stationed at Pearl (and the fleet carriers that were pulled away) are prepared for combat and kept on high alert. All airfields on the islands are prepped for the rapid scrambling of fighters and AA emplacements are set up in hundreds of new locations. 24/7 naval and air patrols are maintained so that any ship coming within range of Hawaii is discovered almost immediately.

December 7th, the first wave of Japanese aircraft is discovered 250 miles away from Pearl by a patrol flight. The entire Pacific Fleet launches and swarms of fighters take flight from every airfield in Hawaii. Most of the entire first wave of Japanese aircraft are obliterated before they even make sight of land. The rest are picked off by the numerous AA guns on the islands. All future waves of aircraft meet a similar end. Unbeknownst to the 6 Japanese fleet carriers and their escorts, the USN Pacific Fleet is closing on them rapidly. By the evening of the 7th, US destroyers, cruisers, and naval aircraft have begun to engage the Japanese fleet. The arrival of the US capital ships sends the Japanese fleet fleeing, but it is already too late. The US manages to sink all 6 Japanese carriers (leaving Japan with 0 fleet carriers in their navy) and a bulk of their escorts. Only a few small ships are able to limp back home.

One of these senarios is imagining how the world would be the US was even more powerful than it is now.  

How would this be accomplished?

A)  **Make Canada warmer:**  This is done by making the Hudson Bay deeper  and cutting off its connection with the artic ocean through the Foxe Basin.  As a result, the bay doesn't freeze over in the winter.  The area around the bay becomes warmer and capable of hosting a much larger population, has a more productive climate (Churchill has a similar temperature to say, St. Petersberg or Stockholm), is capable of hosting year round deep water shipping, ect.  The rest of Canada also becomes warmer, with the treeline going north, the northern parts of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec becoming more productive economic areas.  Essentially, Canada becomes a second Russia of sorts.  

B)  **The US controls Canada:**  As in OTL, the French cononize Quebec, the British colonize the Hudson Bay and the original US and the British eventually take Quebec from France.  However, this time, the British don't enact the Quebec act, resulting in Quebec joining the United States.  Of course, the British still control the Hudson bay but the border is disputed (I'm basing this off the Oregon Boundary Dispute) and in the 1840s there is a war which the US wins.  So it ends up controlling the (warmer and ice free) Hudson bay and the rest of Canada  (Alternatively, the US might manage to purchase the rest of Canada from the British).

Alaska however, is not bought up by Stewart in the 1867, which I figured would make things more interesting.  Perhaps Alaska joins the US later (ex: During the Russian Revolution or the breakup of the USSR) but I'll leave that up to you guys. 

The Hudson bay becomes an economic area similar to the Great Lakes region today only larger.  There's much more farmland and more productive land in general and more immigrants (perhaps more Chinese imigrants are let in) massively increasing the total US population. 

C)  **The Southwestern United States** is taken in a manner similar to OTL only the US decides to annex all of Mexico after the Mexican American War.

So by 1900, the US controls ALL of North America except for Alaska, has a much larger and more diverse popluation, much more productive land and a warmer climate.

What does the world look like today?  How does US history (ex: the civil war) play out?  Does the US in this senario become too large to hold together into one country?  What do US politics look like?  How much more powerful is the US really?

But, what I'd like to identify is some common themes that happen to get posted that I think are unlikely.  

I'll start out with one, maybe my favorite. 

**Rome as the capital of a reunited Roman Empire** 

I don't think this happens. The Roman Empire outgrew Rome early. It's a great strategic starting point for their empire, but keep in mind that Rome was a backwater.  Rome wasn't even regional capital (Rome was, like all empires, divided into more manageable regions, diocese, that the Catholic Church modeled its diocese after, named for Diocletian).  Rome just wasn't the economic center of the empire or region.  

The only remaining significance was really the papacy, which the secular authority in Constantinople didn't recognize as any greater than any other patriarch, and that it was the birthplace of the empire itself. 

IMO, neither of those was significant enough to move the capital back.

Everything goes according to plan as Suleiman the Conqueror (as he will be known to the world) has created a lighter, more agile cannon and has accounted for the difficult forest terrain of Central Europe
September-December 1529- The siege begins as Suleiman is able to bring these lightweight cannons to the Austrian's doorstep and use it to rain fire on their ramparts. The Austrians are able to fight valiantly for months however the sheer number and never-give-up attitude of Suleiman carry the Ottomans through the day as they are able to conquer the city and bring the Hapsburg Empire to its knees.

**January 1530**- Suleiman spends a month in the city working out the terms of surrender of the Hapsburgs and they concede all of Austria to the Ottomans provided they make no attempt to invade Spain or any Hapsburg holdings to the west of Austria. Suleiman agrees, however many within his camp, including his son, plead him to continue to march west. Meanwhile in France, the French government is ecstatic that the Hapsburgs have been significantly weakened and no longer threaten compete with them in the east.

**March 1535**-Suleiman had traveled back to Constantinople and ushered in a new golden age of the Ottoman Empire as the Ottomans have been able to gain new wealth by supplying the Western Europeans with strong Eastern European lumber for their trading ships. Suleiman sees the world is changing and also builds a strong navy and asserts himself in a new Atlantic trade.

**August 1535**-The French have been able to defeat a now crippled Hapsburg Empire at the Battle of Cagliari and extract concessions in the form of New World colonies from Hapsburg Spain, particularly the territories of Peru and Rio de La Plata (parts of OTL Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay, Chile and parts of Brazil,) and the French assume direct control of the shipping and mining of precious metals in the New World

1368054792.0,78,self.HistoricalWhatIf,1dyqcy,Could an American empire ever have been successfully created?,quantumshenanigans,101,23,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/1dyqcy/could_an_american_empire_ever_have_been/,"To preface: I'm not asking whether the empire could have been held together for a substantial period or whether it would have been morally right to do so, just whether or not America could have hypothetically conquered the world at a certain point in time in the manner described below or any other.

My thinking is that the two best opportunities to do so would've been immediately after the fall of Berlin in 1945 or immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

First, looking at the end of World War II. I'm not sure if this is urban legend or truth, but I've heard many times that immediately after he took Berlin Patton asked Truman whether or not he wanted him to march on Moscow, saying that the Soviets would not be our allies any longer. Whether or not Patton actually asked him that, I think considering the massive losses that the Russians had suffered and that the offensive would've started in early May meaning we wouldn't have been fighting in Russia in the winter, the Americans could have successfully taken Moscow in 1945. I know that we could never have been able to successfully annex Russia (for lack of a better term); the main point is that we would've kept there from being a massive centralized government that was diametrically opposed to America's interests. 

We also could have intervened on the side of the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War and set up a state friendly to America. Latin America was already within America's sphere of influence, as was Western Europe (and by extension Africa) in the years immediately after WWII. With the Soviet Union neutralized there would've been no real military threat to us, and in with the dropping of the A-bombs we could've cowed many other states into submission. Without the concerted and monumental efforts of the Soviet Union, it's unlikely that any other state could've successfully developed atomic weaponry for at least a couple decades, meaning America would've had a monopoly on that superweapon and could've used it essentially with impunity. 

Over the next couple of decades I see America dominating the planet either through setting up puppet states (what would happen in China), conquering and ruling outright (what would happen in Japan and Russia), or expanding economic, cultural, and military dominance to the extent that some countries, while ostensibly still independent states, would be virtual vassal states of America (what would happen in Western Europe and the some of the Americas). 

As for expanding in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, I think it'd be harder just because other states have the bomb, there's a much more powerful China, and the economies of Europe are just as strong if not stronger than America's. In terms of military might, however, I think America could've still had a shot at setting up a puppet state in the weakened Russia and potentially moved into China as well, who still hadn't reached the heights they have today, for instance. Hopefully economic interests and unwillingness to commit to total war would've kept most other countries out of war against America.

Again, I know that it would've been immensely difficult to actually hold such an empire together, terrorism would have become commonplace, and the administrative and military costs associated with maintaining it would have been astronomical. Basically I'm asking if the scenarios described above would have been possible and viable, or if there has ever been a better scenario for America to essentially come to militarily dominate the entire world to the extent that it could be considered an empire?",,False,,t5_2si7z,False,,,True,t3_1dyqcy,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/1dyqcy/could_an_american_empire_ever_have_been/,

Basically, the Germany military would be way less equipped and funded and the German economy may not have been as strong, yet let's say in this timeline, Germany is able to produce around 25-30 atomic bombs by 1946, and avoided declaring war on anybody (neither has Japan, they just stuck to fighting China), so in 1945 you have a much stronger France and UK, yet a marginally stronger US (as they don't re-arm and could potentially remain in the depression/have low economic growth without military mobilization). 

The only wildcard in this scenario is the USSR: Are they stronger militarily in 1946 as OTL 1941, or do they focus more on their economy? Do they invade Germany preemptively in 1942-1943 and do they still invade Finland/Baltics/Romania/Poland and most importantly, does the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact still get inked without Germany setting its sights on Poland in 1939? 

The main question, which is up for as much interpretation as you want, is simply: What if Germany postponed World War II b(y not spending itself into an economic crisis) until 1946, when it had secretly produced 25-30 working atomic bombs (15-30kT each)?


EDIT: New angle to the question, since the above is a little too complicated and has too many variables: Germany somehow is able to secretly acquire 10 nukes by June 22 1941 (let's assume a number of scientific breakthroughs allow this to be possible) and can manufacture another 2-3 bombs per month for the rest of the war.

Our professor emphasized the importance of the Canal in ensuring the US's economic rise.

My question to you is, what do you think might have happened if the French were the ones controlling the Panama Canal? Do you think it really was that big of a factor in putting the US on the world stage? Or do you think the United States would've become a global power regardless?

According to Wikipedia, he had high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure, possibly caused by years of smoking, and most likely encouraged by the stress of his long presidency.

But what if he had lived a longer and healthier life, perhaps passing away at the ripe old age of 85 in 1967?

If he had been healthy, it's possible first off that Henry Wallace may have remained on the ticket in 1944. Many Democratic insiders knew that whoever was elected Vice President in 1944 would be President before the term was up, seeing FDR's declining health. Wallace was deeply unpopular, and therefore had to go. I personally think Wallace was so unpopular that he would have been dumped even if FDR was healthy, if only to give the Democrats better chances at winning.

Would FDR have made the same decision as Truman to drop the atomic bombs, and at the same time? How would he have dealt with the rest of the issues from 1945-1949 differently from Truman?

In reality, Díaz decided that he was not going to retire but rather allow Francisco Madero, an aristocratic but democratically leaning reformer, to run against him. Although Madero, a landowner, was very similar to Díaz in his ideology, he hoped for other elites in Mexico to rule alongside the president. Ultimately, however, Díaz did not approve of Madero and had him jailed during the election in 1910. Despite what he had formerly said about democracy and change, sameness seemed to be the only reality.

What if Diaz allowed free elections and Mexico became a prosperous, democratic nation in 1910? What would have been the implications for WW1 (Zimmerman Telegram),  WW2 and especially the Cold War.

I'm a little concerned about the trend towards narrative stories as replies that aren't based enough in actual historical probability or argument. It's like we're getting a polished novel describing one of innumerable hypothetical scenarios. It's one single line of a gargantuan decision tree, in a sense.

**For Example**

If someone asked ""What if Gore won the U.S. presidency in 2000?"" the replies we're seeing aren't ""I'd expect substantially more environmental legislation, but he probably would have had issues with Congressional republicans, particularly John Smith, with whom he had a nasty relationship in the 1990s."" 

Instead, the comment reply theme would be ""Week 1: Justice Stevens, tired from media attention based on his decision during during Bush v. Gore, suffers a stroke and retires. Hour 209: President Gore nominates leading law professor Richard Posner to the bench. Hour 211: While smoking a celebratory cigarette, Posner accidentally burns down the taxi stand in front of the Capitol Building. Senator Barbara Boxer thus has no shelter during a rainstorm the next day, and gets wet before an important meeting with the Chinese. She runs home to change, is late to the meeting, and they cancel a trade deal in response to this rudeness."" 

**It's Understandable that this Happens**
I realize this is in part a result of these being entertaining, and the fact that some of our brethren have been wildly successful—and thus set the tone for the subreddit unintentionally—with the above style. 

**Why It Worries Me**

My worry is that with the narrative, unless you have expertise in that topic, it's impossible to distinguish between narrative license, or something that merely *could* have happened but wasn't necessarily likely, or something that was a pretty reasonable expectation. In reading a very entertaining and quite long story yesterday, I ended up completely unsure of what to believe. Maybe more meta comment would have helped (if the poster said ""This is historically possible but not overwhelmingly likely"") or had another subject-matter pro been on hand, they could have debated it a bit. 

As a kinda-sorta spin off from the r/History subreddit, my own impression is that we want to play with hypotheticals in a reasonable way. Without delving into theories of metaphysics and historiography too much here—where I'd surely be buried by you, my esteemed fellow posters and readers—there's too much history to write a hypothetical scenario without identifying where playfulness is happening. 

**Possible Responses**

1. Nothing. Maybe the community doesn't mind if HistoricalWhatIf is more of the novella format. 
1. Ask posters and responders to add a word about how speculative they're looking for answers, scenarios to be. 
1. Set some rough guidelines for commenters that say ""Try to be good about disclosing whether you're stating something many historians in the field would agree with, or if you're making an assumption and on what basis, or if you're going out on a limb."" Just ask for some transparency from commenters, not citations.  
1. Insert your suggestion or derisive comment to me here. 


**tl;dr
Are answers in /r/HistoricalWhatIf taking too much literary license and not being transparent about it? Should we do something?**

* The Soviet Union had yet to launch its attack on Japan, and so one assumption in the report was that the Soviet Union would instead ally with Japan if the Western Allies commenced hostilities.

I imagine a Pacific War in which every contested island would have been a total bloodbath (even more so than in OTL).  Battles would have put each sides warriors' to the absolute limits in terms of military honor and sacrifice.  I figure that even to the point that if one side ran out of ammunition, their honor might have even dictated that they fight with melee weapons in order to keep things honorable.  Each side would have shown absolutely no mercy to POWs, felt that their respective emperors were divine, and felt that the warrior is one of the most noble of societal pursuits.  Each side would have idolized their heroes to the point of celebrity, the battles to the point of legend, and their victory a matter of national duty and pride.

He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962.

Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.

Just by way of intro, I'm a new moderator (a few months now), but I've been fairly quiet (but actively moderating!) until now.

There was a discussion today about reposts, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/14rt6k/meta_reposts_every_single_day/). My conclusion after some discussion was that we need some kind of index of frequently asked questions (in the HistoricalWhatIf sense) and associated discussions. I think the place to do that is in the wiki:  http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/wiki/.

I've set the wiki to be editable by anyone with ~~100~~ **edit: 10** /r/HistoricalWhatIf karma (that's right, karma means something now).

If you have any objection to this treatment of the issue, please voice it now.

It's up to you (the /r/HistoricalWhatIf community) to create this FAQ, and to point people at it when they repost. Of course, I'll put a link in the sidebar once it's reached a useful point. By the way, when you visit the main /r/HistoricalWhatIf page, there's a wiki link at the top.

Lastly, there's still one open question: should reposts be removed? If so, when is it acceptable to re-open discussion or try again? And can you give me any guidance on how similar is too similar? (Because I'm sure people will try to tell me that their submission wasn't exactly the same as the one they appear to be reposting.)

One more thing: my approach here is that I don't want to punish people for reposting. I think we can be courteous about this. In general, if someone posts a question that was asked in the last month or so, they really will appreciate being pointed to a quality earlier discussion on the subject.",,False,,t5_2si7z,1355467736.0,,,True,t3_14s62p,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/14s62p/meta_a_constructive_discussion_about_reposts/,moderator

Shortly after coming to power in 1862, Otto von Bismarck, Helmut von Moltke and Albrecht von Roon die together in a rail accident. Deprived of Bismarck's political skills and Moltke and Roon's military expertise the stalemate between Wilhelm I and the Prussian Diet remains largely unresolved resulting in the military being left unreformed.

The 1864 Schleswig War with Denmark has the same results but in 1866 Prussia and Italy are decisively defeated by Austria. As terms of the peace, Prussia cedes Silesia back to Austria and cedes her's provinces in the Rhineland to form a new Kingdom of Westphalia under a member of the House of Habsburg. Austria forms a 'South German Confederation' with Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and several other smaller states.

War breaks out with France in 1870 but the German states are led by Austria instead of Prussia. Following the collapse of the French forces and the acquisition of Alsace-Lorraine in January of 1871, the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation is redeclared in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles with Franz Joseph I of Austria as Emperor.

* Oct. 9, 1973: Elvis' divorced from Priscilla is finalized.

* Twice during 1973, Elvis overdoses on barbituates, ending up comatose from one of these events. 

* Elvis is hospitalized once in 1973 from abusing Demerol. 

* By the mid 70s, Elvis is seen as a gaudy, bloated crooner singing for middle agers. 

* By his last year of life, 1977, Elvis was frequently semi-coherent and slurred during concerts. 

* His final tour was canceled after he failed to appear at a Baton Rouge, LA stop. (He did honor some concert engagements after this, though).

* Elvis played his last concert June 26, 1977 in Indianapolis.

* On the day of his death, Elvis was supposed to fly to begin another tour. He was discovered lying on his bathroom floor, unresponsive. 

* Elvis had numerous maladies towards the end of his life: hypertension, glaucoma, enlarged colon, enlarged heart and liver damage. 

* The official cause of death was from polypharmacy, and he had 14 different drugs in his system. 

So, let's say his aides found him early enough to provide medical intervention in time, so that Elvis was saved on that August night. What would've happened then? What shape would he have been in?

And a curious thought struck me: what if the Third Punic War never took place?

Let's set the stage.  It's 151 BC.  Carthage is an economic superpower that repaid its ""crushing reparations"" to Rome in no time at all.  They have raised an army to repel a Numidian invasion (which failed miserably, but that's beside the point).  The city of Rome is growing larger and larger, and they are having a hard time keeping all their citizens fed.  They look to Carthage and its territories, and see a rich area that is ripe for plundering.  They also have an excuse to go to war with Carthage - since Numidia was a Roman ally, they can use this ""Punic aggression"" in their favor.  We have Cato the Elder uttering the phrase ""Carthago delenda est"" at every opportunity.  Rome is making demands of Carthage at the point of a sword, trying to provoke them into declaring war.

Now, freeze time for a minute.  What if Rome and Carthage are able to find some way to peacefully co-exist?  Maybe Rome is satisfied with the Carthaginian tributes.  Maybe Carthage decides that war with Rome will destroy them, and they agree to permanently submit to Roman rule.  Maybe a thousand other things happen - the point is, the Third Punic War never begins, and Carthage (as it existed then) is never wiped off the map.

How would this affect the landscape of the Mediterranean as we know it today?  Would Roman aggression during the period of the Empire end up becoming too much, finally destroying the city?  Would their rich lands and economy have spared them that fate, allowing Carthage to remain while the Roman Empire crumbled?  Or would the Vandals have simply wiped them out before turning their attention north to Rome?

Now, imagine that that never happened, and the Archduke somehow made it back to Vienna. How would the world have changed in the following decades? It seems to me that there would still have been a number of incipient crises that could have led to a war. I'll throw out some ideas for the sake of speculation. 

**The German Navy**
The Second Reich was hungry for colonial possessions and was building a fleet to match the Royal Navy. Would they have been able to surpass it, and, if so, when, and what would have happened? At what point does a fleet-in-being need to become a fleet-in-doing?

**The Triple Monarchy**
It's believed (by which I mean I read it somewhere) that it Ferdinand had survived, he would have tried to pacify the Slavic population of the Empire by granting autonomy to the Serbo-Croatian areas (and possibly other Slavic areas) and forming an Austro-Slavo-Hungarian Triple Monarchy. Would this have been been enough for the bulk of the nationalists, or would it have only succeeded in pissing off the Hungarians, too? 

**Russian Industry**
The German leadership was very nervous about projected Russian economic growth -- they thought that it would surpass that of Germany and Austria combined within a few decades and smother their continental hegemony in its cradle. Would they have tried to force a war before the Russians could become unstoppable? 

**Autocracy, Orthodoxy, Nationality**
Assuming that Nicolas outlived Alexei, the crown would have passed to Olga, right? Would she have tried to maintain the policies of her father and grandfather in the face of profound popular discontent? How would it have ended? Could a female monarch have succeeded in introducing fundamental reforms in such an entrenched aristocratic system?

**Irredentia**
The Italians would have still had their eyes on Tyrol and Trieste, but they could never have defeated the German countries alone. How long would they have waited to make their move?

**The Pashas**
The only problem with the Turkification policies in the Ottoman Empire was that Anatolia was full of minorities and no one anywhere else was Turkish. Could the Empire have held together? Would it have faced a succession of military coups? Would the Russians have started a new ""short, victorious war"" to stifle dissent and conquer the Armenian areas, and how would the world have reacted? What would have been the effects of the exploitation of Iraqi oil?

**Elan**
The French would never have stopped plotting to take Alsace-Lorraine back. Would they have precipitated some crisis in which the Germans seemed to be the aggressors once the Russians looked strong enough in the East?

**Japan**
The Japanese wanted a colonial empire but would have had no hope of  taking one if Europe had remained at peace. Would they have tried anyway? Otherwise, how would stifled Japanese militarism have played out?

**World Socialism**
The influence of leftist ideologies like anarchism, socialism, and syndicalism was growing rapidly before WWI. Without the Soviet Union,  how would a the diffuse left-wing movements have continued to develop? Would there have been a revolution somewhere else in the world?

**The Colonies** 
The rise of national consciousness in the European colonies was probably inevitable. What would colonial regimes have looked like without the war?

**The Crash**
Would something like the Great Depression still have occurred? Could it have led to a war or a revolution?

2. Religious practices are based on the need to survive, as listening to elders as young humans and assuming what they say is true increased our chances of survival.

3. Somewhere along the lines, as we didn't have the real answers, some people created the concept of ""gods"" to explain the natural world and this helped to legitimatize what elders were saying, and this was passed on through the collective consciousness. This worldview beat out the reality-based worldview more than 2,000 years ago in Ancient Greece.

Ancient Greece is where the most interesting part of this Historical What-If happens. Certain philosophers like Aristotle were already developing a form of secular philosophy, but it did not manage to overcome the evolutionary power provided to religion. 

**If the Roman Empire and the rest of the Western World had been shaped by these philosophers' quest to understand our reality, instead of Christianity, Islam and organized religion in general, how would the next 2,000 years have played out?**

Sub-questions to think about:

1. Would scientific development have happened much faster?

2. How would politics and borders been impacted?

3. Would the Roman Empire have existed without Christianity, if not, what would have spread instead?

Thank you for reading this, and I can't wait to see what possible outcomes you come up with.

In response, TR bolted from the Republican party to form the Bull Moose party to run on a progressive platform.  In that year, the Democrats nominate New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson as their presidential candidate to run on a platform of ""small government.""  So, let's say Teddy wins in 1912 and gets his third term as President of the United States:

Would WWI have started?  What would America's role be in WWI? Intervention or isolation?

What would further progressive legislation look like under a third Roosevelt term?  Would there be a split in the Democratic or Republican party?  If so, would it be significant enough to effectively kill one of the two major parties? 

How would the Democrats and Republicans react to Roosevelt breaking with Washington's two-term tradition?

How would the 1916 election look like?

And what about the rest of American politics?  Does the Bull Moose party and progressive ideals remain in the political lexicon or do they slip away from people's mind during/after WWI?
