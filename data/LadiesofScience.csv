So, I just wanted to come here and say, it's totally possible and worth it!  I just defended my PhD in Pathology earlier today, and it was an amazing experience!  Not only did I do what I though was an awesome job, but I was the first person in my program to get a PhD (following a massive revamping).  All of the preparation, tears and stress were worth the 1 hour of presenting 5 years of research to my colleagues, and the additional time just talking science with my committee, and actually feeling like I belonged with them.  I don't know what else to say, other than, man, I made it, and it feels good.  So really, never doubt that you can make it, no matter how hard it seems, because you can.  Just keep going for it, and you can become the scientist you have always wanted!

It's pretty awesome, but sadly is in its last year of funding. 

Anyway, my partnered teacher, call him Mr. M, teaches middle school earth science, among other things, and they're currently on a weather unit. Yesterday, the class was going over a worksheet on the atmosphere and air pressure, and one of the questions was ""Where is gravity the strongest?"" with the answer options being ""at the surface of the Earth"" or ""above the surface of the Earth"". Mr. M told the class that the actual answer was at the Earth's core, and I corrected him, saying that, no, gravity is strongest on the surface of the Earth. He's an electrical engineer by trade, and once I explained to him that we were essentially dealing with Gauss' Law for gravitational force, a light bulb went off for him.

Most of the students reacted with ""Ohh, Mr. M, you got schooled!"" and we were all having a good teaching moment in which Mr. M was explaining why he thought what he did, and how learning is something that happens every day. Then one little boy adds ""You were schooled *by a girl*!"" Both Mr. M and I turned to him, and at the same time as I said ""And what does that have to do with anything?"" Mr. M said ""Why does that matter? She knows more about this than I do."" It was another nice learning moment, sent a good message to the kids, and it was nice to know that he has my back.

When I was a first-year grad student, I sent a copy of my personal statement (for a fellowship application) to my adviser. He sent me back edits, and as a general comment he said ""I don't know if you know this, but for what it's worth- reference letters for female candidates often focus on their interpersonal skills, rather than technical ones. It might help to further highlight your technical contributions to counterbalance that."" 

I think it makes a lot of sense. When I think about the excellent male scientists I know, many of them are good at communicating with others. When I think about the excellent female scientists I know, many of them are also good at communicating with others. But I can totally see how, subconsciously, a recommendation could highlight one over the other for different types of students.

In response to this, I've tried to make sure that I am recognized for the work that I've done and my ideas, rather than only positive personality traits (which I genuinely think I have). I was just reminded of this, and thought I would pass it on to the world.

Tried grad school and hated it. Worked as a Chemist in multiple industries and multiple US states. Changed my career a few years ago. When I was trying to change careers, I was always asked, ""The job you are applying for isn't related to Chemistry. Why would you want it?"" I feel like science majors get pigeon-holed. A scientific background teaches problem-solving and analytical thinking. I love my new career, and I couldn't be successful at it without my science degree.

I just wanted to give my fellow female scientists encouragement. I remember all I heard while I was in undergrad was how I should be a PhD Chemist. I read Athena Unbound. I read articles about being a woman in science. What I never actually read was anything about using your science degree to do something other than science.

This isn't an AMA, but I do offer a unique perspective on alternative career paths.

I signed up for research credit and I signed up for what I thought was a light load of classes. However, my classes especially my 2 unit lab class became incredibly time consuming. I couldn't put much time into research as I hoped. 

Recently, my professor called me into his office to talk to me about the research credit. He told me that he doesn't think I spend enough time working in the lab and I explained to him my classes became harder than I expected. Then he went off to a ""rant"" that I was the absolute worst undergraduate student he ever supervised in his group. He tells me that he sees me not doing anything because I haven't give him updates. I tried to explain to him the situation but he told me that he didn't want to hear any excuses. He then told me that he realized that I bother a lot of the grad students for help and I'm basically wasting everyone's time. He called me stupid and said that this research project is easy. It also doesn't help that early on, my grad student that I used to work under told the professor about all my ""mistakes"" in lab and how I'm really bothersome. My professor thinks I don't do anything in the lab. He says that the grad student does all the work for me, which is not true at all! I tried to explain him my side and situation but he absolutely refused to hear me out. 

He tells me I'm not very communicative and I tried to explain to him that every time I asked him for help. He ignores me and tells me to figure it out myself. I tried to show him my solutions and ideas, but he just tells me it's wrong. I immediately feel discourage in contacting him with my questions. But during our meeting, he tells me that I need to ask him questions that I don't understand but I cannot ask stupid questions. So, I stopped asking questions because I didn't know if it was stupid it or not. Basically, I accidentally stopped contacting him until I got results. I know it's my fault for not communicating with him enough, but sometimes he often ignores me  when I ask him for help or an appointment to meet with him, so I can't help but feel discourage contacting him.

Major wall of text.",Vic_n_Ven,48,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/yrvbo/a_bad_year_and_an_awful_mentor_or_why_i_created/,"Tl;dr: In 2011 I had a bout with Qualifying Examinations, PTSD, my best friend got cancer, I got depressed and my boss fired me from my PhD project and his lab. I was given 4 months to recover from major depression, then he failed me, making me ineligible to stay in my department. He sabotaged my reputation in my department and to my committee, and refused to cut me any kind of slack for a documented medical condition. Don’t trust that your mentor always has your best interests in mind. 

_________________________________________
2011 was the year of the bastard for me-- personally, psychologically and professionally.  My  second year of Grad school (PhD program in a BioScience), Qualifying Examinations about to begin, my best guy friend (for whom I may have some very strong feelings) in an insanely rough patch with his (now-ex) girlfriend and a time bomb goes off in my head. I unraveled a decade-old mystery about myself one evening, 8 days before Quals began. Serial sexual abuse when I was 4-8. Cue the PTSD. I sought a therapist immediately, but I was in no way ready to deal with this “THING”. I basically told to help me keep my shit together until May, so I could pass. She did so, and I’ve worked through a tremendous amount of very hard stuff since. This was not to be the only blow 2011 dealt me.  4 weeks later, my car was totaled. A week later, best friend and his GF break up. I pass Quals, he’s getting along and now it is June. Time for things to calm down, yes? 
Nope. 
Enter: my former advisor. The short version: He treats grad students like employees, he micromanages to the nth degree and is totally unsympathetic to health issues and real-life problems.  My project was DIFFICULT. It was the lab orphan- all troubleshooting, optimizing, intellectual drive, etc. was on me. I was expected to work on a timetable, however, that was appropriate for a well-vetted project. Sucks for me? Yeah. 
So, because I was trying to keep my psychological life from imploding and trying to pass Quals, I spent a little less time and had less focus in lab than he would have liked. So after I pass Quals (written exam? “Decent”, oral exam? “You could’ve done better.”) I get chewed out for not being productive. This hurts like hell. I haven’t told him what’s going on in the rest of my life, but he’s made it clear he wouldn’t care anyway. At this point, my anxiety is off the charts and (in hindsight) I’m starting to move into survival mode (read: my first major depression episode). 

Enter the final straw. In July, as I’m about to fly home for a vacation, my best friend calls, and comes over.  He has found a lump, a big one, in his liver. He’s just come from the doctor and a CT scan, which confirms its presence there. Holy fuck.  So. Away I go to home, and we’re in touch every day, but the waiting is awful. I return, he schedules a biopsy. I drive him to and from. And I wait. And a couple days later he calls to tell me they want him to come back in to receive his diagnosis. I know what this means, he knows. But we hope it is benign. Hope it is just a surgery consult. 
NOPE. Cancer. Liver cancer. Again, Holy fuck. 
So a surgery date is set. He and I and our 2 best friends are spending damn near every waking/non-working hour together.  
In lab, I am beginning to see and trying to understand why I feel so much dumber, and why my boss is being so cold to me, and why things don’t seem to work consistently. Weeks and weeks of helping my friend, his mother, being a source of support and strength.  He recovers. In October, he decides to move cross country, and because I love him and I want what is best for him, I basically pack him and shove his ass out of state.  It’s extremely painful and I crash hard when he’s gone. 10 months of insanity. Surely I can start working on myself, getting my shit back together now.
Enter November. I decide I need to go home for a few days. I coordinate a slightly longer trip so Besty and I overlap a day or two (he wants to meet my friends and family, his family wants to meet me).  2 days before I leave my boss (who at this point, hasn’t said a kind word to me in months. Has said hardly any words in fact and under whose gaze I feel tiny and stupid and entirely worthless) sends me an email. 
Considering 1) my mediocrity as a student 2) my modest progress and 3) my inability to do things right, consistently, I shouldn’t be going on vacation. Turns out, he’s been telling my committee I’m immature, lazy and not smart or dedicated enough for graduate work since JULY. So, he tells me he is calling a committee meeting in “the hope they can straighten you out.” I am devastated. I was just getting a grip on things being off. WAY off. I’m losing weight, not sleeping, can’t focus. Depression, right? Too bad it’s so tough to see when you’re way down in that hole.  So, an extremely uncomfortable few weeks pass. The committee meeting convenes. I’m on 2 Xanax at this point and my pulse is still +16 bpm and I’m shaking, I’m so anxious. 
They send me out of the room
They call me back in, I present my data/prject. 
They send me out again.
Unbeknownst to me, the first time I was sent out of the room, Boss Man did an absolute hatchet job on me. Tried to convince my committee to expel me.  They settled for putting me on probation, but he walked in there with the full intention of booting me. MY MENTOR. So, post getting my ass chewed by the committee, the room clears and I sit down on the floor and just come apart. Completely.  Crying, wanting to throw up, crying. I feel awful. Because it feels like no one has my back, I dont know what went wrong and in my head, there’s no way I’m capable of fixing it, or fixing anything and I should just quit. One of my committee members comes back (thank god) and she asks me some questions, as a physician. And she tells me I am clearly suffering from major depression.  Holy shit. I AM! I’m not dumber, or lazy, or worthless, I’m sick. The committee says I must do 3 things before the next meeting. BossMan decides this translates as 12. He draws up contractual guidelines, I sign them, he assures me he’ll share them with the committee. By March, he’ll have the paperwork to fail me for a second semester signed and ready to turn in, AND the committee never saw them. But that’s in the future. 

In the space of 2 weeks, I start meds, start seeing my shrink weekly (since I can do it openly, now.
Boss Man is unimpressed. He complies publicly with my treatment because he is forced to. He won’t, however, cut me any slack on the science. In his eyes, I continue to fail. I’m throwing every shred of myself into not failing out and into getting healthy. My work is sub-par. But I show up every day, and I TRY. And then, I start to get traction. I have a happy couple of minutes. I stop answering “How are you” with a short “I’m still breathing”.  My advocate committee member acts as go between to me and my advisor, because he can’t or won’t believe that I won’t magically be better in 8 weeks. 

He refuses  to give me more help and oversight, to set more concrete goals, or to help me check my work. Refuses. “I’m not your parent.” Then he tries to “ground” me from school events. What the fuck? I am (on multiple occasions) crying in his office, telling him it’s a really bad day, it’s really bad week, please, please give me some help. Nope. He “can’t take the medical condition into account” when evaluating my progress. He clearly sees it as a character flaw. I’m working 60 hours a week because I’m terrified that I’m not working enough, or hard enough. Feedback? Negative to absent.  I get the 3 things the committee wanted done finished up. I start prepping for my first seminar. Below my radar, BM has already told my committee I’m failing to meet expectations
In the second week of May, as preparation for my student seminar, I give a practice run through to my lab. It’s good. There is a lot of data. I deliver my practice. And my boss walks out. I get trainwrecked by a major panic attack, then I go seek my Advocate.  I tell her what happened. She says she‘ll speak to him, and sends me outside to sit under a tree and calm down. I decide I have to get out of this guy’s lab. Post-haste. In fact, 4 months ago would have been great. I find out, in the aftermath, that the same day, he emailed my committee and told them that my data shouldn’t be trusted, and I knew neither what I was talking about nor what I was doing. 

BossMan calls and wants a meeting. We have a meeting. He fires me, fails me for a second semester and says it’s for non-performance and an utter failure to meet “reasonable expectations”. He says he expects me to be expelled. I go to the dean, dean offers a deal: take a leave of absence, get healthy, come back and finish a masters and then switch departments and do a PhD with a different mentor. I accept. I tell BossMan the plan, he calls a committee meeting (to which he brings another long list of my individual faults and failures). He’s already canceled my seminar. My committee is doesn’t want to see my data because he’s already told them I’ve failed).  They give the plan an OK, and suddenly, I have the summer off. He tells I’m just not cut out for this, my colleagues made it through fine, some people just don’t have the mental rigor for this. On and on and on and on. He had me believing his bullshit, too. I felt broken, stupid and worthless. Just crushed. So I take my leave, I return, he acts like nothing bad or distasteful (or illegal??) has happened. I’m working on my MS now.  I’m better. Meds + therapy +rest+ NOT constantly being told I’m mediocre and incapable has done wonders. 

This is why I started this group and then almost immediately vanished. A huge thanks to Case_Protag for picking up in my place. Anyway, I just wanted to get my story out there. As part catharsis and part warning. I love this group. Thanks for listening.

If you're already in your chosen field, where do you work, what do you do and how do you like it? What does your field bring to your life that you think many women miss out on? And what would YOU like to see on this subreddit.

Let's figure out who we all are and what we're looking for so we can enjoy this subreddit to the fullest.

I suppose I should start, since I'm asking this of others. I'm currently in school, majoring in Astrophysics. I knew I was bound for the stars back when I was like seven or so and my grandpa bought be a cheap little 4 inch Newtonian telescope. I remember seeing the moon through my very own telescope for the first time and realizing that there was no way I was destined to keep my feet on this planet. I currently work with the Astronomy Dept at my school doing community outreach lectures. (I give talks to college kids, high school kids and elementary school kids... trying to get them all into my field.) And I would love for this reddit to be filled with updates, questions, curiosities, thoughts that deserve discussion as well as a plethora of articles and the like.

Firstly, I want to thank everyone in this sub for being supportive, informative, and helpful. I have posted here before about PhD difficulties, and you were all immensely helpful. 

After a lot of soul-searching and discussion with my supervisor, my colleagues, my careers advisor, and therapist, I have realised that academia is not for me and, ultimately, I am unlikely to be able to complete my PhD. Given this realization, it makes more sense to cut my losses early (I am just under 1 year in) and move on to a career that will be more rewarding. I absolutely love talking about science and explaining difficult concepts in fun &amp; simple ways, so I think my calling lies in scientific outreach/communication and public engagement.

I wanted to know if any of you ladies have (or have a friend who has) quit a PhD? If so, did you regret it or not? Why? Do you have any advice for someone who is on the verge of quitting?

I have a fairytale ending after feeling sorry for myself since March! 
My parents gave me an old car as delayed graduation present, so I could now get myself to interviews efficiently. Last week, the PI for my old volunteer position e-mailed me out of the blue! As it turns out, he has a bit of extra grant money to burn during summer, and wanted someone who already knew the lab tasks and personnel dynamics. After that, the ball kept rolling. A new faculty member that I interviewed with in February finally got back to me with concrete numbers, and a year long appointment as a lab tech with administrative responsibilities! 

I have a job! I have concrete plans! I will produce papers! It's everything I could could have hoped for.

Tips for handling all of this?",PurplePhysics,41,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1cp7aj/i_got_into_grad_school_but_now_im_freaking_out/,"So I somehow managed to get in to my top choice of graduate school for electrical engineering (physics undergrad)! But, ever since I started hearing back from grad schools, I've felt that I didn't actually deserve to and that I've somehow managed to fake my way through school/research. People also keep telling me that being a woman has been a major factor in getting in these schools. I'm sure there's truth in there since I am certainly in the minority, but I would really like to think my skills/hard work were the largest factor. I also spoke with advisors before I applied, and it seems that I would not have gotten in had I not spoken with them beforehand based on where I did and didn't get in. 

Anyways, this has led me to start freaking out and thinking that I'll fail miserably once I actually start classes and research. I'm worried about not being able to do the classwork, not knowing what to do in the lab, and not having friends around for support. 

I also turned down an offer at a higher ranked school (top 5 vs top 15), and that's also been worrying me. The research at my chosen institution interests me more, and the grad students seem less stressed though. 

But if any of you lady scientists have been through this and have any tips on how to transition into graduate school, I would be so grateful.

I was put under the mentorship of a grad student in the lab. I admired her a lot, and wanted to impress her and the P.I. However, it was apparent early on that me and this grad student clashed in personality. This was pretty intimidating, and I made a lot of mistakes as I was learning the ropes. One month in, this grad student took me aside (after a seminar with a lot of people around) and fired me. She told me that I wasn't picking up on things that were important, and that I was basically jeopardizing the project. 

Obviously this was very difficult to hear. I feel extremely embarrased. People who know this P.I. personally wrote me letters of recommendation when I applied, and I don't know what to tell them about what happened. I haven't gotten paid yet for the month I was working, and I don't know if my fellowship will be cut off. I am in a foreign country, which makes the whole thing stickier. 


I contacted another P.I. to ask if I could work with her for the remainder of my time here, and she agreed.

I'm writing the series for a lot of reasons, but mostly because I feel that more women need to go into science and a way to encourage that is to put more female characters who are in science, but also approachable, understandable and compelling into the media-sphere--and to make it sexy, too. There are a few tv shows doing this (Bones, NCIS, Rizzoli &amp; Isles) but not enough ""accessible"" fiction. 

Female scientists have been for too long portrayed as nerdy, sexless, unattractive robots. Smart girls, for that matter, are seen as the same. Romance is, granted, considered a trashy form of fiction, but it has also been a cultural touchstone, reflecting expectations for the role of women not only in romantic relationships, but in society. To create characters who have careers in science, who are passionate about science (and hunky, broad shouldered men with great hair, natch), and to introduce topics in science (in very basic language) may help move the cultural perspective even just a skosh. 

I could go on and on, and certainly will if anyone asks, but for now, I have some questions of my own that will help me get this done. 

The first character is a biochemist, the second a cryptographer, etc. I am doing a round of edits for the first book and need a perspective on what biochemistry labs look like--how do they run? How many people work in them? What are their roles? Pretty empirical stuff, yes.

My advisor has been on Sabbatical in New Zealand (we're in the US) for the last six months.  Communication has been difficult.  Things have slid.  Our technician and lab manager are LAZY.  They both show up late/leave early/take undeclared days off/fuck around all day.  They are generally unsupportive and resentful when I ask for their help or assign them a task.  

Lately, this has escalated to the point that I am regularly leaving work in tears.  They're fucking bullies, folks.  They let me know whenever and however they can that they don't respect me, my research, my abilities as a grad student, my relationship with my SO, etc.  It's killing me.  The worst part is that their actions are just subtle enough that they're relatively noticeable unless you're really paying attention--but truly devastating to me.  All the attempts I've made to express my discomfort to them have been brushed off as overreactions and one-time-only events.

My advisor finally returns next Wednesday.  I'm hoping that things will simply change when he returns.  He's 100% awesome and very supportive.  I'm afraid to take any accusations of hostile work environment or whatever to him because it's hard for me to pull concrete examples that sound significant--it's more like a ton of tiny insults to my person.

EDIT:

To clarify, I am 23.  I was the lab technician for 1.5 years while I was finishing my undergraduate degree at a different school.  I started my MS with this lab last May.  I am the newest graduate student, but I have been in the lab for a total of 2.5 years.  I have at least one more year before I will finish my MS.

The other graduate student is a PhD candidate.  He is 25.  He entered the lab at the same time I became the technician, 2.5 years ago.

There used to be four other graduate students (2 MS, 2 PhD), but they have all finished their degrees in the 2.5 years I have been here.

The lab technician used to be our undergraduate student worker.  He is 28.  He started working as our student worker in June 2011, but graduated with his BS in December.  We chose to keep him on as a technician, starting in January.  He has been in the lab for a total of less than one year.

I would just like to say to you all: thank you SO much for participating in this community. I call 1300 subscribers in 10 months damn good. I created it in the hope that it would attract exactly this kind of community and these kinds of discussions. Thank you all so much for your participation, your willingness to share and the generally friendly and supportive tone of this community. My own participation has been somewhat limited up to this point (my project/life/mentor went a liiiitle crazy). But I'm very interested in personalizing and adapting our community.

Here is the catch: I know absolutely NOTHING about the inner workings of the redditmachine. There has been a request for flair being added- I love the idea, I have no idea how to do it.

Additionally, I would  like to add another mod (Preferably a redditmachine/computermachine type). So, if you want to nominate a fellow user, or yourself, please PM me.

Finally, one of your Scientists has proposed a reverse AMA of sorts- basically, we'd like to take a survey of both what field you're in and what level in your career you are currently in. Thoughts?

1329401970.0,32,self.LadiesofScience,psb2h,Physics PhD student with baby panic and lack of someone to talk to,troixetoiles,33,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/psb2h/physics_phd_student_with_baby_panic_and_lack_of/,"Hey lady scientists!

Here's the tl;dr for the upcoming wall of text: Due to reading lots of articles about women in STEM, I'm having baby panics. I have a lack of peers/mentors to talk about this with, so I'm turning to you.

So lately I've been reading a lot of articles about women in STEM academic careers, and more specifically women in physics careers, and how women who want to have a family are severely disadvantaged in these career paths and mostly leave academia. Also, I'm in my last year or so of getting my PhD, so I've been thinking a lot about where I will end up after graduating. (Honestly, I don't think becoming a physics professor at a research university is for me. I have more of a passion for education and outreach, so I would love to work at a small college or with younger students.)

Coupling these two facts has lead me to start having what I call ""baby panics."" I'm not talking ""baby craziers"" where I want to make a baby right here, right now. But I am trying to visualize where I might end up in the next few career steps I take and every time I do, I get this horrible feeling that I will either never get to have a kid of have to give up my identity as a scienctist/potential educator to have one. I feel this way because I will most likely be looking at ""temporary"" positions after getting my PhD. This might be a post-doc or a science policy fellowship, or I've been considering doing an accelerated education masters aimed at people with a science background. And after I finish any of those, where ever I end up, I will be starting from the beginning again. So it seems like if I want to have a kid, I'm looking at several years down the line until I am at a stable postion (hopefully with health insurance) where I will be able to take leave to have a kid.

Now all of this worrying is about a hypothetical situation so far. I've talked to one post-doc from another field (one with more women) who had a good boss who was accommodating for her having a kid. But other than that, I really don't know anyone who has gone through this experience. Most of my science friends have yet to get married and the ones that have aren't making kids a priority. And none of the women professors in my department have had kids, which actually depresses me a little bit, because it seems to reinforce the fact that having a family is incompatible with being a woman physicist.

Overall, I doubt my career will lead me to become a professor in a university requiring a focus on research. I am just more passionate about education.  But even then, I feel like having a kid will either stall me out or that there won't be time for it to be done. But personally, I would rather have kids at a younger age so I would like to start thinking about having them in the next few years (I'm 26 right now). I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Maybe to just hear stories of how you did things or are planning to do things. Or maybe I'm over-thinking everything or being unrealistically pessimistic about having kids while being a post-doc or a teacher or a researcher. I just don't want to feel so mixed up and worried about this part of my life, because I know I want a family, but I don't want to feel like I'm throwing my life away to do so.",,False,,t5_2sg5m,False,,,True,t3_psb2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/psb2h/physics_phd_student_with_baby_panic_and_lack_of/,

Help?,Dungeonjumper,32,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1aanpl/i_am_graduating_this_semester_but_have_no_plans/,"Hello ladies - I hope this isn't too long and rambly, but I would love some advice.

I'm about to graduate with a BS in Biochem and I see myself as, at most, an overwhelmingly average student. I am barely a 3.0 student with an uninspired research project and hardly any good references/relationships with the science faculty. I had always wanted to go to grad school, but I missed this year's round of applications because I genuinely feel incompetent. And I have no plans for my future - every time I start to look at potential internships, jobs, etc. those feelings come rushing back and I get nowhere.

My research experience is very discouraging to me. I can't tell if it's the environment or my skill level that is bringing me down. Basically, I joined the lab as a junior and got stuck with a dead-end project that was eventually scrapped. Now I have a freshman-level project using biochemical techniques to supplement my grad student's data, but our data isn't matching up and I feel like everyone (including myself) is highly questioning my research abilities. In comparison to my peers, who have all produced good data, I am essentially useless to the lab.

Another thing is that I moved here a couple years ago, and genuinely cannot stand this geographical region. And while I would love to move away, my boyfriend of 8 years is starting a business here. So having to choose between a long-term relationship and my location is also a downer. But that is for another topic.

I'm just freaking out a bit. I get that I'm not an idiot, and many people are under the impression that I am a good (albeit lazy) student. But I still don't have the confidence I need to apply to any programs after I graduate, or even to LOOK at these programs. I know I can't keep putting this off though. How do I get over this?",,False,,t5_2sg5m,False,,,True,t3_1aanpl,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1aanpl/i_am_graduating_this_semester_but_have_no_plans/,

To be frank, the course is just way above my level of preparation.  The pace of the course is too fast for me because it assumes a certain level of mathematical fluency and maturity, and I spend upwards of 30 hours a week doing the homework because the insights for the proofs come very slowly to me.  The professor is understanding and accommodating, but there are eight students registered to take this course, and I am the only woman.  

Every time I have to ask a question in class or it otherwise becomes painfully obvious that I'm falling behind, I just feel so guilty for reinforcing the stereotype that women are bad at math.  It's so difficult to be THAT woman - the one that doesn't get it and doesn't belong.  I know there are tons of smart women who rock at mathematics, but I'm not one of them.  I want so badly to be one of them and to prove to everyone in the course and to the professor that women can do it, but I just can't.  Instead, I feel like I'm just making everything worse by being here.

Now, none of these feelings are going to cause me to drop the course or otherwise stop trying.  I do enjoy genuinely every lecture, and the material is very helpful for my research, even if it's more theoretical than applied.  I have strong skills in areas more related to my actual field, so I don't feel like a failure in general.  It's just such a heavy burden to feel like there's a possibility some people in the class could be forming opinions about all females (including you lovely ladies) on the basis of my performance, and it feels like I'm letting you down.

I think I should add - none of my fellow students have ever been rude or judging in any way towards me, so none of these feelings are driven by them.  I think a lot of this guilt is all in my head, and there's a sane part of me that knows that no one has appointed me the frontwoman for all ladies of science, so it's not really my place to be personally responsible for how women in science are perceived.  I was just wondering if anyone else here has ever felt this added pressure.

(x-post to 2xC),troixetoiles,36,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/znmik/what_do_you_ladies_think_of_the_princess/,"[So I just say this article on Jezebel negatively reporting on the ""Princess Scientist"" trend.](http://jezebel.com/5941531/princess-scientist-trend-actually-discouraging-girls-from-pursuing-science). And it got me kind of angry. I actually am a proponent for scientific approaches like this when it comes to young girls (like pre-school to early elementary school). Why? Because due to a lot of reasons that I won't discuss here, many girls that age (for better or for worse) are into ""girly/princessy"" stuff. But as they are, they grow up, grow out of it, and become more secure and independent. So why not use their interests to get them hooked on science at a young age and then their perceptions and interests in science can grow and mature with them?

Also, I don't see the Princess Scientist as pandering to this age group. I see her as someone working against the stereotypes of who can be a scientist. I myself am a physicist and I take pride is being the type of person who makes you think twice when it comes to who can be a physicist. Hell, my job has made me more feminine and outgoing because I enjoy representing myself in a way that many outside science see as positive (as opposed to frumpy or socially awkward). I think that by playing up their femininity for young audiences people like Dr. Erika are showing an audience that science isn't just for boys (go to a toy store and you will see most science toys are marketing this way) and that you don't have to give up things you may love about being a girl/lady/woman to be a successful scientist.

Also, I totally want to be a Princess Scientist so I can wear fancy gowns all day.

Edit: I forgot to add this part of my gripe: When I grew up all the prominent science shows were hosted by kind of nerdy men (Bill Nye, Mr. Wizard, Beakman's World). Hosts like these only reinforce the common stereotype of who scientists are.

It has been an amazing experience so far. I am constantly learning, and I am treated more like an analyst than an intern or assistant. I find my work very fun, despite being mentally **and** physically exhausting, and the days pass quickly. I'm never bored or stuck feeling like the day is dragging on.

I love science, and always have. I'm not sure what I want to major in or where I want to go in life. I study science because I enjoy it. I'm currently a biology major, working in a chemistry lab, but have no idea what I want to study (I declared biology because being ""undeclared"" bothered me, and this way I get to take a wide range of science classes). 

I want to make a comfortable living as I progress in life. My parents gave me and our siblings great opportunities while raising us in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. They can afford to help me attend my (pricey) dream school. My family is definitely considering ""upper-middle class"".

There are four experiments per quarter and a different TA assigned to each experiment. There are four people per group that each do one lab a week and then we get two weeks off to all huddle in corners and write our lab reports and cry about why we shouldn't have waited. 

Most groups, including mine, have three boys and one girl. Two of the TAs are male and two are female. I've always considered myself a friendly balanced person and I didn't have trouble getting along with anyone while the experiments were going on. But I've run into some frustrating sexism while trying to write these damn lab reports. 

I tried to meet with one of the (male) TAs to discuss calculations. It was horrible. He repeatedly scolded me on how he wasn't going to do the work for me, how he was busy this week, and how I just needed to sit down with my group and work things out. My group is not very interested in meeting and I had already tried this but at that point I wanted to just get away.

I am a recent graduate in engineering. Well, I graduated last spring, went to grad school and then dropped out because funding fell through and I couldn't afford it. But that's another story. 

I've been looking for work in my field. I've participated in some prestigious projects, been recognized for them and really, really love my field. I've had internships in both industry and the government, and have done lab research. I have work experience outside of my field (inlcuding customer service) and have extensive volunteer work in my industry and outside of that too. But I feel like none of that matters because of my appearance. 

Yes, it's male dominated but I fear that the way people treat me isn't  because I'm female, but because I have a few rather 'extreme' facial piercings. That is, both my ears are stretched to 1"" and each nostril to 8ga, or about 3.3 mm. I wear plain black jewelry in them, and I feel that they are very understated and elegant. 

After graduation, I cleaned up: I learned to apply makeup, dress like an adult and even got my first professional hair cut. I had convinced myself that these, plus my impressive resume and passion would make people over look the piercings. 

I finally admitted to myself that they won't. This past fall, I went to a conference in the southern US (I'm Canadian) and they didn't really even bother to try and hold back the staring and contempt. The people who make decisions still aren't going to want to take a chance on a new hire who has gone out of her way to make herself look physically different in a way that isn't considered professional. 

So, I took out my nose rings today. I know it's the right decision. I just feel like I'm ""selling out"" a bit and betraying myself. 

Have any of you ladies had to make tough choices about how you present yourself to further your careers? I'd love to feel like I'm not alone here :)

However, having completed one project, I feel completely lost. I have a few follow-up ideas based on that work, but they are seasonal (so I will do them in Autumn). Now it is prime season for field work, and my supervisor and co-sup keep suggesting I do something soon- but neither of them have told me what. I know as a PhD student it is my job to come up with projects, but I don't feel like I have the experience or knowledge necessary to come up with good ideas.

Regardless, I came up with as many ideas as possible and made a document breaking each one up into mini-projects. I asked myt supervisor which idea was the most interesting/practical/worthwhile to pursure, but he won't give me a clear answer. He said it's up to me to pick one, but every time I do he chastises the one I've picked and points out its flaws (it's been done, it's not interesting, it would take too long/be too expensive, it's too far a leap from your current work).

I'm a first year phd student, and my fashion has been described as ""quirky business casual."" I developed it before entering, and my style is mainly composed of knee length skirts, blouses, cardigans, and 2-3 inch heels. My style is my hobby, and I spend a lot of time shopping sales, thrifting, and tailoring/sewing my own clothing to keep within my grad school stipend (and for fun!) It makes me feel better about myself to dress the way that I do, and at this point these are the only clothes I own. 

However, I have read multiple times on science reddits that ""overdressing can hold you back in science."" This is worrisome to me, as I am certainly the most ""dressed up"" in my cohort. 

I have taken this to heart and attempted to ""dress down"" slightly: I wear have a couple loose cardigans and invested in a few t-shirts for the summer, but considering how much love and effort I put into my wardrobe it is difficult for me to invest in purposefully casual pieces that I ultimately do not enjoy. This is my hobby, my art, if I had to give up my science (my ultimate passion and career) I would become a dressmaker, in all honesty. But I worry postdocs and other students think I am vain, shallow, or ""riding on my looks to get ahead.""

Is this something I should be concerned about? People have made comments on my dress, and they have been mostly positive, but one postdoc in particular has made multiple comments about how ""you'll learn to wear flat shoes soon"" and I find that worrisome.

For the record, my dress does not violate the safety standards, on the occasions I work with harsh chemicals I wear jeans and ankle boots, and I wear my labcoat more often than the many of my lab mates. I am in the life sciences (women dominant at the student level), and usually the biggest hazard is blood on my labcoat. 

I am a very goal-minded person, and one day would like to run my own lab, either in an academic, industry, or government setting. Thus, I focus on details, such as who I have asked to be on my committee (those who have ties to labs I want to postdoc in), out-of-academia skills I strive for (teamwork, industry networking, drug-design collaboration, writing for laymen), as well as goal-focused academic progress of course. 

I am looking for honest opinions here: is my overdressing a potential hazard for my career? If it is, I will put my love aside and invest in a pair of flat shoes and more casual tops for the work day (I really hate pants but may buy another pair of jeans). I know I am dressing a little out of the culture, and want to keep everything in mind so I can more efficiently achieve my goal. I do not want to be passed up for collaborations or recommendations because of my dress.

Bosses seem hostile after negotiations.,PostdocAdvice,30,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1e0iuy/i_need_some_advice_about_a_postdoc_job/,"So, I recently got offered a split industrial academic postdoc, and while the research opportunity is great, the pay is not. It's in a very expensive city, and I was having a hard time putting together a budget. I had been in contact with one of their postdocs who left during the time between my initial contact and formal interviews. She was in my opinion, totally honest and helpful. She let me know that the salary I was offered was the same as hers four years ago and that it's hard on a single person to make it work. She, and several of my friends and both of my PI's suggested that I negotiate for perks or pay or both. So I did. And that's where it got messy. 

The guy I interviewed with is very brash with his words, and so in the two phone calls I've had since the offer, the first one was more or less trying to tell me that I'd be ok living on the pay. The second, where I talked to him about the things I felt I'd need to be comfortable living there, I mentioned that this girl had said that her salary was the same as my offer and that it was tight for her. I asked for travel support and work from home time, which he was fine with giving me, but then when we started talking about pay, he told me he'd have to ask his boss but it wasn't likely i'd see an increase. Ok, well at least I tried. We chat a bit more and he again mentions that he'll have to talk to the head of the department about pay, and that I am ""a pain in the ass"". Oh. Nice. So I feel like a shitty person for trying to negotiate a living wage. I get off the phone and talk to some friends and try not to feel like a pile of shit for inconveniencing someone. 

Skip to several hours later. 11pm, I get an email from the girl helping me. She, who no longer works at the company, got a furious email from the head of the department bitching her out for talking to me and wants to talk to me on the phone. So we have a phone call. She asked what exactly I said, and so I reiterated ""I said that you let me know you had lived on that exact salary and that it was tight for a single person in this city"" Ok. That's all. She's trying to salvage her contacts there, and i'm apologizing profusely for getting her into trouble, and there's a good amount of shitty feelings all around. 
So I quit work at 11:45 and have a beer and feel bad. What kind of environment am I going to be walking into? My direct PI has called me a pain in the ass and the head boss hunts down former employees to yell at them about helping incoming students? What the fuck? Is this normal? 

tl:dr, Tried to negotiate for better pay at an industrial postdoc.

(This is also why I try to avoid going home.) 

I got a call from my dad today, and apparently my mom thinks that I should be a doctor instead of a scientist because I work hard, but I don't come up with new ideas. This definitely threw me for a loop. In university, I tend to get compliments for coming up with solutions and for working hard! Personally, I also think that the working hard part has also given me a reasonably good (for a student) arsenal of ways to get things to work. If anything, I suffer from not sitting at the problem long enough to see solution, but that is something I remind myself to do, and it's immensely helpful to have friends and teammates who are willing to sit with me while I look for a solution.

But it was still distressing to hear that my mother thinks that I don't come up with nearly as many new things as my little (elementary-school-age) brother. 

I'm of two minds about what to do with this:

1) Maybe I'm really not creative enough and should try to do something else that I would enjoy, e.g. apply for medical school after gap year.

2) I also know that I feel a lot more comfortable and less afraid now than when I was younger. My parents hit me and yelled at me for ridiculous things (a representative incidence below). I spent freshman year in terror of adults, until I realized that I was pretty much an adult too, and they wouldn't slap me if I did something wrong. Not being afraid to make too much noise while walking, showing 'disrespect',' or forgetting something on a looong list of chores, etc. etc. meant that I was always happier at school than at home, and I'm much more at ease now. I'm actually surprised by what my mother said, because I have generally been praised (and cursed -- after the calculator-virus debacle) for creativity. I personally feel I do have a chance at research. 

**tl;dr** I'm annoyed that something my (previously abusive) mother has said can cause me to question if I'm ""creative enough"" for research. But at the same time, now the box has been opened. How to tell if anyone is ""creative enough "" for research? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Story: For example, I still have a scar from when my mother lost it one day because my baby sister was crying (she was tired and carsick or something, babies can't talk, so idk) and my mother took the car window ice-scraper stick and repeatedly smashed the sharp end into my thigh. Thank god I was wearing jeans, so I only had a humongous bruise. But I tried to push her away, and she it my hand, so I have a half-inch scar between my fourth and fifth fingers. I was pretty distraught, because it hurt and I was a competitive pianist at the time, and super protective of my hands. Of course then my parents yell at me about how I deserved it for getting my hands in the way. I think that moment pretty much catalyzed my desire to work really, really hard for a college scholarship really, really far from home and then cut off my family for good. For those years, I just focused on not making my parents mad enough to be homeless (because that would suck so much), and even then, my parents would 'forget' that I indeed enjoy having food at school lunch, so I would often be without lunch money or sandwich materials. (Now-me wants to tell then-me to cook the food and acquire a lunchbox to stick it in. I knew how to cook and often cooked dinner. I don't know why I didn't think of that!) Luckily, some the kind parents of a friend would pack extra food, and whenever we went over her house, would offer food. Even with that, I was underweight enough for my pediatrician to lecture me by senior year of high school. There really isn't much love lost between my mother and me.

 I'm worried I've made a huge mistake.  I'm in my second year of a PhD program, and I've been slowly getting a feeling that I'm in either in the wrong lab, or in the wrong profession all together.

I had no experience getting myself into this, I just thought it was the logical next step.  I love biology, I want to be an evolutionary biologist.  I knew ahead of time that science is largely self-motivated, but I sort of thought the point was that you join a lab, and start off within the realm of an existing research program.  

I picked my advisor because his research is interesting, and he really likes me.  He's written 2 amazing books, and done some things no one else has done.  He wanted me in his lab, and I thought that was a good thing.  I guess that should have been a warning sign...

In an effort to make a boring story short, I don't like him and I don't think he actually does good science.  He used to, that is clear.  He was very cool at some point.  But then, at some later point, he has become something quite lame, and quite uninterested in how science currently gets done.

So the fun thing is he started me on a question (vaguely) and decided I should extend the scope of a study that he published 2 years ago.  So I began to do that, I started doing what he and the other authors did.  I rapidly realized there were a lot of problems, not only with the original study, but also with applying the methods and analyses to the newer question.  This has led to some understandable strife.

And I'm not being arrogant.  Everyone I have ever talked to about this paper has found the same problems.  My fix for all the problems is a different approach, that is very common in the literature, and lots of different disciplines accept this approach.

And because I'm doing the current, normal thing, he feels like I'm wasting time. 

So I just have to do everything on my own. I wasted a lot of time and energy doing the wrong thing with his approval, and now I'm wasting all my time convincing him that what I'm doing is worth doing.  I'm actually spending a lot of energy trying to make him understand the importance of *sufficient sample sizes*.  This infuriates me.  He acts like I made up statistical power just so I can drag my feet. 


My problem is that I didn't know how this was supposed to work.  I thought something would have clicked by now, and that I'd have a project.  But what happened is that over 2 years, all I've been doing is finding out that everything I'm attempting to do is either wrong or impossible, which would be fine if it was just my own bubble being burst.  However, I have to keep bursting his bubble, but it's basically his ego, and he won't let me.

If I say ""I need to do A, B, and C,"" he says ""well we have a difference in opinion on that, but it's your project.""  I would gladly accept a reason for the difference in opinion, or a reason why I'm wrong, and any suggestions, but he offers no suggestions. I strongly suspect that the reason I'm wrong about what I need to do is because he got away with less so I shouldn't try to do any better.

I don't want to do shitty science, and I don't want to be operating in a vacuum.  I've been crying for 3 days because I feel so alone, and so unequipped to move forward.  He has one other grad student, and she basically had to go about doing everything herself with no support from our advisor.  I think she's done great work, but I don't want to suffer for 4 years like she did.  

  I don't know how to go about switching labs.  I don't feel like I have anything to offer.  I know I'm smart, and I'm capable of doing good work.  I just feel incapable of getting myself out of this hole.


Has anyone here had to switch labs half way through a PhD?  I don't even know if I could just stop at a Masters because my project feels like it's nothing.  Or like it's something I've come to hate.  I mean, I'm still interested in it, but thinking about it now leaves a bad taste in my mouth.


**tl;dr** totally incompatible with my advisor, am not even sure what his research purpose is currently, and I don't know what to do.

Okay, here's the deal.  I'm in a lab with one other student and my advisor.  Me and the other student arrived at the same time, but he has essentially taken off, and done really well at everything, and I have not.  One of the reasons, I think, is that there is a very clear disconnect between how my advisor is with me, vs my labmate.  So now, I have to talk to my advisor about it, but I don't know how or what to say.  Like, there are things that have happened like, he's sent my labmate funding opportunities, but he didn't send them to me.  He's given my labmate a desk in the lab, but he didn't give one to me.  He went to my labmate's talk at a conference but he didn't go to mine.  So I have this perception of being marginalized and so I sort of back off as a result, and then he probably sees that as me not caring and he excludes me even more.  He had a prospective student come this week and I had no idea.  None whatsoever and I feel like that should be open information. I just feel like I'm not in the lab at all, and I don't know if it's my fault or his.  What is appropriate for me to talk with him about to make this better?

It's way too long. I left the US for grad school, and even though I had a not particularly great experience in my program, if I could go back in time I'd do it again in a heartbeat (just with a few changes).

Graduate school, at least in my field of study, has become so blown out of proportion at American universities. A PhD can be completed in three years, and is in many other countries, but in the US they drag it out for up to seven years, so you're doing the work of a postdoc for PhD student pay. My husband and I went to grad school together overseas. I ended up leaving academia, but by the time people we knew in the US were finally finishing their PhDs, my husband had already completed his PhD, done a three year postdoc, and was in a permanent faculty position.

Don't get me wrong, there are amazing graduate schools in the US and many of the best in the world. It's not the schools themselves I disagree with, just what seems to have become the standard of PhD length in the US. It's so much longer than necessary.

I'm just wondering what other people's thoughts are on this.

I'm currently in the midst of completing my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, and I've begun to open up very real possibilities of having a chance at admission into strong controls engineering PhD programs.

I've mentioned to my boyfriend that I've thought about going into a PhD program, to which he replied with ""Why? I would NOT want to spend 6 more years in school."" Keep in mind, he'd be very interested in working right out of undergrad (nothing wrong with that) and establishing himself and a family perhaps 3 years after graduating. For him, pursuing a master's degree in his respective field of engineering would only be done if absolutely needed (he's expressed many times that he ""hates"" school but loves working at his internship). 

I've always been a go-getter and interested in furthering my education (and possibly a research career), but I can tell right off the bat that being with someone while completing a PhD will have its own unique struggles, especially if you participate in a program as a married woman. 

Of course there's another side to my boyfriend's argument, where he does notice that the stresses that go hand-in-hand with living an ambitious lifestyle can take a toll on your health or your relationships with your family, friends, etc. A PhD in engineering will be exceptionally difficult, and I would imagine there will be many late nights I'd be staying in the lab while my significant other stayed at home alone.

I'm really looking for advice or experiences you all have had in dealing with building such a fast-paced, hard-hitting career while in a relationship (or while in a relationship where the other person may not be as supportive as you'd hope during the process).

I am lucky enough to have several choices when it comes to my PhD. 

I got offered one at a not well known university (lab #1), with a nice project, kind supervisors, but low pay-check. Most likely I will also get offered one at a different university (lab #2), which is better known (still not a top university though) and the pay check will be better. I also have other PhD's in the pipeline, however, the one I got offered wants an answer **this week**. I am extremely torn. I have no idea what to choose. I have made pro and cons lists, but they sort of cancel each other out. 

Do you ladies have any advice on how to choose between PhDs? 
How important is the reputation of your university when choosing a PhD? Is a lesser known university detrimental for my academic career?

Career wise I am hoping on ending up as a professor one day, so I feel like this choice will be extremely important for the rest of my career (aaah stress!).

**Update**: Thank you all for the advice! It really helps, although I haven't made the decision yet. I have a phone call with lab number 2 today, and thanks to your advice I know exactly what to ask! To clarify, I am in Europe, so the USA deadline do not count here :) Here you apply to projects independently from the university, so all deadlines differ. Which makes choosing that more difficult, cause you tend to want to choose the first one that says yes. And the time for consideration is short; I got the offer last week and have a week to accept the position or decline it. 

My final decision depends on my talk with lab 2 today. The people from lab # 1 are really nice, but lab # 2 might have a position for both myself and my husband. Which would be the answer to all our problems. Yeah, I married the competition hahaha... But I will update again today or tomorrow! Thank again!

**Final Update** I have chosen lab # 2! The professor actually came to where I am currently to interview me and my husband, and we both got a PhD at his lab! He is a well published scientist, has great ideas for the project and has an open door policy. I will also be trained in new techniques, it sounds perfect!

I published last year for the first time using my married name, which just happens to be a very common Hispanic last name.  Therefore, when you search for it in pubmed etc, you get thousands and thousands of search results. My maiden name is much more unique, and only yields a few hits.  I want my publications to stand out from the crowd, and I think publishing using my maiden name would help with that.  I also feel very connected to my maiden name, as my grandfather was a highly respected research scientist and I feel like I am somewhat following his footsteps.  Is this entirely selfish of me? Have any of you considered this?

My project is sequencing a gene in E. coli and using it for a new typing method that can further distinguish sequence types determined by MLST.  

We got our sequence data back this morning and I've been looking through it and 18 (out of 41) of my samples haven't worked. All of my partner's sequences have worked fine though, so it must be something I've done. However I can't think what.  

This isn't the first thing to go wrong with my samples either. I didn't get a band on the gel we ran after our PCR for some of my samples, which ended up being because I didn't mix all my samples properly (it was fine in the end, we ran it again after proper mixing and all samples had the band we wanted). My partner and I used the same master mix for our sequencing reactions, same primers and everything (we're doing the exact same project but each have different E. coli isolates). We didn't even make it, the PhD student we're working with did the master mix for us. In fact he did a lot of stuff for us between the PCR and the sequencing (with us standing and watching him), so I don't see where things could have gone wrong with only my samples there.  

I've always been pretty good in the lab. My supervisor even asked if I'd be interested in doing a PhD with him because he was impressed by my lab work. But now I feel like a complete idiot that can't do anything right. My confidence is completely gone, and I feel like everyone is looking at me and thinking ""I thought you were supposed to be good?"". I've been feeling incredibly stressed and anxious recently as it is and I definitely did not need this :(  

Sorry it got long, I just wanted to rant a bit really. Has anyone else gone through this sort of thing (having experiments go wrong and suspecting it's completely your fault but you're not sure how)? How did you deal with it?  

TL;DR things keep messing up, suspect it's because I'm an incompetent moron, now have no confidence which will make me even more incompetent.  

EDIT: Just remembered something else that went wrong for me, I accidentally ruined the first lot of primers by keeping them in the fridge not the freezer because no one told me.

What do you think? 

edit: Cool! I'm glad there's some interest. So how do y'all think we should organize this? Here's what I had envisioned - we could use a Google docs group and each post a doc containing a profile sheet with info (our intended programs, the ""vibe"" we wanted our statements to give off, any other pertinent info?) and leave the docs up for review by each other. If you review a doc, you don't change the original document but just leave a paragraph of comments afterwards on a comments page with your name. That way, we can operate off of the honor system - if someone reviews your work, you do them the kindness of reviewing their work. 

Some issues that might be related: the major one is privacy. A lot of these statements can be...well, personal, and reveal personal information including where one lives, maybe name and schools, etc if you publish your CV. I guess you would have the option of deleting that info and leaving placeholders. Otherwise, does anyone know about the potential of gleaning personal information just through Google docs?

We've been together for several years now, are happy and plan to stay together.  

That's all fine, but I've been having a lot of really.... *distracting* thoughts about my totally adorable older, straight, married female advisor.  I know that we could never in anyway be together, even if she was interested (she's not, as far as I know.)  But it doesn't stop me from having the most ridiculous fantasies about kissing her.  It's not exactly a sexual thing... I mostly only think about kissing her. She doesn't have any other students right now, so we get a lot of one-on-one time.  Sometimes i totally zone out while she's talking because I'm imagining kissing her neck.  And then it's awkward, because I wasn't quite listening to what she said.

On top of the romantic feelings she's like my ultimate scientific inspiration (so changing advisors is pretty much out of the question), and she's also a bit like the mom I wished I'd had because of our age difference. 

I know that all must sound fucked up and confusing, because it is.  My partner teases me about it a little bit (we don't keep secrets), saying I should totally go for it if the opportunity ever presents.  I'm like 99.9999% sure that it would/could never come up. And I don't even think I really want it to.  But I still keep having these thoughts, and it's really quite difficult to get work done sometimes.   I really really want her to like me, which can make accepting criticism hard.  And I think I procrastinate more because the stakes of failure seem extra high due to my silly crush.

Everything has been falling into place rather well for me. I started in a high school robotics club with a fantastic set of mentors and peers. In college, people seem rather surprised that I have taken an interest in engineering instead of doing some sort of medical major. 

I haven't encountered many difficulties except for being disheartened at the cost of school and the lack of female companionship. I am a first generation college student going to school more than a thousand miles away from home. I am lucky to be living with my very supportive boyfriend, but other than that my social slate is clear for the time being. It is beginning to wear on our relationship, but I am getting very involved in school clubs, including but not limited to joining the american society for mechanical engineers club at school to help with their current project and a native american club.

Sadly, there aren't very many girls in my major. So far I have met one who isn't just there taking classes with a group of friends or boyfriend or close friend. I am not exactly shy, but it is hard for me to walk up to a group of people and introduce myself. The one girl that I *have* befriended is a senior and very busy so I find myself rather lonely a lot of the time. I have tried making friends with guys, but once they hear that I have a boyfriend they basically lose interest in anything I have to say and stop making eye contact in the halls. Boyfriend is there, but I don't want him to be my only social life. 

**So, what I am wondering is what you have had to go through? What obstacles have you met and was it worth it? Would you have done anything differently?**

edit: spelling

**edit2: While all the advice is greatly appreciated, I want to know more about *you* and anything that you find/found difficult.

I have my first real grown-up job interview in a few weeks and was looking for some fashion tips because this isn't just a short interview but is a three day trip to Tennessee. I'm interviewing for a faculty position so I will be meeting with current professors/deans as well as giving a talk to the faculty and teaching an undergrad class. In addition, I will also be going to dinner with faculty members on two of those nights.

Since this interview is quite extended and some of the situations will be more casual than in a typical interview, I was wondering what you all have worn to things like this. For the main day of meeting deans, faculty, giving a talk and teaching I figured I would wear something like I would to a conference: dress pants, a long sleeved shirt or maybe a short sleeved shirt with a sweater (sleeves are important as I have tattoos and don't want to put them out there right away), and sensible but cute heels. Do you think this is too casual? Also, I just bought a cute business-y skirt, so do you all ever wear skirts to interviews?

Also, on the first night I get there I will be going out to dinner with some of the faculty. Do you think I should wear the same type of thing I would to the main interview day?

I'm in my third year as an undergraduate, and I have these big plans to try to go to graduate school and eventually get my Ph.D. Neither of my parents went to college, though, and they both insist that my plans for graduate school won't really do much more than put me further in debt.

I'm not a 4.0 student, but I'm above a 3 and work really hard to do as well as I can in all of my classes. I also volunteer at one of the labs at my college to help me get a feel for lab practices and gain some experience. Is there anything I can do to up my chances into getting into a good graduate program? Then if I do, what are the chances I'll actually be able to reach my goals realistically? I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I'm just so nervous and I'm hoping that anyone can give me a bit of advice. Thank you all!

The title sums things up: I'm nearing the end of my graduate career and looking at jobs in academia. I already have a lead on a teaching position at a state school back near family in a physics department. I'm a bit stuck on writing the statement of research that is required for the application package...

My background is physics, electrical engineering and now materials engineering - I currently work in soft materials, fluidics, colloidal crystallization - lots of interesting fun stuff. I worked in industry for a couple of years between undergrad and grad school. Seeing faculty life (my advisor &amp; others) at a top research school made me look at smaller schools for jobs. I feel a little like I'm letting down my gender (or something) by taking a (perceived) ""easier"" path. However, my husband and I have had conversations about doing what makes me happy, and I like teaching. I want a balance; I don't want to be defined as my career and nothing else.

*If* everything gets on track, I should be done in August, which means I could be looking for positions to start next fall. That's a big if... Also, the husband is finishing his degree (biology) in 12-18 months, so we don't exactly have the same end date. Ah, the two body problem. He's leaning toward industry, but might do a teaching faculty position. He also doesn't want to do the big research university thing. The job I have a lead on would be in a good location for him to also find something, so there's that...

I've had to learn how to perform surgeries all on my own since my PI is never helpful...at first it was hard to even successfully complete the catheter surgeries, I went through so many practices with problems either being the animal not going under anesthesia, animal waking up during surgery, catheter malfunction..etc. Finally, I got the surgery and recovery down and was able to get a group in to start training...I've been trying to train the animals for about a month to press the lever but only one out of the six was able to learn....I had such high hopes for him and thought that finally at least all this hard work would finally produce one viable data point and today as I was in the middle of performing a dose-effect curve the animal pulls out his catheter and dies.... I was completely shocked, just a few hours more and he would've been done...I just stared at him for awhile hoping he would get back up and nothing...I started crying. I am just so frustrated that I've put so much time and effort into getting this done and after 9 months I have nothing to show for... back to square one I guess.

Background: I'm a 28 year old civil engineering undergrad. When I was young I studied languages, then fell in love with math as a language and sort of drifted into science. My first semester as an engineering student I got a position as an undergrad researcher and then lead on my own project (developing more a more environmentally friendly concrete) and I really, truly love my work. I love all my classes, my professors are kind and helpful, despite the bizarre range of questions I always have. The material is fascinating and challenging... but I'm happiest in my lab, whether I'm measuring materials, mixing concrete, testing samples, or squinting at data trying to figure out what I messed up. :)

I'm very lucky - my research professor is very involved despite being an incredibly busy man. He often sends me scholarships to apply for, pointing out programs that will help me academically. He has me sitting in on interesting grad classes and is arranging for me to take them for credit when I'm a senior. The two directors of my lab have gone out of their way to introduce themselves to me, compliment me on my good work, share information and encourage me. Really it is a wonderful environment and I'm thriving in it.

All my professors take it for granted that I'm going to continue my research. Today during our weekly progress report, my professor mentioned idly that I'm working on my master's thesis. He says I can continue collecting my data while I finish my undergrad and then they'll take me into the master's program and I can spend a year finishing my thesis. ""After that we'll recruit you into the phd program,"" he said. ""You're going to be here a very, very long time.""

The Dilemma: I can't think of anything more fulfilling. I expected to go into sustainable structural design... but I have an unexpected passion for material science. My work is worthwhile and, if I'm successful, will be a minor but valid contribution to the world. This is exactly the work I want to do forever and I feel incredibly fortunate to have found it and been enveloped into it.

But.. there are no women. There's one female phd in my lab and I've literally never seen her. I don't know what work she does, who she is, or what her life is like. There are two other female students in my lab, but their research must be very different from mine because I never see them (and I like to drift around being manual labour for other people's projects when I have extra time to spend so I feel like I ought to know them better). I haven't had a single female professor.. So all I see everyday are male doctorates and male students. 

And by and large they all seem to be married, but I get the impression that their wives cover the majority of the burdens in their home life. My own professor comes in early, works very late, and I often get emails from him in the wee hours of the morning... I'd love having a house husband or a wife if I could afford to support us both, but that seems statistically unlikely. Also, I am not a young woman - if I want children it's going to have to happen over the next ten years and if I go into academia, when would there ever be time for that? I can't imagine being pregnant and pouring concrete much less trying to raise a baby while handling the rigors of being a phd candidate.

So, I guess, are role models to look at. Are there happy, healthy woman researchers out there? Do I get to have my cake and eat it too? Or do I have to choose between having a family and my research? I'm not unwilling to make that decision, I just need to know the realities of the situation and I don't know any female professors to talk to.

TL;DR - Is there room in academia for me to work hard and have a family life?",,False,,t5_2sg5m,False,,,True,t3_186leg,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/186leg/advice_for_a_female_engineering_student/,

OK So. Everyone who has done or been around grad school knows that we work long hours. That's fine, I can work long hours. I can work weird hours - in fact, I prefer it. I understand that as a PhD student, I am expected to come in on weekends. 

What I don't like is being fined $2/minute for coming in after the designated time of 9am. 

Yes, I understand that some labs have 7:30am curfews, and that my adviser is being [slightly] reasonable for letting us do 9am instead of earlier. But dammit if my alarm didn't go off this morning, A Sunday morning, and got my name circled on our sign-in sheet. 

OK so what, a black mark... some shame, I'll try not to let it happen again. But we were sent an email earlier this month, containing the facts: 

&gt;  9am is the absolute latest that you should be in lab and working. And be honest: Write the exact time when you arrive on the sign-in sheet.  Fine: $2/min after 9am.


So I'm really sad that because I signed in at 9:35 (the real time I arrived, mind you!), I will have to pay him $70. *The money goes towards buying food and refreshments for group meetings. It makes me sick that we're buying food with this 'blood money'.* **not to mention that I don't really make all that much to begin with.** 

So, I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. The graduate adviser turns a blind eye to this stuff, because she's got other things to worry about. I feel like the department head doesn't want to know. Another graduate student from another lab complained to Human Resources about his adviser being a jackass, and said student was eventually fired (although it could've been for other reasons).

Everyone asks me ""well why don't you just quit?"" and the answer is Because I've worked hard for a year now, I took classes, and I can theoretically finish the PhD in 3.5 years. I also LOVE the research, and I like my adviser when he's not being Mr. Power Trip. So no, leaving is kind of a last resort for me. I just wish that we weren't *punished* so much.

A little background:   
  
My research interests occupy that gray space that sits between ecology and evolution. Generally, I'm interested in how environmental change contributes to individual variation and phenotypic adaptation and how these changes contribute to population and community patterns. I got my M.S. in a primarily applied ecology department, and I always yearned to take classes and interact with faculty in the more basic ecology/evolution dept (which I ended up doing). However much of the research in that dept is esoteric or theoretical, and I often felt like I didn't fit into either dept very well. 

I was just on the verge of searching for phd opportunities when a fully funded one presented itself. It's very appealing, in the research questions, prestige and financially. However, the direction of the research is much more applied than how I envisioned my dissertation would be. While applied ecology may be better for a professional career, I'm planning on pursuing academia. I see myself as a behavioral ecologist, but the end product of this dissertation may not illustrate me as such, without drastic additions on my part. 
  
Essentially, my question is this: Do you feel like your dissertation constrained your research interests? Did it define who you were as a researcher? Or did you feel free to pursue different interests once you finally considered an 'expert' in your field? I'm not talking about jumping from ecology to physics, but the gap between ecology and evolution can often be wider than you think, unfortunately. Would the fact that it's fully funded change your opinion? It's definitely a topic I'm interested in, although not necessarily the study system that is in my top list.

I will start out with a warning that this post is a long read, I'll do my best to provide all the information required and try to keep it short. 

I am 26 (27 in October) and I don't have any formal education. I am intelligent and capable but after high school I decided to take a few years off to figure out what I want to do before signing up for university. I started a series of great jobs and have been very fortunate to have landed an excellent job, making great money, and working full-time for the last three years. 

Some brief information to backup how I decided my field of choice. In high school my favorite subjects were English, writing, and science (mostly biology and chemistry but I like all sciences). When it was 21, I audited some courses in business and decided it was not for me. I have always loved writing and English. I have always been a stickler for grammar and creativity but had never thought to look into studying English or linguistics. 

When I was 22, I started working for the Provincial Department of Health and through this, decided I wanted to go into health sciences. After a lot of research, I learned neuroscience was something I really enjoyed learning about. I spent a huge amount of time planning my path - BSc in NESC, MCATS, Med school, residency.... I had the 15-year plan (or more depending on acceptance) planned out. I started to work toward it. 

Five years later and here I am. I have successfully completed 3/5 (working on number 4) of the university prep classes needed to apply for my BSc. There is a catch. I don't have family support for going back to school and I have a really good full-time job as the EA to the President. I was planning on doing the BSc part-time (I'm aware this will take forever) and then thought about incorporating my love of writing by taking a one year BJ (Bachelor of Journalism) at a local university offering one year BJ for students holding an undergraduate degree. Then I would make the final decision to do science (either med school or PhD) or something in writing/communications/public relations. I am aware that I am starting really late and it may not be feasible to expect that I'll make into med school. I would like to work in clinical neuroscience but would be happy doing some sort of technical writing maybe for medical journals. 

Here's where I am lost. The whole plan I constructed was based on working toward becoming a neurosurgeon but I am starting to seeing reality and understand that this plan may not be: (a) feasible for someone working full-time even at the undergrad level, (b) realistic, or (c) foolproof. I have a lot of close friends and coworkers that have suggested to me many times that I should pursue a degree in linguistics or English because of how excited and enthusiastic I am about writing and grammar. Additionally, if I chose the route of BA I could do it part-time much easier and quicker than a BSc and there is even a BA Eng degree available completely online. 

Part of me feels like if I don't do what I originally set out to do, that I am failing myself. The other part of me feels that my original plan is not feasible and should be reworked. The problem is I don't know where to start to rework it. 

If I do a BA, I can't just do an MSc and end up in science but if I do a BSc, I may not make it anywhere. If I was to get my BSc, I could apply for a technical job at the hospital and work evenings so I can pursue med school or whatever I end up pursuing if I don't make it into med school. 

If I do a BA, I could secure a job in communications (also an interest of mine just not as strong) and I could still take a science degree and have less worry about - if I lose my job, am I employable -(since I have no formal education now, this is a concern). Also with a degree in linguistics, I could get into neurolinguistics (with some specialized training) and be a speech therapist for patients who have suffered stroke, etc. this would be interesting to me. I'm worried that neurolinguistics is a hard field to be employed in and I want to make sure that I end up with a degree that matters, that can get me a job, that I can apply to a field of choice. 

I just don't know what to do and I am looking for insights into which field I should pursue (I recognize you can't really answer that for me but I'd like your input and thoughts). I enjoy the fields of English, writing, language, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive sciences. I know it seems like I don't know what I want, but I do, I just don't know where to aim now that reality has set in on my extremely ambitious 15-year plan. 

TL;DR: was originally planning to do a BSc in neuroscience and go into med school plus residency for neurosurgeon, but since I am 26 and have a great full-time job, I feel that doing this part-time is unrealistic and I am not sure I want to commit the time (seems like I'm starting far too late for this career choice). Considering switching focus to BA Eng or linguistics and maybe getting into neurolinguistics (speech therapy for stroke victims, etc.). I'm worried that neurolinguistics is a hard field to be employed in and I want to make sure that I end up with a degree that matters, that can get me a job, that I can apply to a field of choice. Need advice / insight.

I was at the top of my field school class and I designed and presented my own research on lemurs at an academic meeting this last year. I like to think I'm pretty well organized and although maybe not a great candidate for Ph.D., I think I'd be a good catch for a Master's program (to later go onto a Ph.D. program).

My ultimate goal in life is to be able to do research on lemurs and examine the patterns of disease or parasite transmission between lemurs and humans and/or cattle. I think there's a lot there that could contribute to better understanding of public health and additionally serve the people of Madagascar.

And herein lies the problem. I know I'm in a field where there's already overpopulated. I'm all right with the idea of private industry, but I can't think of a single organization that would hire anyone to do anything like that. So, I think I'm pretty much delegated to academia which is fine with me because I like the idea of being able to teach and do public outreach as well. But I absolutely am aware at the lack of positions waiting on the other end.

So, there's a few things I'm curious about because I don't know much and I'm trying to do all the research I can. If anyone could shed some light, I'd be very appreciative.

* Is it really as glum out there as they make it sound? Is it likely to change for the better or worse in the future?
* In multidisciplinary science fields, is it difficult to get positions in other fields? (For example: I was thinking of getting a degree in anthropology or environmental studies and applying to jobs/academia positions in both fields).
* International positions: is it easy to get jobs at institutions abroad? Is that even accepted? I imagine it would vary depending on the country and institution's standards, but has anyone did this and would this be something recommended?
* If you wouldn't recommend doing a Ph.D., what are other ways you would recommend someone being able to do something similar? An MPH?

I am a fourth year undergraduate physics student. I'm currently taking an Electromagnetic Fields course and so far I have understood very little, even though I've poured hours and hours each week into revising the notes and completing the assignments.

The other night I spent four hours trying to do a question on one of the assignments; I reread the notes over and over, and went through various texts looking for help, and I got absolutely nowhere. Yesterday I asked my prof a specific question about the set up of the problem, and he refused to answer it and turned me away, saying ""just think about it"" and ""look at the notes"". This was very frustrating to hear after spending so long on the problem already. Even after I told him I had already attempted it, he still refused to help me. 

This isn't the first time this has happened. I had him last year for a class and it was the same situation. I ended up with a C in that course. Several times I went to him for help and I was either turned away or humiliated for my lack of understanding.

I've started to think I'm just stupid, or lazy, but it's hard to say because I have a high gpa and I typically do well in my other courses. I go to school full time and work two part-time jobs to be able to afford university. I'm usually up until 1-2am working on these EM fields problems. I'm not sure what else to do to improve my grade, and learn the material. I don't mind putting the time in, but when I don't get anywhere close to solving the problem after working for hours, it's frustrating.
 
My family and friends have suggested talking to an advisor about the prof, but I think that would only hurt my chances of doing well, as the ""advisors"" in my faculty are just profs who got roped into the job and don't have time for it/want to do it. I just need some support or advice on how to improve my grade without doing the conventional things, since I can't talk to him and the material is too advanced to find good information sources online (our assigned textbook doesn't cover the current topic either). I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit, I really like this community so that's why I posted here!

Currently majoring in physics but feeling very out of place.,,13,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/118kco/how_do_you_know_when_to_switch_your_major/,"This year I transferred to a four year university from community college. I’m currently a physics major, but I feel totally in adequate. This term I originally enrolled in 4 upper division physics classes but ended up dropping two of them. I was completely lost and felt over whelmed. Even with the two classes I’ve kept I have no idea what’s going on. I’m questioning whether or not I have really prepared myself enough for a physics degree. 

I’m not sure if I am accurately acknowledging my limits for the first time or just experiencing the so called “imposter syndrome”.  I took all my lower division coursework before transferring. I did well but certainly not great (B’s in every single math and physics course). Looking back on it I don’t know why I thought it would be ok to go ahead and major in physics when I got B’s in all of my classes even after giving it everything I’ve got. If I stick with physics I can’t see myself getting good grades or even passing the classes. When I’m in class or doing my homework I feel completely lost. I’ve started studying with classmates but they are on a different level than I am. I honestly have no idea how I got accepted into this school. 

The thought of 2 years (or a the rate I’m at now, 3 years) of physics courses where I feel confused and overwhelmed sounds terrible. Most of my classmates are looking to pursue their PhD after getting their BS. When I first started on this path I thought I wanted that too. Now I’m just not sure.

Part of me says to go for physics, that I’ll regret it if I give up now. Another part of me just says to get out while I can, I still have a good gpa and a scholarship, switch my major to something I both enjoy and can do well at so that I have options when I graduate. I’m not sure what to do, its so much pressure to do well and so much money to pay for tuition if I don’t get a scholarship next year. I’m quite a bit older than the average college student, I rearranged my whole life to come to school here and I don’t want it to be all for nothing.

I’m not too sure what type of advice I am looking for. I’m sure people have felt this way in physics before (and other fields too), and I’m sure there’s also people out there who ended up loving and pursuing a major that they didn’t start out with.  If anyone wants to throw in their 2 cents feel free. I know there was a post made by a junior in physics feeling the same way a few weeks ago, but I think she must have deleted it because I can’t find it. 

TLDR; Community college junior transfer student, upper division physics is more than I can handle. Sort of freaking out. Questioning if its best to choose another major now or continue with physics.

I'm currently a junior in Applied Math and applying to my uni's  4/4.5-year BA/MA (for an MA in Biostatistics).  Looking for some advice on the following:

Problem:  I feel like I'm at a crossroads in my research lab experience.  I am supposed to do some biostatistical analysis of blood serum data (hopefully will lead to a ""diagnostic"" through regression equations) but the only data I'm given is ""diseased"" and ""6 weeks after cure of the disease"".  As an underling in my lab, I don't feel like I have the authority to demand for ""predisease"" blood samples and I don't feel like it's a safe assumption that ""6 weeks after""=""predisease"", so I feel like any analysis I do with the data will be completely useless.  There are no trained biostatisticians in my lab, and I've complained to my direct superior and it fell on deaf ears.  

* Since I feel my work here has an expiration date/is useless, should I find another research lab?  Is it too late to find a good research opportunity and should I settle for a letter of recommendation rather than a satisfying research experience (+ the possibility of a better LOR)?  Note: I'm somewhat reluctant to quit because I'm hoping to write a thesis for next year's graduation and I'm worried about time.

* Does an MA vs an MSc in Biostatistics matter?  I can't decide if I should write a thesis for my Master's program, which will lead to Master's in Science, or for my Bachelor's degree, which will lead to graduating with honors.  I know this is probably institution-specific, but should I dare to use one thesis for both degrees?  If it changes anything, I plan to go to medical school and later work as a physician-investigator, though not really as a physician-scientist (MD/PhD).

* Last fall, I had been in contact with an epidemiology professor who seems very kind, encouraging, and eager mentor.  Although I would be doing less wet lab procedures (which I enjoy), he also said that a year or 2 of good work will lead to a publication.  How does a publication fit into the whole scheme of things?  Should I be focusing on this rather than a thesis?  Has anybody killed both birds with one stone?

* For anyone in/have completed grad school: I've taken a class (and had done well!) with the ""Graduate Program Advisor"" for MA/MSc in Biostatistics.  Is it weird if I ask her for a letter of recommendation?

I would love it if there are any statisticians or biostatisticians that could add their $.02 about the ""problem"" scenario in particular.

I’m looking into applying to a few hospitals and universities (that aren't the university I attend) that offer summer research programs for undergraduates and would love any advice. I’m in second year currently majoring in forensic science in Canada. 

1) Having no previous research experience is it appropriate to talk about the classes I’ve taken and laboratory experience I’ve gained through them? Ex. what type of equipment or techniques I’m familiar with.

2) I know the programs I’m applying for are fairly competitive and it may come down to grades. Regarding GPA what is considered relatively good? I don’t want to highlight my GPA if I should actually be compensating for it by highlighting something else. I’ll also be applying to some programs before I get my first semester marks for second year, which I’m confident will be higher than my first year marks. Should I mention that or tell them that I can update them when I get my current grades? My GPA isn't horrendous, I'm just not sure if it's good. 

3) I have to contact specific scientists for most of the positions. I’m really not good at ass-kissing for lack of a better word. I know I should try to research the scientists and explain why I am interested in their research, but I’m not sure how quite to word that without feeling like they'll think I'm just ass-kissing. 

edit: 4) Do you think the fact that I'm in forensic science would be a disadvantage compared to people in health science or other programs slightly more related to some of the research? My program is very heavily based in chemistry and biology, but I'm not sure if people initially get that impression or just think I'm dusting prints and shining lights on things all day.

Now, the advice I'm getting is that contraceptives carry health risks, and certainly in my social circles the perception is that hormone based contraceptives are a BAD THING for your body. I don't live in the US or Canada and I wonder why the prevailing wisdom seems to be that hormonal BC is such a good thing?
Does it not mess with your hormone levels and thus your moods? Does it not have links with breast cancer and osteoporosis? In any event, absent a hormone imbalance, surely its a bad idea to be upping the levels of one hormone or the other in the body?

I know none of you can give me medical advice but I'm looking for a general overview of why I should and should not take hormonal birth control. If anyone has specific knowledge or experience of Depo that would be great too.

For my gap year, I chose a lab just starting in a field I think is pretty cool but slightly outside my main interest area (a cross training year/last chance to do this.)

My first gripe is that I feel excluded. It's an engineering lab, and although I have an engineering degree and some cool projects under my belt, most of my research had been in a life science field, so it could be the har science/soft science feud. My professor even jokingly asked if I felt like a ""fail of an engineer"" even though I have strong design and quantitative analysis experience through my personal projects. Or it could be that I'm not as good at the joking/bragging banter. Or because I'm clearly not as strong (but I make up for it with the fine motor skills.) I personally feel that it's because I'm clearly uncomfortable with the racist and sexist jokes they make.

At the same time, I've been assigned a ridiculous workload. In addition to the original, time-intensive project I started with, I also inherited a project and lab chores when a lab member recently left, because I have very careful lab technique. One of the undergrads felt overworked, so I got another finicky project. The postdoc is deliberately unhelpful to students sent over by collaborators, so they keep bugging me with emergencies they could have avoided with some common sense, so I've started being unhelpful too. I'm already spending 14+ hours a day and coming in on weekends. And the prof just promised my labor to another lab on one of their projects. I talked to him about the te crunch, and he just says I should be able to handle it. I'm at my wit's end!

Btw, I have a pretty strong résumé, so I get contacted by recruiters frequently. However, I'm also applying to grad programs that would look askance at bailing out of this lab.

**tl;dr 25-year-old lady with BA in the arts wants to go back to school for Astronomy, seeks advice and personal experiences...**

a little background: I am 25, with a BA in a theatre arts. I made it through with no debt and since about a year after school, have been working full time in IT at my alma mater (I live in Oregon). This allows me chances to talk to lots of professors and staff, see what people are researching on, and feel very melancholy every time I walk through the main science complex. During college, I didn't think too hard or spend a lot of time being introspective about what I wanted to do. Theatre was great at the time, but now that I am older I've of course changed a lot. 


The field I am interested in is astrophysics, although I'm not sure specifically which part yet. I've done some research on the typical path of studies, the length of time for masters and PhD and the usual end results of faculty positions and researching. I have to say, it's been easy to be discouraged. It seems like a highly competitive field with a very small number of positions available. I'm also getting a sense from some posts here that academia can be very frustrating in terms of the type of people who work in it, experiences with sexism, the way money is handled and so on.


However, I also just can't shake the notion that I should pursue this. It has been dogging me for maybe 5 years. I spent hours and hours during undergrad and after worrying about what I want to be when I grow up, being jealous of all the super-passionate people around me who knew what they wanted to do at 18 and followed through with it and got their dream jobs. I once read some blog post or something about ""finding your purpose."" It suggested making a list of all the things you enjoy doing or are interested in and so on, and when you find the one that you can't imagine not being a part of your life, that makes you tear up and your heart beat faster, that it is what you really want. Of course, that's a very romantic piece of imagery and I'm sure not everyone's path to finding what they want to do in life is the same, but that sort of did happen to me very recently after chatting with a faculty member in the Physics department who is part of the team observing on CanariCam. 


I had a long talk with my boyfriend (who is lovely and supports me) about how I was feeling--stressed out, terrified, excited at the prospect that I was actually seriously thinking about this. It gave me a whole new outlook on how the near future COULD go, which is great because I have always been terrible at knowing what I want to be doing in 5 years (read: I never have). I love where I work now, and I love making money and being able to save a lot, but when I think about trying to advance and learn more in IT I can't really get that excited about it, and the notion of continuing in IT makes me very depressed and doubt my ability to succeed anyway, since I have no IT schooling or experience beyond help desk.


In terms of the logistics, I'm a little worried about money, because as mentioned I have never taken out loans and have never had debt, and the horror stories about paying back loans… ugh! I've saved up a good chunk of change, especially compared to most people my age, but it's only enough to pay for maybe a year or two of undergrad tuition at in-state rates. I'm also a bit worried about my parents, who are in their early 60s. While they are still independent and more or less healthy, I can tell they are aging and I worry what will happen in the next 20 years, since I am an only child and we only have one other family member in this state and she is just as old and in worse health.


So I go back and forth, deciding I should forget about this notion, telling myself to just make it a hobby and be content with that. But I really feel like space exploration and research is one of the two most important fields right now and that I should be part of it. (I don't mind, at this point, the idea of being university faculty--in fact I would prefer to stay away from the private sector/industry and feel like I would be most interested in research.)


So ladies, I would love your advice on any of the above and anything you think is important, especially these topics:


   * Your experiences going back to school in a rigorous science field
   * Your experiences as an astrophysicist/astronomer at work and at school, especially finding work and positions and networking
   * Tips and information on scholarships, grants, loans, tax benefits for the financially independent student
   * Advice on how this decision might affect family life (two aging parents, no siblings, no family nearby)
   * Advice on the coursework. I have always been a great student (I have never received lower than a B) and had no problems with math or sciences back in high school and freshman year of college--but that was a long time ago!
   * Information on the research area of astronomy--what's it like? Is it as tedious as I have heard? Is it rewarding? 

I appreciate any insights. I have searched similar topics on this subreddit and others but wanted to post my own as well.

I prefer going to presentations, but I know not everyone is like me.

I've gone through the pros and cons of each. 

Powerpoint
Pros:
-one time presentation.

-you get to choose what to say; the information provided doesn't depend on the audience's interest/ability/desire to formulate questions, so you're able to actually guide them through the research and hopefully help them understand/care.

-I feel I excel at these. 

Cons: 
-you compete for attention. If your presentation isn't the most exciting in that time period, you may not be heard. You now not only miss out on getting your work out there, but also networking opportunities. 

-These take a lot more prep work.

Poster: 
Pros:
-you get a lot more traffic and because of this, get your research at least seen. 

-possibly more network opportunities

Cons:
-you have to hope that people are interested while you awkwardly stand there waiting for questions. I compare it to waiting to be picked for a team in gym class. They give you a good look over and either pass by, pick you with a smile, or feel bad because no one has picked you yet. 

-you have to give essentially the same presentation as many times as people are interested in an hour or two.

-you don't get to see other people's posters and network with them.

Other grad school options are science stuff like some type of Biology or Immunology or even Biochem. But, I don't think a job in research is worth that much stress and that little money. I know I should have volunteered/job shadowed people from these careers but it is too late now/I only get time on weekends and barely anything is open then. I will still try to start volunteering at a walk-in clinic and job shadowing but application time is quickly approaching. Also, I emailed grad schools but they didn't respond so I am guessing I have to call them. 

I am the type of person who focuses on keeping options open rather than just setting goals and working towards them. As in I tried to get all the pre-reqs for pharm/optometry/dentist school than focusing on my grades even though I wasn't fully interested in any of those. I am having trouble setting the goal to be exact but I feel like I need to set it so I have something to work towards. 

If you guys are doing biomed engineering then tell me more about it! Is there lots of physics? Is job preference given to someone who has eng. undergrad vs sci. undergrad?

I'm in my honours year at the moment and I'm panicking about where to go next. Went to the careers adviser at my uni and she basically went in circles with the advice she gave me and it just ended up confusing me more. 

Basically, I would love to do a phd next (I did my honours project in a molecular microbiology lab and loved it) but I have no self confidence in my abilities and am absolutely terrified its going to be this massive jump where everyone expects me to know what I'm doing right away. 
So because of that my careers adviser told me I should go for a MRes as another stepping stone to build my confidence and to decide if a phd is something I can realistically achieve. 

The only thing that's putting me off this is the finances. If I were to do a phd I would be able to get it fully funded, possibly with a stipend as well depending on the course. If I do a masters I wouldn't be able to receive as much funding and would struggle to pay for it plus have money to live on. 
Pus, if I technically am able to do a phd right away, I feel a bit like I would be kind of wasting a year doing a masters degree? 

As a little bit more background about me, I have asked my supervisor on my hons project and a couple of phd students at the lab I was at if they think I have the ability and they said yes but I still doubt it/them. Apparently I don't really come across as an intelligent person so it puts me off believing people that say I am?

Help :( 

**TLDR; Is it worth jumping in at the deep end and applying for different phds or should I take an extra (safer) year to do a masters degree (even though it will be a lot harder finance wise)?

I'll try to be concise…

My first year in grad school in a biology program, I worked my ass off. I spent tons of time on my rotations, I did a lot of schoolwork, and I really didn't do much else. I was often in lab till 11 or midnight. And I worked myself into some serious repetitive stress injuries. Which really snowballed, partly because I kept working, but in my defense, the doctors totally misdiagnosed me and didn't take my complaint seriously, so I didn't understand how serious it was.

I've ended up taking the last year off to deal with the tendon and nerve issues in my arms. The first semester I took off unofficially, the second semester officially. I joined a lab that I've wanted to be in for years, cutting-edge, well-funded, fast-paced, mostly postdocs. So it was pretty horrifying to try to start and realize that I just couldn't do it physically.

After tons of physical therapy and a couple surgeries, I'm thinking about going back to school in the fall or winter (depending on if I need another surgery). And I'm terrified. The first year of grad school was so scary because I felt like I just didn't have the background. I decided sort of late in college that I wanted to do research, and so I'm lacking in some of the hard science courses I should've taken. I have a lot of lab experience, I'm an author on five publications (two in Nature), and I have an NSF fellowship. But I just felt behind everyone else because I've never properly learned chemistry, or taken a biochem class, etc.

And my advisor doesn't want me to take classes. He wants me in lab, doing work they can publish. Naturally.

So my injuries have just compounded this anxiety to the point that I panic when I set foot on campus. Let alone when I go into my building to talk to someone about something. I don't know what to do. I love the work they're doing in the lab, and it's a super fancy school, but it's also very demanding. I don't know if I can do it because of my lacking background, and my physical limitations. Even when I'm recovered, I'm going to be at risk for developing these problems again. I can never go back to just working 12 hours a day. I have to be careful and smart and respect my physical limitations. How do I do that in such a fast-paced environment? How do I do that without feeling inadequate?

Lately I've been wondering if I should transfer to a lower tier school. I got courted pretty heavily by a couple good but not top-tier schools (UW, Einstein, etc.), and I wonder if, given my limitations, it would make sense to be somewhere a little less demanding, and a little more willing to accommodate me because I'd be a bigger fish in a smaller pond in the settings.

On the one hand, it breaks my heart to think about leaving the city that I've fallen in love with and always wanted to live in, leaving my apartment that's the first place I've felt at home since I was 12, leaving the lab that I fantasized about joining as an undergrad and as a tech before grad school. But I don't know if I can do this. When I started grad school, my attitude was that even though I was missing some coursework, it would be okay because I was willing to work as hard as I needed to to make up for my deficits. But I just can't do that anymore. Everything about this year has been showing me what I can't do, which has ranged from not being able to cook, to not being able to shower without assistance after surgery, to not being able to tie my shoes for weeks. I've gotten all these lessons in my own impotence, and I know that's influencing how I see things.

Any advice?

Like many of you, I'm sure, I was fascinated by the natural world from an early age. During my teenage years, I dreamed of combining hard science with aesthetics and design. At school, I kept my options open and picked both science and liberal arts subjects. The plan was to get as much scientific training as I could and then...? I enrolled in a Biochemistry BSc degree that offered a humanities component and graduated at the top of my class. By this time, the research bug had bitten me and I was accepted onto a PhD programme. This is where my little plan started to break down.

I suffered a nervous breakdown near the end of my PhD and took an intermission. It coincided nicely with the doom and gloom of the global financial meltdown. In that space, I suddenly became aware of all my other options: all that stuff outside the walls of industry and academia. I took up various freelance jobs, exposing myself up to a whole host of creative industries. I went back, wrote my thesis, aced my viva and graduated. By this time I had secured an internship and my alternative career took off. That was nearly three years ago.

My PhD supervisor has since left academia, largely as a result of the unpleasant atmosphere and other pressures introduced by funding cuts. Various other mentors and former colleagues are considering the same. Of the other PhD students and postdocs I know, most have completely left science or are considering it. Life as a perpetual postdoc does not seem worth the pain. To some extent, I feel glad that I got out when I did. I am earning the same (or more) than I would be as a postdoc. I have flexible working conditions. My current career is not tied to a particular geographic location or a particular person or field.

However, I lament what I left behind. I miss the intellectual buzz, the feeling of being at the bleeding edge of human knowledge. My break from the bench has afforded me some perspective and I got to develop a different set of skills. Whereas before I could only envisage myself being employed by a PI, I can now envisage leading and driving projects and teams. I can also see that it might be easier to do what I ultimately want to do (still chasing that childhood dream of combining hard science with aesthetics and design somehow) from *within* the scientific sphere. I feel like I am standing at a crossroads. On one hand, I could aggressively pursue my new career and hope that leads me to where I want to be. Or I can try to get back into science with the same hope.

I run a small national non-profit that focuses on space STEM education. We are located in the DC area. This April we spent $2500 of our hard earned cash (and about 4% of our annual budget) to participate in a huge science and engineering festival held here. The festival encourages participating organizations to connect their members and audiences to the organization web and Facebook page. 

Of late, I have been increasingly frustrated with the content posted on the Facebook site. I will be clear that the questionable content is not created by the organization, but is posted in a discussion provoking manner.  ""This is harsh, but I think it has an element of truth. We get what we celebrate and we don't celebrate science and engineering. What do you think? Be civil."" This was in reference to a photo juxtaposing major scientists with a celebrity, with the tagline ""If you don't know who these people are, but you know who this is, congrats. You're what's wrong with the world."" 

A huge part of my E/PO efforts over the last 13 years has been encouraging my fellow engineers and scientists to be more approachable, less condescending, and tone down elitist tendencies. I shot a very polite email off to the Executive Director of the organization boiling my argument down, thanking him for the awesome festival, and ending on a hopeful note that the organization might be a little more considerate of their impact in the future. He responded by calling into question the legitimacy of my opinion since I was not an actual sponsor, but paid the minimum fee to participate. I thanked him again, reiterated my points, and was resigning myself to no response. 

This morning my FB feed presented me with a giant image of Dr. Brian Cox saying,""Anyone who thinks the Large Hadron Collider will destroy the world is a twat,"" courtesy the previously mentioned organization.

Now, please don't get me wrong. Privately, I have a mouth worse than sailor's, and a vulgar description of female genitalia / sexist term for idiot probably wouldn't cause me to blanche. However, as CEO of my non-profit, I cannot associate my group with an organization supposedly for children that reposts content of that nature.

I sent the Director another polite email letting him know I had informed my board we couldn't participate in their festival in good conscience anymore and wished him the best.

He responded with a series of emails informing me he was going to write letters to all the members of my board telling them  ""you basically are trying to  silence our freedom of speech."" 

The next email, sent privately, and not CC'ing his previously included co-workers read ""and BTW you are not smart enough to know that he is English and this is common language there.""

I have responded, politely, and CC'd everything to the chair of our board. I did not ask for a refund, public apology, or anything that required any admission of wrong-doing on the organization's part, or threaten to publicize the argument or write his board of directors. I just was trying to help someone in a position to do a great deal of good how he could make his cause much more successful, and when he continued to undermine my organization's methods, I broke ties.

1. Am I overreacting about the posted FB content in reference to a K-12 audience? As it stands, this is a bit of a rhetorical question, but if enough of you tell me I need to get off my high horse, I'm willing to take that into consideration.

2. Any suggestions where I can find large international science/engineering festivals that are a little more open to educational priorities and encouraging communication?

I have however found something quite interesting and I could really do with any input anyone more qualified than myself in the area could offer.

Recently I found a gene in our rats that appears to disrupt the correct distribution of dilution genes. Specifically it would appear to effect the pink eyed dilution. Two initial crosses were done. One male showing the trait was crossed to his litter-mate who was also showing the trait, and then also to a completely unrelated female who was homozygous for the normally acting pink eyed gene.

Much to our surprise not only did the condition pass on and show phenotypically in both litters, but at around 4 weeks of age all of the offspring with facial blazes died from the condition known as megacolon.

In my country megacolon does not exist as a result of pigment distribution as these animals are not allowed into the country. Even our high whites do not suffer from it like they do overseas. So this was very curious. 

Not only does the gene cause two colours to be present on the animal (diluted and non diluted, the diluted portion being concentrated around the head and neck) but also high instances of odd eyes, and neat blazes on a lot of the offspring. We have done other test matings that I can expand on upon request.

Necropsies were done on all offspring suffering from megacolon after all other environmental factors for the problem were ruled out. 

So Im at the end of my understanding as far as the way in which dilutions work, and the way in which the gene is acting.

I have not yet ruled out that the megacolon is a once off anomaly caused by the particular male or whether it is directly connected to the problem gene. I do not know if this gene is separate entirely, or whether it is an attachment to the existing pink eyed gene. 

When we crossed the animals to those who did NOT have any dilution genes present the colour discrepancy was not visible on the coat, however many babies still showed the characteristic blaze of the gene being present, and also the cutting of pigment behind the head. 

Has anything like this ever been seen before in labs? I was going to talk to someone in the bio dept at our university but I wasnt sure who to talk to or if anyone would be familiar enough with these animals specifically to add any insight. To be honest Ive never had much to do with that department. Might be a long shot, but I figured it was worth asking in the event someone here does work with these little guys :)

Heres some cute pictures showing the colour discrepancy.

I'm a current sophomore at a small liberal arts college. Right now I'm a declared psych major, bio minor, with a concentration in neuroscience because my school doesn't have a neuro major (although apparently the concentration is going to become a minor soon!). I was reading on another forum today (talk.collegeconfidential if anyone here frequents that site) and people overwhelmingly say that science is a dead end option for current undergrads hoping to go into academia, especially neuroscience. Several users also said that there's no way to get into a neuro grad program with a psych background. It is still possible for me to switch majors to bio with a minor in neuroscience at this point in my college career, but it would be a pain in the ass. I'd be willing to do it if it would help me make the cut for grad school, though.

Hearing things like this is a bit distressing to me, as this is (was?) my ""life plan"". I really want to get a PhD and have some sort of career dealing with neuroscience, or at least science in some respect. I've talked to some of my profs here at my school, and they all assured me the psych background would be fine for grad programs in neuroscience, even if I was aiming for the more biological (or even computational) end of neuroscience. It's hard for me to reconcile what they say with what I read online though. How do I know who to believe? What if things have really changed that much since they were applying to/attending grad school and they're unintentionally giving me bad advice? I just can't see myself doing anything else, especially not a boring job in the business or finance world.

I don't know if any of this is relevant, but I feel like some context is helpful.  


I started my MSc in October and finished my experiments by December. Between then and now, all I've managed to achieve are graphing the results and testing for significance.

The problem is (as you may be able to tell from this paragraph!) that I don't feel able to discern good writing from bad. I am able to write quickly, but I feel like my writing quality is probably awful (although I have high standards, so maybe it is acceptable, I just can't see it).  


I need help.
-How do I stop myself freaking out and/or binning all of my work and starting again?
- Is it even possible to write a Masters thesis in about 2 weeks? Including revisions? And then being prepared to defend it?
- How can I judge if my writing is terrible, or if it's just in my head?

I applied to 3 phd programs this year and was rejected from one, accepted to one, and sort of accepted to the other.  The one I was accepted to sent an email saying, You're accepted, I will be your interim grad advisor but you should pick someone in your first semester, contact me about any questions.  Here is a TA application form, send it back if you'd like to be considered for TA-ships.""  The email also said that acceptance doesn't guarantee funding.  A few weeks later, I got an envelope in the mail with a bumper sticker and info about logins.  

I haven't heard anything about funding since then (mid-March) and there was nothing to sign or no way to indicate that I accept or decline the offer.  At the time, I spoke with my would-be advisor who said she would be a strong advocate for me for the TA-ship, which I kind of really need.  So before April 15, I emailed the interim grad advisor and asked about funding decisions and what the next steps are.  I haven't heard anything.  I emailed my advisor and asked her, and have also not heard anything, although I emailed her two days ago, so maybe she just hasn't responded.  I'm dying!  I feel like even though I was accepted, I'm not accepted or it's not going to happen or something.  Is this normal?  Please tell me it's okay!

**Edit**: So I got a response from my would-be advisor and she said she doesn't know anything yet, but that money is really tight, therefore not looking promising.  Is it reasonable to ask her whether that means no first years will get funded or what the deal is with that?

As a corollary, what if you have an NSF research grant that guarantees you $30,000 for three or five years?  Then, the school isn't paying anything, right?  Is it just assumed that tuition is covered but that there may or may not be a stipend of some sort?

I am a sophomore undergrad majoring in biology and pursuing a career in research. I'm having a weird today. On the one hand, I just secured an apartment for me and my boyfriend (yay!) but I also just got notified that I was rejected from another summer research internship that I applied to. This is the second one that has denied me, citing a high volume of applicants for a limited number of spots as the reason. I am still waiting to hear back from one more, but it is the least attractive option because this one wouldn't provide housing so I would have to come up with a plan to get there and still make money. I am taking on my own student loans so as much as I would love to just be concerned with doing something I like, making money over the summer has to be a priority for me.

I had noticed on the sites for these tow programs that I was rejected from they specifically note that the programs are designed for minority groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research to have access to graduate education. From what I'm gathering between that and the high volume of minority individuals who participate in these programs (as seen by their year to year group photos) is that while they say ""people of all groups are encouraged to apply"", what they mean is that sure, you can apply, but we won't actually care about your application if you're white.

I am a good student, I'm in the honors program at my school, and I've worked my ass off so far in college.

And like many soon-to-be graduates, I have no idea what I will do afterwards.   

When I chose my degree, literally everyone I knew (friends, family, professors) told me that, with a math degree, I could get into any industry because it was versatile.  I realized too late in my academic career that they were all wrong, and that an undergraduate degree in math is not very useful unless I combine it with something like programming or finance.  Unless I want to spend a couple more years (and a lot more money) to learn these things, my math degree is useless.

So now I am facing the very real possibility that I will have left my adequate yet boring job ($33K/year) to go back to school to get a BS, only to be qualified to be an office assistant or a cashier for $10 an hour.  I've been browsing jobs and the ones that will accept a bachelors degree in any field usually require several years of experience in something very specific.

I don't know if I should just cut my losses, leave school with the BS, and hope fervently that I will be able to find a  non-Starbucks job, or if I should try to earn a masters degree in a field that will help me apply my math skills.  (Getting into graduate school seems to be the only thing a math degree is good for.)  

I am loathe to commit to more schooling because I feel that graduate school is meant for people who are truly *passionate* about a topic, and the only thing I am passionate about is to have a career that will be intellectually stimulating. 

Have you been in this situation?  What would you do if you were me?

I live in Canada, which gives me several funding options. Applications for these are due NOW or soon. In order to apply for grants, a project proposal and supervisor is required. But, applications for admission to schools are not due until February-March and most of them say a supervisor will be chosen in the fall term, next September. I've tried contacting faculty members from the departments I'm interested in, but have had no response. Does this mean they are not accepting grad students?

I also have no idea what I should write in a ""letter of intent"". I have pestered the profs at my school enough, and have no one else to ask. If anyone with experience applying to grad school, or going through the process now, would like to talk about it, that would be awesome!

Major thesis lab issues.,Throwaway_gradschool,7,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/rgl01/i_need_your_help_major_thesis_lab_issues/,"I need your help, r/LadiesOfScience. I am confused, scared, hurt, anxious, and everything in between.

TL;DR - PI is trying to convince me to quit grad school. I have never been so sure that I want to, and can do this. Thus I am going to change my thesis lab, three years into grad school. I don't know what is going to happen, and I'm scared.

Long story short, I am thinking about dropping out of my thesis lab after spending two years in it. Am I dooming myself forever by doing this?!

I am a third year PhD candidate. My main issue is with the PI. He basically thinks that I picked the wrong career, and I should quit grad school right now. I am 200% positive that he is wrong, and the thought of actually quitting grad school never entered my mind - and that's all the while being acutely aware of today's ""situation"" in academia. Now, he is a lousy mentor - there is very little intellectual direction given, moreover I am on an ""orphan"" project so that I don't even have others to consult in the lab. I agree that yes, some people in the lab are able to function like postdocs, and admittedly I am not at that level yet. I'm definitely not the star student and I do not pretend to be, either. But... Aren't I here to learn this stuff?!

There is a long backstory of conflict here, but basically I cannot learn and grow under this PI. Whether he likes it or not, I'm moving on. I'm not sure what his reaction will be when I tell him that I am merely moving labs and not leaving school. I am really hoping that he at least supports my move, but who knows... Now, I already passed the quals. Can they kick me out of the program if he insists that I am unfit? His reasoning is anecdotal and far-fetched at best. e.g. He asked me what I like to read on a saturday night, and I answered current affairs. I love my NPR. Well. He told me that just for that answer, I should not go on any further. That if i were meant to do this, science literature relating to my topic is all I should ever want to read. Of course I read other interesting news articles besides journal articles. Does that mean that I am not tickled by science news, or that I don't like to read the literature, or that I am unsuited for this career? I don't think so. He definitely had one scenario in mind and was giving me ""examples"" to see that I should quit. I just don't see it. He also treats people very differently, and as the only student in the lab without funding, I find that I am treated quite differently than other students with funding. He is not enthusiastic about submitting a grant with me either, so.... I'm lost.

To be honest, I had a very hard time passing my quals. I was encouraged (by him) to quit then, and honestly it would have been super easy to quit then. Hell, considering the postdoc job market, the smartest thing to do probably WAS to quit. But I carried on,fought hard, and passed. Moreover, I had a very tough committee and I am quite sure that they would have failed me if they saw that I was totally unsuited for grad school as my current boss seems to think so.

I should have done this right after passing my quals, but at the time I was still (foolishly) hoping that he will start to see me and treat me as a hard-working, eager student with potential whom just need to be mentored and groomed. 

Last time he gave me this talk, I doubted myself. I wondered, oh, maybe I really don't belong here. However, after spending another year in the trenches, I'm more sure than ever that I do belong here and can do great things, if trained to my full potential. I am just hoping that it is not too late to try to find a mentor who can do just that... 

Sorry about ranting... I just need some words of courage from you guys. I will fight with him, and the school, until I can find another thesis lab that can actually TRAIN me. I'm scared to have to make this big change after two long, long, long years, but I will not give up my destiny because I don't fit someone else's unrealistic idea of what a perfect student should be. Of course, it was my fault that I chose the wrong lave and the wrong PI, but things looked a whole lot different when I first joined.",,False,,t5_2sg5m,False,,,True,t3_rgl01,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/rgl01/i_need_your_help_major_thesis_lab_issues/,

[This graph](http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/A3pdmygCQAAfGvp.png) from my former institution inspired me to knock one out for my current department. Bear in mind that the linked graph includes the more 'female' faculties of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and 'female' departments like nursing and pharmacy. 

[This](http://imgur.com/eOJcj) one is for a psychology/cognitive neuro department, where I am currently. The largest group in raw numbers is the PhD students, with 24 people. The smallest is the professors, with 7 people. The crossover is showing up a bit later but that is probably due to undergrad psychology and biology being very female-dominated, leading to higher proportions of female PhD students and research fellows. The dataset is also pretty small. It would be interesting to see how things are in other departments.

It makes me so frustrated to see this because although the department is small this state of affairs is not anomalous. Platitudes about trends changing don't make me feel better since there's no guarantee that things will be more evenly distributed in 15 years.

Hi LoS,

My PI from my undergrad research has asked me (along with several other alumni from our lab) to write him a recommendation of sorts; he is applying for Assistant Professor status, and wants ""a few comments about [him] as a professor/mentor/whatever.”

Have any of you ever been asked to do this? He’s asked for it to be on letterhead from the school at which I’m currently employed, to be as official as possible. I’m wondering how much he wants me to write. I have looked up online instructions for people writing letters of recommendation, but I don’t want to be too formal. I also want to make sure I give him all the information he’s requested though!

I had a great research experience in his lab, and I’m happy to write this “blurb” for him. Is it bad to err on the side of formal and write a more lengthy letter? Any advice LoS?

Thanks for your help. (: I love this subreddit.

Really. I've failed all my classes last fall semester (none of which had anything to do with my major), so I transferred to a better school, tested out of some classes I failed and signed up for the Physics program. Well, last spring semester at new university, I failed all my classes, save for the one class that would've counted toward my major had I not audited it. 

This semester, I made the mistake of taking a physics class I wasn't mathematically prepared for (I'm taking the calculus class that is a ""prerequisite"" for this physics course) and I'm not doing so well. Turns out some of the math goes way over my head, and despite my studying, I don't feel prepared for my test tomorrow. But I'll keep trying and I'm more than willing to retake it next semester when I've finished this math course I'm not even enrolled in.

So, this semester is botched. 

But I absolutely love what I'm learning. I love discovering new math and applying it, I love trying to wrap my head around this new physics, but I'm going about it wrong. I feel like I'm stuck in a system I can't work with, and it's confusing. But there's really no other option, I have to figure it out, because there's no such thing as a physicist's apprentice.

I can do the work, I can apply myself. I don't know what my problem is, regardless I'm a complete failure. I can't obviously finish a degree like this. I can't ever find motivation to do anything but learn the raw material. 

I dunno, just beat some sense into me. Or tell me to quit. I just need something.

* When I was applying for the Master's program, I asked my PI for a LOR.  He said something along the lines of ""fine, but you have to tell me what to write.""  Umm...  Well, I ended up not using him as a reference because I didn't feel like it was ethical for me to write my own application.  I'm not confident I got in because I couldn't get a rec from him.
* I didn't get the research grant the all the seniors in my school are ""guaranteed"" to get.  Honestly, I personally do not know anybody who hasn't gotten it - although I know someone who have failed organic chem and physics (got the grant still) and someone else who hasn't had any research experience.  A few days ago, I asked the grant decision staff member if she can give me any recommendations for improving my application for future reference.  First she says ""well, sometimes there's nothing you CAN do, the decision is weighted 50% student app and 50% faculty app.""  Then she pulls up my file and tells me, ""I'm sorry, but I have no recommendations for you.""  Yep, I forgot to mention that my professor made me sit in his office and tell me what to write for his portion of the application.  Of course, I felt uncomfortable, but he submitted after 2 hours of me reading aloud the questions on a computer screen.
* I've been applying to other research jobs that use my skills, but I just got rejected from one today. :(
* I am pretty sure I want to quit my lab because I feel like my PI doesn't care about anything I do and wants to use me for his own benefit... at the consequence of my personal aspirations and opportunities.

Currently, I really don't mind that I'm not getting my MA/MSc while I'm in undergrad anymore... because I'm so dejected about my lack of fruitful research and a decent lab - I may not be able to graduate with honors because I am not happy in my lab and I may not be able to have a group where I can complete my senior year thesis.

I come from a very tight knit family, and I'm finishing my undergrad in my hometown. I stayed here for family reasons; there are very many medical and financial issues within my family and I've made a point of staying here to help out wherever I can. It's a holding-down-the-fort kind of thing.

Now I'm stuck trying to decide between three graduate programs. Two are in my hometown, one is about 5 hours away. Each program is in a different field-- I've been in a highly interdisciplinary program, and my choices are going to be between earth sciences, environmental chemistry, and ocean engineering. Each of these programs comes with great funding and fantastic advisors, and I could see myself in any of these fields and their associated projects.

Which leaves me in the difficult position of, first and foremost, where to live for the next five years. I don't want to stay at home and end up feeling resentful that I still haven't left because I'm sticking with my family. And I don't want to leave and kick myself for abandoning my family's problems at home.

I feel like I can't really hold an honest discussion about this with either my family or with my potential advisors. It's my choice and everyone involved is waiting for my decision, and it's putting far too much pressure on me to try and think through it myself.

Has anyone here been through a similar situation? I know SO's are discussed pretty frequently here and in other forums, but I feel like this is a different kind of situation-- it's parents, siblings, and other family members, with medical and financial problems all rolled into one.

This is a throwaway. I graduated in May with a BSc degree in science from a small liberal arts school. I majored in Physics and Chemistry, and know multiple languages. I did research every summer and participated in REUs. I had a pretty decent GPA and strong extracurriculars. However I am struggling hard to find a job right now that is somewhat related to what I want to do. After working on my thesis, I fell in love with renewable energy. I would love to find a job in that field that isn't sales, but I am not an electrical engineer. I don't know if I am being too particular (solar energy, preferably a city and not sales) or what. I am still looking at jobs that are just science-y jobs. I wake up, look for jobs, write cover letters, and apply. I have gotten project chemist jobs in the midwest, but I'm from a major city in the Northeast (NYC) and would like to stay around here. My college doesn't have the strongest alumni network outside of its area, and I am trying to network.

I am so frustrated. I just don't know what to do to find a job, especially as a female physicist (without a PhD). I didn't want to go straight into grad school, and deferred my admissions. Now I'm starting to regret that decision. I am firm in the fact that I want practical experience for a year and a chance to not be burn-out before starting grad school in Physics.

So I'm headed for my first big-girl job interview today. It's for a professorship and a smaller teaching college so it's a multi-day campus visit where I will be meeting with and talking with a lot of different faculty members. One of my deal breakers for any job situation is going to be the ability for my boyfriend to get a job in the local area of the schools I'm applying to, whether it is a job at the university itself or something near by because we have prioritizes staying together geographically as well as relationship-wise.

With that in mind, I want to use this visit as an oppotunity to get a sense of the local job market as well as a sense if the college is willing to anything dual-career wise because he's also preparing for a career in academic. I know I'm not at the point where I should straight out ask for a position for him, so I'd like to see if the school has done anything previously for new hires.

So I want to know how you ladies have approached issues like these before. Like, who would be the best people to talk to and glean information from. Also, I don't know if I should call my boyfriend ""my boyfriend"" during the next few days. I feel like that could imply that we aren't super serious, when we really are. But I don't want to straight up lie and call him my husband and I'm afraid the work ""fiance"" will make people think I'm going to get married and have babies really soon. So I think I'm going to use ""partner"" but I just wanted to see if you all had any input/opinions on this question, too.

Thanks!",,False,,t5_2sg5m,False,,,True,t3_12nwna,http://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/12nwna/on_campus_visitsjob_interviews_how_do_your_ladies/,

I've been accepted to an MSc Environmental Science and Mgmt program. In the past several years, I've been involved in disaster mitigation/rehab work and have been an environmental journalist with tons of professional trainings/ seminars in this field so I'm not exactly going into this program with zero knowledge. I must admit that my field work experience is above average and the uni that accepted me thought so too. 

However, this is grad school with a different environment than I'm used to. My professional life was more in the social science field and my BA was cultural and postcolonial studies. One thing good though about this MSc program is its mix of hard and social sciences, which will give me a lot of leeway in my studies. I know my strengths and limits - I'm not very good at hard maths and but I can do some biology, chemistry, and physics. (I'm thinking of focusing my studies on environmental services and payments and conservation, which is more social sciencey. But I'm also interested in other fields of envi science too and I hope I can explore them in the future).

Overall, I'm very excited about this opportunity. But science grad school is alien to me and honestly, I'm quite concerned about the sexism there. Any advice on what I should expect? Are there other ladies of science here who switched from the humanities to the scientific field? And if so, how was it for you?
