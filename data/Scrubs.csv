Half jokingly, I suggested Zach Braff. She loved the idea, so now I'm trying to figure out a way to contact him. I tried DMing him on Twitter, but understandably, I didn't get a reply. I imagine he gets too many messages on there to see them all or even close to all.

This started out as a joke (since he is a celebrity after all), but I really want this to happen or at least leave no stone unturned in trying to make it happen. Everyone in my family is a huge Scrubs fan. In fact, my cousins and I first started bonding after we discovered our mutual affection for the show. I just love the quirky humor of the show, but I imagine that the doctors in my family (big sister and fiancee plus a cousin in med school and another cousin and little sister premeds) get an extra kick out of the medical humor. I would love to have Zach officiate my wedding, but I especially want it because of how ecstatic my family would be over it.

Anyone in the reddit community know how I can make it happen, or at least make sure Zach gets the request?

Thanks,
K

Update: I received his agent's info. I was in the process of composing an email when my sister spotted this:

“@SammieeDarlingg: hey @zachbraff want to marry me &amp; my fiancé?” perform the ceremony, or be in a committed threesome type sitch?

That isn't me, so someone is trying to steal my idea. I'd appreciate anyone here making sure Zach Braff realizes that.

I am now incredibly sad that it's over (I know, two years late). I am glad that they ended the show well, talking about season 8 lol. Didn't leave us hanging, but also didn't just hurriedly tell us every little detail of the characters' futures. As lame as it sounds, and I'm sure many here feel the same, but I really related to JD. I watched this show nearly everyday, up to like, five episodes a day for so long. Now that I've finished, I'm just sad to see it end.

It's most likely going to come across as a big, unorganized jumble of words, but I need to communicate what happened and how I'm feeling.

Scrubs was a show that struck a balance between comedy and drama quite well, and that really drew me to it. I only started watching it recently thanks to the magic of Netflix and fell quickly in love. 

That's only relevant because it was the comedic elements that really drew me in. It's the dramatic and deep moments that caused this...

I dealt with them pretty easily, because they were the basic dramatic elements that you would expect from a hospital show. *(Kinda)*

However, one episode really stuck with me: Season 8, Episode 2. The whole morbid concept really hit me in a way that no other episode did. The fact that we live and try to accomplish so much stuff in this life only for it to end without much of a big deal *(unless you're a president, etc.)* really hit home.

It's been leading me to question why I do anything if in 200 years no one will know who I am or really care about me, just like how no one really cared about George's death.

I don't know, guys. Maybe this isn't appropriate for this sub. However, since this show is what caused this mindset, I figured I might as well post it here.",,False,,t5_2rs5a,False,,,True,t3_1i96ic,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/1i96ic/scrubs_has_made_me_depressed/,

What characters, episodes, jokes, etc. did you think they just failed at? One thing for me, was how really dismissive JD was to his father and brother. Even if they weren't the best, it took quite a bit(his dad's death even) for him to even show the least bit of love for them. This coming from JD, who was supposed to be a really caring person. I was also a little unhappy that Todd never really got deeper(in your endo) as a character, even though seemingly every other main character did.

It's a great show, but there is something fairly unique about this sitcom.  Many shows (even if enjoyable), maintain the same characters with no changes (e.g., Everybody Loves Raymond) or allow the characters to become extreme over-the-top extremes (e.g., The Office-USA version).  They play it safe or try to milk what they think is the selling point of the series. Scrubs does something that you rarely see in television (at the moment, I can only think of Breaking Bad, Community, and Game of Thrones), but the characters actually change.  Not just themselves, but their relationships with others.  That is quite an achievement for any show, but especially noteworthy for a sitcom.  I can't think of many shows that accomplished this--maybe Cheers and Mash.  It's damn impressive. If they were lazy, you'd see the same dynamics play between the characters Dr. Cox/J.D. as an obvious example.  Or worse, they become over-the-top.  Have to love this show for ""taking the risk"" of character/relationship development.

I think that we can all relate to Scrubs in some form or fashion - for some of us, we're experiencing it for the first time. For some of us, it was a staple of our adolescence. For some of us, it was a reminder that, despite all of life's little ups and downs, you've got to stop and have fun. Whether we were watching Hooch be tormented, singing along to ""Steak Night"", or crying with the show's many losses, we all have a bond in some form or fashion to this show.

I think that we can all remember the songs of Scrubs as well. I think we can all remember the first time we heard ""Stolen"" by Dashboard Confessional playing during that huge moment involving Elliot or Josh Radin's song ""Winter"" playing during (arguably) one of the show's saddest moments.

For the above reasons, I have compiled a list of the songs from Scrubs into one giant Spotify playlist. I was tired of seeing half-finished playlists filled with only the creator's favorite songs. As the old adage goes, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. I went show by show, taking each song from each episode and making a playlist.

There are a few songs that aren't listed. You can see the full list of songs that I'm missing [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/qjv6b/finally_a_complete_soundtrack_though_im_still/). I have personally (and successfully) reached out to Cary Brothers and Keren DeBerg. They have both graciously agreed to make their older work available on Spotify just so they can be included on this playlist (and so you can check out the rest of their work - as you should.)

I'm constantly updating and checking to see if Spotify has added more tracks. In the most recent update, they finally added ""All in my Head"" by Shawn Mullins (which was an early version only available on the Scrubs soundtrack), ""Overkill"" by Colin Hay, ""Hallelujah"" by John Cale, and a few others. The playlist currently holds 297 songs from Scrubs for a total of 18 hours.

Spotify is required to listen to this playlist. It's free to download and sign up/listen. If you want to listen to Spotify on a mobile device, you will have to pay for a premium subscription ($9.99/month). 

To check out the playlist and listen to every amazing song from Scrubs, click [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/djxjd/playlist/5UAC7ZLZZIVqdnzMDMNZYp) and click ""Subscribe"" so you can stay on top of all of the updates.

I thought, to celebrate/mourn the occasion, we could talk about what we were doing on that day and what My Finale meant to us.

For me, at the time, it was like the end of the world (I am a teenage girl so I feel everything about 1000x stronger than normal people). I spent the run up to that fateful day warning all my loved ones that I was about to die and writing on the wall in my classroom at school 'MAY 6TH WILL BE THE END' in  a red pen made to resemble blood. Then, on May 7th (had to wait until it was on the internet), I took the day off school, watched it on repeat and cried for eight hours (like I said: teenage girl. Melodrama is what I do best.) But dramatics aside, it was the perfect ending to a perfect show and My Finale was a momentous TV event that will go down in history. It still gives me shivers to think about it and I don't think it could have been done any better.

So what did it mean to y'all?",,False,,t5_2rs5a,False,,,True,t3_t9pjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/t9pjl/my_finale_aired_for_the_first_time_three_years/,

If a few record audio messages I will string them together and also link that too.

I just wanted to say Thank You everyone who worked on Scrubs for making a 20 something grown man laugh and cry for nine years and continue to do so, and wish you all the best.

Being a huge fan, I would go out of my way often to pass by in hopes of getting a glimpse of the shoot (which you rarely could, they kept it tightly under wraps).  However, I did manage to run into Ken Jenkins (Dr. Kelso) twice, and Sarah Chalke (Elliot) stopped into the coffee shop where I worked a few times.  It was awesome, she kinda flirted with me.  Damn the age difference...

Anyway, I rode by the hospital on my bike about a year ago to see what they'd done since the series ended.  Sadly, I saw that they were tearing it down.  The ""North Hollywood Medical Center"" sign had been torn in half, and the walls of the 2nd and 3rd floors were completely ripped off.  As for the rest of it, the grounds were simply dilapidated.  Patches of the parking lot had grown over with grass and the main gates were beginning to rust over.  Without a guard at the security entrance, the barbed wire over the fences seemed less mysterious and more frightening.  I stopped for a while to soak it in.  It was sad, really.

This was a strange moment for me.  I was a year out of high school, but nothing had ever made me feel older.  A huge timestamp on my childhood was falling apart in front of my eyes.  In a few years time it will be as if it never existed.  But I was lucky, I got to see it as it was.  At least I have that.

So that's my story.  It's been a while since I passed it last, but that's what has become of it.

1370917362.0,62,self.Scrubs,1g3aqs,Janitor Fan Theory,Iamyourbetter,71,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/1g3aqs/janitor_fan_theory/,"This was inspired by another redditor's comment (I don't remember the name of the user).
Edit: this redditor made a comment asking if the Janitor was a physics major, citing my example from Season 4 Episode 1. He/she was the catalyst of this theory.

This explains exactly why the Janitor is a janitor. There really isn't much we know about the Janitor because most of what the character tells us is a lie or cannot be confirmed. But sometimes the Janitor will manifest who he really was in a subtle or insignificant way.

The first look we have into the Janitor's past is that he went to college. My theory for this comes from the episode ""My Lucky Night"" (S3E4). During this episode J.D. poses the riddle: ""I have two coins that total to thirty cents; one of them is not a nickel. What are they?"" While the Janitor and cafeteria aide Troy are frustratingly going through a pile of coins the Janitor says, ""Come on, you can do this. You went to Harvard for God's sake."" When he says this he isn't speaking to Troy but to himself. From this we can assume, since the Janitor isn't actually messing with anyone, that this is a factual statement.

The second look we have into the Janitor's past is what he did in college. This is revealed in the episode ""My Bright Idea"" (S5E16) when the Janitor states he used to be a world class 110 meter hurdler at the age of 19, even going far enough as to claim he was at a national competition. At first one could claim he is just messing with J.D., but at the end of the episode the Janitor proves he is capable of running a 110 meter hurdle in approximately 10 seconds. It is even possible that the Janitor's athletic ability helped him get into Harvard.

What also helped get the Janitor into Harvard was his intelligence, specifically in physics. The Janitor has shown evidence that he has an above average understanding of mechanical physics. My first example comes from the episode ""My Own Personal He'll"" (S5E14) when the Janitor hurls a cantelope over the hospital and lands a direct hit on J.D. This demonstrates both his athletic prowess and a seemingly expert knowledge of trajectory. My second example comes from the episode ""My Old Friend's New Friend"" (S4E1). The Janitor paints a seemingly random X in the parking lot. But what occurs is a prank done with precise calculations. J.D.'s scooter is attached to a chain long enough for his scooter to reach
cruising velocity, of which the Janitor must have had knowledgeable information (possibly researched beforehand). When the scooter is suddenly brought to a stop J.D. is launched through the air and lands precisely on the X. The Janitor precisely calculated J.D.'s initial launching velocity with an excellent approximation of his mass and the distance his body would travel through space to the exact coordinates.

If the Janitor was such a gifted athlete and physics student, then why did the Janitor end up as a Janitor? It was because he had another dream besides track and physics: acting. This is made evident from the episode ""My Friend the Actor"" (S3E8) where the Janitor is revealed to have played a minor character in the movie The Fugitive. The Janitor dropped out of school to pursue his acting career scoring the role of a police officer in the famous movie. But this is the closest he ever got. Acting never panned out and the Janitor was never able to get back into school. So he eventually had to settle for an entry level position as a Janitor. But his creativity and intellect still are made manifest (drill-fork, knife-wrench, his elaborate pranks, taxidermy). 

TL,DR: The Janitor used to be a physics student and track star at Harvard, but left to pursue an acting career that ultimately failed leading to his life as a blue collar worker.",,False,,t5_2rs5a,1370917598.0,,,True,t3_1g3aqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/1g3aqs/janitor_fan_theory/,

For me it's always been a toss up between Brendan Fraser as Ben and Michael J Fox as Dr. Kevin Casey. I really like them both because they actually affect the story line in subtle ways.

With Ben's death you finally see Dr. Cox as vulnerable and in my opinion start to care about him more as Bill Lawrence and the writers started to give him more heartfelt stories than in previous seasons but still few enough that his character didn't change to much. It was like a gradual change the occurs while you get to know someone better.

With Kevin he really taught J.D. that he's going to need to stand on his own 2 feet and can't always rely on people. While this doesn't drastically change J.D. it does open up his story lines a little more as they explore this aspect. Kevin also touches each person in the hopsital.

TL;DR: Ben and Kevin for the lessons they teach and the characters they change.

Edit: I just noticed that Michael J Fox's episodes are the 2 which directly precede Brendan Fraser's final one. What a great run of guest stars.

Edit 2: Wow these are all great. Thanks for answering everyone!",,False,,t5_2rs5a,1370482321.0,,,True,t3_1fpkw7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/1fpkw7/who_is_your_favorite_recurring_character/,

This one's a personal favourite, so I'mma start with it...

&gt;*Now, what do you want me to say? That you're great? That you're raising the bar for interns everywhere?* 

&gt;(I'm cool with that.)
&gt;
&gt;*I'm not gonna say that. You're okay. You might be better than that someday; but right now, all I see is a guy who's so worried about what everybody else thinks of him that he has no real belief in himself. I mean, did you even wonder why I told you to do your own evaluation?* 

&gt;(I-I can't think of a safe answer. I just figured---)
&gt;
&gt;*Clam up! I wanted you to think about yourself -- and I mean really think. What are you good at? What do you suck at? And then I wanted you to put it down on paper. And not so I could see it, and not so anybody else could see it, but so that you could see it. Because, ultimately, you don't have to answer to me, and you don't have to answer to Kelso, you don't even have to answer to your patients, for God's sake! You only have to answer to one guy, Newbie, and that's you!*
&gt;
&gt;*There. You. Are.... Evaluated.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Now get the hell outta my sight. You honest-to-God get me so angry, I'm afraid I just might hurt myself.*

But on Netflix, a completely different song is playing during that scene, that just does not capture the mood at all, and in my opinion it's made the episode completely unwatchable. I know how copyright laws work, and that it's probably because they couldn't get the rights to the original song for airing on Netflix or whatever, and I know it's just a small thing, but I just needed to rant for a minute.

I love the cast and the new stories. Knowing a few people in life that are exactly like Cole, I feel the writers and Dave Franco just nailed the character. My other favorite character was Drew, who was an aspiring, thirty-something version of Dr. Cox. It was fun to see their relationship progress.
