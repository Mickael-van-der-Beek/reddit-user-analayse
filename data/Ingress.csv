I recognize Chevy Impala headlights and start to think how I'm going to explain to the officer what I'm doing at 2 in the morning.

He walks up and asked if that is my car. Yes. He says they got a call about someone here earlier, and I begin to explain to him about Ingress and why they might be seeing people here at odd times. He pulls out his phone and nods along, listening. In a break in my explanation, he flips his phone around to face me showing the Ingress app open showing the surrounding streets. ""You mean this game?"" he asks. I  stare in awe for a moment and then we both laugh. We stand and talk about Ingress, our city, and phones for 20 minutes while I establish my fields. I come to find that we had talked a couple times before in our G+ community and that when he saw my car in the parking lot he remembered I had said that I was on my way here and decided to stop by. 
We walk back to our cars, say goodbye, and drive off. Me to home, he to continue his patrol until 6 AM. 

I love this game.

This is a quick list of things that might help you stay out of trouble.
 
* It is important to remember that you are doing nothing wrong and that you do not intend to do anything wrong or illegal.
* Know the game. Know how it works. Be able to explain what it is. Mention that it's made by Google. Google is a buzz word that people know. Mention that it's being played by thousands of people all over the world. This will likely be new to them. They will have no idea what you are talking about. Be patient with them. Never get frustrated with their questions.
* Stay calm. Do not look guilty or shifty. Smile and keep the mood light.
* Always be extremely polite. Talk to them as if they are your friend. Make them feel like you are on their side of the situation. And yes, there is always ""sides"" in a situation. Both are in the police officers mind. One side is ""I'm going to have to arrest these people."" the other is ""These people are likely okay, but I might have to tell them to move along."" For the most part, the police would rather tell you to move along than arrest you.
* DO NOT MENTION THE WORDS HACKING. If you are showing them the game, do not show them the part of the game where you ""HACK"" a portal. You can broadly mention that in the game you ""take over"" or ""capture"" these things called ""portals"".
* If they feel like you've genuinely made a mistake they will likely just tell you to move along and not to return. If the do that, answer, ""Absolutely. Thank you, We can go?"" and if they say, ""Yes."" or wave you along or whatever, pack up your stuff an go. You may technically have a right to be there and you aren't doing anything wrong, but there is no winning when arguing with a cop, especially at night.
 
**==== IMPORTANT ====**

**Trespassing at night**

*Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, loiters or prowls at night on the property of another person near a dwelling-house situated on that property is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.*
 
*Trespassing at night* is an actual law in Canada. It is written in the books as above. What it means is that just being on a person's lawn at night gives the right to police to question you. You might not get arrested (though it's possible) you'll still have to deal with them and they will be a more aggressive  with you than if you are just loitering on the street. Essentially, stay off of other people's property.

**Remember there is no reason to start a fight or an argument with the police over a game. You don't need to ""fight for your rights"" or ""stand your ground against authority"", or whatever, over this. We are talking about a game here. You are not protesting against the government or anything. Sure you may be allowed to be where you are, but there are more portals throughout the town/city and you are wasting time letting the other team win if you are tied up with the police.**

It was very early and in a strange area. I thought to myself that it must be a technician of some sort, because no one commutes out there and they can pick the start of their day. Probably a repairman or something. This was at 7am.

Around noon I decided to venture out to what I thought would be his next possible target on his lunchbreak. It was actually 1230, so I was starting to doubt myself, but I also knew that technicians can run late and then have to lunch late. 

About 1 minute away from my portal I get the whistle of a new email. Niantic Ops. He's just destroyed one of my resonators. I drive by and see some mofo holding two phones.

If you do this, seriously you are an asshat. I have more than two phones. I use one. I don't care if you downvote me for saying you are an asshat because a downvote doesn't change the fact you are a cheating asshat. This isn't some game where you make an extra account as a mule or something. This is farming for extra crap and doing more damage than you could normally do. I play alone and I have covered so much damned area playing fair and it's complete BS to lose my work to cheaters.

I clandestinely hid out and replaced all of my resonators. Then he moved to a different one and I went inside a building and did the same because he switched to his other account when his first ran out of bursters and XM.

I successfully defended both of these portals which are in a complete pain in the ass location against a cheater.

Then I reported him. And I took pictures as well. If you cheat, there are people like me who will report you and for good cause. I hope they ban him.

I decided I'd sign up for the beta to give it a try thinking to myself ""I probably won't get accepted, this seems like something extremely popular, so I'll be down in the list.""  20 minutes later, I get the email that says I'm in and to start setting everything up.

I got a rush of excitement as well as a bit of fear, because I would have to go outside, leaving my safe area.  I set everything up and did the tutorial to the best of my ability while in my house.  Then came the time for me to step outside to do something and it took me a few hours (and a bit of medication) to calm down enough to step outside.  There was a portal actually pretty close to my house and I decided to give it a try.  I hacked it, claimed it and figured out the basics.  I didn't know that it would broadcast the announcement of claiming my first portal, but it did and then the notifications popped up of people congratulating me and it felt...good.

I started talking with some of the people in comms and explaining my situation a bit and everyone was so nice, and helpful. Pointing me to the community for the local faction's G+ pages, giving me tips, offering to help me level if I was ever around their neck of the woods.  It was nice to see people being helpful and supportive around me.  In the short time I've been playing I've made a few friends with people around my area and even got a few of my other friends involved and now we go out a couple times a week to farm or to poke at the opposing factions portals (we're pretty low level in a rather fortified area of opposition).

For all this, I wanted to say ""Thank you"" from the bottom of my heart to the people who developed this as well as the people in my area who have helped me along the way and made this a blast. I have a reason and an actual want to leave the house now, and I honestly think this is helping me come out of my shell a bit and get through my mental problems.

tl:dr - Thank you Niantic, for making a game that has helped me through my anxiety.

I'm sure someone will have this info up in a much prettier format, but I figured I'd go over a few interesting bits that the devs spoke about, starting with the most interesting (to me).

* The team has ""a lot of cool ideas"" for missions tab. Custom missions for large cities, scavenger hunts, tasks, trophies, and achievements. Also possible plans to expand levels past 8. Mentioned an example of an exploration ""trophy"" such as collecting important keys in famous cities (Paris was the example).

* In the future, more tactical decisions, more shield types, a ""rock paper scissors"" dynamic. A lot of room for exploration.

* Talked about how they deal with cheating right now. NIA OPS and an automated algorithm that detects cheating. Proprietary stuff. Combination of human investigation and technical tools, will improve in the future. Says they're being pretty conservative at the moment - as they get more data, they'll start handing out more severe punishment.ï»¿ They stress to submit *any* suspected cheating. The more reports they get, the better they can deal with it.

* Looking into Inventory management, NFC integration mentioned as an idea - Brandon Badger suggested that the possibility of transferring items to physical objects such as NFC bracelets could be a cool thing.

* iOS version is on roadmap, but they're not there yet. Field Trip being developed.

* The team is working really hard right now. No. 1 priority is to improve infrastructure, open it up to wider playerbase. Working really hard on improving gameplay and fixing bugs.

* Brian Rose skims Reddit. Hi Brian!

1354882263.0,115,self.Ingress,14fvfg,Cheating on an epic scale,garzz,138,23,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/14fvfg/cheating_on_an_epic_scale/,"tldr:  JSON data showing a cheater cheating with two accounts, then switching one account to the other side, changing names, and attempting to manipulate players to help his main account.


Here is my story, Reddit.  Since I started playing I have constantly had to deal with a gps spoofer.  It is done on a massive scale.  All of Southern Illinois is covered with fields created by tlp09, formerly known as Damagickid.  Like many other gps spoofers, all his resonators are directly in the center of the portal, making it somewhat obvious.  His first account, Damagickid, was called out heavily for cheating since his timestamps also made it obvious.  After a couple days, he stopped using this account and switched to tlp09.  He is now much more careful but still makes a few mistakes.  


I really wouldnât mind it so much if he didnât cover multiple towns with a single field, rendering the vast majority of portals useless for linking.  Itâs as if he doesnât realize that you get the same amount of AP for any size of field.  He could level so much faster if he just used all existing portals.  It would also let other people actually play the game without driving 45 minutes to take out one of his ridiculous portals two counties away.


I knew he was gps spoofing, but I wanted to see it for myself.  A couple days ago I went for a drive to watch him take back some of my portals.  Sure enough, there was nobody there when he took the three different portals I was watching.  I angrily called him out in chat, and of course he denied it saying I had no proof.  Well he was correct, I had no proof.  But now I do.  Here is your fucking proof.


To make this happen, I needed timestamps.  The chat log on ingress.com/intel only lists timestamps for the current day, but I knew they must be hidden in there somewhere, likely in the JSON data.  (BTW, player locations are no longer reported in the JSON data, only portal locations.)  I used Wireshark to capture the relevant data.  Here is an example: [Wireshark](http://i.imgur.com/oIdQm)


The highlighted field, Number value, is actually a 13 digit timestamp.  I used [this](http://www.googlemodules.com/module/1443/) to convert these back to readable times.  It gives the time down to the millisecond.


[Example 1.](http://i.imgur.com/3wY3M) My fellow resistance member, probers1, knew from the very beginning.  I went back and grabbed the timestamps from the JSON.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/PCxZS) is Mt. Vernon at 1353559781987, which converts to 11/21, 22:49:41.  [Next](http://i.imgur.com/dBP9P) is Harrisburg, which is at 1353560054923.  It converts to 11/21 22:54:14.  According to Google Maps, the drive should take 1 hour 10 minutes.  He made it in about 5 minutes.


The next [example](http://i.imgur.com/7vB9E) is of the tlp09 account.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GHnKo) is the Wireshark capture from Harrisburg at 1354499216673, 12/2 19:46:56.  And [here](http://i.imgur.com/BToSW) is Johnston City at 1354499868661, 12/2 19:57:48.  According to Google Maps, it takes 32 minutes.  He made it in 11.


This next example is the most apparent of all, and also shows how I discovered that tlp09 and Damagickid are actually the same person.  
[First](http://i.imgur.com/5p9ID), tlp09 was in Du Quoin, IL at 1353914348696, 11/26 01:19:08.  17 minutes later, Damagickid [appeared](http://i.imgur.com/dwm65) in St. Louis, MO at 1353915385259, 11/26 01:36:25.  He stopped at 01:42, and 2 minutes later [switched](http://i.imgur.com/LdEZY) to tlp09 at 1353915890555, 11/26 01:44:50.


I saw this one the night it happened, so I have a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/5h3nZ) from ingress.com/intel as well.  It shows how Damagickid suddenly stopped, and then switched to tlp09.  If they were in fact two different people, it would have been a mix of them both taking portals, not dozens of activities from one immediately followed by dozens of activities from the other.  Further evidence that it is the same person can be found on Damagickids Youtube page, where you can find that his initials are actually tlp.  


Later that same day, 11/26, all resonators placed by Damagickid were removed by bubbagrump, who is also an enlightened player, and must therefore have been a mod.  For quite a while after the Damagickid account disappeared I assumed he had been banned.  I just recently realized what had happened.  He did a faction change and name change on the account, which is now known as heiscoming.  The following three screenshots show that heiscoming is the owner of three portals along with the dates he took them.  [One](http://i.imgur.com/0U1Du) [Two](http://i.imgur.com/vmFtx) [Three](http://i.imgur.com/UpW5v)


The only person active on those days was Damagickid.  There is nothing in the logs that shows heiscoming ever deploying a single resonator.  As far as I can tell, heiscoming never existed before 11/27, the day after all the Damagickid resonators got removed.  He now only ever destroys resonators and never places any of his own.  No real player would operate like this.  He is using this account to spy on our faction channel and remove his own old links which are now in his way.  He has also been attempting to manipulate players into helping him.


Until Google finds a way to stop this sort of thing there doesnât really seem to be a point in playing.  I may continue to play in my own town for now, but Iâm done driving half way across the state to remove links that cover dozens of nearby portals.  


Check out Southern Illinois on the map to see what Iâm dealing with.  To my Illinois friends, be warned that this guy is the owner of The Enlightened of Illinois G+ page.


All of my screenshots can be verified by looking at the JSON data.  These are just a few examples, many more actually exist.


To those of you out there dealing with cheaters of your own, you can check old timestamps using Wireshark, hopefully someone at Google will eventually listen.

    }

Looking at the code from the APK, link amplifiers will have rarity just like shields. They also seem to have a LINK_RANGE_MULTIPLIER statistic. Other upcoming mod statistics may also include REMOVAL_RESISTANCE and REMOVAL_STICKINESS. I guess those will make it more difficult to destroy/remove them? No details in the code about how those work, though.

Basically, the more Link Amplifiers you have added to your portal, the further the links can go. The LINK_RANGE_MULTIPLIER of all of them is summed, then the maximum link distance is multiplied by a factor of:

    total_multiplier / num_amplifiers * diminishing_returns[num_amplifiers] / 1000

instead of just 1000.

1356203322.0,82,self.Ingress,15ahb3,I'm done with Ingress for a while,sparr,140,58,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/15ahb3/im_done_with_ingress_for_a_while/,"Ingress appealed to me a lot. Augmented Reality Games are interesting to me, and Alternate Reality Games as well. Combining the two had a lot of potential. Unfortunately Google managed to get the very basics of each genre right but then completely dropped the ball when it came to interesting game mechanics or learning from other AugRG or AltRGs from the past. Here's why I'm going to stop playing Ingress for a while (maybe a few weeks or months), and what I think needs to change about the game to make it work better, especially as it reaches a larger player count.

1) There are a lot of territory-capturing games out there that involve connecting nodes/flags/portals/whatever together. A core premise that Google has missed here is that of ""front lines"" and ""safe areas"". There should be clearly defined and obvious areas of conflict, where offensive and defensive action can be concentrated. In most games of this type of territory grabbing, this is accomplished by only allowing attacks along territory borders. Borders can be defined as where territories meet, or where there are [potential] connections between nodes of opposite alignment. In Ingress, considering how fields are defined, non-border portals could easily be defined as portals that are completely surrounded by fields. If attacks and/or hacks on such non-border portals were disallowed, or greatly discouraged or made less effective or incentivized, then players could put a lot more thought and effort into planning defensive perimeters and avenues of attack. Another potential definition would be portals that you could link from, which is to say you could only attack portals that, if captured, you have the range (and key?) to link them to an existing friendly portal. Allowing one high level player to travel directly to the center of enemy territory and attack important portals with impunity removes a lot of potential strategy and tactics from the game.

2) The puzzle solving and code collecting part of the game is fundamentally broken. ""Media"" in the game is almost always useless by the time it is collected (because the associated puzzle has already been solved), but there's no way for a player to know that without either viewing spoilers online or solving the puzzle just to find out that the resulting code is expired. This could be abated in many ways. Codes linked to physical locations (like the Zipcar promotional codes) could require physical proximity to redeem. Codes resulting from media clues could be keyed to single instances of media, requiring players to find the media to get a code.

3) The interface to the game is annoyingly split. There is no reason to not provide access to the Intel Map information from within the mobile app. Players who can switch between the game and a browser, or who have a second device to view the intel map on, have a very strong advantage. Why not just allow the app to be zoomed out and display intel map information above the current zoom limit?

4) The game encourages unsafe and irresponsible behavior. Playing while driving is the most efficient approach, and will lead to accidents. Driving farther than otherwise necessary just to play the game produces additional traffic, pollution, etc. One weak but simple solution that comes to mind is to limit in-game character movement to a certain speed. If you drive somewhere, then you have to wait for your character to walk (or take some futuristic slow transportation system) there. Some allowance would need to be made for very long distance travel, such as driving or flying between cities, but this would mostly eliminate the situations where people are driving across cities and playing from their vehicles. This artificial travel system could take territory control into account.

5) There is too little interaction between players. Even when standing next to each other, friendly and unfriendly players have virtually no way to interact with each other aside from attacking and defending the same portals. And there's little indication of that. You can see resonators losing strength, or disappearing, but it seems obvious that there should be some notification if I'm standing next to a resonator or portal that is under attack. Equally, if I'm attacking and someone is defending, I should be able to interact with that person somehow.

6) There is too much grinding, not enough strategic or tactical gameplay. Even if #5 was fixed, I'd still be spending 95%+ of my Ingress-playing time alone, and 99% of my actions would involve virtually no decision making or risk. As far as I can tell, the only decisions in the game that actually matter are where I spend my time, which portals to link, which resonators to upgrade/recharge, and what order to travel to portals in. Even worse, most of that grinding time is just waiting. Something as simple as a minigame for hacking would help with this, even if it was optional. Google could steal some ideas from Puzzle Pirates here, where every game action was a minigame, including combat. It would also be a big improvement if having players work together was a bigger part of the game, such as synchronized hacking, some bonus to links made from both ends, etc.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,enlightened,True,t3_15ahb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/15ahb3/im_done_with_ingress_for_a_while/,

Some good takeaways from this conversation that I wanted to share with everyone:


* Portal corrections (relocation, name correction, dupe removal, etc) should start being processed soon. They've been on hold while they prioritized moving through the massive backlog of new portal submissions

* Portals that have been rejected due to proximity to a portal will probably not be re-reviewed automatically if the 'blocking' portal is later moved or removed as part of a correction. They're looking in to it, but I wouldn't hold your breath. You'll probably just need to resubmit them once the portal is out of the way.

* They also noted that in the case of some rejected portals the approval team, and I quote, ""may have rejected them because some of the photos were taken in the driveway of an emergency exit or emergency loading zone (firestations, police stations, hospitals are no longer accepted for related reasons), or showed Portals behind chain link fences or padlocked gates (could indicate it's not publicly accessible)."" - so that's a helpful bit of info. 

Reminder that in addition to the main criteria for a portal, they've said in the past that making sure a sign is visible is more important to approval than a picture of the thing (example: submit a picture of the park sign, not of the grassy field or playground). Now they're also saying to make sure there's nothing in the photo that might make it look like it's inaccessible or in a risky location and that might include fences in the foreground.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,resistance,True,t3_1fntpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1fntpc/new_portal_submission_tips_from_the_niantic_team/,

If you'd like an invite, make a post ~~with your email address~~ requesting a PM, then PM the provider with your email address. Use a throwaway email if you're scared of spam (as several people have pointed out, it's very easy for spambots to pull emails off a public webpage like this, so sending emails over PM helps with spam prevention). When you get your code, **edit your post to remove your email address or PM request**.


If you have invites and are feeling generous, feel free to PM people in this thread and get their emails. For added gentlemanliness, sort posts by date and give them to the people waiting the longest.

**Note0:** Imgur is having issues as of now. I will keep screenshotting and saving them, and will upload them when I'm able to.

**Note1:** Thank you orchis1565 and fenixjr for your help! I should've expected so many responses.

**Note2:** According to Wasney, you can still suggest portals even if you don't have an invite; just have the app installed. Read about it [here.](http://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808254?hl=en)

**Note3:** I'll still be working on these somewhat, but I've been at it all day (minus food breaks) so I'm going to go try out Planetside2 for a bit.

I was low on XMPs from my raid in Oslo the day before, and I start by deploying a farm on the unlinked, low level portals around Oslo City Hall. The level 5 farm was undisturbed long enough for me to burn them all out and link them up nearly perfect, which landed me 25k short of lvl8. I start going towards some of the bigger link hubs in Oslo, which are near the Oslo Cathedral, Oslo central station and the Oslo Opera. They are all within easy walking distance, and I have another hour before the bus leaves. Hopeful of reaching level 8, as I have enough gear to take down most anything, even the level 6 pillars that were the hubs.

As I get to the cathedral, I notice that the portal is hard to breach, an Enlightened is following me! The guy has a bike, ski mask and ski goggles. Obviously a hardcore ingresser, and I soon recognize him from previous encounters around Oslo. Meeting him today could surely ruin my mood! I mange to take down the links on the cathedral, but constant counter deployment makes a portal takedown impossible. I rush to the central station, barely managing to get some of the fields there. Now I sprint to the Opera roof because I'm all out of XM, and I need a lot to take down the fortress of four level 6 portals which awaited. After just a few shots, it becomes clear that I do not possess the energy to pull off the feat at the Opera, and while I walk casually around gathering XM, I have to keep in mind the bus is leaving in about 40 minutes, but I need to maintain the illusion of not being in a hurry. The Enlightened is still following me, and taunts me by saying he will keep following me wherever I go.

I find a mall which has openings in both ends, and it opens up into a busy shopping street. Lots of XM and a chance to lose my tail. To my satisfaction I see the Enlightened guy following me inside with his bike, and I head for the stairs to the second floor. The other end of the floor has a stair back down which has a narrow 180 degree turn in the middle, which is perfect for me. I start sprinting towards the stairs, jump the railing and fall about 3 meters down, get up and sprint through the crowd, around a corner outside the mall and into some construction site that's obscured from inside view.

I run for like 2 minutes, and I'm not a very athletic person. So I'm almost dying out of breath as I crash into a random store to catch my breath. I spend a couple of minutes there, getting my lungs back in order, turning my jacket inside out, taking my hat and my gloves off and I go back out carrying my backpack on the stomach or in a hand by my side to keep my earlier profile as obscured as I can. I take a long way around back to the Opera, walk out onto the roof, and no Enlightened on blasted bikes are to be seen.

Standing in the middle of nasty green fields and huge portals, I fire off as many XMPs as I can muster before the XM blowback hits me, and I manage to completely take down 2 of the portals, lots of fields going with them. I'm still not level 8! I click the level icon in my scanner and find that I'm just a few thousand shy of level 8! I start deploying resonators and shields on the now free portals after a small wave around the roof to gather some XM. Placing the _last_ shield in the second portal I finally see the number in the upper left corner turning to 8, and I start cheering! People are looking at me like I'm an idiot, and I just throw back the biggest smiles!

I go back into the central station, grab my luggage from a locker and head to the buses. I get on the bus and it leaves 10 minutes later. I'm sitting down, trying to comprehend how much fun I just had and how awesome this game is!

Later I get told by the Enlightened fellow on g+ that he had gotten the notifications from me taking down the portals, and saw my burst of happiness from where he works, which overlooks the Opera roof.

It's probably the coolest thing I can remember!

**I don't blame them, I actually agree with them.**

The only incentives to create fields right now is to earn AP for yourself, and MUs for your team. If you hit max level, the AP incentive disappears, now all you have is the cost deterrent of wasting precious portal keys.

Why waste a key to earn worthless 'MU' points that doesn't help your team's local struggle for control? Ownership of portals is what most players fight over. The fields are just dressing.

**The point of the game for most players isn't to get MUs, it's to dominate their turf. Controlling portals without fields still accomplishes this goal.**

MUs are too broad and wide of a concept to appeal to the average player. There's currently 18 million MUs per team. The most any player in our area has made from a link is 32k, and they only get credit because we're paying attention. I have no idea at this point how many MUs on the global score are contributed by me. Because there's no leaderboard for MUs, no localized scoreboard, no incentive, aside from seeing the map covered in your color.

The incentive for holding portals is much greater. You can farm them for equipment, people see your name on them, and you can target and recharge them remotely with keys. Owning portals is where the buck stops for players actually trying to ""win"". And by win I mean hold domination over their territory.

This is called 'emergent behavior'. When players find the way they want to play the game is more fun than the way the game is intended to play. It's a common concept in game design, and Google/Niantic needs to take it very seriously. This is why the game is still in beta.

**Fields need to do more than give MUs.** They need to help secure turf somehow, or there's no incentive in wasting keys to maintain them at higher levels.",,False,,t5_2vij9,1357748807.0,,resistance,True,t3_169620,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/169620/from_a_game_theory_standpoint_mus_and_fields_are/,

I know the enlightened have been a bit discouraged about the gap, but I have an explanation.

After seeing the giant resistance field in Russia, I had my suspicions that that single field accounted for a large portion of resistance MU - the MU drop after the destruction of part of that field last night confirmed my suspicions.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/YtbJF) here.

That single portion of the field - something like 1/2 or less of the entire area, accounted for over 13,000,000 MU. If the rest of the area of that field holds up as MU counts go, its total destruction would put the enlightened on an equal level, worldwide, with the resistance.

So basically, the survival of the enlightened movement sits firmly on the backs of the Russian enlightened right now. Good luck, comrades.

I should probably give the resistance who created the thing a bit of credit as well - the whole field is created by two people who apparently travel together.

I had JUST pulled to the side of a very quiet,fairly out-of-the-way suburban road (in the bike lane, but I was only gonna be there for about 5 minutes &amp; it must've been 4:30am), so I hit my ""asshole that parks anywhere"" aka hazard lights. Not 3 seconds later, he came over the hill behind me, so I thought fast, got out, pulled my flashlight app out, and started looking at my tires. 

He stopped, got out, and asked if everything was okay. I told him yeah, I just felt the car pulling to one side and wanted to check my tires, which looked fine. 

He asked where I was headed at this hour, and I didn't have a quick answer, so I said ""Well.... I'm not really sure just yet."" 

He looked puzzled, then asked why, so I explained that I was playing a social media geocaching game of capture the flag (sort of). He understood the geocaching bit, so I explained more. He asked if he was gonna see more people doing this, I said yeah, most likely, and at all hours, but it'd be more noticeable at night and explained why. He asked for the name of the game, and a couple other questions about it, and we went our merry ways. 

Things to remember when talking to authorities:

Avoid using the words ""hack"", ""bomb"", ""weapon"", ""blast"", and (sometimes) ""takeover"". 

Many law enforcement agencies have a list of key words (and synonyms) that, once heard, they're required to dig deeper. Avoiding these words helps smooth out any interactions you may have. 

The biggest thing to remember, by FAR, is to be polite, maintain a casual/neutral tone, and be respectful. You don't have to kiss anyone's ass, but this advice will get you out of almost anything minor. These officers are doing their jobs. If you make it easy on them, and help them avoid filing a report (or other paperwork), they'll be far more likely to just let it go, or even express interest in the game.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,,True,t3_19yxmw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/19yxmw/i_had_my_first_facetoface_encounter_with_the/,

Since I was going to have a few hours to spare, I thought I would check out the intel map and see what it was like there.  I was amazed that nearly the whole town was covered with green. (http://i.imgur.com/Tnms3.jpg) Watching the chat in the area showed me that the Resistance was vastly outnumbered.  Since my home town is littered with portals and I managed to get up to Level 6 pretty quickly, and I had a plethora of extra bursters on hand (over 300 L4-6). I thought I would lend a hand.  I and my trusty rental car set out to target a few of the key spots.

Along the way I was my snarky self and chatted away in the general chat in the app.  Not really taunting, just having fun.  The Enlightened in the area seemed to be having fun with it too.  One of them, Adiabat, was even spurring me on.

My trek took me to the University campus where I took out about 20 different portals. (Honestly, I lost count after a while, they really need a scoreboard!) Well it turns out that Adiabat works on campus and he was watching my path of destruction.  He came out and caught me in the act.  We had a great little chat before his ride picked him up and I headed back to destroying everything in sight.

I started to get hungry so I headed back to my hotel and had dinner while I examined the map.  Turns out while I was walking around the campus, the rest of them were repairing some of my damage. (http://i.imgur.com/xG0wd.jpg) 

This would not do.

So around 9pm I headed back out and did some surgical strikes to take out the big fields.  Two hours and 300 bursters later, Tucson is a lot less green.  (http://i.imgur.com/2Fbpu.jpg)

1370034065.0,55,self.Ingress,1ffecw,I created an Ingress account and tried to GPS spoof my way to L8 as quickly as possible,ingress_spoofer,106,51,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1ffecw/i_created_an_ingress_account_and_tried_to_gps/,"**NOTE:** I am NOT here to tell you how to GPS spoof, work that out for yourself if you want to.

I've been playing for several months as a legitimate Ingress player and I got to L8 a few months ago. I got bored and thought that I'd see what it's like to be a GPS spoofer, and get to level 8 as fast as possible.  I've been a gamer all my life, I'm 43yrs old with a wife and 2 children. I am chaotic-good.

I started 5 days ago, I've been playing in a major city, I'm now 150K away from L8, but I just had to write this down.

So how hard can it be? Let me tell you about the state of play for the GPS spoofer ...

* it is very easy to GPS spoof. I can go anywhere and it's dead stable. I use an ""off the shelf"" app. I am not an Android developer or 1337 h@x0r.

* Niantic limit your maximum speed between portals, but it's about 700kph (average). I think they have an acceleration factor in there. So you can't instantly pop up somewhere and do something, you do have to wait.

* I can farm with ease so I can get myself a lot of items, but switching between the GPS spoof app takes time and it's actually slower than walking through a dense farm and hacking as you go. If I had a GPS app with timed waypoints, this wouldn't be a problem.  Farming takes hours.

* farming for keys still sucks, spoofing really doesn't make that much of a difference. Sometimes a portal won't give out keys no matter how many times you (remote) hack it

* I can remotely drop items for other players, this is great. Niantic should really make it so you can wrap up items as a passcode and transfer them at some limited speed to another player. Spoofers do this all the time, so let everyone do it.

* I can't defend a portal from being attacked by a strong player. I could deploy resonators, but that would give away my spoofing, right? So spoofing to the portal and recharging does nothing - in my experience. What I can do though, it pick up any dropped keys in the area.

* That XM cost and link defence is a real killer. In the bad old days, as a L5 player, I could take down any portal I wished to with enough XMP.  This means that attacking a portal, even when spoofing, is time consuming. Cubes are rare, and so is XM. When attacking a portal as a spoofer, I have to jump to other portals, collect xm, and jump back. This is one thing that Niantic should fix to **KILL SPOOFING DEAD**. Don't allow spoofers to jump to xm pools! Apply the same instant travel rules to XM as you do to hacking/dropping/picking-up.

* Since attacking portals is now very time consuming, trying to take down a fully linked portal attracts attention from Real Lifeâ¢ players who can arrive on the scene. Ingress is the most paranoia inducing game I have ever played. EVERYONE is suspicious of any movements that don't fit their idea of how to play the game, especially the ""older"" L8 players. They're used to being able to move with speed and destroy all in their path, so they suspect anything that doesn't fit that model. They/we had it really easy.

I had people chatting to me ALL the time, asking to meet me. I spun a lot of stories, but I'm sure I've been reported a LOT. 

Let me tell you, playing these days is HARD. MUCH harder than for us early players. I can't imagine what it's like for you lower level players now. It must really suck. Spoofing doesn't do much to make this any easier.

* spoofing is not social, and not that much fun

* The attack notification is great for anti-spoofing! People come running to the portal, and see that you're not there. I bet there have been LOADS more spoofing reports since notifications went live.

* Player Tracker plugin for IITC is a spoofing killer as well. People can easily see if you are doing anything ""strange"". But IITC is against the ToS, right? ;)


On the topic of the morality of spoofing, I'll just say that I don't know a single player who doesn't break the ToS in one way or another. I know players who:

* will accept spoof-farmed items items, dropped remotely on their doorstep
* have multiple accounts
* use IITC + plugins
* use their under-18 family members as pack mules and force multipliers
* give items to enemies. I've done this as ""goodwill"" when meeting the opposing forces. It's ""diplomacy"" but it's agains the ToS (as they stand).
* win-trade
* inform and spy ... 

So you either abide by all the ToS or none of them, you can't pick and choose. 

EDIT: i.e. you can't pick and choose which rules you want to abide by and which ones you want to break. if you break one of the rules, you're still *technically* cheating. (but I wouldn't judge you for doing it)

But, you know what, it's still a good game, and I don't think it does that much damage. It's noise, it hasn't killed the game.

I wouldn't worry about spoofers too much. They might be annoying, but they will get bored. The best way to knock someone out of the game is to get them to L8. Statistically, they have a much higher chance of retiring at that point. So let them level up and they'll move on.

**EDIT:** Woah! That shield upgrade just made solo play a LOT harder.

Team balanace in my city was one sided at first but over time it has evened out as numbers grew, and now the Resistance actually has to put up a fight to keep any portals up for long.
The community has been, for the most part, great. We've had cross faction beer nights and AP rush events, and now recognize each other on the street and usually stop to chat.

At least, most of us do.

One playing in particular - Let's call him Evilman (a portmanteau of his handles) has been shameless in his cheating for months now, and his play style is ruining the game for all of us.

-He has changed his name at least 3 times (in spite of a limit of one name change per player. No idea how he managed this).
-He regularly spoofs his location, often moving across town to protect his pet portal at his office, even in the middle of the night.
  -He has often taken portals in the middle of an empty field, while multiple agents searched for him as much as 200m away, more than any ""GPS drift"" should account for on a regular basis
-We can't prove it, but we're all fairly certain he has a second account used for spying on Resistance faction chat.
-He reports others for harassment/spoofing/whatever he thinks may stick, when they accuse him of spoofing and ask him to come out and explain himself.
-When caught (someone defends a portal he is attacking, or a teammate joins in the attack, and can clearly see he isn't around), he immediately breaks off the attack and moves several blocks away, only to return 20 minuets later when he assumes the others have moved on (hint: we haven't. we're waiting and watching).

I could even forgive Evilman for some of this, at least in the early days, because it gave the overwhelming Resistance forces something to do, but this has gone on unabated for months and month.
It hit a new level when, after chatting with some Enlightenment folk, it came to light that NO ONE has met him. He's a practically a ghost in faction chat. Doesn't partake in team events. They're lucky to hear him once a week when he complains about a blue farm going up.
The icing on the cake was his willingness to deny AP to the rest of his team. Naturally he was one of the first local Greenies to hit level 8, but that didn't stop him from dismantling every Blue field in the city, even  when other Greens were desperate for the AP.

The man has been ruining the game for everyone in my city for months, and in spite of repeated reports to Google/Niantic from multiple people (on both teams), nothing has been done. Every time he decides to pop his head up again and go on a rampage from his basement, we are all reminded of how quickly the this game becomes no fun at all.
If Niantic really has any intention of giving us a valid end game, of retaining users and building a strong social base for this game, anti-social users that abuse the system need to be punished and removed from the system if they don't change their ways.

I've been playing Ingress in Switzerland for 2 months now, and one of the things I consider a problem I've immediately seen in the first days is still here after two months. And I think generally people would agree that we have too much resonators and always little XMP.

I think the drop rate of both is equal, but the fact that you have to use more than one XMP to destroy a Resonator of the same levelmakes obvious the fact that a lot of people have useless Resonators in their inventories.

I don't want to change the game too deeply (meaning I don't think changing the drop rates and/or XMP power is a good idea), but I think we can reasonably say that Resonators should be a little more useful, especially when stacked. Here's what I thought about :

A single L1 resonator contains in itself 1'000 XM, because when you place it, it's already full and it gives 1'000 XM to a portal. So, instead of dropping hundreds of unused resonators... could we, for example, break them to get a little bit of that XM ? I mean, a level 1 res contains in itself 1k XM. I'm sure it would be possible to break it to get a bit of XM, don't you think ?

Just wanted to open a discussion based on the fact that I think every city should have a ""noob battleground"".  In our city, we've designated a spot where we keep 4 portals on level 1 - always.  Anyone is free to attack, or link to and from them, but they should always have level 1 resonators.

Of course this is meant for people who are just started and a little blown away by level 4 and 5 portals all over the place. I understand, and preach fully that the game is about teaming up and helping level low players, but this can be daunting or even a little high maintenance at times. 

If we can keep a battleground like this in major cities - it encourages low level players to go out, battle it out, have fun, and start leveling - which in turn keeps their interest levels up, game moving, and higher level opponents in the long run.

Some people might not dig this.  Some cities are just out for blood with  regards to the game.  Our city has gone with this, and it's been really good imo.  If you don't have one (I don't think Edmonton does for example) you should highly consider giving grounds for this.  I mean, we're all here for fun anyway right? :)

Take care all, happy Ingressing,

1. It would be nice to see a wider area on the mobile app. Something similar, although maybe not quite as involved as the Intel page. City Level possibly?

2. Satellite Overlay. Just like on the Intel page. I would totally love this.

3. My personal favorite - Google Now Integration! It would be so nice to be able to have 'cards' pop up when you are within maybe a mile, or 1/2-mile of a portal. Maybe that card could show you info about the portal, distance and direction, Faction Owner (or neutral), Map view of the portal(s) and a button to initiate navigation. This would make me happier than a fat kid or cake camp (otherwise, happier than myself)!

I am part of the team from Enlightened Malaysia that recently created (25th June)  and re-created (28th June) a huge [field](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1h2vqv/40m_mu_enlightened_fields_created_over_the_south/) in the South East Asia region. 

However during the afternoon (local time, GMT+8), we noted that another field was created from Vietnam and East Malaysia to the Philippines by agent +iscsi and +HKENGP, adjacent to our original fields. We further notice that they had managed to link from Vietnam to Hong Kong.

The above mentioned agents traveled to Kalimantan, Sabah, Vietnam, Philippines in the space of a few days. This raises our concern. We had contacted the 2 agents but with no avail.

As such, I am here to clarify that me and my fellow teammates are **NOT** associated with the agents mentioned above in any way. To prove our sincerity and dedication to eliminate spoofing activities, we contacted the agents from East Malaysia to assist us to ADA our portal in Kota Kinabalu.

Hope this clear things up. Also credits to /u/danielguita for the title ;)

&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*-- Carl Sagan*


&amp;nbsp;
  
Humanity. Conflict is in our nature. We fight among ourselves, as we have done throughout history. We threaten each other with nuclear weaponry. We have the potential to wipe out our entire race.

There is hope. Artists, scientists who have no interest in war, who seek only to advance the human race towards the future. Those who look towards the greater good for all of humanity.

And now, there are the Shapers.  
&amp;nbsp;

They speak to us. Their influence turns our minds away from conflict, towards art and progress. Their gift of XM enhances our thinking, allowing us to achieve things thought impossible. The Shapers bring the promise of a new age of enlightenment, where war is a thing of the past, and humanity can grow and prosper without fear.

That is why the Enlightened seek to spread their influence. You who are Resistance, you fight to preserve humanity from outside influence, yet you doom us to continue the path of history and conflict, to an eventual fate where we will tear ourselves apart. You believe you are fighting to save humanity, but so do we. We are saving humanity from itself.

1373474593.0,44,self.Ingress,1i0mb5,Some advice for using cheap and/or long usb charging cables while Ingressing with a battery pack.,TreyWalker,55,11,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1i0mb5/some_advice_for_using_cheap_andor_long_usb/,"I posted this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1hzh3r/so_close_this_game_can_completely_kill_my_phones/cazpigw) earlier when discussing voltage attenuation / long cables while using a battery pack during gameplay.

**TL;DR:** You're probably not going to hurt your smartphone from voltage-drop using long cables... but may experience problems if you use cheap cables longer than 6'. If you use cheap, long cables, you may see the inability to charge, or damage the source (charger) from heat, or melt the cable if there's enough amperage and length.


**TL;DR Recommendations:**

 - 5.3v 2.1A - &gt;6' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 2.1A - &gt;3' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 1A - &gt;6' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 0.5A - &gt;10' cheap cable may be dicey
 - Many usb-batteries come with 1A and 2.1A outputs. Switch to 1A if you have a long cheap cable and have problems. Ingress may actually consume more than 1A, depending on the phone (iOS-Ingress I figure uses about 1.2A from my experience, ymmv) but you'll still buy a hell of a lot of time even though you're running out of energy.

(Why you'd be walking around with a 10' cable wrapped up in your pocket, connected to a battery, is also beyond me, but I guess if you have it lying around...)

Attenuation is voltage drop from the resistance of conductor, generally copper, in a USB cable. 

(What comes with the iPhone, what I use:) A 5v, 1A charger using a 3' 24AWG cable, the device will only get 4.85v to it. However, I'd be very surprised to see a phone that has battery voltage greater than 4v, since most now use USB and have to anticipate this loss.

The Galaxy S4 has 3.8v 2600mah. My iPhone 5 has a 3.8v 1440mah. A voltage regulator / charging circuit takes the voltage from the charging cable (between 4-5v) and converts it to (generally) a usable 3.8v, so you don't blow your battery up. Both the regulator and the battery release energy in the form of heat during this process. If the phone did not have some sort of regulation circuit, the onus would be on the power source, the charger, to regulate. The USB standard was created and manufacturers have to perform a cost-benefit-analysis of abiding by this standard since it's now the most popular.

The USB standard is 5v, 500mA. Most of these battery packs output 1A and/or 2.1A. Greater amperage is not dangerous to receiving devices, it just means they're CAPABLE of outputting 2.1A, the current is usually governed by the device. They're generally all made in china, many use the same IC, and call it 3.1A / 15W. With cost of production in mind, cheaper components are used (plastics, no thermal paste or heatsink) and are prone to overheating. 

The same goes for cables. Smaller AWG number = thicker the gauge. I have some old 30-pin iPhone connectors here at my desk: the stock one from apple, one from monoprice and another chinese one. Eyeballing it, the Apple one seems to have 20-24AWG for all 4 wires. The monoprice looks to have 24AWG for power and 28AWG for data. The Chinese one appears to have 28AWG for all four. 

There is a formula for voltage drop, using the same setup above, but with this 28AWG chinese cable, this would not charge my iPhone if it were greater than 9' long, since it would drop to 3.7v or greater. (And that's why it's at my desk, I bought a 10' cable to rig into my car stereo, but the charger I was using was 2A, caused too much of a drop and was unresponsive.)

If you're dropping below 3.8v (or whatever the charging circuit cuts off, which realistically could be 4.2v) from voltage drop, the charging mechanism signals the processor that it's not charging, and doesn't attempt to. I seriously doubt that any modern smartphone lacks the capability of cutting off low-voltage current, which would under-volt the battery.

I've made this handy little chart to show the voltage drop (this all assumes copper, even cheaper stuff may use different material). [Calculate here](http://www.calculator.net/voltage-drop-calculator.html) for yourself!

It should be noted that higher amperage = greater voltage drop from resistance, dispersed as heat. Higher drop = higher heat.

If at any time you move at speed greater than 40 MPH while the client is running, the next time you stop and try to hack, you will get ""hack acquired no items"".

My theory is this is an anti cheating countermeasure.  It seems as through Ingress thinks you are cheating so you get sandboxed (thats what i call it).  I have also noticed that if hacking an enemy portal, you do not get AP and you can sit there for 10 minutes (ive tested this) and keep hacking over and over again, all you get is the no items message.  

I have found a way to tell is you are sandboxed:  Goto your inventory and attempt to recharge a friendly portal that needs it.  If your XM goes down and you see green %number over the resonators, you are fine.  If your XM goes down then comes back and you done have the green +%number, you are sandboxed.

Where I play (east TN) there are small clusters that are very dense.  One in particular has 20 portals all within walking distance.  In other areas, they are spread far apart.  If I farm, then drive to another area, I have to forcibly end ingress and relaunch.

I have tried a few things to mitigate this:
-turn off GPS while traveling
-stay under the speed limit (even tried 25% under)
-put phone to sleep while traveling
-kept phone while traveling
-force resync
Nothing seems to keep ingress from putting me in the sandbox. (other than forcibly relaunching the program)

I play rather aggressively, Im nearly L7 after a month and a half.  I do not cheat nor will I ever cheat.

Regarding cheating, this is my understanding:  (I am likely wrong) It cant really be stopped due to the open nature of android and its hardware.  The only thing Niantic can do is deploy counter measures to make it annoying to cheaters.

Full capture everything! At the moment, you need Ap more than anything. To generate MU for your team, you need to connect portals together. To connect portals, you need higher level ones to really make a difference. To make higher level portals, you need to be higher level yourself, so get out there and do stuff!

2. You will need multiple keys of portals to get stuff done. So, if you have keys for the portal you are hacking, drop your current ones! If you have no keys in your inventory for that portal, you will get another one, and then you can pick yours up that you dropped. This will enable you to have multiples to use to link, as well as recharge and possibly pass to your teammates!

Number 2 clarification: You will need multiple keys for this reason: At the moment, linking a portal consumes the key. Thusly, to link a portal, then be able to recharge it remotely (as they lose -10% a day), you will need two keys. Three if you wish to link it a second time as part of a triangle.

3. Hit that hack button multiple times! Through possibly a bug, or an undocumented feature, sometimes portals will give multiple hacks in rapid succession before triggering the 5 minute cooldown.

4. Turn that screen brightness down! Do everything you can to conserve battery. Screen brightness is the worst on your battery, to make sure to turn it down.

5. Unclaimed portals are MUCH easier to deal with than claimed ones. A claimed portal takes 30 or so XMP to bust open, assuming you are using the same level of XMP as it has resonators. If you aren't, god help you. So try and snag unclaimed ones whenever possible, as it is more resource efficent at this time.

6. When attacking a portal, be sure to stand on top of at least one resonator. If you are using the same level of XMP, you will do 18-20% damage to that one resonator, and minimal damage to nearby ones, perhaps 8% in total. If the resonators are inside a building, I hope the building is public, or you will have a hard time taking down the portal, as at the moment, XMP blasts are centered on your current location, NOT where you target them.

7. To gain AP, you can spam shield generators. Deploy them, remove one, deploy again. It gives 150 AP per deploying. Just know that you are ""wasting"" shield generators to do this.

I'll edit and add more as I find them, or people can PM me their tips to add!

Niantic has plan to increase the player level beyond level 8 (Yeah, we all knew this). However, the specific thing about it was still unknown, until now. That Niantic will introduce *MISSION POINT* (MP). And to reach level 9, a player needs to accumulate MP instead of AP. You can think mission like 'achievement' on games nowadays. The Google employee gave a few examples of how to get MP: 

* Creating link with certain distance
* Creating field with certain number of MU
* Creating certain level of portal
* Destroying certain number of portals

You got the idea. If this is true, I really can't wait. And I think it is good that beyond level 8, you don't need AP (like now).

I think a common fear that I've been reading is that once Google has collected more walking data than then know what to do with, they'll shut down Ingress like they did with their other side projects ... GOOG-411, the image matching game, and others I'm probably forgetting. *Assuming* that Ingress really takes off, there will inevitably be a time where there is enough walking data collected and user submitted portals will be dense enough ... making portals too dense would be a problem (there are some places around where I live where you can maybe walk a few paces and hit a few portals already). However, I notice there's a big pot o' gold just waiting to be taken for Google: ... Missions. Imagine with me. You're hopping around town, doing your thing, when all of a sudden:

Etc, etc, back and forth between Resistance and Enlightened until there is enough crowd-sourced data for Google to analyze to definitively know that there is a bike rack *exactly* at that point. The mapping potential for this is **huge**. Any service can scrape a phone book, find addresses and telephone numbers, and tell you how to get to a listed place. How the hell do you get the data so that you can type in ""bike rack"" into a map and find where you're going to lock your bike up?

Ingress.

Ever use Google Maps and see a location that is ""approximate""? Ever have Maps ask you if that location was correct? Ever have Maps ask you if that phone number you called was right? Have you ever *really* needed to find a public restroom, like NOW? Damn, does that gas station have an ATM? Am I walking the right way to get to the right check in counter for my flight ... this damn map only says ""Terminal K"". What the hell ... I walked all the way here and this place is out of business!

Ingress just crowd-sourced it and gathered times, dates, GPS locations, and pictures ... which they can ""Google Goggle"" and pick out logos, or just have a team zipping by approving photos on the fly. Hell, bring back the image game. ""Match keywords with your partner"" I bet you they can take 20 idiots and you pull back ""ATM"" and ""BANK OF AMERICA"" at least 15 times.

Igress ain't going nowhere. So long as there's something out there unlisted, hard to find, strange to reach, with a generic name, just opened, just closed, or someone tore it down and put a park with walking paths there .... Google wants to know about it. They want to put it on a map, keyword it, give you a phone number, and tell you how to get there. Ingress is how.

Edit: So I really got a chance to tear into the game. (My flight back to SFO was late, got in at 2AM, ""oh, I'll just check it out real quick. You know, unwind a little.""

Pros:

* Fast deploys for resonators and mods
* Visually check where you are deploying

* Finally can scroll through items
* Quick-fire select is awesome
* Remote recharging of individual resonators

Cons:

* Animations are even more bulky and slow down FPS in portal dense areas
* Upgrading resos takes even longer now
* Pressing Deploy to Upgrade resos isn't very intuitive, especially since Upgrade is used only for mods now.  Maybe it should be ""Upgrade"" for upgrading resos, and ""Mods"" for deploying mods.

Enlightened were always higher level, but working together the boyfriend and I could even fix the damage level 8's would do when they rolled through and took our farms.  Since the level up, though, those higher level players took over our farms and filled them with shields, and now the max damage we can do is 1% per xmp.  Despite dropping many lvl 6 bursters, we have yet to pop any of those shields.  Meanwhile, those 8s are rolling through the higher level farms in the area, also fully shielded, and taking them out with seemingly no problem.

We feel like there's no point in us going out anymore because all we can do is hack our few remaining blue portals, which we don't find to be any fun.  We also think that the game is now completely unbalanced for lower-level players who will now struggle to earn AP due to unchanging portals and unbreaking links.

Will add more as I compile them....

As for why this is happening? Based on other people's feedback and what I agree with, I think it was due to the fact that low level players could not participate in the world as much as their older faction members have... This will change the game's meta incredibly and before the beta ends ingress will again patch this if this causes another imbalance.

Things to note:

- These codes were not found by me, they are just floating around the web freely
- You will probably reach the item limit...
- The AP and XM gains are much lower, to favor low level players more
- Well it turns out the codes are from the license plates of ZipCars, but not sure if this was intentional or not...

So, I didn't want to play the game in earnest if I thought there would be lots of cheaters, so I found out how easy it was to cheat.  Took me an hour total to get to the point where I could spoof my GPS location and remotely fire an XMP into a crowd of enemy portals in a big city.  I was the guy who captured the portals in North Korea.  Considering how easy it was to get to that point, I didn't take the game very seriously.  

Since the decay event last week; however, something has changed, and it's become significantly harder to spoof my location. 

Has anyone seen evidence of GPS spoofing since the decay event?  If spoofers have been pushed out, making the game more legitimate, it would be a huge improvement for everyone.

This a Augmented Reality Game where you go to certain locations and ""hack"" them claiming the location for your side. There are two sides in this game ""The Enlightened"" and ""The Resistance"", as best as I can describe it it's like Assassins Creed Where the Enlightened are the Templars and the resistance is the Assassins.

The story is that during one CERN's scientific experiments created a sort of cascade (a resonance cascade you could say) that released exotic matter around the world, portals have formed in locations like statues, memories, museums, etc. While XM particals have been scattered randomly, but they collect around portals.

Both sides are trying to capture these portals and set up resonance devices around the portals generate more energy from or to I'm not sure) and to link them together. When three or more portals are link it creates a field, when the resistance creates such a field it protects the humans living in that area from ""Shapers"". Shapers intend to infect humans using the fields created with linked portals.

The game play is like this:

* You first have to look on the map: http://www.ingress.com/intel (requires login) to find portals like [these]    (http://i.imgur.com/9HLqr.png).    
* You then take you phone with you and  head to the location they are at.   
* Once at the location you must get within 50m of the portal and select then you can hack it.
* When hacked it will give you a Key (allowing you to edit the portal) and other random items (resonators, xmps', and shields), XM, and AP.
* The next step is to set up Resonators, 8 can be set to a portal. Shield modules can also be added to a portal.
* you move onto the next and the next till you can set up 8 resonators on each and link them together creating a field like [this](http://i.imgur.com/M3C0v.png)    

When you come across a portal that has already been claimed depending on if its hostile or not you can do a few things. 

* If the portal is hostile you can use a XMP (a bomb) to attack and weaken the portal and their resonators they have set up, allowing you to eventually hack the portal and take it over.

* If the portal is friendly to you, you can hack it and get the key from it allowing you to add more resonators, shields, regenerate it's energy levels, and link it to other portals.


I hope this clears things up, and I don't know everything I also don't know the motivation of the Enlightened. only that the resistance (the side I am on) is to save humanity. The Resistance is taking quite a beating right now in terms of score and world control

Enlightened | Resistance    
:--|--:
11,537       | 2,500    
82%          | 18%    

Why is this? Well during training you get a message and if you skip through it with out reading you will accept to join the Enlightened.

1360127183.0,31,self.Ingress,17zeh6,[Theorycrafting] Ingress Itemization (Warning: quite long),drusepth,46,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/17zeh6/theorycrafting_ingress_itemization_warning_quite/,"The [recent Ingress Hangout](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/17ydye/new_info_from_ingress_hangout/) revealed that there are plans in the future to tactically increase the complexity of the game by introducing new shield types, a ""rock, paper, scissors"" mechanic, and potentially introducing physical items like NFC bracelets that can hold Ingress items. 

*The inventory and inventory management is also being reworked.*

In other words, this would be the perfect time to suggest some itemization for Ingress. 

Right now items serve one purpose: resonators fill up portals, keys let you link them, and bursters let you destroy them.

But what if, as you received higher level items, they began doing *other* things as well? What if resonators had abilities that transferred to the portal when you deployed them? What if shields did more for portals than just mitigating damage? What if you could use other items to attack in other ways?

*Theorycrafting time.*

**What if Resonators gave abilities to the portal they are deployed on?**

- XM storage: A small amount of XM can be stored in the portal and retrieved by anyone on the team that controls it. If the resonator is destroyed the XM ""drops"" to the map.

- Item storage: Some amount of one kind of item can be stored in the portal and retrieved by anyone on the team that controls it. If the resonator is destroyed the items drop to the ground.

- XM generator: This portal produces more XM.

- Further reach: Increases the maximum distance this portal can link to.

- Luckiness: This portal is more likely to yield more items when hacked (for both teams).

- Movement: This resonator moves around on the map, making it difficult to stand on top of when launching XMPs.

- Energetic: This resonator has an increased amount of energy.

- Efficient: The efficiency of recharging this resonator from a distance is increased.

- Cooling: This portal's overheated hacking cooldown (normally 3+ hours) is decreased by some small amount.

**What if Shields provided extra defensive abilities to the portal they were deployed on?**

- Fatigue: Enemies who attack this portal suffer from a little extra XM depletion.

- Leeching: XM damage suffered by attackers is leeched to recharge this portal.

- Absorption: This portal will automatically absorb loose XM in its field (on the ground) to recharge itself.

- Evasion: XMPs have an increased chance of missing when targeting this portal.

- Hardened: This shield provides increased damage reduction.

- Regeneration: Resonators on this portal suffer from decay at a much slower rate. Multiple regeneration shields may reverse the effects of decay.

- Disruption: This portal is unaffected by the effects of nearby gadgets.

**What if XMPs provided new damage sources and sources of teamwork?**

- Light: Damage and XM required to use are decreased.

- Heavy: Damage and XM required to use are increased.

- Heated: Damage is increased if the temperature is above a certain threshold.

- Cooled: Damage is increased if the temperature is below a certain threshold.

- Daylight: Damage is increased while the sun is out.

- Midnight: Damage is increased during the night.

- Beginner's luck: Damage is increased the closer the player is to level 1.

- Shield piercing: Attacks ignore all shield abilities.

- Shield breaker: Rather than doing damage to resonators, damage is dealt to shields, potentially destroying them.

- Accurate: XMP may be fired from a slightly further distance.

- Preparation: All future damage done to resonators of the portal hit is increased by some small amount for some short period of time.

- Locking: Resonators hit cannot be recharged for some period of time after taking damage from this burster.

- Teamwork: Does slightly more damage for each ally within range of the portal.

- Collaboration: Damage done by allies (not you) to the portal this XMP hits is increased for a short period of time.

- Leeching: All nearby allies regain some XM based on how much damage was done.

- Explosive: Ignites other XMPs fired by allies at the same time, increasing their damage.

**What if new *Offensive Gadgets* provided new tactical opportunities?**

- XM Bursters: When fired at a location, players within the blast radius lose a small amount of XM. Requires XM to fire.

- Degeneration field: All portals within this field suffer from an increased rate of decay for some period of time.

- Disruption field: For some duration of time, players cannot recharge resonators while standing in a disruption field (about the same radius as a blue, player radius).

- EMP: Disrupt all targeted portal abilities for a short period of time.

- Caltrops: Players that walk through caltrops lose a little more XM when attacking portals for a short period of time. Caltrops last for some amount of time before being automatically destroyed, and may be seen on the map by allies of the faction that placed it.

**What if new *Defensive Gadgets* provided bonuses for active, responsive players?**

- XM generator: Creates a field where XM is generated for some period of time.

- Drop site: A drop site may store one item (from any player) that may be retrieved by any player of either faction. Drop sites can only be seen on the map by players of the faction that owns it, unless an enemy comes within range of it.

- White field: All damage and XM usage is decreased by some small amount for players within the range of this field, for a short period of time.

- Heal trap: For a short amount of time, any XMP fired within the heal trap's range will heal its target for the damage that would have been done, instead of dealing damage. After one XMP has been affected, the heal trap is destroyed.

Of course, having *all of these* attributes on everything might make the game *too* complex, but that doesn't mean higher level stuff couldn't get itemized.

*We can dream, right?* :)

Leveling in this game is about gaining AP effectively. To gain AP, you need to use the devices you hack from portals (hacking portals gives a limited amount of AP).

The question is, how best to use these devices?

Gathering the devices takes time, therefore we need to consider how to best use our limited number of devices to gain maximum AP for our effort. I've assumed here that it will take you far more than 8 bursters to fully take out a portal (this is not true if you are high level taking out low level portals though).

The game play offers four main strategies for gaining AP:

1. You can focus on destroying control fields. You only gain AP from disrupting control fields and links, but you use a very limited number of bursters to do that. I've been calling this ""neutralizing"" the portal.
2. You can focus on destroying portals completely and simply capturing them with one of your resonators
3. You can focus on completely capturing the portal (for the final bonus and the extra XP, perhaps, of having shields installed)
4. You can focus on building networks of portals yourself (#3 + linking)

Let's look at some scenarios and where the better options are:

1. There are no control fields on any portals nearby. If a portal has no control fields on it, your best move for AP, is to completely destroy it and completely capture it yourself.
2. If you have at least two portals, with control fields, it is advantageous to either neutralize them or link them together. It is not efficient to fully capture them or even fully destroy them unless you are going to link them.

Whether it is more advantageous to neutralize them or link them together depends on how many control fields you will be destroying and how many you will be rebuilding. I assume, throughout this discussion, that you are going to maximize your links if you go with a network of portals (that you will create as many overlapping fields as possible).

Interestingly though, we can already eliminate one option. #2 is simply not an efficient use of your bursters. If you're going to go through the trouble of destroying the resonators, you should get the extra AP for completing it (and shields if you can).

#3 is only the most efficient option if there are no control fields on the portal and that's true for all the portals you could target. If you have the option to take out a portal with a CF instead, take it. 

Those are edge cases. Most of the time, you should be considering #1 or #4.

#1 is the fastest method, because you don't need to take out more than one portal. In many of the cases, if you want a short mission, you should be focusing on #1. It takes far less time and has equivalent or greater rewards in many cases (per device used at least). It's also better at higher levels where your bursters are far more powerful - you can bring them under 50% much faster and not use the resonators at all. If you find yourself low on resonators constantly, this is a good strategy.

#4 is better if you are inter-connecting a larger number of portals and/or destroying a smaller number of control fields. Even then, since there's a lot of overlap likely in links and control fields, it may still not be worth it, compared to finding an equal number of unlinked portals with the same number of attached CFs and neutralizing them. 

There are tipping points here. Basically the math says we should compare the number of portals you will interconnect (assuming you will fully interconnect them to the maximum potential) to the number of control fields you will destroy, on average, per portal.

For example, for 3 portals, you only need to destroy 6 CFs (2 for each portal) to make it more worthwhile to neutralize them than destroy them. At 4 portals, you need 3 CFs per portal, 5 portals need 4CFs, 6 portals need 6 CFs, 7 portals need 8 CFs, 8 portals need 11 CFs, etc. This doesn't include the time factor needed to link everything together (which weighs even further towards #1).

So, if you're looking for efficient leveling, plan your missions. How many portals are you taking out? How many of those are you going to spend time linking? If you're not planning a serious campaign of destruction and linking, then you're better off just neutralizing the portals you come across (look for tight concentrations of portals with lots of CFs attached).

- I feel like the storyline is at it's core not really important. It's kind of difficult to follow. There's a lot of characters, a lot of crazy science, and no general compendium that is keeping track of everything.
- I participated in the Tron ARG and we were getting free shit CONSTANTLY. I know the budget for Ingress at Google is probably lower than Disney's budget, but even something like free stickers in the mail would be awesome.
- The codes found in the ARG elements are far too difficult to try to crack on your own. If they were more fun puzzles (as opposed to ridiculous cryptography) I feel we would enjoy them more. It's hard to care about solving a puzzle when people way smarter than you finish it instantly, it's released to blogs, in inboxes and expired within four minutes.

The fact that the beta will apparently be for 18 more months makes it seem like Google won't be able to hold our attention -- for the ARG, at least. They seem to have a lot of fun stuff planned for the Ingress phone app coming up (missions, etc).

&gt;&gt;**I was made aware that some Samsung Phones (GS3) and some HTC phones may or may not work with this.**

I was searching the Ingress subreddit for a particular gif to make into a Bootloader animation. After a couple hours of reading and downloading various apps, I've done it! I present to you with a new bootloader image for you awesome rooted fellows! I sped up the animation to 30fps, but you can always slow it down or speed it up as you desire.

I made it off of this gif.

http://imgur.com/fAnQi

The Bootloader zip already packaged, ready and tested.

http://www.mediafire.com/?ks41vez2mf23gd6

Also, you will need this App from Google Play to make things easier if you haven't done this before.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.apps.boot.animations&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5qcnVtbXkuYXBwcy5ib290LmFuaW1hdGlvbnMiXQ..

Once you have your phone hooked up via USB, drag the zip to some folder that you can remember, it doesn't really matter. After you download the app and the ZIP, *do not unzip the file*. The app will draw everything needed from the zip similar to how you flash ROMs onto your phone!

tl;dr steps-

1) Download the App.

2) Download the zip file, *do not extract it*, and put it somewhere on your phone(or download it directly to your phone). 

3a) With the app: Click on the local tab and find where you put the zip file.

3b) Click on it and click ""Install"", the first option.

3c) If prompted, allow superuser access for the app Boot Animations.

4) Reboot, and enjoy!

Enjoy! Let me know if any problems come up.

DISCLAIMER - You rooted. You know any consequences of making your smartphone more awesome. Don't hold me liable for screwups!

Edit1 - Added steps.

Edit2 - Bad phones are bad and need to have consequences!

&gt;I've played around with the resize tool with the Bootloader application. Using it seems to be breaking the files that i've made. I'd just extract the desc.txt file and redo it all manually.

**So, i've found a couple awesome gifs. I'll be making them into bootloaders soon!**

I used the recharge ability to try and save some of my remaining resonators in an attempt to preserve the field.    A second Enlightened member started taking hits on the portal..  I had to recharge again...  One more time the Reso's start depleting and I use the last of my XM power to recharge and figure this attack might be bigger then I think.    3 Enlightened were attacking one portal.
    I get on Faction chat and sound an alarm letting others know that the only Resistance fields in the city are going down.   Another Resistance member is on it just as i'm typing.
    I make my way half way across the city collecting XM as I drive, phone on the charger hoping to not run out mid battle with 0 battery left.
   I arrive on the Legislature grounds, park my car and huff it on foot.   I see nothing visually, but looking on the Comms I can see another Resonator go down right in front of.     It's dark out and I can just start making out 3 sets of legs around the portal as I approach.     I yell out ""you aren't making this easy for me!"" and now it's 5 sets of legs!   Wow are they out in numbers!

    We all introduce ourselves and shake hands!    I get some feedback on how confusing my remote recharge was for one of the enlightened.   He didn't understand why they kept coming back online!    I tell them I'm off to the other 2 portals about 30meters away to hack them for more items as I hit a 300 second (0h how I hate those) on the current portal i'm standing on.    I head off and they scramble their own way.

Clearly seeing the blue and greens on my Galaxy S3's screen!     I'm Resistance!    Instantly they knew who I was by game name and we exchanged some items with the ""drop"" function and went back to the first portal to attempt a retake.

The team that is winning Ingress is the one with the most Mind Units, which means fields are the most important thing to winning the game. The game, however, places a huge disincentive for posting fields. Sure, at lower levels creating control fields are the best way to level up, especially knowing that others will come and knock them down quickly, allowing you to re-build them for more points. As players get into the higher levels, however, the benefit of the AP for creating fields is outweighed by the fact that fields are the equivalent of putting a ""Kick Me"" sign on an elementary school kid. It all but guarantees that your farm will get knocked down, costing you valuable high level resonators.

Additionally, as a player who is looking to do some tearing down for AP, the strategy is to go to the heart of the enemies territory and find the single most connected portal and unload on it. Owning an area really doesn't mean anything, because someone can just drop a bomb right in the center and get a ton of AP. It is the same problem you see in games like Battlefield 3 whereby you push the other team back to their last spawn point, then one person runs deep into the heart of your control, captures one base, and unrealistically spawns an entire army ""behind enemy lines"".

Niantic took a step towards making things better by adding damage mitigation based on links, but it is still only 50% at max and now the incentive is to tactically create links but not fields.

I would like to see the link damage mitigation replaced by the following, which would incentivize placing fields, and increase the strategy surrounding them:

Damage mitigation for a portal is based on the percent of angle surrounding the portal that contains a field. The wording is a bit confusing, but picture three portals, connected, in a perfect equilateral triangle. Each portal has 60 degrees of field, which is 16.6% coverage, therefore the damage mitigation for each of these three portals is 16.6%. Four portals connected in a perfect square would each get 25% damage mitigation.

Initially I thought that mitigation should go to 100% (for portals completely surrounded by fields, or contained within a field), but I would not be opposed to it maxing out at something like 95%. Basically taking down a portal that is completely inside a field should be something that is nearly impossible, and if you try, it will cost a LOT. This would force people to take out the portals on the edge of control first.

The tactics that would spring up from this change would add a whole new level of strategy to the game. Teams would actually be able to control areas, and attacking another team would mean strategically working from the edge of their control towards the center. Building up defenses by capturing and creating fields farther and farther from the center of your ""base"" would be a valid tactic.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,resistance,True,t3_1e8rl1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1e8rl1/damage_mitigation_based_on_percent_of_field/,

* 98 people have used a boat, 220 a plane and 889 the railroad to play Ingress. Pretty much everyone has walked at some point though (95% of respondents)
* In terms of discussing Ingress, Google+ is king with Reddit the Queen (yay Reddit!)
* Most people chose their faction based on the rhetoric, image or ideology of the faction at a whopping 46%. 
* A good chuck of the 93% of people who say they haven't cheated, probably did.  _Technically_ using IITC can be considered cheating. 
* 18% of people have knowingly broken legal or local regulations to play Ingress (tisk tisk!)
* Ingress players are Green Environmentalists and Libertarians at 39% combined. We've got a few Monarchists in the mix too at 1%.
* 55% of players identify as Atheists or Agnostic, and finally,
* 88% of people have seen new places they wouldn't have otherwise and 83% have met new people. Sweet!

We go down to the harbor area and I find a pretty weak portal, I throw EVERY XMP burst I have at it and it's left with just a couple of slivers of power, lame.  So I decide to go and hack a few more portals, hope to get some more bursts.

I walk up to a portal and notice 3 people staring down at their phones, so I ask, ""are you guys playing ingress?""  They are, then I see another, and another, then a bunch more, all told I saw about 15-20 people, ALL RESISTANCE.  I realized right then that I'd better get back to that weak portal before they do, so with 4 level 2 bursters I go back.  This portal btw is in a place that's marked as no trespassing, quite a ways form the actual 'culturally relevant point' and no parking for a quite a ways...

So anyway, I let my girlfriend drive my jeep around, I run over, throw my bursts at it and it STILL doesn't fall.  lame.  That's when I saw a car driving slowly, as it passed the driver had his face in his phone!

So I'm done for the night, grab some taco bell, head home and decide that I'm going to hack a library on the way, pull into the parking lot and there's some dude, face down in a tablet!  I hacked it, got another burst, hit it and noticed that he had dropped a shield, it looked like he had just taken the portal and was a level 1 so I picked up the shield, yelled, ""thanks for the shield,"" and drove home.

WTF is this going to be like when it opens to the public?  This is nuts!

This is not so great for me as I play in an area that isn't officially supported, and the Google satellite imagery is very low res, it's hard to get the right location on the first attempt. Previous attempts to submit via the app have resulted in inaccurate portal locations which have only just been fixed, several months later.

I usually prefer to take the photo home, crop it, improve the GPS coordinates using Picasa and send it into super-ops@google.com from there. I guess I'd better get used to the new method.

As a consolation, if processing is indeed faster it will be good for me as I am about to move into a new city with just one portal in it.

Submit them as portal suggestions. Arrange with your local folks to cover different areas.

When i was standing in the rain, bringing down a massive field as a low-level player i got the same reward as bringing down any little field at any day/time.

The same when planning and bringing up a massive field that took a week to plan and execute. Same AP as bringing up any shitty field on your home portals.

Should you be awarded extra AP for doing something extra ordinary? 

* Fields create over X MU gives you Y extra AP?
* Bringing down a field over X MU gives you Y extra AP? Player level also taken into account.
* Taking down a portal with resonators above your level gives extra AP?

This to encourage player to do more than farming home portals to reach the next level. To take the bus to the other side of town just to bring down that giant green/blue field.

Of course there is a discussion on what is an extra effort and all that. Just a thought.

1375152969.0,27,self.Ingress,1jbngd,Thoughts on strategy from an L5 loner,tripleaardvark,36,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1jbngd/thoughts_on_strategy_from_an_l5_loner/,"I play alone mostly because I don't have a lot of time to play (married and working full time), and can't get involved in the meetups.  I have met exactly one other player, once.  He gave me a bunch of items, which was nice.  I've come to realize that people who play alone have to play differently.

Starting at L1, you're going to be doing almost nothing but farming (visiting areas with several portals and hacking them for items).  You have no hope of taking any kind of offensive action against anything.  Once in a blue moon you can find a low-level portal that no one has bothered to recharge and has only a sliver of life left, but mostly, you're going to be looking for unclaimed portals.  Use ingress.com/intel, get to know where all your local portals are, and scoop the gray ones.  Also, submit new portals.  You get an email notification the day they go live, and if it's not a busy area you can get to it first.  Portals that are on hiking trails and any place you can't get to with a car are good candidates as well.

Portal keys are pretty useless at this point.  But stock up, you get one roughly once in every eight hacks.  Once in a while you'll find yourself in an area with several existing links, and be able to drop the third link to set up a field, and at this level one field is a huge AP score.

If you can find a portal in your area that's always owned by your side, or one that you can keep yourself because it's off the beaten path, put multi-hack and heat sink mods on it for better farming.  

About L3, you'll be able to take down medium-level portals if you're well-stocked, especially on power cubes.  You'll be surprised how quickly your full XM bar drops when you start attacking a portal.  It hits back.  If it's shielded, your weapons will be much less effective until the shields break, and that costs XM, not just weapons.  You won't know how tough it is until you get out there and try it.

This is also the point where you can make portals strong enough to link at a decent range.  A portal with an average resonator level of 2 (two L3s, four L2s, two L1s for example) can link 2.6km away. In the suburbs, most clusters of portals are at least that far apart.

Once you hit L5, you can start conquering portals that have one or two L8s if you're feeling daring and have good stock.  At this point you should be looking for enemy portals that have several fields around them, but are at a low level.  Unlinked portals often aren't worth the time and cost to take them down.  Make it count.  When you can take down several fields at a time, that's a big score.  But links mitigate damage too.  Again, you just have to try it out to get a feel for it.

When you do take down a portal that has a lot of links, don't immediately build the strongest portal you can.  Just the opposite: make it weak.  You get the same amount of AP for it, and a weak portal is much easier for the enemy to take down.  If it's easier, they'll be more likely to do it quickly.  Then they'll link up all their portals again and give you another opportunity to break it down again.  You should make portals in friendly territories strong, and portals in enemy-heavy areas weak.  Hey, you're doing them a favour too.  They get AP for rebuilding those links and fields.  This is one of the most valuable but counterintuitive things I've learned.

Conversation went like this:

Girl: Do you have a pound (Â£1)?

Me: Sure, here you go. Can you tell what you want it for?

Girl: Honestly? I need Â£5 to get to Leicester.  [most likely saving to buy drugs, this girl didn't look well]

Me: Sorry, I can't give you any more.

Girl: Do you need something?

Me: Sorry?

Girl: Do you need *something*?

Me: Sorry. I don't follow you. Are you offering to sell me sex or drugs?

Girl: Sex.

Me: Uh, yeah, I'm OK thanks.

Girl: Oh, come on. I need Â£5.


Later on we went to get some hot chips. I went to pay and realised that I was short by Â£1. So I said to my friend, ""I'm sorry you will have to pay for this because I gave my last Â£1 to a crackwhore who wanted to suck my dick for Â£5. You know I'm telling the truth.""

I've played from 1 to 8 as Resistance then faction changed and played back to level 7 as Enlightened.

Heavily outnumbered we try our best to send people to knock down level 7 and 8 farms whenever we see them. 

Previously I would have said that the change didn't effec that much but these two experiences changed my mind.

On Saturday I tried to knock down 5 tightly grouped level 7 portals. I found it both very hard and used all 3 of my lower level power cubes to do so. At one point I tried even to move away and ""peck"" at the ones on the outside but from a distance the damage mitigation was so high that it was just not a valid option without having way more inventory then I would normally have on me.

On Monday we found 5 8s in a new place and i went to try and take them down. I knew I didn't have the bursters to bust them but I had about 35 L7 XMP which normally would be enough to at least knock a few resonators off each one and let someone else come around for clean up.

I managed 2 and weakened 2 more then left with my tail between my legs and 8 XMP to my name.

I hope this helps people get around a bit quicker.

Next time you're switching filters, keep an eye on the progress bar below the items. You'll notice that it doesn't change as you switch between lists and that if you're at the beginning/middle/end of a list, you'll always be at the same spot in the new list once you change the filter. You can use this to your advantage by always keeping two media kicking around.

Let's say you just fired up the app and opened your inventory. You're looking at your lowest level resonators in the ALL filter. How do you get to the very end of your portal keys list as quickly as possible? Switch the filter to Portal Keys and scroll like a crazy-person? Screw that. Switch to Media instead, swipe left so you're at the end of the progress bar, and *then* switch to Portal Keys. You're now at the end of your key list in about two seconds no matter how many keys you have.

It's pretty fine grained, so with just two media you can jump right to the beginning/middle/wherever of your key list (or ALL, if you want to get back to your resonators). Just go to Media, get the progress bar to where you want it, and then switch the filter accordingly.

Mods and Weapons will never be terribly large, so they can also be used to quickly get to the position you want, but I like Media since it's pretty useless otherwise and it's easy to keep it at just two items for maximum speed when jumping to the start or end of a list.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,enlightened,True,t3_164npe,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/164npe/a_trick_for_faster_inventory_navigation_and_an/,

It got seriously frustrating some times.  

About a week ago I decided to go ahead and root/install CM10.  I immediately went out tried running around in Ingress.  I noticed right off the bat that the tracking was night and day.  I may wander a few feet here and there, but that is pretty rare.  When driving down the same interstates as before there is no wandering off course and I can almost tell what lane I'm in.  The battery life while playing also seems to be improved a bit.  The compass is still busted and doesn't point properlly, but at least I don't have to drive past a portal for 2 blocks just to show me standing next to it anymore!

with the advent of drop rates being equalized from enemy portals I believe we need to see a change in the decay system. Its seems extremely unfair to persecute the owners of the portals with burden on having to recharge while the enemy does not have to do anything but still benefits. I can understand it if there was an actual reason to hack your own teams portals for better items but Niantic, in their infinite wisdom, have chosen to rather make it biased towards the enemy.

I also understand that a lot of communities rely on the decay to generate ap in otherwise one sided areas. So here is what I propose : Accelerating decay. Instead of 15% per day (totalling 7 days) why not start it at 5% and if its not recharged at all that day, the next goes to say 10%, then 15% then 20% etc (balanced so that it takes 7 days just like before) This means people who keep on top of their recharges do so much easier and those that chose to or simply portals that are neglected decay at the same effective rate.",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,resistance,True,t3_1jc7i0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/1jc7i0/proposed_decay_changes/,

I spent the last couple weeks gathering keys so I could build 20 fields today, plus some ugprades and I knocked down a couple fields. For that I earned about 50K AP. This took about an hour of planning and preparation, then a couple hours of driving around. Nice countryside where I am, so it's a bit of an adventure in places.

If I had of attacked the local enemy farm, knock down their fields, and rebuilt the portals, I could have easily earned 100K+ AP. This would take almost zero preparation and take only a couple hours more time. But the whole lot can be done within a day from start to finish, not weeks of farming keys.

If only Niantic would, say, double the AP for making a field and half the AP for taking down a field. Then we would see more long term fields stretching between cities.

The xm damages when a portal hit you back during xmp attack have been greatly reduced.

Before:

L1 = 75
L2 = 150
L3 = 300
L4 = 500
L5 = 750
L6 = 1125
L7 = 1625
L8 =  2500

Source: http://ingressportal.com/research/attacking/

Now:

L1 = 75
L2 = 125
L3 = 175
L4 = 238
L5 = 300
L6 = 400
L7 = 500
L8 = 600 

Note, this is the xm damage when you ""attack"" (xmp-ing) a portal, not hacking.

I think this is lame change, one of the worst change. It is becoming very easy to attack and capture a portal, you will never run out of xm.

Really, I don't understand their logic behind this. It takes quite some efforts to deploy L6 / L7 / L8 portals because you cannot do it alone. But, it is freaking easy to destroy.

This is basically a rant, but I just want to know if its like this everywhere....

My local community for both Resistance and Enlightened is really strict, expectations of minimum play time, expectations of providing specific gear in your inventory to other players if their ""tasks"" are deemed more important.

The faction I am in has multiple different levels of Google groups that require specific levels and proof to join, basically in my city if your under level 5 you're considered useless and should not participate.(*This may not be the case but its really the feeling that is given off*)

An example:

I'm level 3, I spend an afternoon taking out 3 different portals and replacing them with what I could, yes I'm aware not very effective at my level and can be destroyed again very easily. Instead of any sort of recognition for doing a good job assisting the group all I got is: ""Great, now we have to upgrade your shit and no one is close, the smurfs are going to take it back any minute now....thanks""
""Next time co-ordinate with your local elite to ensure you're not wasting your time, or ours.""

The ""Elite"" in this case is someone in the privileged group of level 5 and up players where they can discuss whatever they discuss in this group.

Anyways, end rant. I just needed to get that out, am I over reacting? Is this how it is in your city? Is this normal?

1359355611.0,27,self.Ingress,17f0nz,Some thoughts and impressions from my first week of playing Ingress.,thebornotaku,30,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/17f0nz/some_thoughts_and_impressions_from_my_first_week/,"First things first, I live/play in an area with more high level Enlightened than Resistance, and they're a lot more diligent about getting portals changed back over.

Some thoughts:

1. MU. It's pointless. I know the whole ""point"" of the game is to get MU and make big fields but without any kind of incentive to make big fields or gather MU, I've noticed that most of the time fields are small and nobody cares much when they decay or get taken down.

2. Field size and link length. Also pointless. Again, I know the ""point"" is to get MU and that the best way to do this is to make bigger fields but there isn't any incentive to make big fields. You could spend your whole day driving, farming, and hacking for 1350AP for one big field, or find a nice portal-rich area, farm and hack away, make a bunch of little fields and rake in the AP.

3. There seems to be a pretty strong level imbalance. Playing as a L1 sucked. Playing as a L2 kinda sucks, but a little less. The L7/L8 players I've talked to pretty much all say the game gets boring because they're way too powerful. I've watched one of the local L8 Enlightened players go around and completely dismantle the town in about an hour, and make it all green.

4. And on that note, when he does that, he never really bothers linking fields because again, it's pointless. The game is more ""capture the portal and try to defend it"" rather than ""make fields and control the region"".

So, some ideas:

Though it's hard to make endgame play remain interesting, here are some ideas to make it more fun while leveling:

1. Scaling AP gain for field size/MU count. I don't know how the game figures out MU count but if it went by MU, it wouldn't be as fair for people in lower population areas. Granted, they're also less likely to be challenged while attempting to make their big field so there's that. But having the base 1350AP for making a field plus a certain amount of AP for the size of the field would encourage players to make larger fields, either requiring more work on their part, or teamwork. And on that note...

2. Split AP between the players who made the field. Let's say you've got three players, A, B, and C. A links to B, B links to C, and C links back to A, in that order. When C links to A, it makes the control field and C gets all AP credit for the field. If there's boosted AP for big fields, it could easily turn in to a fight about who gets to make the final link. Easy solution is to split the AP three ways. One third of the AP gain for each link you make. All three links, all the AP is yours. Make one link, and you only get 1/3 the AP, and so on. The only problem I see with this is if you come upon a place where two of the three links are already made, so perhaps there should be a timer set for that. If all the links are made within, say, 10mins of each other, then split the AP. If else, then have it go to whoever made the field.

3. Improve Resonator placement so it coincides with reality. How? Make it so the resonator places where you are standing. There have been a few instances of portals in my town (and I'm sure, many other places) having resonators inside buildings where it's not accessable, or in the middle of a busy street or whatnot. The portal down the street from my house is like this -- it's placed at a post office that's inside a building that is no longer open to the public. The downside of this is there's about 3 or 4 resonators that you can't get very close to without climbing the roof or breaking in, and it makes it unrealistic and really hard to attack.


I'm sure I had other thoughts and suggestions but this is what I can remember right now. Otherwise, the game is great. I love getting out of the house and trekking around, as well as meeting other players. There was one time we took down a local Enlightened L8 player's portal... while he was in the same building. We took over the portal and he immediately started firing XMPs at us, it was pretty crazy to see our freshly claimed portal taking some big hits. We ran around the building to get some more XM and upgraded the portal really quick and luckily he had to do something else or whatever but later told us over the COMM that he was watching us run around outside while he was in the library.

1355950762.0,24,self.Ingress,154mlp,Idea: Control lighting of a real (portal) building corresponding to the faction which owns the portal,Xykr,37,13,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/154mlp/idea_control_lighting_of_a_real_portal_building/,"**To Niantic staff who might be reading this:** Message me if you don't like what I do.

Seeing all the pictures of (portal) buildings which happened to be illuminated in the correct faction color â wouldn't it be fun to *actually* install lighting at a suitable building which changes colors when the portal ownership changes?

I'm currently documenting their internal RPC API and getting the necessary information is easy using a library I wrote. We'd just need a spare invite code cause I'm not gonna risk my main account.

Their backend has LOTS of background checks, by the way â all game logic runs on their server, invalid client data (firing XMPs you don't have, for example) results in an error.

**What is done:**

* backend which tracks the ownership of one or multiple portals

**What we'd need:**

* good locations (the hardest part I guess)
* ~~an invite code~~ (**done** â thank you /u/jswear !)
* a tutorial and a hardware draft, because very likely the people who have access to a suitable locations aren't the ones who wrote the code

Imagine taking over a portal and an entire building changes color!

As soon as I've got an invite I'll set up the server (it's a simple HTTP API which is simple enough to be easily called from an Arduino). I won't publish the Ingress client library code, though, because it has some very real abuse potential.

For the **hardware** part â a simple setup would consist of an Arduino and an [ethernet shield](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield) which polls the API and drives an LED array or something bigger. Or a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), which is $35 and certainly cheaper than Arduino+Ethernet Shield. Any ideas on this? Someone willing to build a prototype?

**API examples** (not up yet, ~~needs invite~~):

You have to get the GUID by looking at the JSON calls on the Intel site, using Chrome dev tools for example.

Example query:

    http://query.ingressapi.net/portal?uid=96c410eac6af49658d5b27b5fe2449b.12

Result:

        {
             ""name"": ""Bound Brook World War I Memori"",
             ""faction"": ""RESISTANCE"",
             ""coords"": [...],
             ""level"": 5,
             ""resonators"": 3,
             ""attacked"": false
        }

Simple API, for embedded devices:

    http://query.ingressapi.net/portal?uid=96c410eac6af49658d5b27b5fee2449b.12&amp;key=faction

Result:

    RESISTANCE

I'm also thinking about some kind of push mechanism, maybe based on IRC, which would eliminate the need to poll.
    
**Update 1**: I've got an extra invite code and I'll set up the query.ingressapi.net server tomorrow! Some DIY/Arduino fans here who want to build a small proof of concept?

1353697119.0,25,self.Ingress,13oenc,Ingress Strategy; My Take,Galanodel2012,36,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/13oenc/ingress_strategy_my_take/,"Hey there fellow ingress players. So I thought I would share some of the strategies I have learned working the battleground of Orlando. Note that this isn't a ""Tips and Tricks"" thread, we have enough of those. Instead, let's look at some things you can do to really stick it to the other side in your area! The biggest thing you will need for any of these is a friend to play with you.

1. Resource Starvation: So, the best way to deal with a ton of newer players in your local area is to resource starve them. Find the portals that are clustered together (parks are a good place), areas where 5-10 portals are clustered all together, and raise them to the highest level you can (3 is good when facing level 1 players), and shield them. Without level 1 portals to hack, these lower level players will quickly run out of resources, and a level 1 XMP does about 4% damage to a rare shielded level 3 resonator even if you are standing on top of it.

2. The Buffer Zone: When creating large fields, create buffer zones of nearby, lower level portals. The idea is that when players show up to take your stuff, they'll target your lower level portals out of convenience, generating warning e-mails from Niantic Ops, and allowing you to prepare for their upcoming attacks on the higher level stuff. By utilizing this strategy, we were able to mount a successful defense of two cornerstone level 3 portals in our area last night.

3. Forward those Niantic emails: We have a separate e-mail created that we automatically forward all Niantic e-mail to, so that we get a unique sound on our phones when stuff comes under attack. This allows us to be on the ball when we are attacked.

4. Idle with a full XM bar: This one is majorly important. Always return home with as full a bar as often as you can. You don't want to be caught empty of XM and suddenly have to recharge portals under attack, otherwise, you end up hopping in your car at 9:50 PM at night to defend stuff like us last night.

5. Level 4: This is your target level. You want to reach this as soon as possible. Level 4 is the highest level portal two people can make working as a team, and has a link distance the same as most cities. With level 4 portals, you can be basically immune to level 1 and 2 players, as long as everything is shielded.

6. Links of all sizes have a purpose: So, create links of even smaller sizes for more AP to level, as well as creating a base for further away links. For example, most of our stuff in Orlando is linked together on a smaller scale , and then we will link further away stuff to the two previous linked ones, creating a control field that is smaller on one end, but huge on the other. This minimizes on travel time, and generates a decent number of MUs.

7. Destroying enemy resonators: The key to destroying enemy resonators can be broken down into a few easy to follow steps. Stand on top of a resonator, fire an XMP. Keep firing until the one you are standing on is at about 20%. Then move to the other side of the circle, and do it again. Your goal is to weaken all of them, so that 2 or 3 final blasts will kill them almost simultaneously, keeping the enemy from reacting to the destruction emails quickly enough.

My nearest portal is 2km away (line of sight), or 4km by car/bike/walk. My town has a good farm going (it's a university town) with about 20+ portals in total. So it's fairly easy to stock up on items and there is a reasonable amount of XMP around, but it's not great.  There is zero XMP where my house is, and where I work.

The nearest towns/villages are about 30min travel time (highway speeds) from each other. So when I have the time I spend a few hours travelling to the next town, take down all their portals and links, put up mine. Only to find out that 5minutes later the locals tear them down again. Meh, it's why I'm now L6 i guess.

It's very easy to run out of XMP during an attack and then I have to travel more than 200m to find another portal with XMP around it.

The effort I put in to visit and maintain portals is already fairly high (walking through fields, muddy paths, woodland), but with this new decay rate it's pretty well impossible to maintain the remote portals. 

Sure, I'll change my strategy to accommodate. And I'll have to play more aggressively and less defensively. But it's a pity that Ingress is very much geared towards urban players. 

How would I fix this? Not sure. Maybe introduce character classes like Engineer and Commando. Engineer can build better portals, but can't attack them as easily. Vice-versa for commandos.

We are able to build fairly large fields because of the lack of competition and the fact that everyone around here has to travel 30+ km to get to work, so there is a lot of key exchange and courier missions going on. But now it doesn't seem worth putting up such big fields when there are only a few people available to maintain them.

Of all the app updates, only the most recent has had anything in the ""What's new"" section: ""Bug fixes."" Other than a couple of instances, they seem to have made a decision to generally not communicate with players about the game, only about the storyline.

We all know that this is a beta and that we can expect bugs and changes as they work toward a full release, but does anyone else find the lack of communication frustrating? Maybe some of you like the mystery of it all, I certainly like the mystery of the storyline, but when it comes to gameplay, I'd appreciate a ""Hey, guys, we're playing around with how fields decay to (reason), we're going to push a change so they (how it works now), we may make another change to this depending on how it works out.

I'll start with some of my best:

* **Place all resonators directly on portal** - This is probably the one single every new player makes. I've been playing only 3 days, but I've seen that one quite often... mostly with Resistance portals, so I won't complain. Saved me some XMPs.

* **Play with GPS disabled** - I have to admit that this took me longer than it should have. I had already hacked several portals and captured some more when I encountered one portal (a bit more off from the city centre) that somehow was always shown out of reach, although I was standing at its exact center. Turns out, Ingress needs GPS enabled to work properly... but on the positive side: I was able to catch a portal in the middle of a lake by deliberately disabling my GPS. Cell/WiFi location was off by about 50 meters, and placed me right on top of the portal.

* **Forget that keys disappear when creating links** - It was a perfect plan: Upgrade portal A, link A to B, and A to C, then travel to B, upgrade it, and link it to C to create the biggest field in the area. Okay, I had to leave soon, but the time would just be enough to accomplish everything. And everything worked fine... except for the last part of linking B to C - ""no linkable portals"". But at least I learned something: when you link to a portal, you lose its portal key. Plan accordingly!
* **Fire XMPs from wrong locations** - XMP bursters have a linear decrease in damage... if you want to target a single resonator, be sure to be right on top of it when firing.
* **Drive 20km to a bunch of unclaimed portals only to find out there is no cell phone reception at that place** - similar: drive 10km to an unclaimed portal only to find that it's not accessible.

I could only find two anywhere near me that were not captured (there are no Enlightened portals either). One looked like it was inside the bounds of a big power plant, so I figured it was inaccessible. The other was up the highway, at an exit by a local prison. I figured I'd try the second.
So I drove out there. Got off the highway, staring straight at the prison. I have to drive around it to get to the ""Post Office"" that the portal is at. I get there.

Good news: There is a parking lot for me to sit in while I swap SIMs so I can use my Android phone. Bad news: This is part of the prison. Like, layers of 20' electrified concertina wire fences and guard towers part of the prison.

So I pull into the parking lot and stop, then pull out my bag and begin swapping phones. As I'm working, I realize that this must be the guards parking lot. People in uniform are coming out of the fenced off area and pulling off flack jackets. Whatever, I didn't see any signs.

I get swapped and power up my other phone. The compass is terribly calibrated, but it looks like the portal might be inside the prison. I spend a few minutes playing with it, and eventually get out of the car and begin walking across the parking lot towards the huge fence, when the compass recalibrates itself and it turns out to be along the road, not inside the prison.

So I walk along the row of cars until I am within range, and hack the portal. Then a guard asks me if I'm waiting for someone. I tell him no, I'm 'testing something on my phone.' He asks something unintelligible, and I say something about being a local university student. A fully uniformed guard walks over and asks if I mean to be here. I tell her yes, I'm not lost. Then she asks if I have permission to be here. Uhhhh, no. She kindly asks me to leave, and I do.

So I hacked the portal and got lootâ¦. but didn't drop a resonator. I don't think I'm going back.ï»¿",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,resistance,True,t3_14cmie,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/14cmie/going_to_prison/,
