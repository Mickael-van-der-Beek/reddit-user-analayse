To be clear, I'm still not going to remove posts asking for advice and tips. I don't think it's fair to limit conversation to whatever 7 people happened to chime in the first time a topic was posted. Advice threads don't just help the person asking - they also encourage veteran comics to reflect on their experience. Teaching someone else forces you to adapt your own philosophy to others, and makes you a better communicator.

That being said, it *is* helpful to have a one-stop-shop for comedy advice. When I started in 2004, the only [standup FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/comedy-faq/standup/) was from the old alt.comedy.standup newsgroup in the late 90s. While the tips about pandering and hack material still hold up, it's woefully out of date when it comes to things like twitter, youtube, alt shows and other industry advances. Given the depth of experience we have on this subreddit, I think crowdsourcing the project will be better.

Right now, the wiki just has the basics of getting started. But there's no reason it couldn't expand to include everything from promoting local shows to starting your own mic to getting Montreal auditions. Right now I've set the editing requirements as low as possible. If you've been subscribed for at least a month, and racked up 10 comment karma in /r/standup, you're eligible. If they're still too high for you to make edits, let me know and I can look into adjusting them.

1370005480.0,63,self.Standup,1fegev,Some advice to new comics..,HyenaMoon,79,16,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1fegev/some_advice_to_new_comics/,"OK I've been doing comedy for several years and I like to think im pretty good. I see so many posts on here asking for advice on standup, or new ways to go about getting better at standup. I'm just gonna post things I know to be true for me, that I feel may help you.

- The only way to get better, is to write constantly and go up often. I see people's posts offering up new ways to up your standup game. No. Keep it simple stupid. You're overthinking it.

- Don't burn bridges. Even if theyre unfunny hacks. 

- Make friends. Network. This will open up new opportunities for you.

- Need 5 minutes of material? Write 10 minutes. Edit that down to 5. Add to it now. Make it 10 minutes again. Edit THAT down to 5. Now you should have a very tight 5 minutes. You just turned that coal into a diamond baby!

- People worry about hecklers too much. You dont get them often, at least in my experience. Dont overdo it with them, you want the crowd on your side. 

- that being said you want to be likeable/relatable. This will let you get away with some jokes an unlikeable comic wouldnt. Also if you have a joke eat shit, the audience is still with you and on your side. This is important.

- Don't steal jokes. You should know this.

- Be on time, don't run the light asshole. You want to be asked up again at a show? dont run over your time. Its not fair to the other comics and the host because you just have to get in one more joke about your stupid cat.

- keep a notebook with you. jot down ideas you can come back to and form into jokes/premises later on. This makes life easier.

- when you feel more confident start hosting shows. This will help you get good fast.

- again, i have to stress this - stop overthinking it. 

Write.
Edit.
Do mics.
Write.
Edit. 
Do more mics.
Dont be late. 
Dont run the light.
Dont make enemies
Make the crowd like you.

In addition to making the show free, this means more stagetime is available, so here's some some info on booking.",Uncoolio,67,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1itp5o/it_took_a_year_but_rstandups_nyc_show_is_now/,"We're looking for experienced, working comics - not open micers. You don't have to be full-time; MCs and features are fine. But you should be good enough at comedy that someone will occasionally pay you to do it. While we make exceptions, we're generally looking for at least 5 years of experience.

The first and easiest way to get booked is to have major credits. If you've been on Comedy Central, Conan, Letterman etc., we're going to put you on the show. Even if the comic's connection to reddit is tangential, credits help draw a crowd. Without a crowd we don't have a show.

The second best way is to know me personally. This isn't just about putting friends on. If I've met you in person, I've probably seen you perform. If I've seen you do well live, I'm way more likely to put you on. If we've never met, there's a chance we still have mutual friends. If a comic I know and respect would recommend you, I'd definitely try to accommodate them. If they're famous enough, I don't even have to know them personally. If Marc Maron says ""put him on,"" I'm doing it.

(Incidentally, a good way to know me personally is to drink with me. And an easy way to do that is to hang out at the /r/standup show!).

The third best way is to be active on reddit. If you're regularly contributing good discussion and content to /r/standup and /r/standupshots, we try to get those people on. Even though I don't always participate in the discussion, I do read it. (Except for the ""critique my first set"" videos. While I don't remove them, I usually find them as terrible as everyone else).

Videos actually *aren't* a great way to get booked. Like most of you, I spend enough time watching standup without watching random submissions that might be terrible. But /r/standupshots is a great way to get my attention. Live delivery is superior, but the quick joke format allows me to see more comics in less time. If I see 3-4 good bits from one person, I'm much more likely to check out their youtube channel - because I know they have some solid writing. That's how I found out about comics like Bill Squire and Josh Johnson.

Booking is a horrible process and there's no way to make everybody happy. I can't promise you'll get on. But in keeping with the educational theme of the subreddit, I can promise that I'll be open an honest about *why* we book who we do - which is more than you'll get from most clubs.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_1itp5o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1itp5o/it_took_a_year_but_rstandups_nyc_show_is_now/,moderator

--------------

Classic first gigs mistakes: 

Talking too fast. 
Getting pissed. 
Not staying in the light. 

Nerves: nerves are good. Embrace them. It can feel unpleasant before going on stage, don't sweat it. It's kinda like you're in a chrysalis, changing from normal you into onstage you. There's no high afterwards without them anyway. 

Stand up straight on stage. 

Watch the pros. 

Start and end with great gags. 
At a gong type affair start with a bang. 
BTF audience seem like kittens, they'll give you time. 
At a more brutal gong night, or any big room really, start off with a big bang. When I did London Store Gong in '02 acts were often off stage within 10 words. 

Surround yourself with good comedy. CD's books, live, DVD's whatever. A good comic is a comic 24 hours a day. 

It's often easier to perform to strangers rather than friends. Think carefully about packing the room with your mates. But at the end of the day, whatever works for you. 

Believe in what you say. If you don't show that you think it's funny they won't believe it is either. Comedy is nothing without belief. It's all a con trick. Many 'great' acts have no jokes to speak of (Hicks, Pryor, Carlin, Rock etc. ). The audience don't seem too notice or mind. 

Watch the whole show. Learn from how others dealt with the same audience. 

Aim to write every day, gig every night. (yes I always say that, but it's such good advice) 

Don't over-run. 

Never, ever , ever , ever apologise. Don't show weakness. Don't say you're not really a comedian, have a day job, aren't sure about this one etc. They want to believe you are the man. Let them. On stage you are the alpha male. 
(Easy advice to give. Hard to follow) 

If it's the sort of club where the audience dress up then wear a shirt, unless not doing so is really part of your schtick. 

Important one this: DON'T CHURN YOUR MATERIAL TOO MUCH. 
A lot of new acts do a gig, it doesn't work as they'd like, they ditch everything and do a new set next time and so on. Don't do it. Always review and grade your material (from tape if you can), keep the best stuf, replace the weakest with the best of your new material. I would say for a new act if you're changeing more than 10% of your material between gigs you're probably shooting yourself in the foot. As you go on that ratio drops. After a few years 1% is good. 

Re: sick material. Be careful, especially if you're new. 
Sick stuff can be ace, but handle carefully. For a skillfully written funny joke the sickness gives it an extra edge, makes it funnier, injects energy into the room. If it isn't up to scratch all these factors go into reverse and you alienate them. That's why you see so many rubbish new acts try and be shocking and fail at it so badly. 'I fück kids' - do you? great! well done you. For most people sick stuff is best left till the second half of yours set by when they hopefully like you and have belief. Early on you may lack the skill to get over sick stuff. Ease into it. A bit at a time etc. 

Of course if your entire schtick is sickness then you have to just go for it. 
If you even dip your toe into these waters then watch Jim Jeffries first, and listen to Dough Stanhope. Even more so than normal stuff sick stuff requires belief. If you say it hoping they'll like it, they won't. My first four years I did mildy dodgy stuff and they often rebelled on it. Why? I was too weak with it. If you're going to do it , do it. With attitude and belief. If they get arsey? plough on. Up the stakes. You lose some of the room? So what? the rest can more than make up for it. You die the odd spectular death? so what? 

'Do, or do not, there is no try'. - Yoda. 

(can you tell from the above bit that Rob pm'ed me some gags that were a bit dark?) 

When you die (it will happen), don't take it personally. 
What's the worst that can happen. Feel a bit of an idiot? someone tells you you're shït? who really cares? 
I lost count fo the amount of people who told me early on that I should give up, never go on stage again etc. Now I make a good living, so fück them all. 

When it doesn't work, or indeed after every gig really, review how it went. What didn't work? what you should have done differently? if you weren't the best on the bill what can you learn from that? 

If it's not working, stick to your guns. The crowd may come round. It takes effort to dis-like someone. After three minutes a lot of crowds that don't like initially can clue into what you are doing. Don't bottle it or try plan B before this point has passed. 

Every word you say on stage has a job to do. If it doesn't, cut it. If two can be replaced by one, grand. Edit, edit, edit. 

'Experiment in good rooms, edit in tough ones. You need both to grow' -Jerry Seinfeld 

On a tough night you are so grateful for all your bankers. The killer gags that always work, that usually get a round of applause. These are your islands in the stream. Collect as many as you can. The feeling you have on stage on a hard night where your desperately looking for your next big laugh to hold them? that's why you need to write more. Love your bankers. When you try new material, if it doesn't get a round of applause do you really want it? 

Have regular punchlines. As a rule never go more than 15 seconds without a big laugh. The longer the lead up to the gag the better the pay off should be. If you're going to make them wait a minute or heaven forbid even two for the pay-off it had better be fücking great. 

Sometimes it's not working as it should. Assuming you're not in your first few minutes you might want to try and banter to re-engage their attention. Go into the audience, chat be funny, make a connection, return to your stuff. Repeat as necessary. Maybe not for the newbie. In fact it's really hard full stop. 

Hecklers can do the above job for you of course. Succesfully dealing with a heckle can energise a set when you would otherwise be losing them. Dont' be afraid of heckles. When heckled: 

1) Consider whether you need to respond. If it's a big room, and a quiet heckle you may just want to ingore it and go over it. You don't have to stamp on everyone. But if enough people heard it, and it is a challenge to your authority then have 'em. 

2) In a big room repeat the heckle before replying. Many of the audience won't have heard it. If you don't repeat it first they won't know why you are saying what you are saying. It also gives you time to think of a clever response. 
(easy advice to give, hard to follow, someone heckles, you think of something really clever, you blurt it out all pleased with yourself,90% of the audience don't get it because they didn't hear what your are responding to. damn) 

3) Ideally respond with something 'in the moment' it doesn't have to be great, they wil love the spontaneity and alphaness of it. If nothing occurs to you have reach for one of your pre-written heckle put downs. 

4) Standard put-downs. At some point or another we all use these when our back is to the wall, but if this is more than once or twice a year then you are a lazy hack. Try harder. 


Joke rules: 
1) Look for the 'reveal' - the key word that springs the trap of the joke's mis-direction. Put it at the end of the sentence. 90% of the time this increases the word's power and hence the jokes surprise and laughter. Occassionally it sounds too contrived to have it at the end but always try it there first. 

2) Jokes have internal rhythms that help them work. You have to play about with this and get a feel for it. Try it different ways and see what sounds right, what is comfortable to say. 

I often insert a bridge into the middle of a line to help the rhythm. 
Set-upy, set-upy,set-upy. 
Seemingly unnecessary bridge. 
Punchey, punchey, punch. 

Two popular ones (often used to disguise a weak punchline) are: 

Build, build, build, build, build, build. Drop! 

Quiety, quiety, quiety, quiety, quiety, Slam! 


3) Write the way you speak. 

4) If you've got two versions of a joke and suggests a visual image, use that one. 

5) cliches aid misdirection, we're used to thinking about them in certain ways. 

6) If you can't write jokes, buy them off someone who can, failing that buy a guitar. 

This started off as a newbie guide, and ended up as everything I know about comedy, with added prejudices. 

One final thing then. All the advice you are given is people telling you what was right for them. It doesn't mean it is what is right for you. Choose wisely and follow your own path. Good luck. Don't forget to enjoy it, it's the best buzz in the world. Thanks for the chips.

This entire time I've been working up the balls (and the material) to go up and tonight was the night. It was awesome. I had so much fun. I met so many cool people. It was an open mic in Huntsville, AL. One thing Huntsville isn't known for is its comedy and the scene is really small but growing. There were probably twenty people at the place at most and about six comedians went on. All of them were awesome. I got some laughs, I didn't bomb. Some jokes didn't do as well as others, but I contribute that to poor delivery and nerves. I think if I worked on them they'll be more successful. Like Louis C.K. once said, if you bomb that's okay because you have a shitload of data to pour through and make your set better. I didn't bomb, but I still have a TON of stuff to hone and perfect before next week. The challenge now is just doing this shit without my notes, I hope to do that next week. That's my goal at least.

This came up briefly in the comments of a thread a little while back and the idea has stuck with me. I'm currently the artistic director of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City, and if /r/standup wanted to do a monthly stand up show at our new East Village venue - UCBeast (Ave A and 3rd Street) - we could make that happen. 

* What do people think? 
* Would anyone be interested in hosting/producing? I think it would be best if we had two co-hosts who shared hosting/booking responsibilities.
* We could tell people about this in the NYC meet up threads and potentially turn this into a monthly stand-up show / Reddit meet up in the East Village at a cool comedy space with a bar with cheap craft beers 

Obviously, I am biased and am coming at this from the perspective that I think it would be a cool show to have at the theatre I am in charge of booking the programming for. But I also think this would potentially be a positive think for /r/standup and NYC Redditors in general. 

Thoughts?

I thought I'd throw in my contribution by sharing my writing technique which I've just settled on. So far is working great and I figure it might help some of you who were struggling with the process as i have been. I've struggled for some time not with writing per sé but with keeping my writing in an structured way that allows me to actually build on what I have. Here's my new approach...

I have 3 categories of joke blocks: One liners, Quick 6's and Subroutines. 

One liners are self explanatory and at first they don't have any place in my routine. I can't remember 30 arbitrary one liners - so instead I consider them to be the first joke in a series of ""Quick 6's"". 

""Quick 6's"" are a series of one liners. Now, I'm using the term ""One liner"" loosely, but anything around a brief paragraph or less qualifies. Once I have a related block of 6 (or so) I lock em off and memorise that block. They can then become part of a routine, because i have memorised a block of them rather than a bunch of fragments.

""Subroutines"" are jokes I write that are several paragraphs long. They can have just come about that way or (more commonly) they are the natural evolution of a ""Quick 6"" block. 

I then build routines out of a combination of Quick 6's and Subroutines.

Id also like to add that to do this effectively i use an app called ""Scrivener"". This allows me to have a master list of all my jokes and draw from them to create ""collections"" which are essentially like playlists. That way if i tweak or amend my jokes as I create a fresh routine those changes are reflected in the master document.

Long term I intend to use the George Carlin/Louis CK approach of performing all my jokes in a festival show and then throwing everything out to make space for fresh material the following year.

It feels finally like I am working on something finite and tangible rather than ongoing and amorphous. That's a big deal for me. If it's not a big deal for you, ignore this post :) Otherwise, I recommend trying out the approach I have described.

Did the gig tonight and... Wow...just... Wow.

This is going to take some explaining.

The venue was a Sports Bar inside a Bowling Alley.  I arrived early to scope the place out and try to get a feel for the crowd.  Upon arrival I was informed by the 'booker' that part of the room had been reserved for a company Christmas Party, which I found odd since we were meant to be doing Stand Up.  I said as much and was informed it ""would be okay, they won't disturb us.""

Looking around, I made note of the 4 pool tables, 2 air hockey tables, 1 basketball shooting game, and 30 odd TVs lining the walls.  

The stage was a raised platform about a foot tall with a second section behind it backed by one of those banners you can get beer distributors to print for you. It was being held up by three wooden slats that were pretty well leaning in on each other for support. All of which was stuffed into a corner of the room.

The front row of seating, 2 banquet tables and some folding chairs, was parked right up next to the stage.  Like RIGHT next to the stage.  Table seating behind that and booth seating off to one side.

People trickled in over the course of the next half hour.  Most of them went to join the throng at the bar, also located in the same room, not 50 feet from the stage.  All told, we had MAYBE 150 people scattered throughout the room with 2/3 of them permanently at the bar.

Two of the other three comedians showed up about 20 minutes prior to show start with the third arriving about 10 minutes before his set started.  I was told I would be opening and I would have 10 minutes to fill.  Unfortunately, 1 of the other comedians was told HE would be starting and was somewhat surprised to hear this.  He had been in ear shot when I was told I would start and he said as much.  So starting spot remained mine.

Show got started about 10 minutes late because the booker was trying to get people to come sit down, which they resolutely refused to do.  He introduced me and off I went.

Except I didn't get very far.  The loud C&amp;W music that had been playing prior to the show continued to play.  The microphone hadn't been set up properly and so my volume had to compete with the musics volume to in order to even be heard.  Pool games continued, people spoke loudly to one another and ignored what they could hear of me.  Feedback was all over the place and the microphone kept cutting out.  Between one thing and another I lost at least 4 punchlines to the sound system.  All the TVs stayed on throughout the first two sets including the two at either side of the stage.  

Even if I had material that could have killed, I was clearly running a handicapped race.  And, at about 3 minutes into my set, the booker started telling me I was running out of time.

Needless to say, as I scrambled to mentally cut material, things went downhill from there.  I got a couple of chuckles from the two or three people sitting close enough to hear, but by and large I was bombing before I even got into things.

And then the second act came on stage.  Since he was more of a veteran than I, the first thing he did was complain about the music still running, the shitty feedback, the TVs still running and all the people talking.  None of these were actually fixed until about half way through his 20 minutes but that's okay because as soon as it was, people started playing air hockey.  The remainder of his set was punctuated by the plink plink of people playing the game.  I watched a guy with 8 years of experience bring his A material and utterly waste it.  There were maybe three chuckles in his entire set.

The third act fared no better.  By now only a handful of people were even looking at the stage.  He tried for about a minute to get anyone to even respond to his crowd work or answer a couple simple questions and then abandoned his material and started riffing on the venue in general.  Nothing.  No interest, no participation, no laughs, nothing.  If anything the people in the bar got louder so they could carry on conversations over him.

And then...  I swear this is true, so help me God.  The booker handed the microphone to one of the audience members and sent him up on stage.  For a good 10 minutes.  No jokes, no stories, no funny stuff at all, just ten minutes about how he is Jamaican, has one Jamaican kid and came from Jamaica.  I left for a smoke.

Then our headliner came up.  You can guess how that went.  A material, not a laugh to be had, etc. etc. etc.

Tonight, including myself, 4 comedians and one random guy from the crowd bombed and bombed hard.  I was embarrassed, not for myself, but for the guys who knew what they were doing and got a shitty venue with a shitty crowd and some seriously shitty treatment.  I don't know what that crowd was there for, but it certainly wasn't to see and enjoy some comedy.

And that's the story of my first gig. ",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_14rxw7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/14rxw7/massive_bomb_delivered_tonight/,

The only time you should shit on a comedian is if they did something to disrupt the energy of the room, like get hostile with the audience or act like a piece of shit.  In that case, your goal should be trying to spin the room back into a safe place.

Just in general, as a host when you get up on stage and act annoyed, as if your job is a chore and that you are doing people a favor for being up there, then that attitude will be reflected upon the audience and the mic will become a self-fulfilling prophesy and it will suck.  (And if you do feel that way, why are you even there in the first place?)
   
Meanwhile, if a mic hosts that are positive and constructive, and excited about the whole process, then that energy will spread into the audience and the show can become pretty fun, no matter how small or awkward the venue.

I've been writing material lately, and going to a lot of shows, and trying to get up the guts to do an open mic.  Paid $8 tonight to see a guy who I wasn't really familiar with, named Rick Overton at a small club near me that only holds about 80 people.  Rick was way better than I could have hoped for and had us rolling.  About 30 minutes in, he stopped and said he had a friend with him who was in town shooting a movie, and brought him to the stage.  IT WAS ROBIN FUCKING WILLIAMS.  The two of them riffed off of each other for about another half hour and it was pretty much the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.  Mr. Williams is a true master of improv (though it's been said he steals much material) and took total command of the room.  Nothing threw him off, and his mind went to the strangest places in front of our very eyes with the greatest of ease.  At the end of the set, he and Mr. Overton paid homage to the great Jonathan Winters.

I know comedians do this sometimes; show up unexpectedly at little shows, but it has never happened at a show I've attended, and I am thrilled it happened to such a huge degree the first time I got to experience it.

All of my breakthroughs on stage have occurred as a direct result of bombing somewhere. Those times where you have to do 12 minutes at a bar in the middle of nowhere for people that just want you to shut up and let them destroy their liver in peace are when you try anything and everything you can. And that's how you discover what works for you, because what I do in that situation is different from what you do, and different from what everyone else does.  

Failure in comedy is a learning experience. I fail all the time. Sometimes on purpose. Then when you do the Improv main stage, you're ready to kill them. That's the payoff for all the hard work.

Show was last Sat, 11/10.",bmorecomical,36,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/132aky/update_to_the_opening_for_stanhope_post_if/,"So, I was told I'd do 12 minutes. There would be a host and 2 of us local guys opening. I prepared what I thought was my strongest 12. When I got there, I was told I'd do 5 minutes. Then a few minutes later I was told I'd do 10, which is what ultimately happened. Trying to reaccess my act not once, but twice, right before the show was a bit frightening. So I'm warning others that haven't done a show like this that this probably happens a lot. New to me. 

At any rate, I went up second. Packed, sold out room. Apparently around 400 people. I have never blanked or had to refer to my emergency notes in my pocket, but part of me was scared tonight I'd break that streak, since it was the biggest crowd I'd played to.

Honestly it went really well. Somehow I was on autopilot as soon as I hit the stage. Never forgot a word or tripped up on a punchline. The crowd liked me and was interested and didn't heckle. I couldn't have had a better set at this stage in my comedy game. 

Afterwards, a lot of strangers were stopping me and coming up to me and telling me they liked my set and thought I was funny. I felt like a rock star. Hope to have another opportunity of this caliber again soon. 

When I was asked to do this show, I jumped on it without hesitation, even though I know guys who have been doing it longer around here, and guys who I think are honestly funnier than me. I was scared. I was nervous. But I said yes and I prepared as much as I could because I saw it as a great opportunity. I'm glad I did it. If something like this comes your way, no matter how scared it might make you, I say do it. Without question. 

By the way, Doug was very nice. He gave me and the openers props on stage and remembered and said our names. He hung out for a bit with us and our wives/girlfriends afterward, and had the security guys bring fans backstage to get stuff signed and get pics taken. Some local comics I'm friends with came out, and I was able to let them all backstage to meet him and hang as well. A really cool guy. Talked about sports a lot more than I expected, haha.

So here is the question I have for the comedians of Reddit that have fully commited to making comedy a profession.  The profession and lifestyle that you have chosen is one that requires you to shun the social aspect of a 9-5 life.  You have undoubtedly missed countless parties, birthdays, weddings, etc...

1370636112.0,24,self.Standup,1fvuyt,Just finished my first year. Some things I've learned along the way.,bmorecomical,35,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1fvuyt/just_finished_my_first_year_some_things_ive/,"I've done 68 mics in MD/PA/DC/VA in my first 365 days. Here's my ""stats"" and what I've picked up along the way.

Highlights: featured 7 times, headlined twice, opened for Doug Stanhope (I've posted about that one [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/132aky/update_to_the_opening_for_stanhope_post_if/) if you're interested). Broke 200 followers on Twitter (that shit ain't easy out here), was a guest on a podcast [here](http://digressionsessions.com/robfarley/).

Lowlights: Three sets I considered a 1 out of 5, ten sets I considered a 2 out of 5 (I rate everything afterward based on how I feel immediately after leaving the stage), getting heckled once by a guy matter-of-factly saying ""You're not funny,"" driving an hour and a half to perform in front of 9 audience members for free, bouts of depression and lack of confidence, drinking too much at a lot of bar shows (after my set is over).

**Things I've learned and consider to be true:**

-Try every room at least once. In general, perform as much as you can. BUT, and this is something I don't hear a lot, I don't think you HAVE to keep doing every room and HAVE to expect to do great everywhere, all the time. A bluegrass band isn't going to go over well at a heavy metal bar. Just as not all music is the same, not all comedy and places to perform are the same. Sometimes it really isn't worth it, but be discerning when deciding where to cut your losses.

-Be nice to everyone to their face and also behind their back, there's a lot of favors and back-scratching to be had in this game.This doesn't mean lie to people who are terrible and tell them they're hilarious. It just means be a decent human being.

-Close every good set with your Twitter handle (EDIT: /user/EmperorSexy points out that this is debatable, see comments). Use #FF to help gain more traction on Twitter. Also if you're a comic and you're not on Twitter, you're wrong. Get on there. Tweet jokes. Gain followers. Plug your shows. 

-Keep refining your shit, it can always get better.

-Open mics are for new stuff, riffing, crowd work. The ""crowd"" is often other comics and they don't want to hear your old shit for the 1000th time. It'll do you no favors there. 

-Hosting is harder than it looks. I recommend listening to Cameron Esposito host on the Put Your Hands Together podcast and try to emulate the way she's so enthusiastic, personable, kind, and engaging with the audience. 

-With time, figure out what your ""can't miss"" 5 minutes are for those chances you get at showcase shows or performing on a show that you can't believe you're on (i.e. everyone else seems out of your league). Then try to figure out what your ""can't miss"" 7 minutes are, and so on.

-If you're new, you're probably not edgy as much as you are offensive and tactless. Calm down, champ. Enough with the racial and jerking off stuff.

-Audio record your sets and listen back. If you start featuring maybe it's time to buy a camcorder and a tripod. I did, just to tape my two headlining sets. I feel listening/watching back is a great way to see what you did right and what you did wrong.

-Keep writing. If you get writer's block and are frustrated you can't think of anything new, work on refining the old shit. Just keep at it.

-The best way to recover from a terrible set is to make sure the next one is good. Even if that means pulling out more old/safe stuff than you'd ideally like, you're gonna want to get that confidence back, dude.

-No one is ""unbombable"" and it happens.

-Don't stand up there looking like you're regurgitating pre-memorized shit, look like you're having fun for christ's sake. Use powerful posture and body language that lets people know you're in control of this room right now and you're a confident, funny person.

-If you have to do bringer shows, suck it up. I know they suck, but going to war with a promoter isn't a smart option either. 

-Be relentless. In writing, in booking, in promotion, in performing, in trying. Be relentless, and persevere.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,1370639218.0,,,True,t3_1fvuyt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1fvuyt/just_finished_my_first_year_some_things_ive/,

I'm a Bay Area open micer, been doing it for a little over a year and had THE WORST experience last night. Did a bringer show for two fairly experienced Bay Area ""producers"" who book for the Punchline in sf and sac and a couple other places so I knew it was going to be important to bring a lot of people and do well. So I bust my ass and bring 15 people (doesnt seem like a lot but im still new, all ive got is friends and family) and really work hard for the show. All the while getting emails from the ""producers"" of the show telling me how important it is to get people out and how we're all going to make 3 dollars per (20 dollar) ticket. Hooray. whatever, i just wanna so the show, ya know? So I get there and my people are the only ones there, none of the other comics on the show had brought anyone. The ""producers"" then proceeded to bring the comics out back and berate us by saying things like ""you guys will never work for us again"" and ""I might just cancel the show."" Just in general being assholes because they didn't get enough money out of unknowing open micers families. So the show goes on as it must and everyone does pretty well anyways and has a good time. At the end of the show, said producer gets up and says ""there's another show happening now so you all have to leave"" to the group of people i brought who had just paid a collective 300 dollars to be there PLUS the two item minimum and were not even lingering, just getting up to leave. So before I headed out I went up to one of the ""producers""  and asked about the 45 dollars (3 dollars per 20 dollar ticket) I was told I would receive in the multiple emails this dick sent me. She responded ""Oh, no , no, no, no ones getting paid tonight."" Oh. What am I supposed to say to that!? Just no. Oh okay. Jesus.  Anyway, I can't say anything because these 2 book everywhere and i love Stand Up but if you're from the Bay Area you might know who I'm talking about.

Our host was scared and timid on stage (second timer trying to host) and it trickled down. 

We chose the wrong night to try to do comedy at a very popular bar. Plenty of people were coming in and not expecting a comedy show, coming in in groups of ten while loudly talking. The audience probably had enough patience for 3 acts and when they didn't prove themselves, they just stopped caring about the existance of the stage, it seemed. 

advice: if you're establishing a new mic at a hotspot, charge admission in exchange for a drink ticket. The point isn't the money, its to establish a mindset/respect for the mic and the stage space. It'll turn away assholes who aren't trying to see a comedy show. 

Advertise the hell out of it to reduce the amount of people who stumble upon it. We had a good size crowd, but atleast 40 people had zero interest in comedy that night and had been drinking since noon. 

Have a host who knows what he's doing. Ours look defeated and broken after the third comic. So much so that a random woman came up and just took the mic from him like ""hey...its ok....ill take it from here"" and then SHE hosted for the rest of the night. 

Have a house that supports the cause, and bartenders that tell people to shut the fuck up/are willing to kick out people who arent interested comedy. The bartender didn't really seem to care. 

either way, as the night wore on, the host totally went bitch for the crowd, letting people just walk up and get on despite the set list and such. There was no respect for the stage because we didn't create an environment where respect for the stage could exist. 

We basically set up a mic in a room full of drunk people and expected magic to be immediate. Huge mistake. ",,False,self,t5_2r18f,1342985765.0,,,True,t3_wz72k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/wz72k/how_not_to_set_up_an_open_mic_learning_from_my/,

So there's a very big name in comedy (one of those guys that most stand-ups idolize) coming to this relatively small town soon and the club he's going to be performing in is having a competition to open for him. The catch is that you have to pay to enter the competition. 

One, this stand-up is the type that might not like that very much and I can almost guarantee they haven't told him. Two, there's something that's kinda creepy and gross about the idea. Three, I'm not great friends with the club owners like some comics and the owners make up at least some of the judges (it's like a panel) so I feel like they'll choose someone else no matter what. On the other hand, it's a pretty awesome opportunity to open for one of my idols and it would be a decent item on any comic's resume. What do you think I should do?

We release to relate. We relate to belong. We are comedians. We attend open mics thirty comedians long because releasing is therapy; therapy is freedom. Our pain compels your laughter, thus releasing us from the stranglehold it has over our lives. Your laughter reassures us that life is not as serious as we all tend to make it. Your silence does the opposite. From our early days we have resorted to laughter to cope. It is our drug. You are our pusher. You deny us laughter, you deny our fix. We go through withdrawal. Our foundation trembles. Only the strong keep from crumbling. The weak stop using altogether. Denying us of our fix forces us to find other ways to get the most sought after.

We joke because we were broken.

Self preservation lays the blueprint.

I came from a small(ish) city that has one bar that does open mics and the occasional showcase. We all knew each other and worked to help each other out, or at least offer support after bombing.
Now I live in a big(ish) city which has an open mic somewhere in the metro area every night of the week, and my GOD the open mics are painful! They usually consist of comics, a bartender and one guy who's too drunk to get up so he's sobering up with some ""lite"" beer. Everyone acts miserable, with one or two exceptions, and nobody pays attention to anyone else unless you're really on fire. I mean, a mild chuckle noise in these rooms would have been vomit inducing laughter back home...

I know everyone says to ""do your time"" at the open mics n' stuff, but if I don't get at least a little time in front of an audience soon, my soul might just shrivel up and die. The scary thing is, I can see my future at these mics. Some guys, who seem like they might have been really funny once, hop up there with no material and complain about their day. Really? The day I start intentionally wasting the audiences time out of spite might be the last day I do standup.

Anyway, I'm venting after a particularly bad night, and would love some discussion on the subject.

I was frustrated because it was hard to figure out what people expected. Now that I co-produce a show, I understand a lot of the booker's reasoning. It's virtually impossible to book a show in a way that won't piss off *somebody.* 

As the booker, it's my reputation on the line. Whether a performer kills or bombs, there's always another show. But if a show gets a reputation for sucking, it's almost impossible to recover. It's a lot harder to produce a new show, than get booked on one.

In order for a show to be successful, it has to appeal to a general audience. Too often, shows become focused on what's best for the comics, and not what's best for the crowd. Putting up a bunch of open micers is a quick way to ensure that a show will never be taken seriously. If there's no audience, there's no show And that means no stagetime for anybody.

Because the consequences of failure are so high, I need someone I can trust. I need to know someone can kill under any circumstances. That leads me biased toward people I've seen several times, over many years - people I know. If I have to choose between a comic I've seen under pressure, somebody who's been around for years, and the promises of someone I've never met - I'm going to go for the guy with evidence.

That doesn't mean that I only book my friends. I know most of the people I book, but I don't like all of them. If you're an experienced comic with multiple credits, I'm going to respect your talent whether I like you or not. You don't have to kiss my ass to get on the show. You just have to be the best comic for the job.

These are the things I consider when booking, in order from most to least important.

* Your credits
* References from other comics
* Whether I owe you a favor
* Whether I need a favor from you
* How well I like you

Whether you're ""funny"" doesn't really matter to me. Every comic thinks they're among the best in the industry, so you can't trust their opinion. If these factors seem unfair, keep in mind it's an unfair industry. I feel your pain, the same things that keep you from being booked on my show, are keeping me from being booked on other shows. I'm playing by the same rules you are.

Not all of these factors come into play every time. Credits and references are the closest thing to determining if a comic is objectively funny. If you've done Fallin and Comedy Central, I'm not going to worry about whether you're fun to drink with. If every comic I know tells me you're awesome, I'm willing to take their word for it. If you run a kickass show and have a great reputation in the industry, you're in a better position that the open micer who kisses my ass.

Ultimately, the best thing you can do to increase your chances of booking, is to get booked on other shows. Trust is the most valuable currency a comic has. If I see evidence that a lot of other people trust you, it increases the chances I will.

So if you don't know me, and you haven't impressed people I know, how do you get on the show? The fact is, you probably don't. For the frustrated open micer, how can you move up if no one will give you a shot? If you're truly good enough, you'll figure it out. It might involve producing your own show, or being willing to do a ton of crappy ones. You'll have to network with hundreds of people, looking for a break. You can't control your luck, but you can control how long you try, and how many people you encounter. The longer you do this, the more experience you acquire. And the nicer you are, the greater the chance that someone will do you a favor. The worst thing you can do is hang your career on a single show. Standup is a numbers game. Success goes to the people who work the hardest.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_z3qrx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/z3qrx/heres_some_of_the_things_ive_learned_from_booking/,

I went on 2 comedians after him and had to change my material last minute as to not say the same joke, and it really threw me off.

He actually left really early, so I never got a chance to talk to him about it, and I haven't seen him since. But what should I say when I do?

**Write one joke a day to post on Facebook.**

Yes, this is very difficult to stick to.  Yes, most of them will suck and you will end up deleting them three hours later.  Yes, you'll even have people commenting lamely on the jokes or re-posting them without acknowledgement. But holy hell, the benefits...

The length of your sets will double and triple overnight, the exposure you get this way is mind-boggling, you will always have something new to say, you'll be able to handle hecklers and random shit better and - most importantly - you'll enter the best mindset for growing as a comic.

You know how Carlin threw out all his material after a year and would start fresh?  It's the same concept.  The biggest hurdle for mid-level comics is getting locked into their sets.  Writing a joke a day ensures that you'll always be growing the set, changing out material, *keeping it fresh*.

On top of that the host will trash all of the acts whether they did well or not - to the point it becomes highly inappropriate and unprofessional - just to remain the focus of the night.

This person will keep getting work on big pro bills, and will keep over-running like this, as well as constantly trashing acts. It amazes me that they still get work when he is clearly lacking in proper hosting etiquette.

The worst part is that this person isn't the only regular host in my area who is like this.

Does anyone else's scene have this problem?

I'm sure a lot of us could shit-talk Jeff Dunham, Larry the Cable Guy, Lisa Lampinelli, Dane Cook, and so on but I'm wondering about what pro comedians each of you specifically do not care for, and why?

Personally, I may be guilty of letting a comedian's Twitter or podcast persona influence my opinion of their stand-up act too much, but that being said I don't like Jen Kirkman or Andy Kindler. I don't care for Marc Maron's stand-up, never have. And to me Patton Oswalt used to be hilarious to the point of near perfection, but I feel his material has been degrading for years, and I think he's capable of being quite rude to his fans. 

You can agree or disagree with me, that's fine, but I'm really interested in who you don't care for and why. Thought it'd be an interesting discussion and something that is the opposite of the typical circle-jerking over a few unanimous favorite comedians.

He then turned to his friends who agreed that they were really bored when my friend was onstage. It was awkward because we were trying to be professional and to my friend's credit he handled it pretty well. What was even worse is that it was happening in front of other comics and audience members from the show. It escalated when the owner proceeded to give my friend comedy advice: ""You have to shout your jokes. You know? I have never known a successful comic who didn't shout his jokes...""

STEALS MATERIAL.

I've had jokes stolen in my own town from video's I've posted on youtube. Since then I only post videos privately so the only people who see them are people I send the link to.

I guess my bottom line is be wary of how easily your material can be stolen. I have writing sessions with other comics and we work together to improve eachothers comedy, but that's because I know them all personally. I would never discuss a joke I'm working on to a community of strangers who are also comics.

My name is Chris Edwards and I'm hosting an Open Mic in Los Angeles. It's the only mic where comics gain and lose time based only on how well they do. If you do well; you get more time; if you do poorly, you lose time. And your time carries over from week to week. So you're getting consistent feedback on how your set is working week-to-week.

Think of it as Stand up Comedy the RPG. You start with 3 mins and can work your way all the way up to 10min.

The Gauntlet takes place at Westwood BrewCo in Westwood. Every Wednesday. Sign-up starts at 10pm and the show starts at 1030pm. 
It's a great room, college age crowd, constantly packed. 
No Charge; Don't Have to Buy Anything.

**About the Shows**

/r/standup is the standup comedian subreddit - which shares moderators with /r/standupshots and /r/standupcomedy. To help promote standup comedy on reddit, the subreddit offers live shows in New York and LA, representing the two major forms of modern standup (alternative and club). The purpose of the shows is twofold: to match redditor comics with an audience, and to provide reddit's comedy fans with the best comedians we can find - redditor or not.

**/r/standup NYC**

The NYC show, hosted by the Creek &amp; Cave, is a independent ""alternative"" standup show. Offered completely free of charge, the free weekly show provides stagetime for travelling redditor comics from across the country, as well as special guests from Conan, Letterman, Fallon, Ferguson &amp; Comedy Central Presents. Redditors get a free show, travelling redditor comics get quality stagetime in a town where it's hard to find, and NYC's best comics get to work out new material in a supportive environment.

**/r/standup LA**

The LA show is a more traditional big-budget club show. Hosted by the Hollywood Improv, the monthly show features a star-studded lineup featuring the biggest people we can get that night.

Tickets for this show are $10, or free with the promo code we publish on the subreddit before the show. The Improv, like most comedy clubs in America, charges a 2-drink minimum in addition to the ticket price (alcoholic or non). Between tickets and drinks, redditors attending the show should expect to pay ~$20 per person. While this is more than many are used to paying for entertainment, it's significantly lower than the average price for a night at a NYC or LA comedy club. We regret not being able to offer this show for free, but doing so would require significant sacrifices to presentation and talent. Rent, stage, lights, sound, security, promotion, TV-caliber performers - all of these things cost money. Since we already have a free alternative show, we felt this approach would provide a good contrast between free DIY bar shows and big-budget club presentation. The producers of /r/standup aren't profiting from the show, and we'll always try to be as upfront as possible so there's no hidden costs.

If you're more interested in completely free comedy options in the LA area, ask around in /r/standup. Our comics will be more than happy to help.

**I'm a comic. How do I get booked on the show?**

Details on our booking criteria are available [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1itp5o/it_took_a_year_but_rstandups_nyc_show_is_now/).

Because of differences in format, it's significantly easier to get booked on the NYC show. Since it's weekly, there's more time available. And because it's free, we can take more chances with performers. That being said, the show isn't charity stagetime for any redditor who's ever gone to an open mic. But if you're a working comic with several years of experience, who's willing to do an unpaid 10-minute spot in one of the world's most expensive cities, send me a PM and we'll do what we can. Right now our time slot might change, so we're unable to book past September. But going forward we'll do what we can to put on as many comics as possible.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_1k7o7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1k7o7n/the_next_nyc_rstandup_show_is_10pm_814_at_the/,

Our guest this week is Rory Scovel, who everyone in r/standup should get into if you aren't already. We're proud to have given him a good show to be on, and we're really proud of the great episode he gave us.

So, with that I invite you to check out the [episode](http://www.laughmatic.com/episode-14-rory-scovel/), and if you like it then how about [subscribing](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/laughmatic/id547235232) and checking out whatever else we might have in store for you?

Alabama Flea Markets:

- Many sub-species of rednecks
- Large variety of items to purchase, albeit shitty ones
- Germs. Everywhere. Leave your hands in your pockets. Better yet stay in your vehicle.
- Want a leather belt that has your name on it and rebel flags surrounding it? You're in luck...
- Rabbits for sale! Food or pets... Seriously, wtf?

On top of that, there would certainly be lessons learned on how to perform jokes, because as I'm sure we all know, a joke is only as good as the person performing it. 

The obvious pitfalls are certainly there; someone claiming the material is there own, people accidentally doing the same set because they Reddit in secret, people doing the act more than once, etc. Even still, I think it could be pretty cool.

We would need some simple rules, like keeping the set short so that open mic'ers could do, keeping it relatively clean so that open mic'ers can do it, and not using preexisting jokes so that we're not thieving assholes.

When I was a little boy, I wanted nothing more than to be cool and I saw African Americans as the personification of that. When I went to the YMCA as a kid, I thought all the little black kids were very cool about stuff, and I noticed they were more athletic, and I wanted to be like them. I also noticed that most of them had outtie belly buttons...so I wanted one...one day I spent some time in my dad's garage with a pair of needle nose pliers trying to pull mine out! True story.

Moving forward into adult hood, I've been diagnosed with high blood pressure (which is brought on by anxiety). Now this isn't scientific and could only be considered ""anecdotal evidence"", but I've noticed that every time a white person takes my blood pressure (including me!) my blood pressure is high...when a black person takes my blood pressure is very low. For whatever reason, I feel very calm around black people and I think this is the reason my BP reads low during those times.

So, I wanted to write a bit about these things, and my quest to be cool, and my interpretation that the African American culture is very cool seeming to me. My problem is, I don't want to come off like I'm putting everyone in a box, and I certainly don't want to be racist.

You're over-thinking it. Stop. A*** A**** has great advice, but if you're not in the reading mood, don't do that either. Don't do anything, writing especially. If you're a comedian, funny things will come to you. You have a gift for being able to see the comedy in situations people experience every day of their lives, but they either don't see it or make the normal choice not to make a big deal of it. That's YOUR job.

If nothing is coming to you, don't panic. This is a great time to pull out your old jokes. If they're in a notebook, transcribe them to a Word document or otherwise create a document you can organize. Re-read your jokes. Try to approach those jokes from different angles. Figure out a way to connect jokes where some continuity may exist for good transitions. If you need better transitions, write those.

Think of that time some dumb drunk bitch said some dumb drunk bitch thing during your set. Now think of what you wish you had said to her. Maybe it's about her being a dumb drunk bitch. Now you have heckler ammo in your pocket.

Write and re-write your old shit and before you know it, you'll be writing new shit because you just inspired yourself to write and be creative.

If you car won't start, you give it a jump. That's all you need. The car is fucking fine.

Do you think an unlikable person can make it AT ALL as a comic? ,throwacomic,20,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/14oy8q/i_am_an_unlikable_person_do_you_think_an/,"That's not intended to sound self-pitying, it's a very realistic self assessment. I don't mix well with people, when I try to be outgoing I come across as awkward and cloying. I have zero charisma. I'm human wallpaper. That's just me being honest with myself. 



I have always loved Standup and the reason I was drawn to performing because I always saw standups as social misfits who were maybe - just maybe - a bit like me. But it's bullshit. Listen to every comedy podcast, interview, whatever - successful comics aren't outcasts. They're not weirdos or socially awkward - they're ALL outgoing charismatic people with tons of friends and incredible social lives. And I mean they were like that *before* they were famous.  Listening to Mark Maron who sells himself as some self-loathing outsider, all you hear about is all the wild partying and girls he banged and all his good and bad times with friends and what have you. He had more interesting stuff happen to him in the early 90's than I've had in my life. THIS is an outsider? No, he's an incredibly likable, outgoing, charismatic guy. 

Jim Norton - another guy who traffics in self-deprecation - has had tons of hot girlfriends, lots and lots of comedy friends across the country and - for a sober fella - he seems to have an awfully good time with people. 

That's just two off the top of my head. I hope you get the picture. 



So I think I've got good material and I don't have any problem on stage (I'm better on stage than in a one-on-one or party situation for sure) but at the end of the day, I don't ""connect"" with the audience beyond the jokes, I don't know how to mix with other comics, and god knows I'm a complete failure at networking.


Look, I know stand up isn't for everyone and I've pretty much come to the conclusion it's not for me, and that's life and the world keeps turning - I just wonder if this is a topic anyone else on this sub has ever thought about or has any opinion on.

Two questions are on my mind: ""should I even do transitions?"" and ""how do I link together jokes that can be related with a natural flow?""

I feel like it's a natural part of building a set, but comedians get away with a lot. I tried to do transitions for the first time in a competition, to link my three best jokes...I felt like I forced it. For example, I have a joke about reality TV and I have one about Alaska. Should I link them by talking about reality TV shows in Alaska?

So, r/standup, do you:

* say ""fuck transitions!""

* insert a transition between jokes

* tie everything together at the end

* something else I haven't thought of yet

I know someone like Mitch Hedberg gets away with not doing transitions cause it's one liners and his lack of transitions adds to the performance. I do more stories and topical bits that average between 1-2 minutes long. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great!

EDIT: The overall impression I'm getting is ""eh, don't worry about it."" So my follow up question to that is: How do you signal that you're changing topics?

Here is what I do, in case it is helpful for others, but I think I'm making this too hard...

**What I do...**

* When a thought occurs to me i stick it in [edit: into a note in my joke notebook]. Later I go back tag and edit and improve.
* Each note is one joke and its inextricably linked tags (tag lines that is not evernote tags).
* To make a set, I tag all jokes I think I want to use with unique tag for the set.
* I search for that unique tag.
* I rename the jokes by prepending a number to each title so I can sort by title to get them in order. I copy them all to a new notebook, and merge them all in to a single note.

This works really well in that I then have a complete detailed set of notes for that set, but it is tedious to retitle jokes to reorder them, and I can only keep one set at a time this way with out duplicating jokes...

What I really want is a ""collection"" which is a set of notes (I get this through the unique tag) that are ordered (the performance order) with out retitling. Then ideally I'd have the same joke in multiple collections, possibly in different orders and combined with other jokes.

In so far as I know every note can't do that, but I suspect some of you may simply have a better or just different approach that might work...

Ideas?

Also, in case my questions are handled by another post or an external site, please point me there.

But the question relates to joke writing. I've wanted to perform stand up for a while now, and I want to finally take the leap. There's only one comedy club in my town (Tampa, Fl), and I went to their open mic last night and the place was jam packed. I'm talking at least 50, which for a town that I thought was a comedy desert, was shattering. I wanted to start at that room's open mic because I heard it was small, but with a crowd like that, I know I need some sharp material. Dying on stage is something I expected to do my first time, that it happens to everyone, like the Jump scene in The Matrix. But in front of so many people, that is not a fall I want to take. So, I'm looking back over what material I wanted to bring and am planning to hit the next open mic in two weeks. My question becomes, what is the advice you all have for joke writing? Nothing specific, but instead what are the general guidelines and advice you all have? Pacing and transitions, softer jokes for larger, more general population crowds, local jokes, crowd work, and how to close a set. 

Any help the community can offer would be appreciated. Again, point me to someone's site or previous post buried in this subreddit if this has already been discussed.

I posted a while ago about doing a comedy type road trip.  Well the time has come.  I will be leaving Minnesota on January 17th and returning 3 weeks later.  I just finished my MBA, quit a job I hated, and want to have some fun for a little while.  

My wife's boss told her it would be a shame for her to not be able to go with, so he is giving her 3 weeks off to come with me.  She is a professional photographer, so it should make for a pretty awesome photo album by the end at the very least.  

I am looking for local stand-ups in different cities who might be able to just point me in the right direction.  It's going to be tough to make every night productive, but I would like to get on stage as much as possible on this trip.  

And the last bonus!  I am a huge craft beer/homebrewer type, and I want to share one of my favorite Minnesota beers with anyone I can.  I will be bringing with me 8 cans of Surly Furious for each town I'm stopping in.  I want to trade for your local brews that you are just as proud of.  When I get home, I'm going to throw a big party with tons of different kinds of beer.  Hopefully the people that come out to trade will stick around and watch some comedy as well!  

The cities/schedule are as follows: 

January 17-18th St. Louis, MO    
January 19th-20th Kansas City, MO    
January 21st-22nd Denver, CO     
January 23rd-24th Salt Lake City, UT    
January 25th Reno, NV    
January 26th-27th Sacramento, CA    
January 28th-29th San Francisco, CA    
January 30th- February 2nd Los Angeles, CA    
February 3rd - 4th San Diego, CA

Everything I read is that open mics are for newbies and for experienced folks who are trying out new jokes. Does that mean that once I feel like I have a good bank of strong material, do I just keep going to open mic nights to try and get noticed by someone and offered a gig, or am I supposed to contact clubs and try to get a booking, or go to some auditions somewhere, or enter contests, or what?

So I was working on a bit that was still pretty rough. It was based on a true experience (as many are) about how I almost clipped a bicylist with my car. The bike rider pulled up to my window and screamed, ""EAT SHIT AND DIE!"" I had some observations about what that actually entailed, how much shit you'd need to eat before you died, and that he probably didn't mean that literally. Just in general talking about the weird shit people say when they are mad.

No big deal. I was just open micing some new stuff. It wasn't fantastic but it got a good enough response that I wanted to tighten it up for my next showcase. But afterwards I had someone come up and accuse me to ripping of Louis CK. Wait, what? I've seen a lot of CK's stuff. I think he's great, but could not remember the bit he was referencing. Here is a link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbURUrgQao&amp;feature=related

Anyway, the bits were similar but Ck nor me are the first people to observe how weird it is that people shout crazy shit when they are mad. How do you even respond to that? I scrapped the bit, but I'm not sure if I should have. Your thoughts?

Sorry. That's been fixed and so I wanted to again let you guys know about an episode of [Laughmatic](http://www.laughmatic.com/), the podcast I do here in Montreal.
This week's guest is Matt Ward, a Knoxville, TN comic who's basically trying to create a comedy scene from scratch down there. They have a decent thing going now after a couple years, and he talks a lot about the right and wrong ways to go about developing a scene, comics, and an audience. There are often posts in here from people in towns with little to no scene, so I thought you'd be interested.

Matt also talks about quitting your day job and transitioning to a full-time career doing comedy. So I thought you'd be interested.

I got a lot out of having that conversation, maybe you will from listening to it. Check it out [here](http://www.laughmatic.com/episode-39-matt-ward/):

I'm booked here and there and I host my own open-mic that many people call the best in the city (there are 6 other weekly shows in town).  I have connections all over the Midwest and I still love taking the stage.  

I am not too big for Columbus, the scene here is fantastic and I have plenty more to learn.  But I want to do bigger things than are possible here.  To that end I am working on two collaborative YouTube efforts (links in comments) and planning a solo project because I see the internet as my best route to the global stage.  That's also what brought me to Reddit in the first place.  Standup is absolutely what I want to do with my life, and I'm ready to take a leap of faith and see what I can do.

Problem is, I can't relocate to do that.  I didn't start standup until I was 27, and by that time I was already married, a father, and had a mortgage.  My wife is extremely supportive of what I do, but she wouldn't give up what we've both worked so hard for to move to NYC with me unless there was a steady gig there waiting for me.  Likewise, I wouldn't move for any length of time without her.  

But with all of that, I still have a lump in my belly that wants to uproot everything and go to the big city to see if I'm good enough to rub elbows with the big-shots.  I really don't know what to do about it, but I know there's gotta be other guys on Reddit in similar shoes, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_1e9bwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1e9bwt/what_do_i_do_if_i_cant_move_to_nyc_or_la/,

",TimIsWin,26,15,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1768mi/ive_been_a_bit_of_a_dick_on_here_lately_so_ill/,"There's been a bit of an over saturation on this topic, so I figured I'd type up a few things for those of you interested in giving it a shot. This won't be about writing material or stage presence or anything because I still suck at comedy. I'm only coming up on two years and here is all the advice I can offer: 

1. Stop dancing around and reading articles and listening to podcasts and just go do it. I know I did this a ton. I'd filled half a notebook and I had done a handful of open mics and I would stay up late at night thinking about it and watching documentaries. It's silly. I did well my first set, but in retrospect I was awful. You've just gotta get up there. Obsessing might help you do well in a good room, but you need experience to work a tough one. I can't even explain it. I learn something every set. You learn so much you wouldn't even consider without being up there. 

2. Don't turn to the Internet for validation on jokes you've written before performing them. This will have two results. Either you'll say ""Oh I guess these are funny, I don't need to perform them"" or ""I guess these aren't, I won't perform them."" Either way it's going to keep you from performing and that's the only way you can get better. You'll get feedback from other comics at mics. Anything that someone can tell you about your material is just them putting their spin on your material. It works better after you actually do it. Then people know you and can toss you a tag or two that fits with your style. That's a whole different ball game. 

3. I'll reiterate. That's the only way to get better. Doing it. There is very little you can gain from posting a video from the last open mic you did four months ago. A lot of brand new guys (including myself when I started) seem to think that you can get by on digging deep into writing, but it's more than that. That's a good habit but you can't really learn what works on a stage without being on one. Allow yourself to learn. Get on stage. 

4. Videos are nice for yourself, or even here on /standup sometimes, but I wouldn't make them public. I have one public video (and another posted by a different source) and it makes me uncomfortable to have it up. Especially if you're still very green. It shows. I regret posting videos from the first six months. I was so proud but they're really really awful. I was just a baby. I'm still a baby. 

5. On open mic conduct: show up, sign up, be friendly. Talk to the other comics - if you keep coming out these guys are going to be your friends after a while. And comics are a great bunch of friends to have. Don't worry about getting shows. Just go do your jokes and bullshit with your peers. 

6. Don't be a dick and don't go over your time. 

7. Don't get ahead of yourself. Focus on getting funny. 

8. Have fun.

It's okay, I really hated my job. But luckily I saved 50% of my income over the past 3 years, so I have the funds to live a little before jumping back into the corporate world.

I finish my master's program on December 12th. After that, I would love to come visit your city and hit up open mics with you. I will be using couchsurfing or hotels to stay so I'm not looking for accommodations, just someone to hang out with at open-mics and show me your scene. In return, I will buy you beer (or other beverage of your choice), certainly get you dinner, talk comedy, write bits, work on jokes, whatever. And of course when you come to Minneapolis, I will take you to every place I possibly can.

Also I think it would be interesting if I do a blog or something, update a post on here, about the differences between each scene.

So, where should I go? Anyone interested? You can friend me on facebook, check out my website which I just finished, and listen to 25 minutes of my comedy here. I can do anywhere from 3 to 35 minutes. I could do 45 but haven't had the opportunity yet, but I have done two completely different 25 minute sets.

Also, I will be driving everywhere. So once I get interest, if there is any, I will plan my route and work out dates with people ahead of time. This for me is all about doing something fun and something I love after having done a job I hated for so long.

Drunk asshole was overserved, sexually harassed my 5 lady comics before they even hit the stage and then proceeded to heckle me during my hosting set.

My counter is to take a nice guy approach and say ""*I really hope you're having fun tonight*"". Usually people realize they were being assholes after that and chill but an overserved (and undersexed) patron is out of control, have crazy misconceptions about stand up and the amount of 'pussy' it gets you and thinks he's contributing to the show and the reward in 'pussy' will be great. Even though these women traveled 60 miles to play my room and will be going to my house after the show to smoke a joint and listen to vinyl before they drive home, not fuck some misogynist drunk.

I then threatened him with telling the bartender to cut him off, but he had a pitcher in front of him and he was already overserved. I got him to be quiet by ignoring the troll and using a little ""*frown power*"", which is to stop the show and visibly frown at drunk patron, thus making everyone at the table ashamed to be sitting with drunkie. That only got me through my opening hosting set.

I brought up the first girl, an eccentric that isn't quite as weird as Bamford, but is so new that she hasn't made her weirdness work to it's full potential, but she has awesome moments of brilliance. Heckler is not TOO bad, but has a few things to say, I tell the bartender something needs to be done, bartender has a few words with drunkie, goes back to the bar and moments later drunkie makes the statement ""**Mexicans are the new n___ers**"". Loudly. Homegirl told the dude to plain ""**SHUT THE FUCK UP**""-applause break-. **The bartender says she didn't hear it**.

When she's done I bring lady 2. Some material about her mother and she points out that my mom is sitting in the suicide table. Oh yeah, did I mention my HISPANIC MOM is there??? Drunkie makes a comment to the effect of ""**I'll fuck his mother**"" while looking at my mom. I'm livid. Fortunately, another bartender(not the one that was 'hard of hearing') talked this patron into going to the smoking area. Unfortunately, this bar pays me a lot of money to put on shows there and so I'm not in a position to make this drunk apologize.

Dude came back in and couldn't even sit at the farthest spot away from the stage at the bar without misbehaving. The bartender called him a cab and he remained inside. He said something to my feature act(and very close friend) that was extremely disrespectful while on stage and I finally circumvented the bartender and told him leave and followed him out the door and the bartender followed me. I then brought up the headliner and the rest of the show went great beyond the energy drainage of the whole dealing with drunkie ordeal, leaving the headliner with a set that I could have been way better received, had that asshole not ruined the night.

It's all good, I have a show in a cannabis cafe tomorrow and those folks are way to passive to even answer a question...

I guess why I'm posting this is, if you are hosting a one nighter, **have a talk with the bartender before the show**. Tell them you **need them to have your back**. That guy should have been 86ed the second he dropped an N bomb. The bartender should have taken my word when I informed them of his extreme trespass. 

I wanted to threaten the bartenders with calling them in for overserving if they didn't 86 him on the spot, but I feel that will just jeopardize my show. Instead, I got a few customers to ask the bartenders if they thought they had overserved the guy.

How would you have handled this differently?

tl;dr Drunk asshole at all-female comedy did some pretty low class heckling and I did not have the bar staff backing me up 100%. I eventually took matters into my own hands and *peacefully* removed him after the final straw.

I'm just wondering... the reactions I'm getting at open mics out here... are those the same reactions I should be expecting from regular crowds?

I feel as if comics aren't as willing to laugh at material as a regular crowd might be. Now I know I'm a very long way from knowing what I'm doing on stage. I get that. I'm just trying to set goals for when I can start doing bringers, or MCs, or features etc. I get great laughs from the open mic crowd when a joke hits but its inconsistent and from an objective stand point I've probably bombed every time I've gone up on stage.

I'm just wondering, are open mics a good way to judge my progress or should I be doing something else along with open mics? Any help would be appreciated.

I just came back from Dave Chappelle's show tonight in Montreal and he was really hilarious. I like the growth he's made without changing what makes him funny. Anyways, the only thing that bothered me was the crowd asking him potentially the worst questions ever during the Q&amp;A portion of the night. It came to the point where people were just yelling celebrity names (including Justin Bieber) and Dave, rightfully, was like ""you know your career is over when people ask you about other celebrities"". Big kudos to him turning awful questions into great answers. Anyways, apart from like two or three funny questions (like someone asking why he didn't work out his legs over the years, to which Dave replied: actually... i have been :( thanks for noticing) but overall i feel like he was probably annoyed with people asking if he knew prince/rick james, or where ja rule was. /rant",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_1j0edt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1j0edt/small_rant_here/,

I've had a no bringer show policy in effect for myself for the last year and a half, and frankly it feels great.

For sake of argument I just assume a $10 cover and 2 item minimum, I think that's fairly standard, but you can adjust it however you feel best fits your prerogative.

Here are some issues I personally have with it, and then I'd love to hear from you guys on them and hopefully someone who does book bringer shows can chime in and tell me their thought process so that I may better understand. 

1.) If you require five people to show up for me at a show at $10 tickets, you're essentially charging me $50 for 5 minutes.

2.) I've never seen a bringer show where there was an actual comedic ability requirement to get on it. What incentive is there for me to ask my friends to pay $10 + 2 item minimum (or whatever the case may be) to see me for 5 minutes, and a bunch of other people whose only qualification is they have friends. 

3.) Exactly what am I getting out of a situation of a show with 10 comedians, each who had to bring 5 people, and pay $10 per person, where you're making $500 and I'm doing what exactly??

  - To further clarify this one, How does it seem fair that I'm giving you everything, including audience, and not getting anything in return?

Now, I promote every show that I do. I want people to see me cuz frankly I believe I'm worth seeing. I also realize I'm pretty lucky to be living in LA right now where I can not do bringers and still get on stage as much as anyone else.

Last night, we had the most stoic crowd I've ever seen. It was like a funeral afterparty in a Jodi Picoult novel. The comics I work with vary from exceptionally talented to socially awkward script-readers, but laughter is not uncommon. I'm much greener than they are by far, but these guys are great, and the comedy is generally pretty tight.

I swear, there was courteous clapping at the beginning and the end of each set, but aside from ONE poop joke, and the one working comic passing through town, the only laughter was from among ourselves. The audience just was not having it.

I didn't have a great week. Work was especially rough (I'm a mail processor) and a friend of mine passed away over the long weekend. I was the penultimate act in our 9-strong lineup, and I had a 7-minute set. I got about two minutes in through the silence, and just handed it in, thanked the audience, and passed it on.

For me, it wasn't a matter of cowardice, but pride. I know every joke isn't for everyone, but I'm proud of my material, and I just was not feeling the atmosphere of the place. The comics I do standup with all powered through their sets, and I respect that. Nothing I can do about it now, but I think I'd do the same thing if I were to relive it. It's an open mic gig, and I do it because it's fun; last night was an endurance trial just to watch the other guys bear the silence.

I was asked to be on a comedy competition at my local comedy club, but was expected to bring 10 audience members.

I was told I could pick up tickets with my name and hand them out around town to fill my quota. 

We can argue all day about bringers, but let me get to my real question.

I couldn't do it because I found out the show has 20 comics on it, most of which are fresh newbies or comics I know to be terrible. I couldn't make a stranger sit through that, because I wouldn't.

What I'm getting at is that where do we draw the line for the quality of a show? I don't see the point in putting on a show that will burn people from wanting to see a local live comedy show or even a live comedy show in general.

I'm an amateur comedian from the Philly area. I've performed in DC, Philly, and Ohio. I just wanted to see what everyone's thoughts are on these suburban bar open mics. 

I live in the suburbs, and it's not every week I feel like going all the way down to the city for a real comedy-venue open mic. 

So in my neighborhood outside of Philly, there's a plethora of open mic venues, but they're all at bars that aren't really set up for comedy. The TVs stay on, usually a sports show, and all the guys are just looking to get laid. They're set up for music. Usually when the MC announces a comedian and I try to get everyones attention; a bunch of women actually come up. ""oh a comedian, this must be interesting.""

And I honestly do okay maybe 33% of the time (even after I've killed at a Comedy Open Mic). The cold hard truth is most of the bar doesn't care about the performers. It sucks but it's great practice. Anyway, I just wanted to get a feel of or hear some stories of some other comics performing at these open mic venues more set up for music. Maybe some of you guys have some tips or suggestions?

Just curious when you bomb what percentage do you think reflects your jokes and what percentage do you think is just the audience? 

The reason I ask is because I did a set comprised of jokes that have hit very well in the past and I got nothing. The show I did last night almost didn't happen because of low attendance and in the end maybe we had 20 people in the crowd. Even the best of the comedians in our scene had a hard time getting big laughs. Part of me wants to say it's just the crowd but the other part of me thinks that it can't be the whole crowd and it must be me. 

I don't have video or audio of it so it's hard to give proper judgement.

My favorite game is Tagline Pitch, where I give the tagline for a movie and the guests pitch me a movie based on it. Past examples include:

* They’ve played football. Now it’s time they learned *fútbol*.
* She’s ending women’s suffrage--one suffragette at a time.
* He had the fastest gun in the west. But she was from the East.

We also play a game called Guess the Google (Family Feud using Google's autocomplete function) and Madison's Finest: Fact or Fiction (guessing game based on police reports from Madison, WI).

We're just trying to have fun--not too worried about popularity at this point (although we pride ourselves on professionalism and high-quality editing). Let me know if you're interested! Feedback of any kind is also appreciated.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the interest! You guys are awesome. First of all, our three hosts are located in LA, Washington D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin. But if you're not in one of those places, don't worry! Since we do the podcast via Skype anyway, we can call you.

I've been racking my brain to remember this comedian, but despite all the information I remember about this guy's jokes, I've forgotten his name and searching hasn't turned up anything. I thought his first name was something like ""Jeff"" or ""Geoff"" with a Chinese last name, but I could certainly be misremembering this.

Here are some facts of which I am sure, mostly because I remember some of his bits so clearly (I will describe them later):

* He was male
* He was Canadian (from Toronto?? not sure)
* He was Chinese
* He worked pretty clean as far as I can remember, no swearing, definitely not a shock comic. All the jokes I remember were pretty straight observational comedy.
* I thought he was very funny, but I don't think he was that famous. I half-remember a blog post from some other working comic who did a set with him (possibly a friend of his?) and remarked how this guy was pretty shy and didn't come out after shows to talk to people and how he had to prod him to do this.

Here are a couple of his jokes that I remember, I think they are all from a single album that he was selling from his website or something. I never saw any video of him (perhaps this was in the pre-Youtube days?) or saw him live.

* He had a bit where he said Batman wasn't very impressive to him, mainly because of the existence of Canadian Tire. Things like how Batman may have some elaborate grappling hook, but how Canadian Tire would also have an elaborate grappling hook...endorsed by Wayne Gretzky. I think he also ended this bit by saying that you should shoot Batman in the mouth.

* How he got annoyed when people who don't speak Chinese would say ""Koong Hay Fat Choy"" to him, and how he wanted to reply with ""Hap-Pie Nu-Why Year to you, too.""

* How they should have an anti-racist day holiday at school, the punchline was that he got a card saying ""You are not a chink."" Then he ""Awwww""-ed like he got a sweet Valentine's day card.

* How he learned you should never to ask about your girlfriend's sexual history, because you'll never know how to deal with it. The example he cited was: ""What was the craziest thing you ever done sexually?"" ""I did it with four black guys on a boat!"" ""What?! This is Toronto, there's only like four black guys in the city!?"" ""Yeah, that's them.""

My past was ridiculous enough to write a tome of stories about. Clinical Narcissist dad, overprotective mom who taught at the middle school I went to, ADHD, Epilepsy diagnosis and general teenage awkwardness make for some fun stuff. Ideally the general act tone would probably be like Marc Maron/Mike Birbiglia.

Anyways. My problem, or more appropriately; obstacle, is I'm an introvert. Shy I guess, depending on the situation. Maybe I just need to fuck a bunch of high schoolers or watch less interracial porn, but I need to cross some sort of bridge to ante up some confidence to go on stage.

Frequently I hear comics talk about being able to do 3-5 sets a night in NY.  Now, in my experience, most of these guys haven't been or don't regularly spend much time in NY.

I go up once every 6-12 weeks and spend a few days doing mics and showcases in NY, but it's been my experience that this idea of doing 3-5 sets a night in NY is a bit of a myth unless you're getting booked gigs later in the night (because seemingly all of the mics run during happy hour).

But my question relates to something Louis CK says in the film. He talks about a set he was working for an hour show a few years ago. He says that 40 minutes of his set was great, but the last twenty sucked. The reason for this, he surmised, is that his closer, a 5 minute bit, was killer, and he knew that no matter how shitty the 15 minutes before it were, he could always get the audience back with the closer. The sharpness of that bit let him coast on shitty material for a quarter of his show. So what he did is move the closer to the beginning of the set, and it forced him to make the other 15 minutes in that chunk better. Doing that instantly transformed that previously shitty chunk into good material.
So, the question is have any of you tried this? Or have any of you found other creative ways to force yourself to recognize a shitty set of jokes?

Add your own.,,8,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1jaqk0/some_too_many_thoughts_on_joke_writing_add_your/,"Amateur comedian here who after almost a year of writing jokes is going to write a post that I wish I could have read before I started. 

Anything expressed is either based on my own experience or is based on the words of experienced comics.

1)	Have a notebook. 
You have been and will be amazed at how quickly ideas you don’t commit to paper leave your head. I use a pen and paper because I find the material process of actually writing in the real world makes the germ more likely to expand than it does when I type.

2)	Always write, or don’t. 
I feel that I have to nuance this one a bit. I know Anthony Jeselnik attributes his success to his capacity to write more than his peers did. I know that Mitch Hedberg wrote the fuck out of shit. But one of the best working comics today, Bill Burr says he only writes onstage. Louis CK says that he deliberately avoids writing offstage because he feels that a different part of the brain is used when trying to be funny on the page as opposed to being spontaneously funny. Patrice O’Neal and Doug Stanhope are two other comics who said/say they never wrote/write. O’Neal in particular described the need for comics to just get up onstage and talk. The rationale here was that one’s funniness will emerge naturally. (I should point out at this point that O’Neal first did stand-up by heckling someone. He was invited onstage by the beleaguered comedian, and O’Neal went on to crush it.) Those of you who know these guys will notice the distinction between short form joke comics like Jeselnik and Hedberg and long form truth tellers, like Burr, CK, Stanhope and O’Neal. 
However, Dom Irrera once praised Stanhope for being one of the few real comics working today and remembers him as one of the most prolific writers he’d ever seen. I recall Stanhope on one podcast or another, dismissing the idea of any ‘craft’ in what he does, but anyone who is familiar with his act will see this as characteristic self-deprecation on Stanhope’s part. Furthermore, in CK’s more recent TV show, during one of the stand-up segments, CK flicks through a few pages of a notebook before beginning his performance. The pages look to be developed beyond a simple premise or two. If you watch O’Neal’s spot on the Trump Roast, (highly recommended) he makes a bit of a deal of dispensing with his prepared notes, then proceeds to go off on Jeselnik, William Shatner and Seth MacFarlane with a string of astute insulting observations. Obviously, I can’t say whether he wrote them ahead of time or came up with them on the spot, but based on various podcasts such as Ari Shaffir’s Skeptic Tank, The Joe Rogan Experience, You Made It Weird, etc. writing is something most comics aspire to do but often find difficult to commit to due to laziness. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock are two guys who are obviously conscientious joke writers, but far be it from me to tell future Burrs/CKs/Stanhopes/O’Neals to write more. I think it depends on what kind of comedy you want to do. If you want to be a long form honest comic try going up with a premise and working it out. Anyone familiar with the career arc of Burr, O’Neal or Joey Diaz will know that the best thing that happened to their act was bringing their natural funny onstage, although, this can take a long time to achieve. I think a lot of young comics would benefit from having confidence in their own sense of humour earlier on in their career. The hardest thing about writing is how often it has to be done and there’s no avoiding that. Set aside an hour a day and if you do that consistently, for a few weeks, it will stop feeling quite so boring. The more you do it, the easier it will get, hackneyed muscle work-out metaphor, etc.


3)	Listen to as much stand-up as you can. 
His name escapes me right now, but I think it was a guest on Shaffir’s podcast who described how the pool of comics your average American comedy club owner has to draw on these days is ten times the size that it was a decade ago. This is probably due to the American comedy boom Tom Rhodes describes, which is interacting interestingly with the comedic recession in England. Anyway, this guy went on to say that because of the internet, podcasts and shows like Tough Crowd, the current generation of comics are far better at what they do much earlier than in previous generations. Michael Che is my preferred example. Look up how long he’s been doing stand-up if you want to feel bad about yourself. Take advantage of this, you wouldn’t take a musician who doesn’t listen to music seriously. I’ve listened to hundreds of thousands of hours of podcasts, radio appearances and stand up sets and they all give you a jump start on what to expect from the business, which subjects are hackneyed and which ones aren’t and will allow you to learn from the naïve mistakes of your betters. Jim Norton is a guy who doesn’t watch any comedy for fear that he’ll pick something up and recycle it in his act but I know the biggest reason that I want to do this as a career is so that I can be exposed to the funniest people in the world. Marc Maron and Joe Rogan discussed this on a recent podcast and Maron conceded that he will often find his contemporaries’ mannerisms blending into his jokes, he mentioned Dave Attell specifically. I think it was Jason Thibault who described how Steven Brody Stevens’ delivery will creep into his voice onstage. Sarah Silverman and Pete Holmes discussed their tendency to adopt Chelsea Peretti’s penchant for abbreviations. Brendon Walsh describes how a number of his recorded sets when opening for Stanhope on the road come embarrassingly close to an approximation of Stanhope impression. My point here is that comics of all levels are influenced by other comics and you shouldn’t be too anxious about listening to too much comedy. Keep at it and your voice will emerge. Probably.

4)	Write other stuff. 
Moshe Kasher cites someone (Buddy Hackett springs to mind, but I know they’re not contemporaries, so that’s definitely wrong) as saying that stand up is not the comedian’s sole medium of expression, that one should always be trying to branch out. This is primarily a Los Angeles mentality, I imagine, but if hammering out a script every once in awhile is good enough for almost every major comedian working today, it’s good enough for you.

tl;dr Read the whole post, stupid.

1. Will they take me seriously? I'm young and I think they'll see me as a child, rather than a comic.

2. Are there different clubs for different styles? I have jokes that aren't necessarily bad, but not really for little kids. How do I find an appropriate club near me? 

3. How do I make friends in comedy? I'd love to meet comedians but I'm afraid that I'll be held back by my age.",,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,True,t3_1j8s1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1j8s1t/looking_to_start_young/,
