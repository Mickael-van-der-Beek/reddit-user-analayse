All the interviews didn't turn out well for me.

So on that day, mom had to go somewhere with our car and that place happened to be nearby to my interview's place, so she said she'd drive me and come together with me.

Mom waited in the parking lot while I had my interview.

The boss and some director came to interview me. The director was a real douchebag. He took a quick look at my resume and said:

""What is this, a joke? How many times did you change jobs during the last 3 years? You are already 36 aren't you? You said you have experience in this field, but this shit does not count. So you have some mental sickness, huh? Sorry but we cannot hire you. That's it. You can leave. Let's not waste our time.""

When I came back to the car, mom didn't ask me how the interview went and just said:

""The radio station said it's gonna get cold again tomorrow... Are you hungry? Let's eat something on the way home honey""

We didn't talk a lot and went to an Italian restaurant nearby. We ordered some spaghetti.

That's when mom said: ""Maybe you are lucky and they hire you this time."" ... Well that was awkward. For what seemed like minutes I could not reply anything and finally I said. ""No mom, today was bad.""

Smiling, my mom said: ""Don't worry honey, I will drive you next time too."" 

I really started to feel sad at that moment and felt so sorry for mom. I really want to get a job and want to make our lives easier.

Driving back home mom says: ""The spaghetti at that restaurant wasn't too great, huh?""

Thanks to everyone who keeps coming back to /r/HorriblyDepressing, you guys are awesome.

There's been an issue recently concerning the amount of posts that are simply Youtube links to depressing music. As we all know, musical tastes, as well as whether something is depressing or not, are completely subjective and we're not judging you for liking or disliking a song. However, it feels as if simply dropping a link to a song that gets you a bit feely isn't what this subreddit is about - it promotes no discussion, no thought, and often no real immersion into emotion.

For this reason, the moderator team has decided to trial out something new - ~~**for one week, as of 10pm, 15th of July 2013 (GMT+10)**~~, we are only allowing [MUSIC] posts if they are posted as a text-based post, with a short (*not* one line) description of the song, its meaning, how you perceive the song and/or how the song makes you feel.

The Moderator team believes that this trial should help us work toward a healthier, stronger community, by fixing an issue (link spam) and introducing a new way for our Redditors to connect.

Please leave any comments or suggestions in the comment section below - we will be reading all of them, since this is definitely not something we do often, or have ever done before.

This rule is now permanently in effect.",META,False,self,t5_2wk3u,1375927246.0,,,True,t3_1hur9l,http://www.reddit.com/r/HorriblyDepressing/comments/1hur9l/mod_post_meta_concerning_the_influx_of_music/,moderator

I remembered what you said.

You told me not to drink, Mom,

So I drank soda instead.

.

I really felt proud inside, Mom,

The way you said I would.

I didn't drink and drive, Mom,

Even though the others said I should.

.

I know I did the right thing, Mom,

I know you are always right.

Now the party is finally ending, Mom,

As everyone is driving out of sight.

.

As I got into my car, Mom,

I knew I'd get home in one piece.

Because of the way you raised me,

So responsible and sweet.

.

I started to drive away, Mom,

But as I pulled out into the road,

The other car didn't see me, Mom,

And hit me like a load.

.


As I lay there on the pavement, Mom,

I hear the policeman say,

""The other guy is drunk,"" Mom,

And now I'm the one who will pay.

.


I'm lying here dying, Mom...

I wish you'd get here soon.

How could this happen to me, Mom?

My life just burst like a balloon.

.

There is blood all around me, Mom,

And most of it is mine.

I hear the medic say, Mom,

I'll die in a short time.

.


I just wanted to tell you, Mom,

I swear I didn't drink.

It was the others, Mom.

The others didn't think.

.

He was probably at the same party as I.

The only difference is, he drank

And I will die.

.


Why do people drink, Mom?

It can ruin your whole life.

I'm feeling sharp pains now.

Pains just like a knife.

.

The guy who hit me is walking, Mom,

And I don't think it's fair.

I'm lying here dying

And all he can do is stare.

.

Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.

Tell Daddy to be brave.

And when I go to heaven, Mom,

Put ""Daddy's Girl"" on my grave.

.

Someone should have told him, Mom,

Not to drink and drive.

If only they had told him, Mom,

I would still be alive.

.

My breath is getting shorter, Mom.

I'm becoming very scared.

Please don't cry for me, Mom.

When I needed you,

you were always there.

.

I have one last question, Mom.

Before I say good bye.

I didn't drink and drive,

So why am I the one to die?

After soliciting for various sexual favors, he calmed down and we played Monopoly. He was so proud he punched me when I did well. I wanted to go home at this point, but didn't register it as dangerous.
His mother was bathing his sisters in the back. She left. He pulled me in their and asked me, ""Do you want to feel them?"". I was confused, and left the room. I said, ""I need to finish my chips.""

Suffocating yourself is near impossible. It hurts. You realize how hard breathing is becoming. You know you could probably hold your breath for the same amount of time or longer than it was shoved in that pillow. But, well, it's different when you think you wanna die. When your face is warm and surrounded in soft fabric. When you know what you are doing it gets damn hard. But you have to. Because maybe you'll succeed one day. Maybe your eyes will gloriously glaze over. You will see nothing but black. You won't notice your breathing. It'll be like you succeeded suicide. That minute victory. Then you'll wake up. You'll realize you are fucking alive. And alone. And your brain just tricked you. You'll try. Again and again. Until you've had enough. Until it's too much. Until you give in and buy a gun (totally legally of course. You can't go against your beliefs as you die). And that's all it takes. One pull of one trigger up against one temple of one person. You. One bang. You fall to the ground in a heap. A few seconds of life left in total pain. But you smile. Because you did it. You succeeded. And now you can be done. Thank god you can finally be done.

I was forced to visit her every other weekend for a few years, but after all her time was spent sleeping 'til 3 PM, drinking, smoking, trying to convince me to lie about my dad so she could get custody and child support, we got a judge to remove her mandatory visitation. From that point on, I lost all connection with her side of the family (her 7 sisters and her parents). I recently got a call from one of these sisters, who lives half way across the country, that my grandmother wasn't doing so well. She had been forced to come to our state to take care of her. They didn't know how much longer she had, much less how much longer she'd be able to live a ""normal"" life. I strapped on my best looking outfit, and punched up her address that afternoon. They had her waiting out on the porch for me, she couldn't have weighed more than 80 pounds. She had a terrible black eye where she fell and hit her face on the coffee table. Her side was wrapped with an ice pack due to her recently broke her hip. I introduced myself to her, but she didn't respond. After a few minutes and her family trying to explain who I was, she broke down like I've never seen anyone before. It was hard just to watch. She apologized profusely for reasons I didn't understand. I was so happy to see her for the first time in a decade. She had never forgotten my birthday in her prime, always sending me a card and calling. She was beloved by my dad, knowing she always genuinely cared about me. Here she was, though, apologizing to me when I had forgotten her. She regained her composure after an agonizing ten minutes, and explained she was sorry for everything my mother and done and how she treated me. She felt guilty, this poor woman who loved her children and grandchildren so much, when she had done nothing wrong. We went inside and sat on the couch, making small talk. She asked me how school was, if I had a girlfriend (I told her I didn't, but she asked me if I loved her. Not wanting to disappoint her, I said I did very much), etc. It was nice to have a normal conversation with her, to be her grandson again. Then out of the blue she asked who I was. She became confused and angry, asking why I was in her house. It took everything I had to not cry uncontrollably. Everything that was building up, our relationship that was coming back, everything, it was all torn down in a matter of moments. I frantically tried for hours to make some impression that would last in her mind, but time and time again she would forget everything about who the man in her living room was. I couldn't handle it anymore. I had to cut my losses before I poured out every emotion imaginable in her house and left. I had to come to terms that I would never be grandma's little boy again.",,False,self,t5_2wk3u,False,,,True,t3_1hcfw4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HorriblyDepressing/comments/1hcfw4/visited_grandmother_with_alzheimers_today/,

Her sister, dad, and mother survived, but some family was staying with them, and her cousin and aunt or uncle died as well.

My mom ran a daycare out of her house, but it was only a couple kids at a time. She watched this girl since she was a baby, saw her grow up, listened to her first words. She and my little brother were best friends. She was always so happy, unless she really wanted something, then she could throw a mean fit, but that was rare. She died when she was 6 I think.

A few things i remember vividly about the situation. One was my mom, she heard the news Christmas morning and broke down crying, she was a mess that whole Christmas. Another thing that really stuck out was when i went to the wake. Her older sister started crying about how it was her fault and she should have done something. Her grandma was holding her still. 

Her dad tried to save her and ended up with 4th degree burns on his shoulders and burns covering like 80% of his body before firemen took him out of the house.

My parents knew that life somewhere else would be hard for me. So they got me a puppy.

A 3 month old dachshund.

I remember the first day we got her. Our next door neighbor (We lived in an apartment at the time) would always walk her boxer in the mornings. I remember me running up to her and showing her Sadie. I was so happy to have a puppy. What kid wouldn't?

That summer, we move back from Shreveport (upper Louisiana) to St. Bernard (Very south of Louisiana). Our house had seven feet of water. Some houses were destroyed around us. Being that I was too young to realize how much was destroyed, I always played with Sadie. We lived in a FEMA trailer at the time so we never had room to play fetch and all. I was always a relaxed kid also so I always let her sleep on my lap when I played Gamecube or whatever. I snuggled as often as I could with her.

The year school systems were brought back to southern Louisiana, no one I knew came back. I was often bullied for having a big nose. Being the closed person I still am, I told no one. But Sadie knew.

She always knew when I was sad.



For the past few months, she has been peeing blood and whimpering from not even being able to walk. She wasn't to old which was what got me the most scared. As often as I could, I would snuggle with her and pet her. Even though she had fleas. I love her. Nothing could stop that.

My family has been in debt recently and we couldn't pay for her needs,  only food and other needs and all. She was still happy though. She always was.

About three nights ago, we all woke up to bloody pee all on the floor and vomit everywhere. My family panicked and we brought Sadie to the SPCA.


What a mistake.


The lady at the counter thought we abused the dog and that's why she did that. She was rude to us and said we don't deserve her and we will never get her back.

 Alright I have a friend who we will call M who lives in California, and he is 18 years old. He had never been with a girl before and this past fall he met a girl who just so happened to like him back so after a few months they eventually started dating. She was incredibly religious and made M go from being hardcore atheist to going to church two or three times a week claiming that God had saved him and that he was in a good situation. So then he finds out that she cheated on her last boyfriend (another member of the church) and that now because she has become religious that she wouldn't cheat again. He was skeptical at first but the closer they got the more he trusted her. 

They saw each other several times a week and they were happy together. Then in one week it completely turned around. His girlfriend had 2 months before she was to move to Oklahoma. Then 2 days after that his mother was put in the hospital where she was diagnosed with lung and kidney cancer, given a year to live at most. M was horrible torn apart, however despite the fact that his gf was about to move he wanted to stay with her and they ended up getting closer and closer. He fell in love and said that he would get a job after he graduated high school and that he would work and work and work so that he could move to Oklahoma and be with her despite the fact that his mother was dying.

 I kept telling him that he needed to be there for his mother but his mind was completely consumed by this girl that he had only been for a few months. As time went on he became even more consumed with the thought, his grades slipped even more and he was just depressed and confused. So the time comes closer to her moving and they had promised that they would wait until marriage to have sex. However... She changed her mind at the last moment and two weeks before she was to move she decided that she wanted to take his virginity (she was not a virgin) I think this was to keep thinking about only being with her.

 So they spend the very last day together before she moved and according to him it went by too quickly and he was just incredibly depressed, beyond depressed. The following day she was gone and they were on Skype when he found out that one of his friend's girlfriend had been sending nasty messages to M's girl about her staying in the same room as her bf (the boyfriend and this girl's parents are dating). When M questions this his girlfriend admits to flirting with this boy over the past few weeks and that she was sending dirty text messages and pictures and such. M was heartbroken. His girlfriend said that she did not act out on them(which I now know is a lie) so she shouldn't be in trouble but M had his mind made up and he broke it off with her.

 He had doubts before about her cheating but then over time came to trust her only to be cheated on. The first love of his life and the person to take his virginity completely destroyed him. I have not heard from him since that night when he broke it off with her which was about two nights ago and I am worried because he said he wanted to kill himself. I am not sure if he did or what is going on but I still can't get over how tragic it must be to have your heart completely torn apart like that. Not only did he completely lose his first love (Which I have no doubts he will one day find another woman who will actually treat him right and he can finally be happy again) but he is going to lose his mother soon. I couldn't even imagine it. I wonder how he will be with the whole church thing now though... Whether he will stay with the church or not.

I have been depressed for many years. I was depressed during a recession. I was depressed through my middle school life. I was depressed through my high school one. I was depressed into college. I have barely any drive: no career motivation, no sex drive. I have begun to love my depression. I know what you're thinking: (1) I am being melodramatic, (2) ""You don't know what love is!"", (3) I am lying and a stupid muthafucka. I have touched the beauty that is existence, though. Every time I felt love, my soul was lifted ten feet in the air and no words could describe my love for life. I hope you feel it. We, the intelligent monkeys, have attached to a metaphysical plane, and are doomed to never exist again. Scared? Well I fucking am, you and me won't exist in the not too distant future. I am very scared. I am very scared. You and I aren't permanent.
Here I am, scared and in love. I am in love with myself, and with the people who share my plight. I love you, even though, yes, you raped a baby, and yes, it died. I love you because the nonexistent abyss stares you in the face. I love you, because there is life with you. The universe is an accordion, where mostly everything that could happen did, and we are alive. The baby isn't, but I am sure inside you there is something to love. Death is beautiful. Oh my God, the beauty. The beauty of everything is too powerful for my little animal brain. But I assure you, it is the most beautiful thing. Everything in existence is too cold, or too hot, everything is too large or too small. Everything except for us. We are just right. Everyone is. There exists a brain and the components of life, for everyone, even the ""evil"" ones. Life is so short, in hindsight. But it is the longest thing I will do. I am crying now. Shit, I wish I wasn't so scared. Most of the people that have brought me here, except for my grandparents and parents are dead. I don't want anything more than to love. That is the only thing that we have. 
To all of you that want to die. I hope that you see that you are beautiful on the inside. You have the spirit (life) which will never exist again. I am fucking serious, you will never exist again. You remember all that shit that happened before you were born? Where were you? Well, that's where you are going there again. Is it painful? No. Is it lovely? No. It is our destiny, and I love everyone for it. We comrades around a ticking bomb.
Now...  Why am I depressed if I feel so much love? I am obsessed with my demise, and I have no one to talk to. I quietly drifted, moved easily by every influence around me. My life, I used to think was wasted, but it wasn't. I would rather live than not, any day. I also do not want anything, nothing in the world would make happier than my poor family. My sad, alkie father, my sad brother, and my demanding mom; I love them so much, I am crying again. Shit I am lachrymose. 
Sorry if this wasn't depressing enough, but I want to let you know, the time I spent on these web pages were my favorite.

I haven't cried this hard in years. I lost my grandfather two months ago, I loved him, but I didn't cry. I don't think I will. He lived a full life. He did what he loved, and what he wanted.

I haven't cried this hard in years. Not since I lost the dog I grew up with. 14 years. 14 goddamn years we spent together. The moment I got home from the hospital, she never left my side. She was young. Still a puppy. I was an infant. We grew up together. She was my nanny. She went with me everywhere. She kept me from playing with a rabid raccoon, and later with the neighbor's escaped 4 foot long iguana. We went on hike together. I remember going into the mountains with her. The moment her leash came off, she would sprint into the trees. Off to find some scent she picked up. But she always came back. She always came sprinting back out of the trees, and I would always go to meet her. I'd pet her and send her on her way, of course. I couldn't keep up. She was young. But not a puppy anymore. I was just a kid. I didn't want to hold her back, she'd have more fun if I just trundled along at my own pace. She was my first word. The first thing I ever said was her name, and years later she still answered to my version of her name. Azi, I called her. I couldn't pronounce the ""T"" but she didn't care. She came over to nanny me anyway. She was always there with me when I was sick, and the same with my sister. She was more content laying down by our side when we were sick now. I was still a kid, but she wasn't very young. I always spent time with her. If I had a problem, she was there to listen. It was important, too. When you're homeschooled for ten years and don't get out much, a dog that always listens is the best thing in the world. But she was getting tired. She was deaf now. But she could read body language. She'd still come when you patted your legs, but she moved a little slower now. Now the tables had turned. She couldn't always keep up with me. I was kind of fat, but she still had trouble. Her hips were going south, but not too bad. Only when she overdid it. Eventually, her eyesight started to fail her too. She could see, but not too well. She got tired. She would lay in the main traffic areas of the house. At the entrance to the kitchen, in the middle of the living room, in the hall. We never got mad. We knew what she was doing. She was keeping tabs on us. All those years of playing nanny, and she wanted to know where we were. If we didn't pass through the room where she was, she's move to find us then lay down there. We got puppies. Two of them, brother and sister. Black labs born on the Fourth of July. She whipped them into shape. They knew what was what. They were only 6 weeks old when they came into the house but within a week she had them trained. She got worse. She spent most of her time sleeping now. The puppies would try to get her to play. **I** would try to get her to play. We used to twist up old shirts into strings, and play tug-of-war. It was her favorite game. I always let her win, of course. But she didn't want to play any more. I spent a lot of time with her, cuddling now. More than usual. Her ears weren't so perky any more, they didn't stand up quite as straight. She had some benign tumors now. They'd gotten bigger. She was getting old. Very old.

Two weeks. Two weeks was all it took. I know why she whipped our puppies into shape. She knew what they were. They were her replacements. Because that's all life is, isn't it? It's just a series of dogs. She knew that too. She wanted to make sure she had good dogs to follow in her path. So she made sure. She did a good job. It's been almost 7 years. Our puppies aren't puppies any more... They're getting kind of gray under their chins, but they aren't old. Yet.

It's been 7 years. For seven whole years I've been waiting. I've been holding back, I've stayed strong. I held it down so long, that I forgot about it. But I miss you. I miss you, Tazi, and I love you. I still do, I promise. I didn't forget. I still keep that last t-shirt you used hanging up on my coat rack. It's still got rips in it from where you shook your head just a little too hard. I know what they say - ""Think about all the good times you shared!"" And I do, I promise. I won't ever forget. But I miss you. I wish you were still here, so I could make more good memories. But you aren't.

The spring after we buried you in the back yard, some flowers came up. Right over your grave. Right next to the headstone. They looked familiar, Tazi. They looked just like you...",,False,self,t5_2wk3u,False,,,True,t3_1e20zm,http://www.reddit.com/r/HorriblyDepressing/comments/1e20zm/last_minutes_with_oden_feeling_things_i_havent/,

1376787560.0,8,self.HorriblyDepressing,1kkwo0,I watched my sweet baby girl die.,judimusprime,15,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HorriblyDepressing/comments/1kkwo0/i_watched_my_sweet_baby_girl_die/,"I'm sorry if the title is misleading. I am referring to my pitbull, Girlie, who just last week was struck by a semi truck in the highway in front of my house after running out the door before I could catch her.

All I can think is that she thought she was going with my boyfriend since he had just left a few seconds before. The door was still open because my boyfriend's brother was smoking a cigarette. I went to grab the leashes to take our girls out on a walk. I didn't even think about the fact that my boyfriend had just took off on his bike, and how excited  Girlie got when she heard them jingling. All I saw when I turned around was her tail disappear around the door frame. 

I dropped everything and bolted out the door after her... our other pit, Nina, bolted out too. I was running to save their lives, but I couldn't get there fast enough to pull Girlie out of the road before that semi sent her flying. I felt everything inside me break all at once, my heart in my stomach, my feet like stone as I came to her and pulled her to the curbside, tears running down my cheek. My boyfriend was only a block up the road. He saw Nina in the street and snatched her up, not even seeing me on the side of the road with our other girl. I heard him when I realized what had happened. The sound of his cry for Girlie shattered my world.

I carried her back to the house while he carried a struggling Nina, and we put her in the shade. My boyfriend's brother had shut the door when he saw me running out after Girlie, and we were locked out with my injured baby until their grandfather arrived to help us get her to an animal hospital. The first place we took her was the SPCA. While we didn't have much of a choice at the time, I severely regret taking her there.

They took her to the back, and an hour later came out to tell us we needed to take her to a trauma center (for animals), because her front legs were broken and they were 'pretty sure' she had severe head trauma, even though she was responsive and wagging her tail on the way there. Then they informed us that any trauma center we took her to would require a deposit before even looking at her. That is EXACTLY what they told us. 

We couldn't afford to take her anywhere. On August 2nd, we were struck by a drunk driver head-on the very night that we had moved to Florida. Without a vehicle, we have been struggling to find jobs. We had no money to save her life. They said we could leave her there for the day to be monitored, but no one would be there past 5pm to watch her through the night. The only option they left us was to put her down.

It took time for me to sign the consent form. I was holding the pen and staring at the signature line and all I could do was cry. Girlie had been with us for two years. We had adopted her from a pitbull rescue to be a friend for Nina, who was a puppy when we got Girlie. So they would always have each other. She was so beautiful. A Bluenose brindle. Everyone who was around her, loved her. She was a mean looking dog that was no more than a big puppy at heart, who wanted nothing more than to go bye-bye in the car and be petted and adored. She did not deserve this. She did not understand what was happening to her. 

In the end, I was the only one who could sign the paper and let her suffering be over.

It was over so quickly. They let us spend some time with her before it was time, we were both holding her and telling her she was a good girl and how much we loved her. She was looking at us the whole time. My boyfriend couldn't be there with her when it happened, so I stayed. I held her while they put the needle in her. As her breathing became labored. Until it was nothing but a hitching cough. And then it was nothing. And I couldn't breath with her. I died inside. They had to pull me away from her so they could wrap her up for us to take her body.

I cried all the way home. While my boyfriend dug her grave, and we put her in. His brother was the most broken of us. He'd been living with us for a year, and since he got here, she slept in bed with him. She was as much his Girlie as she was ours. She was his best friend. She was like my own child. And we weren't able to save her.

We're keeping her collar and leash. We're going to get her name stitched into her collar and I'm going to keep it for as long as I live.

It rarely bleeds. That's were scissors come in. Or my nails. I should refrain from using present tense shouldn't I? 80 days sure is a long time...it's be an awful record to tarnish.
