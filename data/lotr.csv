1355432398.0,549,self.lotr,14sz2i,A Thought Before Seeing The Hobbit tonight.,Opheiliac,640,91,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/14sz2i/a_thought_before_seeing_the_hobbit_tonight/,"On December tenth, 2001, Peter Jackson's film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was released in theatres.


It doesn't seem that long ago.  I remember skipping a day of school to be the first in line for tickets, power-reading through the appendices of the books one more time (to better point out faults in plot or character should they arise during the movie), and finally rushing when the theatre doors opened to get the best seat, and settling in with my popcorn, hands shaking and my heart in my throat.


Now, eleven years and three films later, I have tickets to the midnight premiere of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' this evening.    I have a familiar tightness in my chest - excitement.  I feel ten years old, sitting in that same seat with the overhead lights dimming, the huge film screen flickering.


Now at the beginning of another Middle-Earth film trilogy, it's easy to make comparisons of then and now. It's been nine years since the premiere of 'The Return of the King', and things have changed.


I'll be driving my own car to the cinema this year, not taking the bus or having a parent drive me.  I'll be taking my little sister with me (her first midnight viewing).  


I've moved twice, been to Italy, broke one car, started a book, played onstage in Vancouver, found love, made friends (and lost some),have done lots, done nothing, gardened, wrote, been sad and ecstatic, learned to bake bread and how to shoot. And so much more than that.


I've grown, perhaps strangely, in the past years.  But with that green door to the House on the Hill in front of me once again, I'm reminded what moved me so much about this story the first time around.  


Within these epic, sprawling fantasies lies an emotional core: Friendship, courage, following through and the importance of peace (whatever one's peace may be).  That the good things in life are worth preserving, worth protecting,  down to the smallest, seemingly mundane things (a box of salt, a strand of hair, the memory of strawberries).


I forget sometimes in my plans and pursuits, when I find myself in shreds over my bank account, or my job, or what to take at post-secondary, that it can be easy to overlook the simple and beautiful things and people around me, that are worth cherishing.


I'm reminded again that greatness isn't always money, degrees, or the most recognition.  Greatness can be coming home at night to someone you love.  It can be following through on a promise, standing by a friend, or shouldering a burden you weren't asked to.   Greatness can be a home, a place to sit and eat (however many meals a day one finds agreeable) and be at peace.


So tonight, a little older and a little more grown, I'll take my seat in the theatre for the fourth of six premieres, with the excitement of a child, and an appreciation for the ideas values and imagination an excellent and moving story has brought to my life over eleven years. I will visit The Shire once more, and hold my breath as the opening credits run across the screen. 


And After that? My life will go on much as it has for the past decade, with its own adventures, boredoms, trials and anomalies.  And myself and my world will continue to grow and change.  But if I take anything from this, it will be that when I go home, to find someplace quiet, where I can sit down with a glass of wine , with a good friend, laugh,  and share stories over a good meal. Because no matter where I go or what I do, the best part is often coming home, coming back.


(EDIT)

I had no idea this post would garner any sort of response when I posted.  This has been an amazing few hours everyone.  Thank you so much to all of you, I'm blown away by the amount of you who feel the same way about Tolkien's world.

The Prof has always been a very hilarious and interesting teacher. When I asked him about the class, he immediately said we'd be reading the Simarillion for the first two weeks and learning Elvish the last two weeks, which I sheepishly replied that I'd already read it and would love to read it again, and that I already knew Elvish. Since he had found me out as a hard-core Tolkien fan(I've read the books every year since I was ten, I'm 23 now), he summoned me to ~~the White Council~~ his office and asked me what books I suggested he use as supplemental reading to his course. This should be fun to say the least. Can I bore you guys with updates on it? I'd like to have someone to share stories with that loves LotR as much as I do :)

Edit: Woah this blew up while I was in class!!! Haha glad to see everyone's interested :) First day was just as awesome as I thought it would be. I'll be updating/replying to you with the antics of class today here in a bit. Now to figure out how to format said updates...

At the end of RotK, after the ring is destroyed we hear about the feasting and celebrating, and how the hobbits tell their tale to the assembled guests including the Elves.


""It's just that with Mr. Frodo hurt, I lost my temper a bit, if you understand me. There was nothin' for it but to have at that spider.""

I like to imagine, that when Sam talks about Shelob, that Aragorn and Elrond's jaws drop. I mean, they wouldn't let it show. But, I imagine them just looking across the table at each-other like ""Wtf? _Sam_ killed that thing, and he doesn't even realize what he did."" Killing Shelob would have been a notable feat for Aragorn, or Boromir, or even Gandalf single-handedly.

1361341337.0,192,self.lotr,18vfqd,Most Well-Known Quotes from the Lord of the Rings: Books vs. Movies,spezzle5,208,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/18vfqd/most_wellknown_quotes_from_the_lord_of_the_rings/,"So, as I didn't see a thread concerning this topic, I decided to compile a comparison of the most famous quotes from the books with their movie counterparts. A lot of these quotes take place in different times and places in the books (Gandalf's speech to Frodo takes place at Bag-End as opposed to Moria, Sam's speech takes place on the stair of Cirith Ungol as opposed to Osgilioth, and the ""White Shores"" bit takes place at the Grey Havens as opposed to Gondor), but for the most part, the original dialogue is intact. Although Peter Jackson and co. changed up certain lines/circumstances to make the quotes more cinematic, I love how they included them in the films.

**Gandalf's Speech to Frodo**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izSjEQ84OwQ

*Book:*
&gt;""I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo."" 
&gt;""So do I,' said Gandalf, ""and so do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" (Tolkien, 50) 


**Sam's Speech**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEMdXhfO-Wk

*Book:* 
&gt;""Yes, that's so,' said Sam. 'And we shouldn't be here at all if we'd known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think they were things the wonderful folk in the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it in the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folks seem to have just been landed in them, usually - their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't."" (Tolkien, 719)


**White Shores**

*Movie:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-3U52TcWmE

*Book:* 
&gt;""And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise."" (Tolkien 1042)


Anyways, there's many more quotes that line up between books and movies, but I thought these were the best examples. So what do you think? Are there any awesome quotes that I missed here? And which versions do you prefer, the the quotes in the books, or their film counterparts?",,False,self,t5_2rfb9,1361341541.0,,,True,t3_18vfqd,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/18vfqd/most_wellknown_quotes_from_the_lord_of_the_rings/,

What do dwarves actually eat? This troubled me for a while, and many possible answers came to mind: Do they host their own livestock underground? If so; how would they feed them, and where would they keep them? I'd expect Dwarven cities to be populated into the thousands, surely they couldn't keep enough livestock to feed that many (hungry) dwarves everyday in their lightless holes. Do they hunt for their food outside of their cities? Something about a dwarf with a bow just seems quite off to me, let alone large groups of them quietly hunting animals. Do they suck the moss off rocks? I bloody hope not, if I knew this about Gimli before hand he wouldn't be in my top 3 characters.

Is it explicitly stated anywhere what a diet of a dwarf contains? If not, does anyone have any more (and hopefully better) theories of how the dwarves keep their stocky frame?

Even though I knew both stories well, I'd never put those two together.  Given Tolkein, it was probably intentional.  

The Ring of Gyges is myth used by Socrates in Plato's Republic.  Gyges finds a ring that makes him invisible when he turns it.  As soon as he finds out, he goes to the palace, fucks the queen, and kills the king.  It's used to represent human nature as ""unjust"".  As soon as someone doesn't face consequences for their actions, they will act in the most selfish and self serving way.

Of course, the One Ring is corrupting.  How much is Tolkien alluding to this?  There's no way he wouldn't have known about it, but is this a response to the Republic, a justification for ""justice"" with in an epic?  After all ""goodness"" and virtue are pretty significant in LOTR.

Has anyone else looked more deeply into it?  I guess it's kind of obvious once you put two and two together, but some how I don't think it ever came up before.",,False,self,t5_2rfb9,False,,,True,t3_19e4l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/19e4l9/the_one_ring_and_the_ring_of_gyges/,

I think the answer might be that he thought he did kill Bilbo, but really killed Drogo and his wife. 

Drogo and Primula died from drowning on the Brandywine river in Buckland. Witnesses claim to have seen a struggle. This is Smeagle's MO. 

 Gollum only had two clues; ""Shire and Baggins"", Not likely to travel on land, Gollum would have killed the first Baggins he found along the Brandywine river. Being the only Baggins in Buckland, this would have been Drogo. He wouldn't know the difference between Drogo and Bilbo, as he never actually saw Bilbo, and didn't know his first name.

What do you guys think? I couldnt find this theory anywhere. 

•edit for clarity

*Edit 2

Some good points (and some not so good points) have been brought up, and I would like to address them in order of importance. After looking at the evidence, my theory isn't likely. It does however, add some extra elements to the story, and next time you read it imagine that this is what happened. You will be surprised with how much it changes.There are many things in LOTR that is up to speculation (Tom B for example), this is one of those things. Reading through it it adds a lot to Frodo and Gandalfs character. And all I ask is that you keep it in mind when reading it again.

Remember, LOTR is meant to be read as a **history** written by players of the story, not a **fiction** written by an infallable author.

**Gandalf said Gollum turned back before finding the shire**

Yes, Gandalf said this. But what would he have said if Gollum turned back after killing Drogo? He certainly wouldn't have told Frodo. If he did, and Frodo killed Gollum in retaliation, the ring would have him, as completely as it had Gollum. This also brings up that the elves would know what happened, and the enemy as well. The elves wouldn't tell him because Gandalf didn't, and the enemy didn't because he never had the chance.

**Gollum was with Shelob in 2980**

This is the most convincing argument against my theory, and why I ultimately concede it isn't likely. I will say in my defense however, that Tolkien said that the dates in the appendices are not 100% accurate. In fact, that date was gathered by the elves during their interrogation with Gollum, who certainly wouldn't know what year it was.

**SnakeyesX lied about there being a struggle**
&gt;'... and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.' 'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.' 'And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him.' said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller. 'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman.' said the gaffer, who did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble.'

If you saw a couple get drownded, first the man then the wife, in the dark of night, and not accustomed to thinking about foul play, it would look exactly as described. Gaffer shot it down because he shot down ANYTHING which put Bagginses in a bad light.

**Gollum didn't find the ring, wouldn't he keep looking in the Shire?**

Gandalf said that Gollum turned back from his quest of retrieving the ring before he got to the Brandywine. All I'm saying is that he didn't turn back until after he got his revenge on Baggins.

**Edit 3: Gandalf wouldn't lie!**

Yes, I know everything revolves around Gandalf Lying, and neither Frodo, nor Sam, *ever* learning the truth (Otherwise they would revise the red book). But I insist that Gandalf would have lied to prevent sowing hatred in Frodos heart, and therefore giving the ring more power over him. Remember, Frodo wrote LOTR and therefor any lies Gandalf told would be kept intact.

**Edit 4: Why stop there, before he found the ring**

This is actually why I came up with this theory in the first place. He had a mission to kill Bilbo and never went through with it. That seemed odd. Frodo thought it was odd too and asked Gandalf about it, who gave a very pitiful answer ""now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me."" What I think is more likely, he went all the way to the Shire, killed Drogo (thinking he was Bilbo), and then, only after not being able to find the ring, went to Mordor. Having had his personal revenge he then saught the true lord of the ring. This explanation, I think, makes much more sense than Gandalfs explanation.

**Edit 5: Kyzf42 makes a more compelling argument than I can, read his comment after this to have a different perspective. Also, Smeagle is running around this thread, if you know his true name ;-)**

(All quotes from *The Letters of JRR Tolkien.*)

&gt;Do you think Tom Bombadil, the spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside, could be made into the hero of a story? Or is he, as I suspect, fully enshrined in the enclosed verses?

(16 December 1937)

&gt;As a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of things unexplained (especially if an explanation actually exists); and I have perhaps from this point of view erred in trying to explain too much, and give too much past history. Many readers have, for instance, rather stuck at the *Council of Elrond*. And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally) ...


&gt;Tom Bombadil is not an important person - to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment'. I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in the *Oxford Magazine* about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, if he did not have some kind of function. I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war. But the view of Rivendell seems to be that it is an excellent thing to have represented, but that there are in fact things with which it cannot cope; and upon which its existence nonetheless depends. Ultimately only the victory of the West will allow Bombadil to continue, or even to survive. Nothing would be left for him in the world of Sauron.

&gt;He has no connexion in my mind with the Entwives. What had happened to them is not resolved in this book. He is in a way the answer to them in the sense that he is almost the opposite, being say, Botany and Zoology (as sciences) and Poetry as opposed to Cattle-breeding and Agriculture and practicality.

(25 April 1954)

&gt;You may be able to conceive of your unique relation to the Creator without a name - can you: for in such a relation pronouns become proper nouns? But as soon as you are in a world of other finites with a similar, if each unique and different, relation to Prime Being, who are you? Frodo asked not 'what is Tom Bombadil' but 'Who is he'. We and he no doubt often laxly confuse the questions. Goldberry gives what I think is the correct answer. We need not go into the sublimities of 'I am that am' - which is quite different from *he is* * . She adds as a concession a statement of part of the 'what'. He is *master* in a peculiar way: he has no fear, and no desire of possession or domination at all. He merely knows and understands about such things as concern him in his natural little realm. He hardly even judges, and as far as can be seen makes no effort to reform or remove even the Willow.

&gt;I don't think Tom needs philosophizing about, and is not improved by it. But many have found him an odd or indeed discordant ingredient. In historical fact I put him in because I had already 'invented' him independently (he first appeared in the Oxford Magazine) and wanted an 'adventure' on the way. But I kept him in, and as he was, because he represents certain things otherwise left out. I do not mean him to be an allegory - or I should not have given him so particular, individual, and ridiculous a name - but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science: the spirit that desires knowledge of other things, their history and nature, *because they are 'other'* and wholly independent of the enquiring mind, a spirit coeval with the rational mind, and entirely unconcerned with 'doing' anything with the knowledge: Zoology and Botany not Cattle-breeding or Agriculture. Even the Elves hardly show this: they are primarily artists. Also T.B. exhibits another point in his attitude to the Ring, and its failure to affect him. You must concentrate on some part, probably relatively small, of the World (Universe), whether to tell a tale, however long, or to learn anything however fundamental - and therefore much will from that 'point of view' be left out, distorted on the circumference, or seems a discordant oddity. The power of the Ring over all concerned, even the Wizards or Emissaries, is not a delusion - but it is not the whole picture, even of the ten state and content of that part of the Universe.


&gt;* Only the *first* person (of worlds or anything) can be unique. If you say *he is* there must be more than one, and created (sub) existence is implied. I can say 'he is' of Winston Churchill as well as of Tom Bombadil, surely?

(Sept. 1954)

Also, since there is a popular theory that Tom Bombadil is God:

&gt;There is no 'embodiment' of the Creator anywhere in this story or mythology.

After all, Gandalf goes on to truly dedicate his presence in Middle-Earth to fighting Sauron and kindling the spirit of hope and persistence in the Free Peoples - which is exactly the remit of Narya, the  Ring of Fire. Saruman was jealous of this from the start - if Saruman had Narya, might he have been the beacon of hope, and never consumed by jealousy, lust for the Ring and the desire to rule?

Original recipe provided.,MKoppJones,111,15,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/13ba3x/elvish_bread_aka_lembas_bread_metric_recipe/,"This weekend I am making Elvish Bread a.k.a Lembas Bread. When I went looking for a recipe I could only find the Imperial measurements for the ingredients, also the recipe missed the use of one of the ingredients. Therefore, I have converted all of the convertible measurements to metric for us metric users. I hope you guys enjoy the use of this! I have provided the original recipe below.

I will be sure to post pictures of the outcome and a small review on this recipe!

**Ingredients**

* 300g cups of flour
* 1 tablespoon of baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 113g of cold butter (1 stick)
* 60g cup of brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup/honey
* 160ml of milk/heavy cream (or more, *or less*, if necessary)
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla

**Method**

* 1) Preheat oven to 220˚C
* 2) Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.
* 3) Add the butter and mix with a fork or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine granules.
* 4) Add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly into the mixture.
* 5) Add the milk/cream, vanilla and honey, and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.
* 6) Roll the dough out about 1/2 inch in thickness.
* 7) Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.
* 8) Criss-cross (DO NOT cut all the way) each square from corner-to-corner with a knife.
* 9) Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.

""In rode the Lord of the Nazgul. A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgul, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.

All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dinen.

'You cannot enter here,' said Gadalf, and the huge shadow halted. 'Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!'

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.

'Old fool!' he said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!' And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

Gandalf did not move. And in that ver moment, away behind in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.
And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns. In dark Mindulluin's sides the dimly echoed. Great horns of the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last""

&gt;""..I am not weaponless.""

&gt; Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of Andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. ‘Elendil!’ he cried. ‘I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dúnedan, the heir of Isildur Elendil’s son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!’

&gt;Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown. Éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes.

-p. 433, ""The Riders of Rohan""

Passages where characters in the LOTR reveal themselves, even for a moment, as the truly powerful and masterful creatures they are continue to be some of my favorites. The Aragorn of the books does this more-so than the Aragorn character in Peter Jackson's movies.

I also love how passages like this subtly reveal the ""other-worldliness"" of Elves, if it can be called that. This passage, to me, is a clear example of the Elves' ability to perceive things more deeply and in a different ""dimension"", if you will, than other Children of Illúvitar. He sees the power of Aragorn's bloodline, majesty, and leadership manifested as an orb-like crown. The true nature of the Elves, while still mysterious in the Arda universe, is shown briefly here, and in a passage a few pages before. As Aragorn and Gimli slept, Legolas was ""standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night"". This is described as sleep, ""if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of Elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.""

5) After Theoden says ""Let them come!"": ""Just go up to them [the orcs] and say 'Go home!'""
6) When the ents get together for their entmoot: ""Ah yes...the talking trees.""

8) During the fight at Helm's Deep: ""Where's the hot oil?"" ""They don't do that mom."" ""Oh well they're gonna lose for sure.""
9) When Frodo points Sting at Sam: ""Frodo's just all, like, weird in the second and third movies.""

In my case, reading them first when I was in college, that was how I took them.  I did not know that Tolkien had developed an entire Universe of supporting background for these stories (I did not read the appendices of LOTR the first time around).  Nevertheless, my first experience with his writings struck me the same as I have heard other people express it: they opened my imagination like nothing else.

So as much as I enjoyed the books the first time around, my enjoyment increases the more I learn of the history of Arda.  For instance, at the mere story-telling level, Gandalf is an intriguing Walt Disney-type of magical character and he has lots of groovy cool adventures, but as I learned that he was actually a god and was sent on a mission by the Creator, it was like a re-discovery of the character.  

I saw the LOTR movies ten years ago but I didn’t realize Gandalf’s sword was King Turgon’s sword.  Now, the movies and books are even more enjoyable.  At the time I saw The Hobbit, I did not realize that Thorin’s sword was the sword used to kill a balrog (which was also a god-like creature, but which an elf could still kill—awesome!) at the fountain during the fall of Gondolin.  

I could go on with hundreds of “aha!” moments I’ve had as I have learned the history of Arda, but many of you know what I mean.  For me, this very dense body of history behind the main stories just keeps increasing my enjoyment of Tolkien’s best-known works.  To me, it separates out his work, profoundly, from all the sword-and-sorcery stuff that came in Tolkien’s wake.
