(Song 1)
There's no such thing as black and white, 

There's only between the lines.

If there's such a thing as heaven,

Then I'm walking a fine line.

I didn't ask for war and peace,

At least not in my time.

I didn't ask for sticks and stones,

And maybe that's just fine,

Oh my..

It's all my..

There's no such thing as black and white,

There's only between the lines.

If there's such a thing as Hell,

Well then maybe that's just fine.

Oh my..

It's all my...

One thing is certain,

Nothing is the same.

I didn't ask for love,

I don't feel the pain.

I've walked through the gates of heaven,

Swam through the lakes of Hell.

They've all left me,

Maybe that's just as well...

It's all my..

It's all my..

It's on my.. mind..

It's all in my head..

This is a very small subreddit, so feedback is really very necessary. A downvote doesn't say anything. Is it ""I don't like it,"" or ""this needs more work,"" or even, ""Damn, I wish I could write like that and I'm just gonna be spiteful?"" I've seen some honest-to-god, superb songwriting on here get downvotes with no rhyme or reason.

I don't mind the downvotes -- I don't expect everything I write to be completely successful, and nor should anyone on here, really. But when it's just a ""click the downvote and move on"" sort of deal, there isn't anything being added to discussion, and no one gains anything from it. Even if it's just a simple ""I don't like it,"" it would be helpful.

I appreciate the subreddit for what it is, and I've received some genuinely helpful and/or insightful feedback from people. But in order for a subreddit of this size to have any real merit, there needs to be open feedback from each other, right?


I'm not on here for the karma, honestly. I'm here for the feedback and criticism.

Just a few thoughts.

I'm 24; been playing since I was 14, so I just finished my first decade of apprenticeship. I play guitar, bass, drums, percussion, keyboard/piano/synthesizer, and harmonica. I sing as well, and I write quite a bit - hundreds of songs so far. I really strive to challenge myself and write in differing styles.

I grew up on Chess Records, Delta blues, and the Rolling Stones. Pretty soon I got into all kinds of stuff - some of my favorites are John Lennon, T.Rex, Iggy Pop, the Who, David Bowie, Adam and the Ants, Franz Ferdinand, the Kinks, Gary Numan, the Master Musicians of Joujouka, and Those Darlins.

""**Brighthead**"" is my debut album. I recorded it in 2009, in a converted garage studio down in Florida. Recorded it with the members of a garage rock band called Stonefox, now called Young Circles. We had lots of fun and they were very supportive. Lots of long days and great creativity. (I **LOVE** making records.)

Last summer, I released a single, ""**Sunshine**"" b/w ""**PicturePulse**"". This was even more popular than ""Brighthead"" was.

I'm currently underway with the recording of my sophomore album, ""**Soft Dig Only**"". It's a much rootsier, bluesier affair than my other stuff.  I'm recording over 40 songs for it; it'll be trimmed to a double-album for release.

I'm not trying to do anything distasteful or AWish by posting here. I really just want to see what you guys think of my stuff. Most people seem to dig it, but I always look for new opinions.

There was some interest in getting a weekly discussion thread together, so I thought I'd put one together for today. I'm happy to do it every week, depending on how successful the first couple are. If the mods want to get involved or anything, that'd be cool.

13peeps mentioned Justin Bieber in the thread yesterday. I thought we could talk about pop music for our first discussion. Is there room for good songwriting in pop music? Are there currently artists on top 40 radio who you'd consider great songwriters? Do lyrics even matter anymore?

Do you, as songwriters, incorporate aspects of pop music into your songs? Are there certain techniques you use? Is your most popular song the most popular because it's the catchiest or the poppiest? What about it draws people in?

One week we could talk about choosing a chord progression or crafting melody, another week we could all discuss the role of metaphor in songwriting (maybe everyone would post their favorite image they've ever included in their lyrics).

Is this something people would be interested in? There's a wide variety of genres and voices on this subreddit. I think if people were interested, we could get some interesting perspectives.

It's a contest held every two weeks where you sign up as a lyricist, vocalist or musician and you get put randomly into teams where everyone has one of the three roles. Each round is assigned a theme and then you have eleven days to get together and make a song. At the end of that, there's voting on what song is best overall and who did best in each category. 

It's a very polite community and it's a lot of fun. 

You should think about signing up for the next round, especially if your specialty is vocals or lyrics. Right now, the signups thread has way more musicians in it than anything else but don't let that stop you from signing on as a musician.

I've decided that we're going to increase the quantity and hopefully quality of critiques and feedback on the songs.  We (as in the members of this songwriting community) are asking that everyone that post a song also provide, with that post, links to three recent critiques they've provided for others.  I am hoping these are well though-out critiques.  

Myself and the other moderators won't be deleting posts for not adhering to the posting guidelines and the three critique rule.  I'm hoping the rest of you are on board with that and will use the power of karma to control it. 

I've decided not to disable down-votes.   I was considering self-post only but was reminded that it is convenient to have the embedded players on the page, so we'll leave it as it is. 

I would like to [start a discussion with everyone about critiques.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/jivuw/rsongwriters_lets_discuss_critiques/)



**With all of that said I want to also say that if anyone disagrees with anything I've done please let me know.   I would rather you post your song with no critiques then to not post your song at all.   I'm not trying to make any tyrannical situation, just thought we would all enjoy something new.**

**Original Post**
-----------------------
_____________________
I've not paid as much mind as I would have liked to /songwriters and I feel as though the community is not getting what they want out of the subreddit, so, in the coming weeks I'm going to seek to make some changes.  I'm looking for your feedback now as to what you would like to see happen.   As the moderator/creator of the subreddit, I've got my own opinions and desires but I realize those aren't all that matters and I alone have not made this community what it is.   







The primary change I'm interested in making is getting the community to begin to focus more on genuine, well-thought-out critiques of one another's work.  I never intended this to be a showcase subreddit as much as a place where you can receive feedback from your peers that is helpful.  







Regarding how I feel about feedback:   Helpful feedback is not always nice feedback.  You can always remain respectful, but sometimes things just need to be put bluntly.  That said, ""your songs sucks"" does no one any good.  I'm fine with, ""your song sucks"" as long as it is then supported by well thought out ideas and suggestions for improvement.  






Someone else suggested getting to link your song along with a critique as a way of encouraging more critique and feedback. 






Also, it has been suggested that we disable down votes...

I've been trying to think of cool things /r/songwriters could do, and it struck me that people would probably be interested in a album of the best material from ""the voice of the internet""

I'd be happy to handle the admin/logistics side of things.

I'm thinking it could work like this:

1) We set a deadline for submissions - I think it's just ""submit your best work"" (one per account) as opposed to needing to record something specific

2) We put all submissions in a thread, and allow the usual upvote/downvote mechanisms to do their thing

3) After a week or two of voting, we take the 10 or 12 songs with the most upvotes, and make them into an album!

That's the basic idea... what do you think? Interesting? Stupid?

Some additional thoughts:

* Original music only - no covers.

* We could put the result on iTunes or whatever. All proceeds go to charity (to avoid any upset over $)

* If it goes well, this could be a recurring thing - every year, or maybe every few months.

* We might want to promote the ""voting"" phase widely across reddit. Submissions would be mainly /r/songwriters and our companion musical subreddits. But voting should be as wide as possible.

* We could ask one of the art subreddits to do a cover, etc.

I think last week was pretty successful, so let's get right into it.

Let's talk about voice. All of my favorite songwriters have established themselves as having a unique tone/voice. John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats, for example, has a very specific aesthetic -- he sounds like the Mountain Goats. 

What is the process of defining your voice? At what point do you start sounding like ""yourself,"" rather than ""Oh, he's doing a version of Death Cab meets Bright Eyes."" How would you describe your voice? What makes your songwriting particularly ""you""?

For veteran songwriters: was there a particular song/album where you feel like your songs really started being being uniquely you? How much of that was conscious? For newbies: where do you think you are in the process? Is this something you think about?

I don't mean to imply that voice is a static concept: you unlock the achievement of being unique and then you stay that way. Of course your songwriting is always going to be evolving, but I think it evolves within the certain framework of ""you.""

I think this discussion might lend itself to people posting a particular song of theirs that they think encapsulates their voice. I'm a little hesitant about that, because I like the idea of these discussions being self posts that don't turn into self-promotion, but I think in this case it would add to it.

I have to just sort of wait for that **bang** moment and hunch over my guitar and write it out before the tingle in my face leaves.

However, I've noticed that if someone gives me a topic to write about, or a song idea comes up in conversation and I say, ""Hell yeah, I'll write a song about XXX"" I can crank it out as easy as breathing.

It's as if I push myself harder if there is some sort of promise of a song to someone else.

Also, I  nearly always write when I'm extremely exhausted. Maybe it has something to do with clearing my mind but that's just how it is.

And I guess the strangest one is that I have an easier time writing if I'm wearing a hat. I don't even want to think about that one. haha

1362986191.0,9,self.Songwriters,1a2k6d,What are some popular songs with lyrics which are actually about something other than break-ups or parties?,Ayavaron,12,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/1a2k6d/what_are_some_popular_songs_with_lyrics_which_are/,"This isn't a complaint. It's more of a curiosity. I've noticed that the vast majority of hit pop songs have very little narrative unless it's about a break-up or a party. If they stray from that, tend to be theme salads. (e.g. Imagine Dragons' ""Radioactive"") 

Occasionally, there are sorts of story songs that become hits. (e.g. Aaron Carter's ""Aaron's Party"") but these are pretty rare. 

It seems like there's a huge gap between the kind of songwriting done by someone like John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats and his efforts to sing from the roles of various characters and real people to other specified characters or real people and the kind of songwriting done by Top 40 songwriters like Dr. Luke and Max Martin. Is this gap really that big? What's the most successfully anybody's crossed it?

I have played around with lyrics and written down random stuff before but this is the first time they have actually produced something I think is worthy of critique. Let me know how I can improve this song, suggestions are more than welcome.

**Verse 1**

Started nervous and alone

a sea of faces all unknown

never would have guessed

it would turn out like this

Laughing, great friends

Good times till the end

back then time moved in slow-mo

where the hell did it all go

**Chorus**

Oh nostalgia won't you be my time machine

Take me back to the places I've already been

Oh nostalgia won't you be my time machine

Help me relive all my precious memories

**Verse 2**

I'd rather just lie here

In silence with you near

thinking up the perfect lines

that might make me more inclined

to sound cool, or clever

I'm just a fool trying to keep it together

Notebooks full and schemes galore

all to make you love me more.


**Chorus**


**Verse 3**

Feeling alone, again

home would be a godsend

this just might be my hell

not quite feeling myself

Days spent reminiscing

staring at the ceiling

like it's an empty canvas

as my mind paints all I miss


Now I find I'm aging

my hair is greying

Many more memories to come

pushing out old weak ones

some sad, regretful

small or monumental

but I know I'll be happy

as long as they outlast me.


**Chorus**


I just thought of the chorus tonight and I am not really sure how to critique my own work. All help will be appreciated. Thanks!

Let me expand on that last point. 

So you sit down to critique someone’s work. You stare at it for a while. You know it’s not the best but it’s takes a while before you realize what you don’t like. Then suddenly it clicks.... It’s that the writing feels very passive.  So you write your critique and send it off. 

Fast forward a couple days. You are working on one of your songs and you realize it feels kinda passive. So you rewrite it to make it more active. Congratulations you now are a better song writer. 

It’s easier to spot the the problems in other peoples work than it is your own. Critiquing people's work helps you figure out and vocalize what you do and don't like in songs. Once you can vocalize it you can apply it to your own work. ",,False,,t5_2qtpz,False,,,True,t3_klxm7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/klxm7/why_you_should_critique/,

(xpost from r/dogs),pineapple_blurt,11,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/ironi/songwriters_of_reddit_a_challenge_write_my_dog_a/,"The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!

First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp

Now, some Apollo facts:

- I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.

- Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.

- According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.

- He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.

- He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.

This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D

Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

However, for the most part, I found that reading the book has made me think more formally and thoroughly about elements of songwriting form and practice that I'd taken for granted.

1335639492.0,6,self.Songwriters,sx3fz,[Meta] What if we made a thing out of analyzing examples of truly great and truly poor songwriting? What would be the best format for such discussions?,Ayavaron,12,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/sx3fz/meta_what_if_we_made_a_thing_out_of_analyzing/,"I've been thinking about this subreddit and its problems lately.

/r/Songwriters/ is focused on critique in a way that's not bad but makes participation challenging. Submitting your stuff for critique is sort of selfish and the act of critique is its own challenge, demanding close attention to the OP's content and it is all for little promise of payoff. 

Just look at the guidelines on the right. Yes they're fair but they're hard. It would be great if we maintained that standard all the time but it demands a lot of anyone who wants to contribute. 

So why do I think discussions of examples will help? 

1. If the subject of discussion is something people already know about, contributing becomes much easier. Is ""Don't Stop Believing"" an incredibly overrated example of songwriting? If so, why's it so popular anyway? What can we learn from it? I bet you already have opinions about it. Instead of asking you to absorb something new, form an opinion on it, and also write about that opinion, a known example only asks you to write about it. 

2. These discussions would be inviting even if you don't write songs. How many people love art but hate drawing? Wouldn't it be great if we had a discussion format that seemed to equally invite songwriters, song appreciators, and people who just wanted to learn about why other songs were good and bad? 

3. We could all learn from it and that reinforces the quality of the critiques that are currently this subreddit's bread and butter. We'd know each other and the songwriting craft better. 

Now all that optimism aside, I could see this turning into something very annoying too. 

* Saying ""Let's discuss this song"" doesn't take a lot of effort and might lead to floods of submissions, all of them lacking in community engagement. 
* People might use it as a way to just promote their stuff. 
* If a submitted song is too obscure or something like that, we suffer from the original problems that asking for critique on a work-in-progress suffers but I suppose those will just be weak submissions. 

But I think all those problems can be dealt with if we approach discussion submissions the right way, agree on a format for them guaranteeing a minimum amount of effort on the poster's part and then have mods enforce that format of minimum effort. (I'm thinking something like you have to title your submission |[Let'sDiscuss], then the performer name, then the title| and then the submission body should contain both a link to the song and the full lyrics.)

So who's excited about this? Anyone see any problems or opportunities I failed to address? How about the mods? 

*tl;dr Just check the submission title. All this long stuff is reasoning and specifics.*",,False,,t5_2qtpz,False,,,True,t3_sx3fz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/sx3fz/meta_what_if_we_made_a_thing_out_of_analyzing/,

Through trying to do my best with what little I have, I have found that my sound has actually been sculpted by my limitations. I have recorded a few things in studios and I actually prefer the sound of things recorded in my little bedroom! 

I have a stripped down drum-kit, hi-tom on its side as a kick drum, use a brush for the ride cymbal in my right hand, brush in my left for the cymbals. Also drape a dampening pad halfway over the snare, revealing a little of the skin to strike the snare. Sounds surprisingly good and has a really unique sound. I then record with an SM58 on the kick (hi-tom) and a cheap condenser at the back of the room. 

Vocals also recorded with the same condenser, picking up the room and every little sound made in the flat haha.

All of the recordings contain traffic noise, my house-mates pissing about, door-bells and whatnot. But I have found that all of these 'mistakes' add character to the sound and give it a strong sense of location.

I lost my fiance a few years ago and was having a very difficult time coming up with healthy ways to keep my mind off of things and be productive. As I started to develop a style of my own and discovered what I valued most in songwriting I started to realize that it was something I would like to do as more than just a vent. It quickly went from being a hobby I enjoyed in my free time to a passion and now something I want to put to music. I enjoy writing lyrical rap, I feel that rap allows me the most flexibility to express myself and just comes in so many different forms. It really is poetry in rhythmic motion for me. So, I'll post the lyrics here without much more talking.. I'd appreciate any criticism as I find sharing it them with friends and family just doesn't do me any good. Thanks so much for your time, and I'm more than willing to toss my own feedback on anything you may have written that you'd love to put under the ol' Reddit microscope. Cheers!

The day when you told me that you'd always be right there

You played me and you fooled me be because you never really cared

Cranial assassination, a bullet through the brain

Damn you to your own damnation, I'll never be the same


Pre chorus

(Slow acoustic)

Cause I don't know who either of us are anymore

I've searched wide and I've searched far

But I can't find the evidence

Chorus (Fast-paced punk)

Where did you go, how have you been

Where have I gone, I haven't been

And did you know that I don't know

What I'm doing

Verse 2 (Ska)

I beg and then I cheat and then I beg again some more

They're killers, I'm a sheep, I have to dress up like a wolf

I regain my footing to be knocked back down again

My legs, they flail, they kick and all cause your the one to blame


(Pre-chorus/chorus)

Sometimes I wish you the very worst and hope the best for me

Over My Head

Vs1

The moon beats down as her eyes shine up

She's all alone and she can't keep up

I'm missing the beat and grasping out of time

Just out of reach even though it's all mine


Pre-chorus

She's there

I'm here

She's everywhere

And nowhere near

I need control

I need it all

She needs a place

Where she can fall


Chorus

In the darkest day of the brightest night

She cannot stay and I cannot fight

Where do I look when it's over my head

Where does she go when everything's said


Vs2

Even though she's never seen home

Even though I'm running alone

I can't see where I'm supposed to go

The destination is you, but you're gone


(Pre-chorus)


(Chorus)


Chorus 2

I cannot run and I cannot fight

It's out of my hands and out of my sights

My mouth of cotton and hands of lead

Have sent me here, all left unsaid


Bridge

You were two steps away, we were a minefield apart

Never could say, you silenced my heart

In a couple of weeks, in a couple of days

I could've spoke my mind we'd be on our way

It's too late now can't take it back

The silence was worse than the worst I could've done

Started when I was 14. Been a musician for a decade now. I taught myself how to play a bunch of instruments, sing, write, and use multitrack recorders and recording software to multi-track myself. 

I fell in love with The Rolling Stones when I was young. Since then, I've also really been influenced by Queen, T.Rex, Pixies, Adam and the Ants, Prince, Chuck Berry, David Bowie, The Kinks, and many, many more. I loved music with an abandon; it was all I talked about, all I hoped for. My absolute dream.

I've made basically every single major life decision based upon music. Girlfriends, college (or not), jobs, living situations, budgets, my appearance - everything. The eggs are all in one basket, so to speak. Spent many thousands of dollars, thousands of hours, and worked my ass off to have gotten where I am. (Which isn't very far at all.)

For a while, I was pretty good. Tried a few bands - bands don't work out for me too well - made a professionally produced solo record. Everyone who heard it loved it - save for the record companies and managers. (laughs) I couldn't get anywhere if I tried. Even the indies won't give me the time of day. But I've got a peculiar Catch-22; I'm a solo artist...who needs a band to play live, in order to get exposure to attract a label. But - I can't hire a band with no money...so I can't play live to attract a label. :(

Thankfully, we have the Internet. ""You can do this yourself!"". But there's so many folks on there, many of whom are quite superior to me, that it's really difficult to stand out. Being good isn't good enough; you've got to be your own 24/7/365 PR machine. And I hate attention-whoring; even posting on YouTube, or doing this, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'd rather be working, and hoping that my work speaks for itself. Tweeting about what I'm wearing today is for crappy popstars. I am a songwriter; I write.

Currently I'm about to begin recording my second album. Just finished demoing all of the tracks in my bedroom. I have one more solo album written after this, and I'll get to that afterwards.

But I've got nothing else. No inspiration left. No muse. I used to play guitar in my garage for hours. I used to be so excited when I heard my favorite song. Now I couldn't care less. Everything precious is gone.

I have absolutely no clue how to restore it. Melodies used to flow from me so easily. I used to write pretty well. Now I couldn't to save my life. I've suffered with bi-polar disorder and major depression for most of my life, and I know that plays a part, too. I seem to find that most of us have suffered from similar things. It seems to be the artist's malady.

I know this is a lot of info from a stranger. But I'm at the end of my rope. I've lost the magic and I'm wondering if it was all just a teenage fantasy that I bought into. Perhaps rock and roll was just a way to prolong adulthood, and now I no longer can. Maybe time's caught up with me and I need to put away childish things. I don't even know.

Lyrics:
I've worked harder in the last week than I ever have
I've been spotted by at least 30 men
I fear spiders for what their webbing can do
I lost my spy glass, dropped it down into

All the world's consumed by broom
You have to let it go
Once they're done with me they'll turn on you
Oh don't you know?

My grandfather sunk like a stone in the bay
After it's thrown and skips 'cross the waves
A family marked by its inability
To follow a plan so ill-conceived



Words on paper are easy enough to ignite
The fragments afloat on the sky like starlight
And like your body: the fragile pith of a fist
Before it's thrown and catches alight.

Called nothing more than an eater for hire
With dead wings, a flake on the breath of the fire.

Would appreciate feedback while this is still raw, before the paint starts to dry.

### You and I

Can you breathe for me?  
Understand my dreams?  
Blow away my heartache and evaporate my fears?

Won't you take me in?  
Fold me in your wings?  
Quell my fevered mind and fly us out of here?

You and I are two birds in the wild  
Held together by a painted smile  
Darkness overcomes the men and women of the sea  
So I will wait for you right next to me

Why can't love be fair?  
Why don't you hurt equal share?  
How are you so calm when I'm so terrified?

Will you hold my hand  
As I sink into the sand?  
Soothe my naked beating heart with your cold eyes?

Cause you and I are hopelessly entwined  
Held together by a softlit watercolor smile  
You were never gonna leave the simple life behind  
Still I will wait for you beside the fire

    while you were gone, I made some changes 
    cleaned out the kitchen and vacuumed the floor 
    moved some of your shit to a different position 
    to give me some options of blocking your vision once more
    
    while I’m out of work, I have nothing to pay for 
    traded excess for more time to myself 
    traded my sanity, silence starts nagging me 
    the windows fog up, humming gives me a moment of clarity
    
    the key is under the mat 
    just open the door 
    and picture me like you thought of me before
    
    though I’m out of work, I’ve minimized expenses 
    left most of my bills for someone else to ignore 
    I’ve given away all my thoughts and possessions, no wonder people suspected depression 
    you know me. untie me and feed me and clothe me and hold me and beat me 
    the stitches were left from before
    
    the key is under the mat 
    just open the door 
    and picture me like you thought of me before 
    breathe deep in the fog, find the dresser’s top drawer 
    pull out your old bottle, let me drink just once more

I like lying down here,
where I don't have to fight,
but the fire that we burn
doesn't shed any light
so don't leave me in the dark,
lest I lose my way,
and wind up far from here
with the breaking of day

She's got time on her hands, time that I need to find someway to get back part of.
And I just don't understand, my heart's just not in this plan it's not my way.

I don't care what your decision is
but I really wish you'd make it,
'cause I know what you want
and I don't want to fake it.
But it's getting harder as days go by
for me just to take it
and I'm sorry if it's wrong,
but I can't wait anymore.

She's got time on her hands, time that I need to find someway to get back part of.
And I just don't understand, I got no time for this and I'm running from the start again.
She's got time on her hands, time that I need to find someway to get back part of.

I figure it can't be terrible or I wouldn't have been able to get a Grammy winner to produce my record.  I'm not asking for a lot of money for appearances - I'm happy to play for a sandwich at first, and then money later if all goes well.

Sunrise lovers
Midnight death
Tear up the words, the pieces
Send em to rest

Life goes on
At times fast, at times slow
Wouldn't you love to know the answer, girl?
Wouldn't you already know?

Great friends make great lovers
But can never end as so
What road to take after this one?
Shouldn't I know?

It goes nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere slow
Just a stew of emotion
Boiling what you think and what you know

Well, here's your love song.

Have you ever, ever, ever 
think bout who you are when I'm around?
Did your soul ever emanate the slightest hint of a frown?

Did you ever, ever, ever
think about who I am?
Detour on the road? Gasp of fresh air?
Or a sexy helping hand?

We'll, I guess this is your love song.

Is there a subreddit for posting lyrics that musicians may want to take and write some music around? If not, would it get any support? I used to like giving my musician friends lyrics to see what they'd do with them... and some of the musicians were happy to have the lines as a challenge, or just bc they weren't writers and wanted copy.

I started to purge today on ""paper"" about how happy I was to be done with 150 phone calls for my company and the purge started to sound like lyrics with a little rap break in the middle, thus the question.

I have wandered in the courtyard master of disguise
Cloak and dagger out to capture the elusive prize
Had my game-plans and my passwords all to no avail
But as long as I keep going I won't say I've failed

Cos all in all the light's still shining so let's go on
All in all if we're not dying something must be wrong

Crossed the desert cold and nervous on a moonless night
To see if I could catch a glimpse of what you're really like
But when I got there I was so scared I stood at the back
Making out that it was too weird and I could never go for that

But all in all ....

I have seen them causing trouble just because they can
Little games of dark deceit and twisted sleights of hand

But all in all

Sometimes here it gets so quiet I become disturbed
I need someone to have some fun with or just a quiet word
I have witnessed in the wreckage crazy minds on show
Watched them creeping seeking refuge before they have to go

Please let me know what you think, download for free if you like, share if you like, I'd love any feedback! I'm new to sharing music on reddit so I'm really excited to see what comes of this. This song is about extreme anxiety and depression I struggled with this summer and fall. 

Lyrics:
There are green leaves stuck between my teeth.
I'm too afraid to part my lips, to send the ships, to speak.
One more day turns into five, to six, a week.
These flushed cheeks have shriveled dry,
two lumping heaps of dead leaves piled high. 

Woah (Woah)

There are rubber bands stretched across my chafing hands.
I want to care, to reach, to tear,
but they're always gonna be there.
Telling me, telling you that I'm busy when I'm not. 
Wishing away another day,
wasteful distasteful hate.

I'm a mod over at /r/gameofbands - a themed songwriting contest with randomly chosen band members each round.  We've had a lot of fun and made some [really](http://soundcloud.com/plingus/until-the-days-are-done) [great](http://soundcloud.com/needanameok/team-10-the-ex) [songs](http://soundcloud.com/memefilter/what-is-love), and I encourage anyone who likes a challenge to join up.  

This is not why I'm posting though.

This round's theme is ""holidays"", /r/songwars has chosen it as their theme too, and all of us (generally speaking) are planning on ""releasing"" a Reddit ""holiday album"".  THAT is what I want you to get involved with.

(If all goes as planned) [radioreddit](http://radioreddit.com/) will host a dedicated ""holiday music"" stream, and all the holiday songs generated by Reddit musicians [can and should be uploaded there](http://radioreddit.com/uploading).  The ""album"" will probably be a ""pay what you want"" package on bandcamp or similar - **they're free** but (in theory) you'll be able to donate if you want to, and you can DL single songs or the whole package.  There may be some voting process to hone down the material to an ""album's length"" (overall upvotes are a very Reddit-y way of sorting the best tunes), but that's only speculation at this point, and your ideas are welcome.  

You still own your tunes, you retain all rights.  No hidden agenda.

So, if anyone here is thinking about writing a ""holiday"" song, please submit it to /r/holidaysongs so we can include it.  Post any related questions there too.  There are no other topical restrictions (profanity/blasphemy/etc) so write about whatever you want (in the ""holiday"" spirit, of course).  Parody songs are fine too.

.

The clear clean country air begins to cool outside

And the horses don't have anywhere to hide

In their pastures, they remain fenced in

Their little patch of world - A wide green cubicle for them

They stand there idly, munching on their grass

Without a worry or concern because what's past is in the past

I can see them standing there and my lips begin to curl

'Cause my future's making way and independance will unfurl

.

And past the horses, there's a hill covered with mud

And in the mud, the pigs are rolling all around

In a couple weeks, they'll find their luck's run out

As the end draws near, moving quick without a sound

They didn't come here to be happy, they were brought here to be meat

That's all their fate beholds, all they can ever hope to be

But me, my future will be so much better than that lot

Just splitting pathways up ahead - The final choice is all I've got
 
.

You can't tell me I'm not destined for some greatness

With the obstacles I've pushed through in my path

You can't hurt me with your pathetic little insults

I'll make history unfold, meanwhile blank will be your epitaph

.

And there in the beehive, the queen bee gives her orders

And the mindless drones work on, creating hexagons in there

And the buzzing sounds they're making are an effort just to please her

But the winter's getting nearer and they know it's not so fair

Nature's fury soon will knock their precious kingdom down to rubble

It's a shame they couldn't have a better chance to make their mark

Their stingers will be useless when they're gone and dead, forgotten

But my apirations blossom - Life is just about to start

The Homeless Prayer




As you think of feeding the birds in the sky

Lord, look down on me – for I'm in need

I'm hungry, cold and in a situation

All your servants pass me by

And can't even look me in the eye





Small kindnesses are big in heaven

Remember them when they appear

This sign I hold now is my voice

So pass me now or make a choice.





Tell me are they not commanded

To help the poor and open handed

All your servants pass me by

And can't even look me in the eye.





I'm using bigger letters now

And hope my spellings right

In hopes my sign is in their sights

My clothes are worn

I wear them tattered

My hollow eyes – my soul is shattered



Small kindnesses are big in heaven

Remember them when they appear

This sign I hold now is my voice

So pass me now or make a choice.





Tell me are they not commanded

To help the poor and open handed

All your servants pass me by

And can't even look me in the eye.






What brought me to this circumstance?

A series of misfortunes where there is no more advance

Don't judge me now – for it is written

The Lord will judge those who have given

I close this prayer with just one thought

Thank you in advance, what your servants brought.

Hay, Sweat and Horses





Her farm was just a little one

But so much work had to be done

Hot summer days

You could always tell

There was always that familiar smell





Hay, sweat and horses

Hay, sweat and horses

Hay, sweat and horses





Honey do you know what I mean

That scent, that lingers in the air

But darlin' you don't seem to care





Went down to the flower store

And bought some flowers just for her

Their smell would certainly overcome

Anything them critters done





Hay, sweat and horses

Hay, sweat and horses

Hay, sweat and horses





Sweat drippin' like a waterfall

Pitchin hay left in the stall

Thinkin' of some cold sweet tea

I knew that she'd soon bring to me

All I want now is a bath

And just a short way down the path

I wonder what she's gonna say

About the smell from me today

I asked her, this is what she said.

“Hay sweat and horses, it all smells like roses to me.”

“Hay sweat and horses, it all smells like roses to me.”

Having some mixed feelings about my band wanting to replace me on lead vocals and thought I'd ask some non-singing songwriters on reddit about their experiences taking the backseat on lead vocals in their act(s). 

I'm not a horrible singer and can sing ""ok"" on recordings, but can't quite hack the material live as consistent as I'd like. I've recently signed up for some vocal lessons to improve my vocals, but it's become quite a heated topic with my bandmates and they feel I'm being selfish by continuing to ""anchor"" the band. 

Although I am open to having these songs performed the best they can by a new singer, I still feel a sense of hesitancy relinquishing lead vocals as I still believe I have the potential to improve and front the band.

Over the course of this summer, I feel like I've been running low on inspiration for pretty much all aspects of the music I usually write -- guitar parts, lyrics, vocal parts. Lyric wise, it seems as if I've only ever been immensely creative when it comes to dealing with something I'm unhappy about, but nowadays I feel like I'm content with the quality of my life (except for my lack of songwriting -- vicious cycle!) Instrumentally, I feel like I'm wearing out the same chord progressions and licks over and over again. What do you guys do to spark up new inspiration?

The chance was to great for me not to take
A risk to high that it would not wait so I
Packed up, walked out the door
To avoid your face, I stared at the floor

In time to hear you say...""*


The imagery of that part, I see as a lady with her bag in hand, hat on her head, having just kissed her man a tearful but resolved goodbye, walks out the front door and hears the screen door slam which makes her turn back around to see his face, she pauses just long enough to hear him say one more thing that she didn't want to hear, thus the chorus begins.

Moving Mountains  

    She was waking weary
    a product of unfamiliar surroundings
    a dream-like arousing of fantasy
    and where she wanted to be.  
  
  
    She thinks, ""I'm drifting upward
    the breeze here is better.
    My only grounding's
    my ankle-tied tether""
    and she's dancing alone
    above the weather.  

    and whether she wants this or not.  
  
    she crafted scissors
    from two ice skate blades
    she found in her winter closet
    and promptly cut.  her.  ties.  
  
    her head was inflating
    with thoughts that kept racing
    amazing herself
    by never looking down  
  
    ""I'm drifting higher
    the view here is better!
    oh the things that I've seen
    with just the snip of a tether
    and I'm dancing alone
    above the weather  
  
    and I'm not regretting a thing.""  
  
    From way up here
    moving mountains
    is effortless  
  
    I'm never coming down.

She's got my son in tow with this big ol' ears

And a goofy grin and there's no sign he knows where he's been

You and I can't forget so there's no regret about him



He'll be alright, he's rather smart you say

He's learned to add and to stay away

He says ""Dad, its good to see doing ok""

that was the last time I'd seen my son in that way



I stare into the stove and I stir up the pot

The beans are boiling its all I've got

There's a knock on the door but its hard to be open to that. 

I wish there was more but there's no sense ignoring the facts

Oh he lives in a cabin,
Deep in the woods and up on Watch Hill,
A creature of habit,
He never has one payed a bill,
Uncle sam, oh sam he is happy still

Two sunken eyeballs,
A beard that falls with the wind,
Hair as ragged as the garden,
To which his wife used to tend,
For a decade his wife has been dead
But he talks to her right before bed

Mr Wood this is all in your head
Take a pill then go back to bed

Two droopy eyeballs, 
El Gato, does possess,
El gato has lived on watch hill 
Since nineteen ten
How is el gato not dead
He is yet however he lives

Teeth like an addict,
Neck like hes taking a nod,
The farmer's a man of his word, 
But not of god,
Arms the size of cape cod,
Is he a human or god

Mr. Wood this is all in your head
Have a drink then go back to bed

Liver of an elder,
His son is of whiskey and gin,
Not a penny to claim, nor a job
What a disgraceful kin,
He collects in an old rusty tin.
He longs to be loved again

Face so sullen,
Mr Wood lives without sound,
He longs to free his soul 
From the way it is bound.
With a shot his body hits the ground
The news quickly spreads through the town

Old Farmer Wood is dead,
Having listened to the voices in his head.

Ears so droopy,
El perro waits by the door.
Waits for the farmer,
To come back from the old store,
But Wood has ended his wAr,
Wood wont come back no more.

Arms outstreched,
Father stands over the corpse,
After prayer and farewells,
He gets back on top of his horse
God dont feel no remorse,
But the son does of course.",,False,,t5_2qtpz,False,,,True,t3_1kebrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/1kebrj/too_simple_help/,

What is your guys' philosophy on tracklisting? 

For example, do you like a ""soft song, loud song, soft song, loud song"" approach? Do you try to start strong or finish strong? What do you like a closing song/opening song to sound like? Do you have any particular formula? What are some examples of well put together tracklists?
