1367260951.0,123,self.beertrade,1dcr93,Grouptrade! Springtime Beer It Forward: Sign up now!,mrblack08,129,6,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1dcr93/grouptrade_springtime_beer_it_forward_sign_up_now/,"And we're back! After a successful first round earlier this year, it's time for a springtime BIF!

**How It Works**

For the uninitiated, a BIF is where everyone is assigned a person to ship to but you don't know who is shipping to you until you receive your box. I will make it so the person you are sending to is in another region so you can send them exciting beers they can't get there. It will be a shotgun start, so everyone will send at the same time. Or atleast before the deadline. I will have to collect your addresses, I promise to delete them once this is completed. 

**How to Join**

Step 1: Upvote this post! The more it is seen, the more people will join. And a comment too for good measure, so everyone can see who is getting in on it.

Step 2: Fill out this form! [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PbUzo5ippgxf5E6HDAfzwM2D2dgD5gFHt3tZ6lDF1Ss/viewform)

Step 3: Wait for me to assign you a shippee

Step 4: Ship Beer, all of it!

Step 5: DRINK BEER. (And post in the hauls thread, I'll remind you via email)

**What's Included**

There is a **minimum 72 oz requirement**. (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, 3 bombers and a 12oz, a growler and a 12 oz., or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.) You can ship more, but don't ship less. This is a public trade at the end and we will all know what you sent. Don't be a dick. Plain and simple.

Theme for this trade is seasonals! Specifically spring/summer seasonals as the weather is getting warmer. IPAs, Bocks, Wheats and all the like. Try to get as many seasonal brews that your shippee normally couldn't get into your box as possible - but if you come up sort, general locals will work just fine as well as those more rare and sought after beers. Not much sense in getting a box of beer that you could just go buy off the shelf.

**Requirements**

You must have an account atleast **3 months old**, and at least **2 completed trades** in /r/beertrade. This is to ensure people feel comfortable shipping. 

This is like any other /r/beertrade trade and it will get reported to the mods. So if you fail to send or don't fulfill the beer requirement, you will be marked. 

**Deadlines**

Sign-Up Deadline: 5/8

Receive Assignments by: 5/13

Ship Between: 5/15-5/22 (If you have to ship earlier you can, it would just be better if everyone didn't get their box until they themselves have shipped so if you can ship during that week it would be best - 5/22 is the absolute deadline)

This gives you a couple weeks to find beer and ship it.

**Notes &amp; Helpful Things**

Do not ship via USPS - it's illegal and can get you fined.

Pack Well! If a bottle breaks in transit - you are responsible to replace it if it means you're shippee is going to receive less than 72 oz. (Sidebar for shipping tips)

Send extras! Glassware, shirts, coasters, homebrew, &amp; whatnot are highly encouraged. (**DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as part of the 72 oz requirement, it can only be included as a bonus)

Use Seekabrew.com to ensure the beer you're send is not found in your shippee's state! Don't send them something they could just pull off the shelf at the local liquor store. (Exception for ""rare"" beers that are hard to get)

I will send updates via email about deadlines as well as when the haul thread goes live.

I will update this page once the sign-ups are closed with a list of all who are involved.

Sign-ups!,mrblack08,109,6,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/16rffh/group_trade_beer_it_forward_signups/,"I've always wanted to curate a **BIF (beer it forward)** for /r/beertrade. I finally got the time and so I've ran it past the mods and we are all set for what I believe is reddit's first (or atleast in a long time) BIF! 

(u/SatansLH did a BotM club and it was hugely successful http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/gyqav/group_trade_beer_of_the_month_club_5_signups/)

**How It Works**

For the uninitiated, a BIF is where everyone is assigned a person to ship to but you don't know who is shipping to you until you receive your box.

**How to Join**

Step 1: Upvote this post! The more it is seen, the more people will join. And a comment too for good measure, so everyone can see who is getting in on it.

Step 2: Email me @ kyleblack08+reddit [at] gmail.com with the following info:

Name

Address

Reddit Username

(optional) Link to Wants/Got (Check the sidebar) + Untapped Username + Ratebeer Username + Beer Advocate Username + Any other info that might give your shipper insight to beers you like / want / have already had

(optional) Favorite beer styles, Least favorite beer styles, any other pertinent information you want your shipper to know about you.

Step 3: Wait for me to assign you a shippee

Step 4: Ship Beer

Step 5: DRINK BEER. (And post in the hauls thread, I'll remind you via email)

**What's Included**

You can ship more, but don't ship less. This is a public trade at the end and we will all know what you sent.

Ship only beer you think the shippee wants or can not get. (Don't be a jerk) Super local brews that are less known are great, as they don't have big distributions. I will do my absolute best to match people who are in far off different regions. I recommend trading beers that people wouldn't normally try to trade for. But hell if you want to send a bunch of Heady Topper, Pliney, and Hill Farmstead to your shippee be my guest. 

There's no exact theme for this trade, just be considerate in your selection. (Find out what they like!) If this is successful in the future there will be themes.

**Requirements**

You must have an account atleast **3 months old**, and at least **one completed trade** in /r/beertrade or substantial proof that you trade over at BA or someplace else. This is to ensure people feel comfortable shipping. In the future I might drop the one completed trade rule, but I want to make sure the first BIF goes off without a hitch.

This is like any other /r/beertrade trade and it will get reported to the mods. So if you fail to send or don't fulfill the beer requirement, you will be marked. 

**Deadlines**

Sign-Up Deadline: 1/25

Receive Assignments by: 1/27

Ship Between: 2/4-2/8 (If you have to ship earlier you can, it would just be better if everyone didn't get their box until they themselves have shipped so if you can ship during that week it would be best - 2/8 is the absolute deadline)

This gives you a couple weeks to find beer and ship it.

I will send updates via email about deadlines as well as when the haul thread goes live.

I will update this page once the sign-ups are closed with a list of all who are involved.

He has failed to complete a trade with /u/juliusseizure. After juliusseizure sent his box, Bearded_Infamy ended all contact. This trade was arranged via the Unwanted Narwhals BIF, where the two traders actually were placed in a two person group.

He will be banned from /r/beertrade. As always, the ban is reversible if the situation is rectified, and it is made clear that the user understands the issue.  Bearded_Infamy will be reported to /r/badkarma, which I encourage everyone to use and check. 

I also encourage everyone to exercise caution in trading. If something about a trade doesn't feel right to you, it's probably best to move on. A quick cell phone picture exchange is a good way to eliminate most scammers, and it's never rude to ask a new trader to ship first or check on trade references.

He has failed to complete a trade with /u/soup_or_crackers and is no longer responding to messages.  soup_or_crackers sent his box, and it was confirmed received by T0b3 about three weeks ago.  The timing of his last activity on reddit suggests that he has ignored messages from soup_or_crackers, so it's unlikely that there is some sort of issue keeping him away from the computer.

He will be banned from /r/beertrade. As always, the ban is reversible if the wronged parties are satisfied and it is made clear that the user understands the issue.

T0b3 will also be reported to /r/badkarma, which I encourage everyone to use and check (not much about /r/beertrade on there, fortunately).  I also encourage everyone to exercise caution in trading.

Just wanted to throw this out there now, but it's always good advice.  Beer trading is a largely trust-based system.  Beer traders are among the most generous people I've met, but occasionally people will try to take advantage of such generosity.

Please make sure to exercise caution when trading.  It's reasonable to expect a new trader to ship first, to ask for trading references, or even ask for a photo of the beer your trading partner is to send.  Only trade with people who you are comfortable with. If you don't feel like you trust someone, do not trade with them.  There are more safe trading tips in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/12cgsz/how_can_we_improve_and_minimize_the_risk_of_the/) thread, as well.

And, of course, thanks to those who help alert the community of scams.

Cheers, and happy (and safe) trading!

I know it's only been a short while since the last one set up by u/mrblack08 but I feel it's the perfect season to constantly have new beers to try in the fridge. I'm just going to go ahead and copypasta the last set of rules/regulations since it seemed to work well.

For the uninitiated, a BIF is where everyone is assigned a person to ship to but you don't know who is shipping to you until you receive your box.

He has failed to complete a trade with /u/poetryandbeer, has not responded to my messages and promised to poetryandbeer that he would ship his box without appearing to do so.  He did not confirm receipt of poetryandbeer's package, but he did post on reddit after both tracking info shows it arriving (on 3/21) and poetryandbeer messaged him for confirmation.

He will be banned from /r/beertrade. As always, the ban is reversible if the situation is rectified, and it is made clear that the user understands the issue.  gatorbait22 will be reported to /r/badkarma, which I encourage everyone to use and check. 

I also encourage everyone to exercise caution in trading. If something about a trade doesn't feel right to you, it's probably best to move on. A quick cell phone picture exchange is a good way to eliminate most scammers, and it's never rude to ask a new trader to ship first or check on trade references.  There are more suggestions in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/12cgsz/how_can_we_improve_and_minimize_the_risk_of_the/).

Unfortunately I feel it is time to bring up a sensitive subject: PROFITEERING. 

We are a small somewhat closeknit group - we fled BA to find better quarters. But in the past few months I have watched site turn into another place to try to exact the maximum amount of value out of your overhyped beer, and it's time to call this trend out. 

Sure I am going to be hated for this, but it needs to be said. Beer trading has never been about exacting maximum value from your beer. Sure you have a rare beer, trade it for another rare beer - that's what trading is all about. This idea that a widely distributed beer, albeit limited release, is worth ridiculous amounts of trade vale is crazy.  Sure, you could only buy 2 bottles, but everyone in 15 states can. It's a huge, but spread out release. It is not worth $80, no matter what the hype is. Hype does not determine value as much as some would like it to. This site is not meant to be an alternative place to trade your hyped beer.

Votes in Reddit are in place in order to make sure quality content gets to the top and to the reader. I don't feel that this subreddit really gets enough posts to warrant this feature. 

For instance, a new poster just got downvoted to oblivion before some others showed up and righted the ship. If we want this community to grow, we can't run off fresh blood. It's ridiculous. Upvote the posts that deserve it, leave the others at eternal ""1s"" and it will serve the same function.

Downvotes only serve to deter individuals. When I first started posting here I made all kinda of ISO that I didn't know were well out of my realm. It made me feel like I was too stupid to be in this subreddit. I started doing my research and started finally putting together good trades. 17 trades later I'm still learning trade values. 

r/beertrade is supposed to be the antipathy to Beer Advocate. We are not supposed to be the snobby ones. When some anonymous assholes downvotes every trade from newbies to veterans, it comes across that way. 

I know this subject has been brought up an I anticipate the old ""spirit of Reddit"" arguments, but the ""leave a reason for your downvote"" just isn't working. We need something different and I believe it is getting rid of downvoting all together.

I know it's been a good number of days (37, to be exact) since the last reputation list update, and for that I apologize.  We have been receiving an unprecedented amount of trade reports over the last three months (which is great!).  However, that means that we have that many more messages to sort through, which ends up taking some time.  Needless to say, we fell behind this last month, and the update got kind of out of hand.  We'll be making an effort to update the list more regularly, since we now know the pain of waiting over a month to do so.

This latest update includes 412 trades completed over the last month, plus a few days.  Anything reported before May 5, 2013 at 2:58AM (Pacific time) should be reflected in the latest update.  Flair has also been updated.  As always, if we've made mistakes, [shoot us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade).

As some of you know, reputation list updates usually happen about once every two weeks or so.  We let the trade reports build up and record them all at once, which helps us save a little bit of work in the long run.  I got a bit busy at the beginning of last week, when there should have been an update, so I apologize for the delay.  That being said, I've just completed another large reputation list update (214 new trades).  If you reported a trade in the last three weeks or so, you should have received a message from either /u/tukey or myself.  If you didn't, or if there's an error on the reputation list, please let us know via [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade).

We've had quite a bit of growth in this community's size lately, so we decided to bring on a new moderator.  /u/tukey is a long-time contributor to this trading community, and he'll be helping us out with maintaining the reputation list, answering modmail, and generally keeping /r/beertrade a fun, safe, and trustworthy community.

Hi all!

I've been involved with this community for a while now and I've been blown away by the generosity of many of the traders on here (big thanks to everyone I've traded with!).  In light of this, I thought that /r/beertrade might enjoy this type of ""trade"" that's somewhat popular on Beer Advocate.  If you're unfamiliar, a Lottery-It-Forward (LIF) involves one sender somehow (possibly randomly) choosing someone to receive beer.  The receiver then starts their own LIF sometime after that, and the chain continues.  Anyway, I'm hoping that this could be some sort of a recurring event here and I'd like to take the first step to see if that's the case.

I visited Russian River last evening during the NFC championship game (condolences to Niner fans) and picked up **Pliny, Blind Pig, Supplication, and Damnation**.  Whoever ends up winning this LIF will receive these bottles.  Before you jump on this, I'd just like to lay down a few rules that hopefully won't cause a problem for most of you.

* If you win, please hold your own LIF sometime in the near future with some of your favorite beer.  This sort of trade can't succeed in the long run if you don't abide by the ""forward"" part of the title!

* I can only ship to the contiguous United States.  Apologies to Alaskan, Hawaiian, and international traders.

* You must have an active reddit account over 3 months old, or be listed on the reputation list in the sidebar.  Sorry to any new members, but this will give me some reassurance that the LIF has a reasonable chance to continue.

Hope that didn't lose too many of you; here's how I'll be deciding who to ship to.  PM me a positive integer (1 or greater).  **Don't post your number as a reply to this post, and only send me one number!**  The winner will be the person who sends me the lowest unique number.  For example, if I receive the numbers {1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 7} from eight total people, the winner would be the person who sent me ""4"".  Easy enough, right?  I'll leave this open for a few days so hopefully anyone who would want to participate has a chance to do so.  I'll update this post when it's over and notify the winner.  Hope this LIF is something you guys are interested in, and if so, I'd love to see it continue!

**TL/DR: PM me a positive integer to possibly win Russian River beer.** 

**Update:** Thanks to those who have PMed me their guesses!  I'm thinking that I'll leave this open until midnight (Pacific time) on January 26 so that people will have had 48 hours to participate.  I'll post the winner here at that time along with whatever information about the contest results anyone may be interested in.

**Update 2:** Alright everyone, this LIF is complete.  We had 71 people participate, and **the lowest unique number was 2**, chosen by **acrocanthosaurus**!  Congratulations to him, and I hope to see another one of these pop up sometime in the future.

In light of recent events, several important aspects of beer trading should be reiterated.  Beer trading, here and on other forums, is primarily based on trust.  The following have been mentioned in the past, but are important for us to remember in order for our beer trading community to be sustainable and for traders to successfully complete trades worry-free.

1. **Don't be shy to ask for references from potential trading partners.** As opposed to other trading forums, we do not have user profiles where we can individually list former trading partners.  If you don't feel like you trust someone, don't trade with them.  **If you are not comfortable with asking your trading partner for references, you may message the moderators.  We will be more than happy to provide a list of former trading partners upon request.**

2. **If you are a new trader, be prepared to ship before your trading partner.**  This is common practice in beer trading communities and helps to prevent scammers from creating multiple accounts to cheat honest traders out of beer.

3. **You are responsible for the package that you ship until the package is in the hands of your trading partner.**  If your package does not reach its destination safely, you are responsible for replacing it.

4. **If you encounter any problems in a trade, don't hesitate to contact the moderators.**  The sooner we know about an issue, the easier it is to resolve in general.

While I've been a subscriber here, we haven't had an open forum for suggestions to improve our community.  So, **if any ideas for improvement come to mind, feel free to post them in the comments**.  As always, you are welcome to message the moderators with any ideas as well.

Finally, thanks to everyone who has positively contributed to this subreddit to make it the successful beer trading community it is now.  Trading allows beer enthusiasts from around the world to share beer they love with others who otherwise wouldn't be able to obtain it.  So, thank you to all of you generous [/r/beertrade](/r/beertrade) members for making this such a fantastic community.

Cheers,

statball

I know that BA and some other forums do this...but it's not very interactive and requires you to do a lot of work. I want some feedback though.
I've got a ""want"" or wish list, where you can pick from a user generated database the beer you want. I travel a lot and enjoy the different beers from different regions and often find others who would like the beers I have in my fridge and vice versa.


There is a ""fridge"" where you can upload the beers you have for trade. Your fridge can be browsed and trades can be offered.


There will also be a system that will automatically match your wish list with another persons fridge in the event you should both have something each other wants.
You can follow each other, rate trades on a scale, review beers and leave feedback on users you've dealt with in the past.


There are a ton of other features that will be involved, but those are the basics, wondering if you guys have seen anything like it or have any input as to what you would like to see from something like this.
Thanks for your time.


Edit: its a selfpost so I'd appreciate it if you upvoted for visibility, remember, I gain no karma here, just want some feedback

edit 2: This will be completely unique to whats already available.  expressobeans and cellarhq along with BA and the other ""forums"" have the fight idea, just poor execution.  A quick visit to any of these sites will show that its not as easy as adding what you want, showing what you have and letting a system make you matches.  

Also, the search functions were mentioned, they aren't very specific, anytime a search is vague you run into problems, its just pointless.

Edit3:  downvoting my comments (oldstylecubsfan) that answer your questions with the correct answer is sort of immature, regardless some questions are valid.

Let me answer this:  is it illegal?  No it's not.  If you can't understand it, do your research, I have.

Negotiations:  of course you can negotiate trades, nothing here will be straight up unless you want it to be, this is giving you EASIER access to some bodies fridge/cellar and will automatically update you inventory as trades occur.  We will make matches based on your wants.  Give you notifications if you have something when that somebody wants something you want, pairing.  If they don't match in value, you negotiate.  

You'll also have access to ratings that show you value based on a number of things so you can make a smart trade if you're new to this.  Also trades can be private or public and you can leave them open for friends and followers to rate from good to bad.  


Edit4:  Just to touch base on what is already out there.  Most of what you see is forum based, and BA seems a bit difficult to navigate and understand if you are a novice to the site.  Theres nothing simple and easy to understand about it and its definitely not straight forward with its trading.  Its a site for rating beer that has a forum. 

Anything Forum based has the same inherent problem, if nobody takes interest and keeps it on the top, it get lost and you may never see a response.  Just because the request is old doesn't make you want the beer any less.

CellarHQ: started with the right idea, poor execution.  Try searching for a beer and its only matching keywords...Hopslam for instance game me everything from Abita-Unibroue with over 30 different results.  What you want to see is who has Hopslam in their fridge and is willing to trade.  You may want to narrow is down by distance to make shipping cheaper, or maybe its a short drive.  These things all matter and have been ignored.  We address all of these issues.  

The main question we really have to address is: Do we make it a mobile site with the regular site or do an app. 
When doing an app you have to hope people run updates (I rarely do), apps have capabilities that are cool but require more time and effort to cross platforms whereas mobile sites work on almost any.  It would be cool to be able to have label recognition (which would be difficult) but (most) all beers have UPC codes that could easily be scanned to add to your collection or do a quick search.

1303938889.0,29,self.beertrade,gyqav,Group Trade:  Beer of the Month Club #5 - Sign-Ups start today,SatansLH,31,2,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/gyqav/group_trade_beer_of_the_month_club_5_signups/,"It’s that time again boys and girls.  My semester is coming to a close and I figure what better way to celebrate than to do a Beer oft Month Club.  If you're looking for your first trade to get your feet wet this is a great way to do it and to meet some of your fellow r/beertrade members. This isn't about trading white whales or super rarities; it's about trading good local beer with others. So if you're intimidated by the trades that you see happening and never have the stuff people are looking for that's ok. Our main goal here is to trade some craft beer local to you that you think is worth supporting. We don't care what it's BA rank is, we only care that it's craft beer and that it's local to you. 

**DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.
There are over 1600 microbreweries across the country; you probably live near one that a lot of us never hear about. Those are the kinds of beers we trade here. We have people that cover all corners of the country and this will be your chance to trade with one of them at random.
How it Works
What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

•	Step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your essential information.

•	Step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with. So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

•	Step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, what your interested in, what you're not, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing. It's meant to open up a dialogue.

•	Step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone. It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

•	Step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

•	Step 6: Drink beer.

**What's involved**


We trade at least 72 oz. of beer (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, 3 bombers and a 12oz, a growler and a 12 oz., or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.)
Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you. You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates. If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it. If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.
I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time. Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute. If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day. I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping. 

**Theme**

This theme suggestion comes from familynight.  In honor of my semester coming to a close I think celebratory beers are in order.  This doesn’t mean white whales or beers you’ve been cellaring for 5 years.  More like when something awesome happens what beer comes home from the store that you want to celebrate with (as long as it isn't PBR)

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up have an active account at least 3 months old. This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.
If you have read the above and are still on board, awesome here's what you need to do. Send me a PM with the following information by May 4th.

•	Your handle (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

•	Your City and State (This is all I want, so I know where to assign your region. I am not collecting addresses.)

•	Your e-mail (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:

SatansLH

Woodway, TX

SatansLH@gmail.com 

**Note:** New Rule Something we are enforcing this time around to help protect members is the Ship First Rule. For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first. The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end. This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you, as I will do my best to assign you with an experienced trader. If you and your partner both have trade reputation then fire at will. I will inform you upon partner assignments of you or your partner’s probationary status.

**IMPORTANT DATES**

•	May 2nd, 2011 the last day for sign-ups

•	By May 4th, 2011 you will have partners assigned, probably earlier

•	May 19th, 2011 the ship by date. This is the absolute last day you should be shipping.

That gives you 2 weekends to procure beer, pack, and ship. That is more than enough time and gives a big of window for our probationary members to ship by. It is your responsibility to get your package on it's way in time.
Packing and Shipping Guidelines
Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the [2] [Trading and Packaging Tips Section](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)
The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, bottle openers, coasters, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.
If you're unsure of what to send, use [3] [this list](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ap6d1DIcENXqdHgwd3ZNeTJBellDWFpuQTRKR0FiekE&amp;hl=en#gid=1) to see if the beer you are sending is distributed in your partner’s area.

Since Heady is unfiltered, a lot of the yeast comes through which can be cultivated and then used to ferment a cloned recipe. My trade offer is this: 

4x Heady (more the better)

FOR

6 pack of homebrew heady when its finished.

To sweeten the deal, I also want to do an upfront actual beer trade for any of the following craft brews:

* FFF Alpha King 
* FFF Zombie Dust (3x 12oz)
* FFF Dreadnaught (1x bomber)
* Deschutes Red Chair NWPA

If none of those are worthy enough, here's my cellar list: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B64Dyq_pRRpmYXNPTnZWbXd2R1k/edit?usp=sharing

I hope someone would be willing to trade for this, as it isn't the typical trade we see around here. And no, you won't go blind from drinking homebrew.

In person I gave him a Vuja De and some fresh Pliny. His end of the trade was some founders goodies and KBS once it released 2 weeks later.

We were in periodic contact via email before and after the KBS release He claimed shipping was delayed on his end due to some extenuating circumstances which I can understand at this point, these things happen, shoot it's happened to me. Jump forward two months and I never get a box or tracking number. I email him again and I get a run around saying it was sent and he's looking for a tracking number. Still no box and no tracking number. I end up moving across the country and give him my new address in the ridiculous hope he will finally ship on his end. He promised to ship again since he couldn't find any record of shipping the first box and then stopped communicating altogether. 

So here we are a year from the original trade and I still have no box or tracking number. I'd let it go and chalk it up to table stakes for beer trading if he wasn't so involved in his local beer culture. It's not even a big trade I feel like this person just cant be bothered to care. If the package did ship I would at least have expected a tracking number somewhere along the line but I was never given one over the course of what must have been 20+ emails. 

I know this is a boring clusterfuck of a story but your advice is appreciated. 



tl;dr: Got fucked over by fronting beer in person to a popular beer blogger. Should I give out his blog and info?

Edit: Posted on r/beer too. I'm going to give him a chance to contact me and explain what happened/ship. I will follow up with his response. It was last left that I would be happy with ANY beer he shipped as long as I receive something from him. 

Edit 2: So I emailed him a recap of events as I saw them and asked him for an explanation. I told him I've given up on getting beer from him but if he convinces me this wasn't malicious I will drop it if not I will post his blog here. I don't want to ruin a reputation for what may have been a horrible chain of events. I Will follow up when I hear back.

* *Wants* are the beers that you are looking to obtain in a trade and *gots* are the beers that you have and are willing to trade away.

* Each r/beertrade member should have at most one post on this page, and it should simply be edited to update your wants/gots. 

* If you want to respond to someone's wants/gots, please PM them.  Don't reply here or you'll be asked to delete it.  This is strictly a profile page - please keep it clean and organized, to everyone's benefit.

1264111565.0,24,self.beertrade,asktf,READ FIRST: r/beertrade rules.,LambTaco,25,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/,"**Please read this primer in its entirety.**  

Some things may be repeated between sections because they are **that important.**

----

1.) **Wants/Gots**

* To get started in r/beertrade, you should create a post in the [Wants/Gots](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asxog/community_page_wantsgots/) page (also linked to in the side bar), listing what beers you are looking for and/or what beers you have for trade.  This is one of the main resources for determining what beer is available for trade from other r/beertrade members.  Whenever you want to change your wants/gots, just edit your entry on the page. 

2.) **Setting Up a Trade:**

* If you want to set up a beer trade, there are a few main ways to go about it.
* Check the [Wants/Gots](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asxog/community_page_wantsgots/) section and PM an r/beertrade member with your trade proposal.
* Submit an In Search of Post, entitled ""ISO: xxxx"", replacing 'xxxx' with the beers you are looking for.  Also list what beers you are willing to trade in return.
* Submit a For Trade post, entitled ""FT: xxxx"", replacing 'xxxx' with the beers you have for trade.  Also list what beers you might be looking for in return (if you have any in mind).

3.) **Trade basics**

* NEVER trade beer for money.  That's called a sale, and it's very illegal without the proper business licenses.  Any sale/purchase proposals will be removed immediately and you may be banned.
* Only trade with people who you are comfortable with.  If you don't feel like you trust someone, do not trade with them.
* We recommend not trading with any reddit members who have an unusual account history, such as people who never comment or people who have been users less than 1 month.
* As much as possible, we recommend dollar-per-dollar trades, so that each person is trading beer that is worth the same amount of money.  Sometimes rarer beers may be worth more than their retail price, but that is a decision between the two people arranging the trade.
* You are responsible for the beer that you ship.  If the package is somehow lost or damaged before it reaches its destination, you are liable for replacing the lost or damaged beer.  If you refuse to replace lost or damaged beer, your trading career on r/beertrade is over.

4.) **Finalizing a trade**

* Once a trade is ready to be formalized, use PRIVATE MESSAGING, email, etc.  Do NOT give your address, full name, or any other personal information out on the public forum.
* Don't forget to read about the [Reputation List](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/blrjn/community_page_reputation_list/) so you can get reputation points for your trades. 

5.) **Shipping**

* If you're shipping domestically, please avoid the USPS (United States Postal Service).  Only use private shipping companies if you can.  We recommend FedEx.  
* No matter how well you package your beer, damage or loss is always a possibility.  You are shipping at your own risk.
* You are responsible for the beer that you ship.  If the package is somehow lost or damaged before it reaches its destination, you are liable for replacing the lost or damaged beer.  If you refuse to replace lost or damaged beer, your trading career on r/beertrade is over.

6.) **What's allowed**

* Self posts ONLY.  
* FT and ISO posts.
* Instructional posts about packaging, shipping, different shipping providers, etc.
* Questions about trading, packaging, shipping, etc.
* Linking to images WITHIN a self post is perfectly fine, but only if the images and the post are on topic.  Please don't just write one line of text and link to an image.  That belongs in [r/beerporn](/r/beerporn).  We're looking for things that help the trading community.
* Trade summaries can be posted as comments to the monthly trades thread (eg ""March Trades"") that is linked in the side bar.

7.) **What's NOT allowed**

* No beer reviews or ""beer porn"" submissions will be tolerated.  You will be asked to delete them here.  Post those things to r/beer.
* Trade summaries should not be posted individually, but they can be posted as comments to the monthly trades thread (eg ""March Trades"") that is linked in the side bar.
* Please don't spam trade requests or offers.  Instead of posting a bunch of ""FT"" or ""ISO"" posts, just use the [Wants/Gots](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asxog/community_page_wantsgots/) page.
* You will be asked to delete any submissions that are deemed to be spam or off-topic.
* Do not post your or anyone else's personal information.  Any such posts will be removed immediately and you may be banned.
* NEVER trade beer for money.  That's called a sale, and it's very illegal without the proper business licenses.  Any sale/purchase proposals will be removed immediately and you may be banned.

----

*DISCLAIMER*:

*Neither the moderators of r/beertrade nor anyone affiliated with reddit.com are liable for or responsible for any damage to or loss of property, any legal problems, or anything else that may result from communications on r/beertrade.  We will try our best to foster an atmosphere of professionalism and honesty, but ultimately you trade AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

Funny that there have been a couple threads about new beer sites here recently, as I've just developed and finally pushed live a new cellaring site, The Beer Cellar, accessible at http://www.beercellar.me

I designed this site initially for my friends and me, then decided to branch out and bring it public (I've been working on things for the past few months in my spare time).  While it has many similarities to what I believe is the go-to online cellar, CellarHQ, I've tried to incorporate a number of enhancements and extra features.  On top of that, I plan to continue actively developing the site, and have a number of future ideas for new features, including features aimed specifically at trading communities like this one.

For now, some features that might interest you guys include:

* Tracking of entries in both your cellar and fridge (on the same records)
* Ability to quickly increment cellar counts on existing entries
* Quick tasting note additions whenever drinking a beer, and automatic consumption history entries whenever drinking a beer
* **Trading labels** may be appended to beer entries (FT, ISO), and are visible to anyone who views your cellar
* Filter any cellar (yours or someone else's) based on cellar/fridge counts, trading status, or date each entry was added
* CSV Import and CSV Export of your cellar

For more info, I put up an inaugural blog post here: http://www.beercellar.me/blog

Hopefully some of you guys will find the site useful!  My contact details are in the blog post, so feel free to get in touch with any requests, comments, etc.  Also, while I can't promise when exactly any of these features will go live, here's some of the things I already have planned in terms of improvements:

* Add advanced search capabilities for trading purposes
* Add friends/favorite functionality to keep track of interesting cellars
* Along the same longs, add some sort of cellar activity tracker to see recent additions and changes

Edit: if you'd like to see my cellar, here it is! http://www.beercellar.me/cellar/josh

**Edit 2:** thought I'd mention in case anyone is wondering that Trading Labels are not enabled by default, but you can turn them on via the My Account area.  Once turned on, they'll appear in your cellar and will be visible to you and anyone else who looks at your cellar.  Clicking a Trading Label in your cellar will bring up a drop-down to change the status.

**Edit 3:** based on comments here and elsewhere, sounds like I should prioritize the mobile friendly view for the site, so I'll definitely move that up in the queue.  Thanks for the continued feedback!

**Edit 4:** First (minor) feature update pushed live!

It seems like the demand for group trades is much higher than the supply as of late, so I'd like to organize one I've been wanting to do for a while.

Everyone out here probably has a favorite local brewery that they doesn't get enough credit.  The purpose of this trade is to get the word out about your favorite local brewing establishment.  I will match people up based on location, trying to maximize distance, and each person will send a sampler pack to their respective partner.  As a 6-pack is the standard sampler for beer I am going to use that as the minimum volume to be sent.  Here are the rules:

* You must have at least one reported trade on r/beertrade or a reddit account that has been active for at least 3 months.

* You must send a minimum of 72 oz of beer.  This can be in any combination of bottle sizes.

* You must include at least four unique beers in your sampler.

Once these conditions are met, expanding the trade to more bottles or breweries is always encouraged.    

To sign up send me the following pieces of information to samplertrade@gmail.com :

* Reddit Username

* Location (state and city)

I will take sign ups until March 6, 11:59pm PST or until 32 people have signed up.  Please email me from an email address from which you are ok to receive mass email updates regarding the trade.

**Note: Ship First Rule.** To protect people from shady traders I am going to enforce this rule.  If you have no reputation on this site you must ship first.

Other information about trading taken from SatansLH group trade posts:

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the Trading and Packaging Tips Section The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, bottle openers, coasters, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

___The rules:___

You can submit up to 2 entries. Any format is fine

These 2 entries must be tan narwhals, white narwhals, grey narwhals, pink narwhals… whatever… not normal stuff. 

Link for submissions:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17m81vV5Wl2elV4bOIgwz4MXx16UCOj5jywP0PyFEpIs/viewform

Qualified: Everything is fair game. Verticals and groups of beer can count as one entry.

Once the submissions are in, a full list will be put out. You rank the entire list (your submissions included).

**YOU WILL ONLY SEND OUT YOUR BEERS IF YOU ARE RECEIVING SOMETHING YOU RANKED HIGHER**

And then people will ship.

The greatest thing about this BIF is that if you submit say… Blabaer. You will only have to ship it out if something you ranked higher than Blabaer is being shipped to you!

Shipping will be first week of July

You must be an experienced trader to participate.

Ok, I took the form offline for any more submissions and I am now going to prepare the list and will make a new post for it. Here's the link to the new post with the list:

http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1g3qy2/unwanted_narwhals_bif_list/


6/10 - 92 submissions, 50 traders

**FAQ:** 

""*I need to change my submission...*""
This is fine. All submissions are time stamped, just resubmit with the same reddit username and I'll only use the last submission for each trader when compiling the list.

""*Can you give me an example of a reasonable submission?*""
The quality of beer you put into a Beer It Forward is the quality of beer you should expect to get in return. Reasonable submissions include limited releases, vintage beers, hard to find imports, barrel aged russian imperials and barleywines, verticals, sours, growler fills, etc... if you were going to have a good friend over for a beer tasting tomorrow what would you break out for them?

The next day I got a message saying I was in and what time do you want to get there.  After a few messages, I stop getting replies.  After two days of no contact, I get a message saying ""well, my brother wants to go, but doesn't care about beer, so I'm just going to take him.""

Look, I know it's not as bad as a trade where one person got screwed, but I passed up a few other potential deals for tickets because I thought I had one locked up. I'm mostly pissed because it feels like he knew he was going to do this two days ago, hence the sudden lack of communication and by not telling me then, costing me two days to find another ticket.

Below are the rules and instructions to join. This is a first draft, so if anyone has suggestions, please comment and let me know.

First of, I should explain the concept. We will be playing a small tournament style game of Texas Hold'em poker using pokerstars.net. Each player will ante a beer, and the losers will ship their beers to the winners.

For the Poker BIF, each player will ante up their beer. The minimum requirements are 22oz of good beer. This doesn't have to be insanely expensive, but try to pick something that is harder to come by that people would enjoy winning. A general guideline would be something rated at least 85 on Beer Advocate that has limited distribution; something that people would enjoy receiving. For example, for the first tournament, I will be anteing a bottle of Boulevard's Bourbon Barrel Quad. Each person must let me know before the start of play what beer they will be anteing.

I have made a google doc with some basic information: the payout structure and the list of players. The payout structure should be fairly self-explanatory. The losers will ship to the winners according to their places and the number of players. If anyone has questions about this, feel free to PM me or comment below. I will update the list of players as people join. Losers will be expected to ship by no later than the Friday after the game. The google doc can be found here: [Payout and Player List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As0-XY7YSsEXdFZJYUVaOFNaeHI0bEUwU0FQX3N2RFE&amp;pli=1#gid=0)

The first game will be scheduled for Sunday, July 8th at 3:00pm Central time. This is to give everyone enough time to get signed up and work out their schedules. (And also because I am unavailable the next two Sundays). There will be 5,000 starting chips and 10 minute blinds. I expect the game will run 2-3 hours max.

To register, first PM me your ante. I will add you to the list of players on the google doc. The next step is to download the pokerstars client. This is available at [pokerstars.net](http://pokerstars.net). Once you have this downloaded and you have created an account, to join the tournament go to the ""Home Games"" tab, click ""Join Club"", enter ""651112"" for the Club ID and ""1123581321"" for the invitation code. This will bring you to the club lobby where you will be able to join the tournament. (For all you who are worried, pokerstars offers free play [and only free play for Americans] so there is no need for credit cards or personal information.)

I think that just about covers it. We'll be playing poker for beer. If anyone has questions, comments or suggestions, please let me know below. Like I said at the top, this is a first draft so if you have any recommendations, they will be seriously considered. I will also make a reminder post for our first game a few days before it actually happens.

Edit 1: I am going to instate a two completed trade minimum for each contestant.  This is to prevent someone from creating multiple accounts / playing with no intention of shipping / etc.  I think a two trade limit is enough to keep spammers and cheats out but not so high as to prevent well-intentioned players from playing.  Any player must now have two verified trades to join.",,False,self,t5_2rgco,1340233631.0,,repLevel3,True,t3_vcbaw,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/vcbaw/group_trade_poker_bif/,

1283984433.0,19,self.beertrade,dbbd0,Group Trade:  Beer of the Month Club -9/10,SatansLH,23,4,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/dbbd0/group_trade_beer_of_the_month_club_910/,"**Beer of the Month Club - SIGN UP IS NOW CLOSED**

This is a simple concept I’d like to start on r/beertrade and hopefully do on a monthly basis.  Essentially it will be a monthly secret Santa where everyone throws their name in the hat, gets assigned a trade partner, everyone will ship by a certain date, and we all get beer around the same time.  

Every month we’ll add a theme to the trade: beer styles, seasonals, your favorite holiday beer, all suggestions are welcome.  The only constant is that it is local to you.  The trick here is we’ll assign regions so when names are picked we will choose from 4 or 5 different hats and hopefully get new beer to everyone.   
This is meant to be an introductory way for a larger group to participate.  So if you’ve been sitting on the fence or have no idea how to get started this is for you.  

**TRADING DETAILS**
When you get assigned a name this will be your partner.  I felt like people would be uncomfortable with me collecting a bunch of names and addresses to sort myself. So it is your responsibility to trade addresses and all other information needed to ship beer.  For simplicity sake you and your partner are going to trade beer with each other.  So instead of the traditional anonymous receiving that goes with secret santa, you’ll be in direct contact with them.  This gives everyone accountability and also a chance to get to know your fellow beeritor. This will also hopefully establish a trade relationship for the future.  My goal is this will help build our community and that it will also weed out the bum traders.  

**DISCLAIMER**
[Click here for rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/)
Also those who wish to participate must have an account 3+ months old and be within the continental 48 states

**SHIPPING**
[For advice on shipping click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**
Your account must be at least 3 months old.  If you pass then you can send a message to me in this format:

USER NAME,
CITY, STATE
Suggestion for next month’s group trade 

This needs to be sent to me by September 18th.  For this first trade I will cut off at 30 people since we’re still in beta.  If we manage to max out then I’ll raise the bar next month and we’ll figure out how to accommodate more people.  When you receive your package send me a confirmation message so we can update the good trader list and keep track of who failed.


**DATES:**

* 9/9/2010 is the cut off for entry
* 9/10/2010 you will be assigned your partner
* 9/25/2010 this is the date you must ship by

** TRADE THEME**

This one is open to anything this time around.  Send whatever you want as long as it’s local and a 6-pack.  Get to know your fellow beeritor and come to an arrangement their favorite beer style, whatever works for you.  As a side note it is not required but is customary to pack extras with your shipment.  It doesn’t have to be anything major, generally coasters, something homemade, or something your area is known for.  People like surprises almost as much as they like getting beer.  

questions/comments/suggestions/are welcome.  

If you experience any problems during the trade send a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade) and they will do all that is in their power to help make it right.

*(The following is quoted from the last BA forum link above and was written by BA user RedwoodGeorge)*  
**Packing advice**

Think about the physics of the situation - what can break a beer bottle? If you do everything reasonable to protect against situations that can break a bottle, you're most of the way there. 

Two major threats: 

1) Something outside the box. What if the box gets dropped, kicked, pierced or crushed? Where's your bottle going to be? You've got to have durable protection between your bottle and whatever the outside world (aka 'UPS') can throw at it. If there's nothing between your precious bottle and the cardboard, your bottle isn't protected. A layer of peanuts is good but make sure the bottle can't 'swim' through the peanuts to the cardboard wall. Rigid foam, cushion foam or heavy bubblewrap are all good solutions that the bottle can't swim through. 

2) Something inside the box. Would you put a beer bottle in a box full of hammers? Of course not. And yet you'd but a beer bottle in a box full of other beer bottles! Try smashing two bottles together and tell me one of them won't lose that contest. You've got to protect the bottles from crashing into each other. The first approach: more padding, this time on an individual basis. Most folk wrap each bottle in a layer or two of bubblewrap. If one bottle runs into another at least there's two layers of bubblewrap to absorb the energy. Better still, immobilize the suckers so they can't crash into each other. Three strategies: 

a) pack the box -tight- with peanuts in between the bottles so the 
bottles can't 'swim' and hit each other. Remember the box will 
spend a week in the back of a truck so there will be lots of 
jostling during that time... 

b) put the bottles into individual cells, much like in a case of beer. If 
they can't leave their confinement they can't come in contact with 
other bottles. Make sure the walls of the cells are adequately 
strong to restrain the bottles if the box is dropped. 

c) bind the bottles together. This may seem counterintuitive but 
physics doesn't lie. Take the bubblewrapped bottles and tightly 
tape 'em together. That way they all move as a group instead of 
moving in different directions (sometimes towards each other) 

Now that you've got the inside of the box well protected, make sure the box is well sealed. Don't use cheap tape. Expect the driver to leave it in a puddle of water in the back of the truck (because some will) The cardboard may have little integrity by the time the box gets to its destination so make sure the packing tape is there to help. For the truly paranoid, strapping tape (with the embedded fibers) is insanely strong. One complete loop of that will hold practically -any- box together. 

How about used cardboard boxes? I generally avoid them. With all the time, money and effort being spent on shipping the beer, saving two bucks and using an old, soft box doesn't make sense. If it's in good shape then fine but don't cheap out at the wrong time... 

Lastly, what if the cap should fail while in transit? Sadly it's not unheard of, especially if the beer is highly carbonated or if it's a twist off cap (with less grip than a standard pry-off cap). Some folk wrap each bottle individually in a ziploc bag, some line the entire box with a hefty bag. Either way if a bottle leaks the beer will stay inside the box rather than soaking through both and a) tipping off the driver that you're shipping a prohibited substance and b) weakening the cardboard of the box. It's not a bad idea to put some newspaper or paper towel in the box to soak up any liquid - it's much easier to contain a wet paper towel than many ounces of escaped beer. 

Expect them (aka 'UPS') to drop your box. If you're not comfortable dropping your box (repeatedly) from chest height onto a concrete floor then you haven't packed well enough. If you hear -any- rattle when you shake that box like a five year old trying to get the last nickel out of a piggy bank, you haven't packed well enough. 

Just keep thinking ""plan for the worst"" and remember that they (aka 'UPS') don't care about your package nearly as much as you do - pack with that understanding and your beer will arrive safe and sound.

FedEx users/receivers: Has anybody ever been visited by a ""Senior Security Specialist"" from ""Corporate Security (Western) Region"" ?

Since I was at work my brother played dumb about what kind of packages I receive and how often. After a while the man moved to questions about how the packages were delivered: does the driver knock, are they left in a concealed space, etc.

Ok, so the last few months have been rough on my wallet and I had to forget about my original plan to try and do a ""serious"" group trade in the style of redditgifts. Anyway, I'm doing something somewhat similar in hopes of at least getting people some beer this winter season. Sure, none of these will ship in time for Christmas or New Year's, but it may be better this way so that beer doesn't sit in a warehouse somewhere waiting to be picked up after holidays.  
  
There's no theme aside from keeping what you're sending your match a secret. 72oz (a 6pk) is recommended but more is encouraged. Treat this like you would've a Christmas match, and feel free to include any gifts (glassware, posters, coasters, extra beer, rare beer, homebrews, music you made, food only found in your region etc etc etc)

Sign-ups will be from 12/12-12/21

Ship by 1/11 which is plenty of time to catch up from the holidays.  
  
I'm cutting off at the last even # person to sign up by 12/21 (obviously odd #'s won't work because there will be one person not receiving anything)  
  
Limiting this one to the 48 states (sorry canada, hawaii, and puerto rico) in order to make this a little bit easier for people.

Maybe having a unique badge per trade level.  1-5, 6-10, and so on.  Represent them like bronze silver gold, maybe a bottle or pint glass as the trophy...  and you can build from there as this grows.

For those who aren't familiar with this here are the [rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/dorv9/beer_of_the_month_club_october/) from October's group trade. 

**NOTE** Reddit Accounts must be at least 3 months old to participate.  This is to avoid scammers and beer thieves and to ensure everyone has a Merry Christmas.

**Trade Theme**

Hey guys, as promised it's that time again.  Seeing as it's Christmas and all, I thought it would only be fitting to do stouts, porters, and winter warmers.  We will trade the usual amount of 72oz. of beer( 6-pack) but this time around as part of the Christmas spirit I thought it would be cool to trade an extra beer related gift.  It could be a hat, glassware, things that aren't generally freebies, etc.  If these things aren't readily accessible to you, I think you're all creative enough to come up with something special for your partner.  Gifts should be in the $5-10 range.  


**How to Sign-Up**

I'm going to do things a little differently this time to make things easier on me.  I'm going to operate partly through traditional email this time around so that I can send mass messages, friendly reminders, and be a little more hands-on.  If you're interested in playing please send me a message with the following information (type it all out so I can copy and paste it):

* reddit name

* City and State

* E-mail


After you've done so post in this thread to let your fellow traders know who's in.

I'm going to set the cut off for sign-ups at 50 people once again.  If this gets an overwhelming response I'll consider amending it but so far we haven't exceeded it. 


**Important Dates**

* Sign-ups will be from **11/25-11/28**

* Partners will be assigned **11/29-11/30**

* Shipping by **12/15** which allows a little over 2 weeks to buy, pack and ensure everything arrives in time for a Merry Christmas.  

**If you have any questions, comments, or concerns don't be afraid to post in the thread or send me a message.**

**SIGN-UPS ARE OFFICIALLY OVER.  We have 26 people signed up.  Bare with me because today is going to be hellish for me.  This is my crunch week so I will hopefully get to it this evening but only after I finish a 5 page paper and a marketing project.  You know how it goes, work before play.  If I don't get to it this evening I'll do it when I get home around 1pm on Wednesday and send out all the confirmation emails.  My apologies in advance.

It belongs to an extremely good friend of mine who wants the BAVDL so I cannot speak for any other offers for the Huna.


Seeing as he has never done an online trade and has no Rep on here or BA nor anywhere else, I offered to facilitate the trade for him in exchange for being there to drink some. 


Thank you for your time and understanding.




[EDIT @ 1055pm EST] - So I just went to the brewery tonight for a pint and, just my luck I missed, them selling more BA Hunahpu by 5 minutes. Wasn't even able to buy one from someone at $50 a bottle. 


Spoke with a brewer who was having a pint and he stated that there are apx 3 more cases to be released, which would put the final count around 600 (apx 50 cases x 12 bottles). IF this were true that would negate ALL of the argument about the total number being 3000 and cause the (in my opinion) trade value of the BA Hunahpu to rise and make it well worth a BAVDL. 


Now again, I'm ONLY counting this as just a rumor! So, sadly, only time will only tell what the final count on the market will be. 




SPECIAL NOTE - Spoke with my friend in possession of the bottle and told him how this thread blew up and still had no offers: he stated that he would be willing to add in a bottle of Marshal Zhukov or possibly a bottle of regular Hunahpu if that will get this trade completed.

My submission:

&gt;I like 191 for a variety of reasons. 191 is a palindrome, and who doesn't like Palindromes!? Write it backwards and its still the same number--awesome! And a prime palindrome? That's gotta be rare, no? More importantly, If you combine it with the luckiest of numbers, 7, you get perhaps one of the greatest non-prime numbers ever, 1337. Any geek knows that 1337 means leet, or elite which is, in fact, how Pliny is described! I wouldn't know having never been blessed with the good fortune (or distribution market) to ever lay Pliny upon my senses, but I would know that should you choose me as your winner, I'll be LiF'ing one Bell's Hopslam 2012 that I just picked up last night.

&gt;:)

&gt;/crosses fingers

&gt;PS. It turns 191 is more awesome than I thought after a little bit of research (not used above): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/191_%28number%29 maybe my favorite of the wiki list is The binary number of 191 has seven 1 digits, but just one zero (10111111).

&gt;Well done! The main reason I like 191 so much is it's a Gaussian prime, which I studied during my undergrad (mathematics). Let me know your address and I'll send the Pliny! I'm excited that you'll be sending Hopslam... I got to try a bottle when my twin sister, who lives in Philly, sent me out a custom 6 pack of her favorite brews.
Thanks for Lottery'ing it Forward!

My package arrived today and I found not one, but [TWO bottles](http://i.imgur.com/vAfx3h.jpg). So, I am offering up [two bottles](http://i.imgur.com/AR66kh.jpg) of Bell's Hopslam. 

Here is how you play, step 1, read the [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/ou8z3/russian_river_lotteryitforward_lif/) for some rules. Step 2, Send me via PM 3 items on your bucket list. If you don't keep a list of stuff you'd like to do before you die, then make something up. I'll pick my favorite submission. This is quite a bit more subjective than the original, but then again, so was the one I won. No submissions will be accepted after 11:59 PM ET 2/19. I'll announce the winner and publish the list of entries on Monday or Tuesday. The beer should be in the mail Tuesday also.

Also, in case it wasn't obvious, the winner must carry the tradition and LIF some beer.

Edit: crossed off bucket list items are acceptable submissions, perhaps even bonus points.

I am sorry if you missed out on this league but /u/thermic will be creating another, so keep an eye out for that**

Welcome to the 2013-2014 edition of /r/beertrade fantasy football!  We had a great group of beer traders compete last year and it's time to do it again.  Read through the following league details, and if you are interested, please post a comment or send me a message.

Here are the details that I have so far:

* Preference for league membership will be given to traders with experience on /r/beertrade .  If you don't have /r/beertrade rep but have trading experience on other sites, send me a message with your user name and the site and I will look up some references.

* Every trader who participates in the league will ship a box.   I will be providing a list of all participants to the beer mods and it will be like a normal beer trade - you will get a trade rep point for shipping your box and will receive the usual penalties for not shipping.

* The prize distribution will be determined by the number of participants.  It usually works out something like: 1st place gets 4 boxes, 2nd place gets 3 boxes, etc.  I will post more info about the prizes once the league numbers are finalized.

* We tried fleaflicker last year but I know there were a few kinks on there, so we will be moving to ESPN this year.

* I will tentatively set the draft date for **Sunday, August 25th at 9 EST**.  Let me know in your comment or message if this **DOES NOT** work for you.

* League settings will be relatively standard (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 RB/WR/TE, DST, K).  Scoring will be standard ESPN as well (except I will be taking out all yardage bonuses - e.g. bonus for a long touchdown pass)

That's all that I have off the top of my head, if you have any questions just post them.  Last year we only had one league but almost had enough for 2, and I'm thinking this year we should have enough for at least 2.

Cheers!

**edit for info I forgot:**

Last year's minimum was $30-40 of beer per person, but porch bombing is also encouraged

**edit 2**

I will be updating this post with people who are in the league as I get through them.  If you don't have a few trades done on reddit, I will be messaging you for further info.

1373186066.0,16,self.beertrade,1hsmeu,BIF Sign-ups: Survivor BIF,statball,16,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1hsmeu/bif_signups_survivor_bif/,"This has been a long time in the making, but we're happy to present the first (hopefully of many) /r/beertrade Survivor BIF.  Similar BIFs have been organized on Beer Advocate, and we thought we'd give it a shot here.  For those of you unfamiliar with the concept, here's how it works.

If you have ever seen “Survivor”, the TV show, you already know the general format.  We'll start with 16 players total, and players will be eliminated one-by-one until there is a lone survivor remaining.  Immunity challenges will be held at scheduled dates.  The winner(s) of the challenges will be immune to elimination for that round.  Players then vote for the person they would like to eliminate.  The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.

Hope we haven't lost anyone yet.  Here are some more specific details.  We'll start with 16 players, divided into two tribes of 8 people.  The first six immunity challenges will be team challenges.  That is, one entire tribe will win immunity after each challenge, while the other tribe must vote one of their members out of the game.  When we're down to 10 total players, we'll merge tribes and all immunity challenges will become individual challenges, meaning that only one person will win immunity after each challenge.  Players eliminated in challenges #8-14 will form the Tribal Council, and will ultimately help decide the winner of the Survivor BIF.

Still with me?  Great!  If you're interested in participating, here are a few criteria we'd like to make sure you meet.  We realize they're a bit stricter than most BIFs, but there's a lot more involved in this one, and we want to make sure that all players will be able to fully participate.

* You live in the 48 contiguous United States.
* You have completed 5 or more trades on /r/beertrade.
* You are capable of using and posting photographs to Reddit, Imgur, and Untappd.
* You can successfully sign into and use the [Snoonet IRC #beer channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/beer?nick=kiwi_?).
* You can successfully sign into and use Java-based Yahoo! Games.
* You are willing to send the equivalent of a [Poker BIF ante](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As0-XY7YSsEXdERLS3I2bmxZT1hlRlZ3bF9YMkUzNGc#gid=8) and some nice local beer to a participant who places highly.
* You will have the time to actively participate in this BIF over its duration (maybe a month or so?).  The challenges won't require you to be glued to your computer, but each one will require at least some level of participation.  

**If you meet the above criteria and are still interested, [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=statball) with your e-mail address saying that you'd like to participate.**

I'm unsure of the level of interest for this BIF, so I may need to lower the completed trades requirement if there aren't enough participants with 8+ trades.  If the response is high, then I'll randomly choose from those who message me, and those who are not chosen will be given priority for a future BIF (assuming this one goes well, of course).

If you have any questions, please post in the comments!  I've probably left off some important details somewhere in this wall of text.  Looking forward to finally getting this BIF started!

**Edit: Reduced trade requirement from 8 to 5.**

We're working on the program now to upload your beers, create a wish list and then match you to people looking for your beer and vice versa. You'll have a rating system, a way to look up beer ratings so you can compare and counteroffer on trades if they aren't worth the trade.

Once logged in the main page will have a news feed of updates from users you follow, breweries and retailers so you can stay up to date on upcoming releases, events and comment on trades made.

When you click on a beer a pop up screen of the beer and all its information will come up.

working on some other things as well but I think for now that should suffice to get it up and running soon.
We're working with some pretty big names as far as brewers go as well as getting a ton of feedback retail stores to help guide us in the right direction.  We expect to launch in the near future and you should expect to see our marketing team push this hard across the country!

Here is the BA post:

EDIT: This is open to anyone who has 5+ completed trades on reddit or BA. Sorry, but since you are going to be shipping to someone who is not necessarily shipping to you, shipping first doesn't do us any good here. 

http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/have-brewery-a-want-brewery-b-a-mixed-brewery-box-swap-bif.42034/
Pretty simple idea, open to US only. Available for individuals or groups.

When you sign up for the BIF you put one (or 2) well respected, sought after, or well reviewed brewery(ies) down that you either have ample access to or have a well stocked cellar from.

Ie. I could sign up with Jackie O's (because I go often and have relatively easy access) or Upland because I have a lot in my cellar.

In your submission you indicate whether you're willing to make a box based on ONE of the breweries you submit or TWO separate boxes, one of each brewery you submitted (a great option for groups)

Once I have enough signups (lets cap this at 20 for the first round), I send out the full list of breweries being represented and you rank the top 5 you'd like to receive a box from. You MUST rank 5 breweries not including your own.

Then, I will take the person or group representing the highest ranked brewery, and have them receive from their number 1 pick. Then the second highest ranked brewery will be assigned, and on down the list. Each time, the highest ranking out of the 5 rankings that I can assign, I will.

After all the assignments are made, there will undoubtedly be a few people who weren't able to get one of their 5 rankings. They will have the option to chose from the remaining breweries or opting out for the round.


Then, each group makes a box for their target consisting of beers and swag from the brewery they represented:

Minimum retail value: $100 

Minimum # of different beers: 6 

Maximum # of growlers: 2 (unless it is discussed with me ahead of time) 

*at least 2 must be specialty beers (ie. something not easily available, ex. Dark Lord, Beatification, brewery release bottles, etc) 

Minimum swag: 1 piece of glasswear, 1 other swag (no coasters, but stickers, bottle openers, etc are fine)
 

The shipping window for this BIF will be fairly wide to allow people ample time to build boxes and visit the brewery they are representing.

Suggestions of breweries I'd love to see represented: 

Hill Farmstead 

Cigar City 

Russian River 

Crooked Stave 

Westbrook 

Surly 

Kuhnhenn 

Freetail

Here it  is.  
  
I am a homebrewer in need of an awesome full color label for an upcoming IIPA in the works. It's a hell of a hop bomb and kind of experimental, so it will only be a small batch (2.5 gallons). [recipe/info here](http://hopville.com/recipe/1278989/imperial-ipa-recipes/hop-grenade)  
  
The beer is called Hop Grenade, ""brewery name"" is Beers By Facundo or BBF. I am going to be printing these at Kinkos most likely and just hand gluing them onto 12oz bottles. A full wrap size would be nice but not necessary (7""w x 3""h) - half wrap would be ideal since they'd be cheaper to print on an 8-1/2 x 11 sheet (label size 4""w x 3""h). Please PM me links to your images (this way nobody copies off your idea, etc.)  
  
The contest starts right now and will last until April 20th (4/20 lol) 6AM Eastern Time (wake up early you drunks!). The best label wins. I know it seems like a long deadline for a LIF, but I also know that it takes a long time for an artist to perfect their work. Also, it gives me 2 full weeks to scrounge up hard to find beers in the state of NJ.  
  
Winner will receive a variety of 12oz/16oz/22oz bottles/cans. I will be updating as I pick up more stuff, but I will start by saying I will be including some bottles of Nugget Nectar AT LEAST. Winner will also receive a few homebrews, including (when ready) Hop Grenade in a separate box (at a later time). That's right, winner will receive TWO packages of beer. One right away, and another approximately a month or so later.  
  
[RULES FROM ORIGINAL LIF ARE TO BE RESPECTED](http://redd.it/ou8z3)  
  
Please be creative, be awesome, and feel free to stalk me to find out more info on myself and make this a little more centered towards my likes.

1297384711.0,16,self.beertrade,fj4nw,Group Trade: Beer of the Month Club #4 - St. Patricks Day,SatansLH,16,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/fj4nw/group_trade_beer_of_the_month_club_4_st_patricks/,"Well St. Patricks day is coming up and I thought it was time to get this show rollin' again.  I know we've had an extra long hiatus but I expected everyone appreciated a little more recovery time after the holidays.  So I'm starting this one about a week early so we can get everyone beer before our favorite drinking holiday.  

In the past week or so I've seen our ranks swell as we crossed the 900 mark so for all you new guys, welcome we're happy to have you. If you're looking for your first trade to get your feet wet this is a great way to do it and to meet some of your fellow r/beertrade members.  This isn't about trading white whales or super rarities, it's about trading good local beer with others.  So if you're intimidated by the trades that you see happening and never have the stuff people are looking for that's ok.  Our main goal here is to trade some craft beer local to you that you think is worth supporting.  We don't care what it's BA rank is, we only care that it's craft beer and that it's local to you.  **DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.

There are close to 1600 microbreweries across the country, you probably live near one that a lot of us never hear about.  Those are the kinds of beers we trade here.  We have people that cover all corners of the country and this will be your chance to trade with one of them at random.  

**How it Works**

What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

* step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your essential information.

* step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with.  So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

* step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, what your interested in, what you're not, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing.  It's meant to open up a dialogue.  

* step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone.  It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

* step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

* step 6: Drink beer.

As you can see it's a pretty simple concept but people enjoy it enough that I'm doing it for a 4th time.

**What's involved**

We trade at least 72 oz. of beer(1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, 3 bombers and a 12oz, a growler and a 12 oz., or whatever combination you want to do to make it to 72oz. of beer.)  

Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you.  You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates.  If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it.  If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.  

I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time.  Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute.  If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day.  I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping.  We want everyone in the group to have a happy St. Patricks day.   

**Theme**  

I'm leaving this one open to interpretation.  If you want to send your partner drinkin' stouts and red ales you are welcome to do so or the makings of a fantastic black and tan then by all means.  I'm just trying to make it easier for everybody.  The most important thing is to check with your partner and see what kind of beer styles they'll drink.  Who wants to get a box full of IPAs if you can't stand hops?  

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up has an active account at least 3 months old.  This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.

If you have read the above and are still on board, awesome here's what you need to do.  Send me a PM with the following information by Monday February 15th.

* **Your handle** (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

* **Your City and State** (This is all I want, so I know where to assign your region.  I am not collecting addresses.)

* **Your e-mail**  (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:  

SatansLH

Woodway, TX

SatansLH@gmail.com (spam email for anyone who cares)

**Note: New Rule**  Something we are enforcing this time around to help protect members is the **Ship First Rule**.  For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first.  The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end.  This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you as I will do my best to assign you with an experienced trader.  If you and your partner both have trade reputation then fire at will.  I will inform you upon partner assignments of you or your partners probationary status.  

**IMPORTANT DATES**

* **February 15th, 2011** the last day for sign-ups

* **by February 18th, 2011** you will have partners assigned, probably earlier

* **March 7th, 2011** the ship by date.  This is the absolute last day you should be shipping.  

That gives you 3 weekends to procure beer, pack, and ship.  That is more than enough time and gives plenty of window for our probationary members to ship by.  If you're on probation and you wait till the 7th to ship we can no longer guarantee you'll receive your beer by St. Patrick's day.  It is your responsibility to get your package on it's way in time.

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the [Trading and Packaging Tips Section](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS. 

 **DO NOT USE THE  UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE** 

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.  

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar.  Extras are not required but once again are encouraged.  It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, bottle openers, coasters, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish.  Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again.  It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

1285993175.0,17,self.beertrade,dlsjc,Box-in-box packing,LambTaco,21,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/dlsjc/boxinbox_packing/,"I thought it might help some of you out there to see a photographic tutorial of box-in-box packing.  I took some photos of the packing process of my recent BotM trade.

My philosophy is to err on the side of caution.  I take maybe an hour to pack my shipments on average, and use more materials than most people, but in return I'm rewarded with peace of mind.  A side benefit is that a good box-in-box can be reused many, many times, with the outer box being replaced periodically.

Here's the step-by-step of me packaging a 6 pack + 1 extra:

Materials:  
One inner box  
One larger, outer box  
One small box, 8""x8""x12"" or similar (to cut up)  
Bubble wrap  
All natural packing peanuts, ~$3 worth (all natural = no static cling)  
Tape  

1. Find a suitable inner-box to contain your bottles + some padding.  For this trade I settled on [a box from a Goose Island 12 pack](http://i.imgur.com/oWFAS.jpg)

2. [Wrap each of the bottles](http://i.imgur.com/L0bp0.jpg) once or twice around with small bubble wrap and secure with tape.

3. Figure out how you want to [position your bottles](http://i.imgur.com/Owov1.jpg) in the box.

4. From the small cardboard box, [Cut and place rectangular separators](http://i.imgur.com/gwWyO.jpg) between each group of two bottles.

5. From the small cardboard box, [Cut and place X shaped separators](http://i.imgur.com/TFUkU.jpg) between each empty space between bottles.  [All separators in place](http://i.imgur.com/iXgMw.jpg).  For the odd bottle, notice the V-shaped separator.  
&gt; To make an X separator, you need to cut two narrow rectangles and then cut a slit halfway down the middle of each one.  [Then interlace them](http://i.imgur.com/nTIZH.gif) and unfold the them until you have an X shape.  These separators will tend to close or flatten, which is good because they will have tension and will stay in place once you wedge them open.

6. At this point the bottles should be extremely snug from the tight-fitting cardboard separators.  If you shake the box, nothing should move at all.

7.  If there is any ""head room"" at the top of the box, fill it with padding.  Use whatever packing materials are available for this.  [Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/JHp95.jpg) [Pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/MXytm.jpg).  The goal is to prevent the bottles from moving around at all inside the inner box.  The inner box prevents from the bottles from colliding with each other due to the box shaking around.

8. Now you can seal up the inner box.  After the box is taped shut, [place it inside a large garbage bag](http://i.imgur.com/T1V8V.jpg) and tie it tightly shut.  If anything breaks on the inside, the inner box will prevent the sharp glass from cutting the waterproof bag.  No leakage = no legal problems!

9.  Now you can move on to the outer box.  While the inner box is designed to prevent internal collision, the outer box is designed to prevent external collisions from damaging your shipment.  Find a box with [good clearance around your inner box in ALL 3 dimensions](http://i.imgur.com/54Hcr.jpg).

10. Pack a tight [1-2 inch layer of packing peanuts](http://i.imgur.com/Y0knv.jpg) on the bottom of the outer box.

11. Center the inner box on top of that layer and [tightly pack more peanuts around all four sides of it](http://i.imgur.com/5zgXG.jpg) until you reach the top of the inner box.  At this point make sure you've packed as much as you can around the sides.

12.  [Finish filling the outer box](http://i.imgur.com/j3qGM.jpg) with packing peanuts in as tightly as you can while still being able to close the flaps without bulging.

13. Seal the outer box well with packing tape.  I suggest using the common ""H"" taping procedure at a minimum.  I usually add more tape on top of that.  

14. Give your box a nice, swift kick with a steel toed boot!  Don't really do that.  But if you did, your bottles would most likely survive.

Kopi-Lewak Speedway Edition,tukey,17,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1ap139/lif_battleship_kopilewak_speedway_edition/,"Hello everyone, it has been a while since the last lottery-it-forward series was started.  To get this going again, I thought we could play a childhood favorite of mine: Battleship.

**What is This?**

A lottery it forward is a game of chance and/or skill where the reward is a free beer from the person hosting the game.  The hope is that the winner will pay it forward with their own lottery-it-forward sometime in the future.

**Who Can Play**

In order to limit the number of games I have to play to a reasonable number, I am going to restrict entry to users with **7 completed trades.**  I will only ship to addresses in the continental United States as well.  All entries must be submitted by Friday, March 22.

**How it works**

Below I will copy and paste an ASCII grid for players to place ships denoted by numbers given below.  All ships can only go in a straight, vertical or horizontal, line and cannot overlap.  You get to place the following five ships on the grid: 

1. Aircraft Carrier - Length = 5
2. Battleship - Length = 4
3. Submarine - Length = 3
4. Destroyer - Length = 3
5. Patrol Boat - Length = 2

Here is an example grid with boats placed:

    ___|_1_|_2_|_3_|_4_|_5_|_6_|_7_|_8_|_9_|_10|
    _A_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|

    _J_|_0_|_0_|_3_|_3_|_3_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_0_|

We will submit moves to each other through the email address battleshipLIF@gmail.com in the form of an ordered pair indicating a letter for the row and a number for the column.  Also each email should tell me if the last move I made was a hit or a miss.  Example email:

(B, 7) - Miss

The first person to sink all my ships will win the beer.  If all your ships have been sunk, you are out of the LIF.  I will use a different grid for each person, so you cannot collaborate with other players.  

**How to Enter**

Fill in the blank grid given below with your ships an email this grid with your reddit username in the subject line to battleshipLIFgrids@gmail.com.  The purpose of this is for me to verify a winner after my boats have been sunk.  Next send an email to battleshipLIF@gmail.com with your first move and your username in the subject line.

Of note, DontCountToday and CountOnTomorrow came in first and second, respectively.  This is of note because they are a couple (playing in separate rooms and not trading info).  They have, however, volunteered to give up their second place prize because of the obvious possible implication of collusion.  I watched them play the entire time, and they played competitively against each other.  They also took their leads by knocking out other players early on.  I do not believe they were colluding, but they graciously relinquished 2nd place prize regardless.  I thank them for the level of transparency and honesty they allowed in this and future games.

I suggest using the 10 player payout structure to resolve this little hiccup.  DontCountToday and CountOnTomorrow will split first place, FishBulbBrewer will take second, and dirtygrind will take third.

DontCountToday/CountOnTomorrow came in first and will be receiving:

Stone 10th Anniversary IPA, Sierra Nevada Life &amp; Limb 2, Boulevard Bourbon Barrel Quad, and 2011 Firestone Walker Sucaba

FishBulbBrewer came in second and will be receiving:

Founders Devil Dancer x2 and Freetail Ananke

dirtygrind came in third and will receive:

PM for address, package and send well, report to the mods for applicable reputation points, etc.  If you have any questions about who you are shipping to/who is shipping to you, please PM me.

* *Wants* are the beers that you are looking to obtain in a trade and *gots* are the beers that you have and are willing to trade away.

* Each r/beertrade member should have at most one post on this page, and it should simply be edited to update your wants/gots. 

* If you want to respond to someone's wants/gots, please PM them.  Don't reply here or you'll be asked to delete it.  This is strictly a profile page - please keep it clean and organized, to everyone's benefit.

**The Run Down**
This is the second month that I’ve done this for r/beertrade. 
To those new to the concept this is a group trade that operates very much like a secret santa...only with beer.  Every month we’ll add a theme to the trade: beer styles, seasonals, your favorite holiday beer, all suggestions are welcome. The only constant is that it is local to you. The trick here is we’ll assign regions so when names are picked we will choose from 6 different hats.  This is meant to be an introductory way for a larger group to participate. So if you’ve been sitting on the fence or have no idea how to get started this is for you.

**TRADING DETAILS**
 When you get assigned a name this will be your partner. I felt like people would be uncomfortable with me collecting a bunch of names and addresses to sort myself. So it is your responsibility to trade addresses and all other information needed to ship beer. For simplicity sake you and your partner are going to trade beer with each other. So instead of the traditional anonymous receiving that goes with secret santa, you’ll be in direct contact with them. This gives everyone accountability and also a chance to get to know your fellow beeritor. This will also hopefully establish a trade relationship for the future. My goal is this will help build our community and that it will also weed out the bum traders.

**DISCLAIMER**
  [Click here for rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/) - Also those who wish to participate must have an account 3+ months old and be within the continental 48 states

**SHIPPING** For advice on shipping [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE** Your account must be at least 3 months old. If you pass then you can send a message to me in this format:

* USER NAME
* CITY, STATE
* Suggestion for next month’s group trade

This needs to be sent to me by October 11th if we have not filled up by then. For this trade I will cut off at 50 people. If we manage to max out then I’ll raise the bar next month and we’ll figure out how to accommodate more people. When you receive your package send me a confirmation message so we can update the good trader list and keep track of who failed.

**DATES:**

•	10/10/2010 is the cut off for entry

•	10/12/2010 you will be assigned your partner

•	10/26/2010 this is the date you must ship by

**TRADE THEME**
The most popular suggestion from last month was fall seasonal. We’re talking pumpkin, marzens, oktoberfests, harvest ales, etc.  That should be plenty of room to play. I know a lot of you sent this last month for our free-for-all and to that I say look on the bright side, you’ll have a whole new partner this time (I’ll verify no one gets the same person from last time).  Pick a different brewery; send pumpkin ale instead of marzen.  The trading size is approximately 72oz. of beer.  If you want to hit that mark with a 6 pack, a growler, or bombers , I am fine with that.  How you trade is entirely between you and your partner.

**Extras**
As a side note it is not required but is customary to pack extras with your shipment. It doesn’t have to be anything major, generally coasters, something homemade, a loose bottle or 2 from other 6-packs, or something your area is known for. People like surprises almost as much as they like getting beer.  Plus it’s Halloween I’m sure you guys can come up with some creative.  Send candy that goes with the beer, dress up your bottles, pack it with little plastic spiders.  Your partners will thank you for going the extra mile.
questions/comments/suggestions/are always welcome.
If you experience any problems during the trade send a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade) and they will do all that is in their power to help make it right.

I want to trade with you!  And I need some help!  I would like to have most of the trades arranged a head of time, as planning this trip on my own is a logistical nightmare.  When I get home, I'm going to throw quite the party (or series of parties) with the stuff I traded for.  

If you are interested and willing to meet up (will mostly be at craft beer bars or comedy clubs...perhaps you even have a favorite place where everyone would like to meet).  Also if you contact me in advance, we can work out a more substantial trade if you want more than just a few cans.  

I have only arranged two trades thus far (which isn't looking good for my idea).  My plan B is to bring 4 packs with me into craft beer bars and hopefully trade for free drinks with the employees there, but I'd rather get stuff I can bring home and share with my friends/family.  

I'm looking to trade for pretty much anything.  My favorite style are imperial stouts, but I'm also a big IPA fan as well as anything with coffee/smoke flavors. 

If you contact me and we arrange a trade, I'll get e-mail or facebook info from you and a few days ahead of time I will contact you as a reminder and just let you know where I'll be the nights I am in town.  The only thing I cannot be flexible on are the dates I will be in certain towns.  Other than that, the point of this trip is to just hang out, have fun, meet people, and drink a ton of really, really good beer.  If you are willing to trade, I will work with you to figure it out.  

My schedule is as follows:
January 17-18th St. Louis, MO     
January 19th-20th Kansas City, MO

Again, this is just a feeler post, so let me know if that sounds high/low.

If we got 12 teams in the league, I thought the payout could go something like: 1st place gets 4 boxes, 2nd place gets 3 boxes, and 3rd place gets 2 boxes (all boxes coming from the 4-12 ranked teams).  This could be changed if necessary as well.

I think the draft would be sometime in late August/early September, but like I said before, this is all open for discussion.

Let me know if you would be interested!

**Update** : Based on the responses so far I would say we are definitely doing a league.  Here's what I'm thinking right now:

I'd like to keep it at 12 teams, I think that would be a good league size.

Please hear me out.,Triangular_Desire,16,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1e4qds/proposal_for_any_central_nc_beer_lovers_please/,"I wasnt to sure where to ask this, I figured r/beertrade is as good a place as any. Im seeking a 2011 or a 2010 Darklord for my annual stout day. I havent had any luck locating one. 

The Proposal:
Come to my Stout day with your Darklord and you will have the oppurtunity to join in on the tasting of the hundreds of other beers that will be there. So far we have a 3 year vertical of Brooklyn Black ops '10-'12, 3 years of Old Rasputin Barrel Aged '09-'11, every Yeti made going back to '10. 3 years vertical of DF Worldwide Stout '09-12. 2 years of Mother Earth Silent Night. We'll have a few 3 floyds Mokolo milk stouts, and a lot more. Too many to list in fact and Im not sure what all everyone will be bringing yet as the party isnt until July 14th. 

All you need to do is show up with your Darklord to share. There will be about 15 of us beer nerds. More beer than anyone needs and plenty of good food.

If you have a '11 or earlier Darklord and think this is something you might want to do shoot me a PM and we can chat about it. 

Thanks for reading, I know this is a pretty random request.

To those who are seasoned traders and to those of you who are new to this welcome to the glamorous world of Beer of the Month Club.  

**How it Works**

What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

* Step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your information.

* Step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with. So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

* Step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, what your interested in, what you're not, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing. It's meant to open up a dialogue.

* Step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone. It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

* Step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence(beer porn) in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

* Step 6: Drink beer.

**DISCLAIMER** 

Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.
There are plenty microbreweries across the country; you probably live near one that a lot of us never hear about. Those are the kinds of beers we trade here. We have people that cover all corners of the country and this will be your chance to trade with one of them at random.

**What's involved**

We trade at least 72 oz. of beer (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, 3 bombers and a 12oz, a growler and a 12 oz., or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.)
Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you. You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates. If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it. If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.
I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time. Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute. If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day. I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping. 

**Theme**

This theme is of course Halloween.  So send your partner some awesome Fall/Halloween beers, scary labels, candy to pair with the beer you send, the more creative the better.  Have fun with it.  

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up have an active account at least 3 months old. This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.
If you have read the above and are still on board, awesome here's what you need to do. Send me a PM with the following information by Monday September 29th.

* Your Reddit handle (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

* Your City and State (This is all I want, so I know where to assign your region. I am not collecting addresses.)

* Your e-mail (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:
SatansLH

Woodway, TX

SatansLH@gmail.com 

**Note: Ship First Rule.** This is something we are enforcing this time around to help protect everyone from shady trading. For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first. The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end. This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you, as I will do my best to assign you with an experienced trader. If you and your partner both have trade reputation then fire at will. I will inform you upon partner assignments of you or your partner’s probationary status.  This goes the same for if you both you and your trading partner have 0 reputation.  I will try hard not to let this happen but last time that’s how the numbers played out.

**IMPORTANT DATES**

* Thursday September 29th, 2011 the last day for sign-ups

* By October  1st, 2011 you will have partners assigned, probably earlier

* October 17th, 2011 the ship by date. This is the absolute last day you should be shipping.

That gives you 2 weekends to procure beer, pack, and ship. That is more than enough time and gives a big of window for our probationary members to ship by. It is your responsibility to get your package on it's way in time.

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the Trading and Packaging Tips Section
The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, bottle openers, coasters, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

**Personal Note**

My apologies to all those who were afraid I fell off the planet.  I really do love this community and I wish to continue to be a part of it.  I have just been extremely busy,poor, and consumed with RL stuff.  The one nice thing that comes with the beginning of the fall semester is a sense of order amongst the chaos so I promise you all that you will see more BoTM clubs as long as you guys want to keep having them.  I may not be able to afford to participate in all of em but the least I can do is organize them.  I know quite  a few of you were ready to take up the mantle and I sincerely appreciate it.  I'd like to get other members involved but to be honest it's really kind of a one man process until the response becomes overwhelming.  Until then just know that I sincerely appreciate the support from everyone, cockold, ghenna, myheadhurtsalot, and familynight especially.

As founders and moderators of /r/beertrade, familynight and myself are happy to see so many successful trades and so many happy traders. However, we feel that this subreddit is getting to the size where these posts are beginning to dilute the content and beginning to push actual ISO/FT posts down the page.

Because of this, we are changing our policy regarding trade summaries. From this point forward, they will no longer be seen as appropriate content and you will be asked to remove any such posts. The only exceptions to this rule are official BotM Haul posts and any posts that focus on valuable information that other traders might find useful. 

The flip side of this announcement is that we are encouraging you all to post pictures of your successful trades to /r/beerporn, where they will be most appreciated.

Edit: By request, there will now be a monthly successful trades thread, linked in the side-bar.  All trade summaries should be posted there.  A new thread will be started by a moderator each month, and the prior month's thread will be linked to from the new thread.  If you look to the side bar, March 2011's trade thread has been posted.

I'm not trying to be greedy, but just want to make sure my time and effort are taken in to consideration. 

For the most part I understand a trade to be monetarily even. You spend $25 on your beer, I spend $25 on my beer and we trade. What about beer that is hard to come by? For example (and maybe this isn't a good one) Founders KBS will be going on sale shortly. Its a very limited run and seems to a bit high on the want list. However to even be able to buy it, you first have to be lucky enough to get a ticket for the privilege of buying it, then you have to arrive on the right day to buy it, then its sold in limited quantities at that.  In the end its only $5 a bottle. To me the new guy here it doesn't seem unreasonable to  ask a little more for the time and effort it takes to get it. Also, I'd be trading away the opportunity for me to drink it because I might not get it again until next year if I'm lucky then too. 

Am I being a jerk for thinking such a way? 

Edit: Thank you all. This discussion helped me put in to words better than I did above. My thoughts were $5 of KBS is not worth $5 in Budweiser. Likewise I wasn't trying to say $5 in KBS was worth $25 in Budweiser. I just wondered what the proper way to trade a rarer beer was. As I said I'm a noob and in hindsight ya....a rare for a rare does make sense. I just didn't want to get screwed. And yes I understand they have tripled the production of KBS this year and it won't be that ""rare"", but being as I drive by Founders twice a day and the tickets go on sale this weekend, it was foremost in my mind to use as an example.

Juliusseizure defeated morequinn for 3rd place and 2 prize boxes.

There also were weekly contests such as most defense points, least bench points, etc.  The 3 who did the best in those weekly contests throughout the year (not including 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place who already will receive prize boxes) will receive 1 box each.  Those people were: morequinn, OldNintendood, and thermic.

Following is a summary of the prize winners and their shipping partners:

* dirtygrind **(1st)** will be receiving boxes from: FishBulbBrewer, jfmamj, OldNintendood, and bunkrock

* bunkrock **(2nd)** will be receiving boxes from: thermic, familynight, and DrWalterWhite

Also, if you are in the Chicago area, let me know in the offer so we can perhaps just make the trade in person and not have to deal with shipping. 

Some beers I would like to try, but just suggestions to give you an idea of what I'm looking for:

Three Floyds- Dark Lord

Goose Island- Bourbon County Anything, King Henry

Founders- CBS, KBS

Great Lakes- Barrel Aged Blackout Stout

Once sign-ups are complete I will email everyone with a link to a Google Doc showing the order of shipping. You will be responsible for contacting the next person on the list to get their shipping info. If you want, please also include your preferred styles of beer or any style you don't like.

I have quite a few rhizomes that i am not going to be able to use.  I have some I dug up last fall when I was putting the garden to bed, and I also have some that i dug up yesterday and today while prepping the garden for this season.

I have a ton of cascade, less centennial, and even less chinook.  The rhizomes are from three very strong vines going into their sixth season.  

The rhizomes I dug up today are already growing and should take off when they are put in the ground.  The rhizomes from last fall have been stored in the fridge in plastic freezer bags with moist paper towels.  I can't guarantee their viability but they should be fine.

All I ask for these is to be reimbursed for shipping, and of course I would accept beer towards that end :p.  Let me know if interested.

I have read the ""[Read First](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/)"" but still have one big question:

How do you recommend a novice gauge value in a trade? I would most likely be FT-ing some older stuff (e.g. Oud Beersel Oude Gueuze Vieille 1999) or limited stuff (Bitches Brew, Allagash Vrienden) but ISO-ing some stuff that is pretty common, just not in my region (e.g. Russian River, Cantillon).

It is always $4$ or is there some resource/method to placing value.

To be clear: I am not afraid of getting ""ripped off"" as value is obviously subjective and I have the power to take or leave any trade based on my own value perceptions. I just want to avoid insulting or wasting the time of potential trade partners with a skewed rookie perspective.

Thanks!

PS here's my list and I will post to Wants/Gots pending some insight on the above.

Posting this again to see if there's enough interest to get it off the ground.  If not, we might have to scratch the event. :(

If you have ever seen “Survivor”, the TV show, you already know the general format.  We'll start with 16 players total, and players will be eliminated one-by-one until there is a lone survivor remaining.  Immunity challenges will be held at scheduled dates.  The winner(s) of the challenges will be immune to elimination for that round.  Players then vote for the person they would like to eliminate.  The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.

Hope we haven't lost anyone yet.  Here are some more specific details.  We'll start with 16 players, divided into two tribes of 8 people.  The first six immunity challenges will be team challenges.  That is, one entire tribe will win immunity after each challenge, while the other tribe must vote one of their members out of the game.  When we're down to 10 total players, we'll merge tribes and all immunity challenges will become individual challenges, meaning that only one person will win immunity after each challenge.  Players eliminated in challenges #8-14 will form the Tribal Council, and will ultimately help decide the winner of the Survivor BIF.

Still with me?  Great!  If you're interested in participating, here are a few criteria we'd like to make sure you meet.  We realize they're a bit stricter than most BIFs, but there's a lot more involved in this one, and we want to make sure that all players will be able to fully participate.

* You live in the 48 contiguous United States.
* You have completed 5 or more trades on /r/beertrade.
* You are capable of using and posting photographs to Reddit, Imgur, and Untappd.
* You can successfully sign into and use the [Snoonet IRC #beer channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/beer?nick=kiwi_?).
* You can successfully sign into and use Java-based Yahoo! Games.
* You are willing to send the equivalent of a [Poker BIF ante](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As0-XY7YSsEXdERLS3I2bmxZT1hlRlZ3bF9YMkUzNGc#gid=8) and some nice local beer to a participant who places highly.
* You will have the time to actively participate in this BIF over its duration (maybe a month or so?).  The challenges won't require you to be glued to your computer, but each one will require at least some level of participation.  

**If you meet the above criteria and are still interested, [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=statball) with your e-mail address saying that you'd like to participate.**

If you have any questions, please post in the comments!  I've probably left off some important details somewhere in this wall of text.  Looking forward to finally getting this BIF started!

I did several trades like this in the past on BeerAdvocate - - until they changed their rules. This work is usually just sold, so this painting does have a price ($250), but I'm very willing to negotiate and I wouldn't expect that much value in beer. I'm all for trading for any off-the-shelf stuff I don't have access to in the NW, but if someone is interested in trading rarer beer (or aged beer), I'd be happy to discount the painting even further. I have a ""wants"" list on BA under the username ""caninedevotion,"" but I'm also open to suggestions. 

I also have an oil painting of MoaS bottles and two cheaper mixed-media paintings - a Thomas Hardy and a Traquair House that I may also be willing to trade if anyone is interested.

[](/REP1EXAMPLE) is a Reputation badge.  The number of '+'s in the badge represents which [reputation level](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/blrov/how_the_reputation_system_works/) you are currently at.

----

[](/hopbadge) (the hop cone) is the Community Service badge that is given out at the moderators' discretion.  Current owners of the Community Service badge are:  
  
[LambTaco](/user/LambTaco) - For helping to create and for moderating beertrade.   
[familynight](/user/familynight) - For helping to create and for moderating beertrade.  
[SatansLH](/user/SatansLH) - For organizing the Beer of the Month Club, which accounts for a large amount of r/beertrade's trade volume.  

----

[](/tradewarrior) is the Trade Warrior badge.  This is given to beertrade members who, despite having had a shipping company break all or part of a shipment, have replaced the damaged bottles and have kept on trading.  Thanks for being awesome, guys.

----

[](/repking) is the Reputation King badge.  Only one person can possess this at a given time.  The trader with the most reputation points temporarily claims this badge.

The reputation system is based on points. 

* You earn 1 point each time you complete a trade with someone.
* Participating in moderator-sponsored community trading events will give additional reputation points.  Rep points for group trades are updated all at once after the group trade is completed.
* If someone is falsely claiming a trade with you, **please message the moderators** so we can take the appropriate action.

Reputation points translate into a reputation level.  There are 5 reputation levels:

* Level 1 - 1 point
* Level 2 - 5 points
* Level 3 - 10 points
* Level 4 - 40 points
* Level 5 - 100+ points

We will maintain a centralized list of everyone's reputation (see sidebar), and it will also show up next to your names when you post in r/beertrade (if you are viewing with Firefox3/IE8 and have custom styles turned on).

Hello Everyone,

I'm new to beer trade, and though I've been living in Wisconsin most of my life, I'm moving away. I thought it would be great to take advantage of our great New Glarus beers before I move to get some things I might have not tried. I have access to the following:

* Strawberry Rhubarb 
* Raspberry Tart 
* Serendipity 
* Wild Sour Ale 
* Two Women (Little known but I love it) 
* Moon Man (My personal favorite for just relaxing) 
* Spotted Cow 
* Edel Pils 
* Dancing Man 
* Black Top 
* Totally Naked

I'm game to try anything that I couldn't easily get in Wisconsin. I lived in DC for a bit too, so I don't have much interest in DC Brau or DFH. I'm personally not much of a lambic or fruit beer person, but I'm younger and haven't tried enough to be an expert on taste, so I'll outline my general likes: IPAs, Coffee Stouts, Chocolate Stouts

Never had Hoptimum or Hop Stoopid. I have a trade in the works for Pliny the Elder and other Russian River current beers. My all-time favorite beer was the Lips of Faith Cocoa molé.

Let me know if you want to trade and what you think I'd like, and we can see if we can work something out before I move!",,False,self,t5_2rgco,1374549812.0,,,True,t3_1itzos,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/1itzos/ft_ng_strawberry_rhubarb_wild_sour_ale_edel_pils/,

Again, up for grabs are three 750ml bottles (1 each) from Jester King Craft Brewery:

* [Das Wunderkind! Sour Saison](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-das-wunderkind/156094/)

* [Thrash Metal Farmhouse Strong Ale](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-thrash-metal-farmhouse-strong-ale/161248/)

* [Jester King/Mikkeller Drink'in the Sunbelt](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-mikkeller-drinkin-the-sunbelt/141252/)

The Rules:

1. Lower 48 US states only. Sorry Alaska and Hawaii (and other countries).

2. Please don't play if you have/had regular access to these beers (e.g., most of Texas).

3. If you win, start your own [/r/beertrade](/r/beertrade) LIF in a timely fashion to keep the love going!

4. (changed from statball's LIF) To win, you must be listed on the reputation list in the sidebar OR have a ratebeer.com or beeradvocate.com trading history. Sorry to any new members, but this will give some reassurance that the LIF has a reasonable chance to continue.

**How to win this LIF**: Be the first to guess the beer (and brewery) represented by the **[snippets I have cropped from the beer's label.

**[Clues 1 &amp; 2](http://i.imgur.com/34UR6.jpg)** &lt;--posted 2/12

**[Clues 3 &amp; 4](http://i.imgur.com/hfKyr.jpg)** **NEW!**

I will be posting more sections of the beer label every day until the correct beer and brewery is guessed. You get one guess per clue (honor system here, people, no alternate accounts!). This beer/brewery may or may not be related to the beers being given away.

Good luck, and cheers!

I did several trades like this in the past on BeerAdvocate - - until they changed their rules.

I'm all for trading for any off-the-shelf stuff I don't have access to in the NW, but if someone is interested in trading rarer beer (or aged beer), I'd be happy to discount the painting even further.

1313597622.0,10,self.beertrade,jlpno,"Group Trade: Local growler trade, round 2! Details inside.",myheadhurtsalot,14,4,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/jlpno/group_trade_local_growler_trade_round_2_details/,"Last year, the illustrious familynight and LambTaco set up a growler trade ring [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/c8317/group_trade_local_growler_trade_details_inside/), and I think I speak for everyone who participated when I say that it was a fun and different spin on beer trading, and I want to do it again.

Here is the basic premise: this is not a traditional beer trade, with two partners swapping brews across the country, this is a Beer it Forward (henceforth to be known as BIF), where the first person (I guess that would be me this time) selects a member of the trade ring to receive the next growler. Once that person has received their leg of the trade, they then select a member to continue the trade with, and so on and so forth until the ring completes. 

The idea is to send a local favorite that isn't available in the area of the recipient. Try to choose beers that aren't bottled or widely distributed. The max growler price will be $25, but any growler will do. Just don't be upset if you get a cheaper growler - there are some great beers that have very low growler prices.

The bare necessity is one 64 oz growler of local brew, but extras are encouraged (who doesn't like getting surprise beers?). 

Because of the lengthy time inherent in a trade ring like this, sign ups will be limited to 10 traders. If you can't commit to shipping your beer within a few days of receiving your shipment, then please do not sign up, as we don't want people waiting for their growlers 3 months down the road. Sign ups will also be limited to traders with established reputation, sorry newbies.

Obviously communication is key to making this work - make sure you get in contact with your trade recipient as soon as possible to find out where their tastes lie and to get all of their pertinent shipping info. I will maintain a trade list to monitor the progress of the trades - please post your updates to this thread (with beer porn preferably).

So - anybody interested? Please respond with your city, and your likes/dislikes, and let's get this BIF moving!

Cheers!

EDIT: Well damn, that filled up quick! I'm leaving it at 10 members for this round, if the trades go quickly, I may do this again with a larger pool. Thanks to those who have joined, I'll be sending you some further information shortly!

Since I don't have the beer yet, there is some element of chance.  However, barring car problems or catastrophes, I will come home with some excellent beer for trade.

Happily, I have room in the beer budget for two growlers.  I want to generate more interest in the subreddit and get things moving a bit, so this will really be two trades, and I'd prefer to trade with people who haven't ever tried this beer.

That said, I'm not quite sure how to handle picking trading partners, given the apparent interest.  My normal wants list would probably limit things overmuch.  While I love a lot of the silly rare fanciness, I want to keep things open to people who don't have access to the top-rated, imperial, barrel-aged whatever.  I was thinking that maybe I'll just go with whoever fulfills my short list of requirements and gets the most upvotes or something.  It's a flawed system, but if you have a great reason to get it (or a better idea!), say so.

I'm not looking for anything particular in return, though I dearly love sours.  I like to review, so I'll only accept beers that I haven't tried and can't get.  I'd prefer beers that are good and local to you with limited distribution.

The growlers are $44 each (includes new growler fee), and I'd like the trade to be dollar-for-dollar.  If you want to include homebrew, just make a reasonable estimate or something.  And if you want a bottle or two of fresh Pliny the Elder/Blind Pig, that can be arranged.

I would appreciate if people looking to trade would fill out a wants/gots post.  I acknowledge the hypocrisy there, as I haven't filled one out yet.  I guess I'll also limit it to redditors who have had an account for at least a few months.  Finally and sorry about this one, USA only - it's a shipping cost/time issue.

I might have forgotten something.  I'm a tad inebriated.

Edit:  I was going to post in /r/beer and get some more interest, but I've had a string of computer issues keeping me mostly off reddit.  So, I'm not quite sure how I'll pick trading partners, now.  It's open to everybody at this point, for one thing.  Maybe, I'll pick randomly or something, roll a die.

Edit #2:  I got just about the last two new growlers at the brewpub.  They're currently full of Pliny the Younger and sitting in my fridge.  Since only six people have shown interest (my fault for not posting to /r/beer), I'm just going to roll a pair of dice.  Rolling... ... ... ... ...1 and 2.  Huh.  Should have just picked by upvotes.  Well, if I don't get responses from them, I'll pick someone new.  Sorry for not being able to get more growlers and for my general disorganization - things have been hectic recently.

http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f69/stone-ruination-clone-155771/

Which agrees with:
http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/medium/StoneRecipe1.jpg

It is nearly identically done to the recipe, fermentation was at 67-68F with WLP001.  The OG came out to 1.071 and went to 1.012 7.74% ABV.  Stone Ruination is supposed to be at 7.7% ABV.  Dry hopped at 70-72 F for a week.  

Same hop bill, dry malt extract instead of grain.  This should be really close to identical, if the recipe is good (50 or so pages of forum talk indicates it is).

My goal: Compare my homebrew with the Stone original so I can taste if its close.  Just for fun.

What you get: One homebrew for each Ruination, and a fun taste test of a homebrew copy of a beer you probably love.  If you're interested I can give you a copy of my brewing notes.

Let me know if you are interested,  I bottle today or tomorrow, will let it condition and carb up for two weeks, crack one at two weeks to make sure its good, and send it to you ready to drink--There's a bit of a lead time.

FT: Just about anything by some of the top Michigan breweries, Founders, Bells, New Holland, Brewery Vivant, Short's, Dark Horse, Arcadia, etc. Being in GR means it would be easy for me to ship a growler/brewery swag from the locals, like Founders, Vivant, or even some of the newcomers like Grand Rapids Brewing Co., Perrin (the next big MI brewery, in my opinion), even Odd Side, Old Boys, etc; and of course the right offer that would give me an excuse to head an hour out to Bell's or Dark Horse would be carefully considered.

Also have some great bottle shops by me, so if you're looking for something by a brewery from a neighboring state, just drop me a line. Too many to list here, but I'd be happy to provide lists of what I have access to if there's something specific you seek.

While I'm not necessarily looking for whales, I do have bottles of '12 and '13 KBS that I'd be willing to move for the right offer.

Recently shipped a trade out to a fellow redditor.  'Twas 2 HF growlers, and 3 additional bottles.  The FedEx folks apparently delivered it to the wrong address (wrong street and wrong #).  The address written on the package was correct, they literally took it to the wrong street and building.

When it arrived, the folks who received it are claiming that the packaging materials were mostly gone, and the two growlers were not in the box.  It was one large box that had all 5 items in it.

The fellow redditor believes that the growlers may have leaked, and FedEx opened the box, removed the leaking products, and finished shipping the rest.  

My question is, has anybody come across FedEx opening their package, removing part of it, but shipping the rest on its way?  I'm finding that extremely hard to believe that they'd allow SOME beer to be delivered, but not all of it.

In addition, is there anything we can do to verify this story with FedEx somehow?",,False,self,t5_2rgco,False,,repLevel3,True,t3_164p6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/164p6l/issue_with_fedex_delivery/,

Let me explain: a local pet shop makes animal ID tags out of bottle caps, and they are terrific. Friends and family are very impressed. Thus, holiday gift ideas abound. I want to give those with animals new tags from their favorite or local breweries.

Problem: I'm in Florida, which is good and bad. NONE of my friends and family breweries are available here.

I am in search of a specific list of bottle CAPS - usually from very common beers:

* New Belgium (Classic NB logo with the bike) (x2 - 4)
* ODell (x2)
* Allagash White
* New Glarus (specifically Spotted Cow)
* From Chicago: Half Acre or Revolution (do they bottle/have individual caps?)

Here's the challenge/caveat : the caps can *not* be bent - they need to be pried off the bottles with care so as to bend them as minimally as possible for the maker to use them. So:

I'm willing to do a **bottle-for-bottle** trade for equivalents available here, -OR- **trade bottle caps**, if that's your game, -OR- **pay** a small bit of money per cap and shipping.

Looking to do this ASAP so that I can get them made and delivered by the holidays. To make it a bit easier on me, if you're willing to trade for 2 or more of the above it would help.

Thanks!

This was my first time shipping to Canada though but my tradee insisted he has done several trades all with no issues at all. I had to list the items as candles because they insisted I give a description and all. It also cost a ton of money to ship from Chicago. Well this morning I wake up to check the status and it is this:

There is an inadequate description of the merchandise. More documentation required.

I did give all my contact info so I expect I will receive a phone call though I do not know for sure. Whats process am I looking at dealing with here? Anyone have a similar experience shipping to CA? I imagine that there is no point in lying any longer (or should I never admit I knew there was beer lol). Options!

Edit

OK I called the international shipping department of UPS and they asked just for more description of the contents. Following advice from several places (http://biergotter.org/intltips.shtml) I told her that I believe the young man at the UPS store did not ask for enough information, and provided her with a Harmonized Code - 701310 - ""Of glass-ceramics"" and a general description of ""collectible glassware."" She added all the info, and asked for my contact info and also if I had the receiver’s phone number, which I did not provide. I do not know why they would be talking to that person, but I would hope it is only to ask him to come pick it up. They then said that someone would likely get back to me by tomorrow morning. Don’t know what it all means

Edit 2

Sweet baby Jesus the package is now In Transit and on time! I received a call from a blocked phone number and didnt answer, but no message was left.

So here it is!  Up for grabs are three 750ml bottles (1 each) from Jester King Craft Brewery:

* [Das Wunderkind! Sour Saison](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-das-wunderkind/156094/)

* [Thrash Metal Farmhouse Strong Ale](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-thrash-metal-farmhouse-strong-ale/161248/)

* [Jester King/Mikkeller Drink'in the Sunbelt](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jester-king-mikkeller-drinkin-the-sunbelt/141252/)

1. Lower 48 US states only. Sorry Alaska and Hawaii (and other countries).

2. Please don't play if you have/had regular access to these beers (e.g., most of Texas).

3. If you win, start your own [/r/beertrade](/r/beertrade) LIF in a timely fashion to keep the love going!

4. (changed from statball's LIF) To win, you must be listed on the reputation list in the sidebar OR have a ratebeer.com or beeradvocate.com trading history. Sorry to any new members, but this will give some reassurance that the LIF has a reasonable chance to continue.

But acrocanthosaurus, how do I win those delicious beverages?  The rules, my friend, are quite simple. 

**How to win this LIF**: Be the first to guess the beer (and brewery) represented by the **[snippets I have cropped from the beer's label](http://i.imgur.com/34UR6.jpg)** (you may need to zoom in). 

I will be posting more sections of the beer label to this post every day until the correct beer and brewery is guessed. You get one guess per clue (honor system here, people, no alternate accounts!) This beer/brewery may or may not have any relation to the beers being given away.

Good luck, and cheers!

This is an extremely special brew that many can appreciate. Only sold in very limited quantities at their anniversary party on 11/12/2011, this is a collaboration between Three Floyds, Surly, Struise, and Mikeller.

From the bottle: *""This massive stout is the combined effort of Three Floyds, Surly, Struise and Mikeller. Literally, we brewed Darklord, Darkness, Black Albert and Beer Geek Brunch with our friends at our brewery and blended them. This is a celebration of, not only our fifteen years, but also the international craft brewing industry and those of you that support it. Cheers and thanks, FFF.""*

I am really only looking to trade a bottle or two of these for some of the three Dogfish Head beers in the title; 120 Minute, Olde School, Burton Baton. I am not looking for anything super fancy, but bear in mind one or two bottles isn't going to cut it.  These bottles are already reaching $70+ each on ebay.

**EDIT: Since there seems to be some confusion on what I'm looking to get for this beer, mostly through my own fault, heres some more detail...** The cash value alone for this bottle is $40 ($30 + 1/3 of a $30 ticket). That doesn't include the 4 hour wait in line or the rarity of the beer in general. Firstly, I'm not concerned with age of the beer I'm looking to get. When it comes to Olde School or Burton Baton, I would need multiple 4-packs of these. When it comes to 120 Minute, I'm looking for at least a 4-pack of this.


I do also have a couple of the rare barrel aged beers from Floyds that I got at the XV Anniversary. I'm not completely against trading them, but it will take a special trade for one of these. I have a single bottle of Barrel Aged 'Owd Engwish' (157 of 261) and a single bottle of 'Cuvee du Viking' (384 of 386).
