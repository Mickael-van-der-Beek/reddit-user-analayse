I just got back to Australia from a holiday to the US. It was the first time I had ever been to the US and I went to New York, Philly, Baltimore, DC, Richmond and Charlotte. 

I just wanted to say that I absolutely loved Philadelphia! It was by far my favourite city. I loved everything about it, and it is the city I am missing the most. Those of you who live there are extremely lucky, and I can't wait to come back and visit again as soon as I can.

Cheers

If you've ever walked by there, we're the ones with all the motorcycles and the gigantic yellow Pikachu in the window.  The fire alarm went off as I was painting the cabinets and she was vacuuming.  Thinking it was nothing I poked my head outside and saw nothing.  Assuming it our neighbor's terrible cooking skills I knocked on all the doors to get them to open their windows.  We then smelled smoke and I put on a helmet and gloves and ran around to see if something was on fire.

We stepped outside and noticed white smoke coming from the metal storm doors going into the basement.  The landlord walked by and calmly told us that he had a small fire in the basement and proceeded to walk inside. She grabbed her purse and I grabbed one of my cameras thinking we would be displaced for a couple of hours at most.

That was the last time we would ever step foot inside that aparment.  It was smokey when I ran back in to grab my camera bag and harddrive with all of my work on it.  She didn't think to get any of her stuff and we left the motorcycles parked where they were (though in hindsight we should have moved them).

Smoke started billowing through the cracks quicker and quicker and you can see in the photos that the fabric is beginning to burn and turn the smoke a yellow / orange color.  Pikachu is still waiting to be rescued at this point.

We hear breaking glass and see pikachu ripped out of the window, too bad for him.  At this point all firefighters are gathered downstairs sending up 3 ladders to the different windows on the second floor.  This does not look good but there's still hope that we will be able to get in and grab some stuff.  At worst we figure we'll have to replace our furniture and repaint the walls.

It is atone point that I notice the roses on the kitchen table become engulfed in flame and at that point I knew it was all over.  We watched flames start licking at the ceilings, at the equipment, at the cabinets, everywhere.  We stepped away and went to New Wave and came back an hour and a half later to find that the wall had collapsed and a man had lost his life battling the fire.

The first 15 or so photos are from the fire, ignore all the rest.

I could make a post at the end of the week with what I know is happening and you folks can comment with anything I missed? I follow upcoming concerts pretty closely so I'd have that down as well as bar events. However, I'm not too knowlegeable on some activities, like events in the comedy scene so I'd need help! Thoughts? 


Also, instead of making another post, I would love to make an updated spreadsheet for Philadelphia happy hours. Anyone want to help? That is, if there isn't an updated one that I don't know about. A while back, there was that google docs one floating around but I can't find it at work. The specials were outdated and a lot of the bars listed don't exist anymore.


**EDIT**: Awesome! Lots of positive feedback. I'll start this weekend, see how we like it, get feedback, etc. 


Also, thank you caoimhinn for finding the old spreadsheet! It's giving me something to work off of. Happy Hour spreadsheet is now in the works. I'm currently listing bars and their locations; I'll format it so you can sort by neighborhood and day. I'll see how far along I get in the next few days (I seriously underestimated the amount of bars in the city!) and then upload it to GoogleDocs. There's a lot of information to fill in but I'll try to get the majority of it if I can. I'm sure I will leave out some bars though so you'll all have to let me know which ones I missed! 


**EDIT #2**: [Philly Weekly](http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/drink/guide/happy-hour/) has a Happy Hour guide apparently. I just browsed through it; I'm not sure how current it is (some closed bars are on there) and it seems like a lot of bars I'd like to include aren't listed. There are also a ton of different neighborhoods listed; I think I'd like it more broad. So, my question: scrap that idea since it kind of exists, or move forward? Here is what I have this far: [The Sunday tab on the bottom](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Asi2A-7i6ObQdDAtQTlIbGRKY2dPVUVOd29IZUFXbGc) has all the bars listed. The neighborhoods may be a little off, I'll go through and make them more accurate.

My friend Kevin was shot in the neck during a robbery in Northern Liberties on November 15th. He is still in critical condition. His spine was shattered and the fear of him becoming a quadraplegic is almost certain.

If anyone has any information, please please please let the detectives know. Also, Kevin's usual route home from the Piazza (where he was) is down 2nd street, right on Brown St, and left on Bodine Street. He lives on the corner of Fairmount and Bodine. If anyone along the way has cameras, please let the detectives know. Thank you.

Police Report:
Please be advised that last night, Tuesday, 11/15/11, 2:46 AM, 6th District police responded to 911 calls of a person shot in the 700 block N. Bodine St. Upon arrival, police found a local resident lying on the ground outside 714 N. Bodine with a gunshot wound to the neck. Fire Medic unit #15 transported the victim to Hahnemann Hospital where he was listed in critical condition. Police were able to ascertain from the victim that he was walking home after going to a local bar to get something to eat, drink and watch the Monday Night football game. On the way home he was confronted by an armed male during an apparent hold up and was shot. The offender was described only as a short black male who fled south on Bodine St. Central Detective Division is investigating and is looking for possible video cameras in the area that may have captured the incident, victim or offender. Any information may be called into the Special Investigations Unit ,at 215-686-3047 or Central Detective Division at 215-686-3093, or 3094.

EDIT: NBC has released a picture and video of the suspect:

Now, let's begin. I am out today running errands. One such errand was getting a decent sized amount ($200) of cash out of the atm. Instead of putting this away in my wallet, I thrust it into a pocket in my purse. 

Later, while walking down the street and checking my phone, I hear someone shouting something. But hey, it's Philly, so I ignore it and stay in my distracted phone-gazing state. 

The shouting gets closer, and I see two women walking toward me saying, ""Your cash! You dropped your cash!"" And these two women handed me my cash. I guess it had fallen out while I was pulling out my phone. 

I was dumbstruck, and started thanking them profusely, but like the true Philadelphians they were, they just said, ""You're welcome"" and moved on. I realized a few minutes later that I should have given them something, but it was obviously too late. 

30 minutes later I decide to stop into Wendy's for a bite...and guess who is in line? The women who had just saved my ass big time. I offer to buy them lunch, and after a second they accept. I know a stupid fast food lunch isn't much, but it made my day that I was able to do something. 

Lately my funds have been VERY tight, and I have no idea what I would have done if I had lost that cash. These two people saved my entire month, and I wish I had the money to give them more.

In response to the recent leaks pertaining to NSA wiretapping, a subreddit was created, /r/restorethefourth, to begin organizing protests for July 4th. I noticed on the list of protest locations that Philadelphia was not yet included. 

If enough of us have interest in putting something like this together for our city, it'd be great to start discussing potential locations and getting the requisite permits if needed.

We spent most of our time at the Children's Hospital as a very large tumour was found on our then-gestating child.  We only saw the Liberty Bell and got a tour of the city by a wonderful cab driver who picked us up at the hospital and decided we needed to see more of the city than the hospital.  He was great.  Showed us a lot of the city at no charge.  Nice to meet someone with such pride in his city.

Anyways, my wife and I loved the city.  We swore we would come back one day.  It has been ten years.  We have a beautiful and healthy 9-year-old girl and she has 6-year-old twin sisters. 

We hope to come this summer.  I like your Visitor's Guide suggestions for the family. If you have any other suggestions (like something new since the VG was written) or a good family friendly (and reasonable) hotel that would be welcome.

This is mostly just a statement of appreciation for your city.  And just my way of saying ""Thanks for being awesome, Philly.""",,False,self,t5_2qh24,False,,,True,t3_sh67w,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/sh67w/my_philadelphia_story/,

Nelson Mandela Myers, a 27-year-old sanitation worker and foster father of two, was the one who found her. She had been sexually assualted and then pushed outside into the freezing night in a t-shirt, and Myers heard her whimpering under a playground slide, at 5 a.m. as he walked to work. He stayed with her, wrapping her in his coat and comfortingher, until police came, and in short order he was called a hero and told he would receive the $10,000 reward for information leading to her recovery. More than three months later, while he and his wife struggle to pay bills, the city is jacking them around and ignoring their phone calls, and they haven't received a penny. ['Samaritan' who found Na'illa lives up to his famous name](http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-17/news/36396399_1_janie-myers-sanitation-worker-police-superintendent-michael-chitwood) | three months later: [Man who found abducted girl still hasn't received his reward](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/dncrime/Man-who-found-abducted-girl-still-hasnt-received-his-reward.html) | 1 week later: [Where's Nelson Mandela's money?](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20130405_Where_s_Nelson_Mandela_s_money_.html)

Actually, the ""brush off"" implies they're ignoring him. Last week the city informed him he needed to bring his whole family down to city hall, at the Myers' expense, for reasons they wouldn't divulge, a trip that had to be aborted when one of their children lost part of a finger in an accident on the way down. They still haven't been told why they had to go to a meeting about the check. Stay classy, Philly.

They will be using the same pollution-causing drilling practices that have repeatedly poisoned water supplies all over our country, as highlighted in the documentary Gasland. In addition the gas industry will be using [military-style 'Psy Ops'](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/m629d/oil_executive_militarystyle_psy_ops_experience_to/) on those who demand clean water, so this will be a difficult fight. We need calls to come from all over the nation and we need people from all over the region to come out in protest on Nov 21st.

The Delaware River Basin Commission is an intergovernmental body that is comprised of five voting members, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, Governor Christie of New Jersey, Governor Corbett of Pennsylvania, Governor Markell of Delaware, and the Obama Administration represented by the Army Corps of Engineers.  For the Delaware River to be opened up to drilling, three out of the five have to vote yes on the draft regulations plan.  We need them all to reject the proposal and reject gas drilling and fracking.  

**There has never been a more urgent moment in the Northeast in the battle against fracking. ** 

Here are 4 ways that you can participate:

1) Call the the Governors from the member states and President Obama TODAY and tell them, ""Hello, I am calling you to express my serious concerns about hydrofracking.  Please Don’t Drill the Delaware!""

* Governor Christie’s office  - [609-292-6000](http://www.state.nj.us/governor/)
* Governor Cuomo’s office - [518-474-8390](http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact/GovernorContactForm.php)
* Gov Corbett’s office – [717-787-2500](http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_corbett/19926)
* Gov Markell’s Wilmington Office - [302-577-3210](http://governor.delaware.gov/index.shtml)
* And the white house comment line is [202-456-1111](http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact)

2) Come to the DRBC meeting in person!

First and foremost, let’s have a short note about moderation. If something has gone awry with your post or some such, **you’re allowed to let us know**. Two of the mods practically live in IRC, 50-some of you *actually have my telephone number*, and about 20 of you **know where I live**. If, for some reason, you think we’re trolling you or [secretly deleting comments to cover for racist friends](http://redd.it/k7jyr), there just *might* be another plausible explanation just around the corner. Of course, you could tell us how [you know everything about how reddit works](http://i.imgur.com/PNrTk.gif ""That picture is definitely photoshopped!"") and how we’re all racists ourselves, but that [doesn’t make us happy](http://i.imgur.com/g8vXl.gif ""BUT I WUV U!"").

Also, **for our collective sanity’s sake, don’t feed the trolls!** Just downvote and move on. Is race a major issue in this city? Yes, certainly. But don’t think for one minute that you’ll be able to have a serious conversation with a troll.

Secondly, having formed an exploratory committee to study the possibilities (Seriously! We met on Tuesday.), we came to the conclusion that it was time for another huge meetup. ~~So, take this survey and tell us how awesome it would be to have a Jekyll &amp; Hyde meetup at the top of Liberty Two in October.~~ The idea would be that you can either come [super dressy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64054156@N04/6091295760/) (Jekyll) or in an [awesome costume](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64054156@N04/5831266955/) (Hyde). We’d love to hear your comments, questions, and ideas, ~~so again take the survey~~ (and feel free to add comments below). Like the last Liberty Two meetup, you will need to RSVP with a name (but we’ll deal with that later).

As a self-post, this gets no karma, so please up-vote for visibility.

I'm a former Michiganian who moved here about a month ago on a wing, a prayer and two months of savings. I love it here. I want to stay. 

But I'm halfway through my two months, and I still haven't been able to find a job. I'm using the internet to the best of my ability, but there are only so many positions listed on PhillyJobs and similar sites, and I can only cover so much turf in a day. 

Do any of you happen to remember seeing businesses that were advertising for help this week? If you could spare a few seconds to tell me where, I'd be grateful. 

And if you haven't, and could toss me an upvote -- so that someone might see it who has -- that would be equally great. 

Please and thanks!

UPDATE: someone asked. Anyway, I put in applications at a handful of the places you lovely folks mentioned, and I have an interview at Conant in the morning! Will post back afterward and let you know!

Thank you all so much for the tips! 

Aaaaaand once again, I'm a lady.

[More about the space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/v0ds5/philadelphia_global_meetup_update/c506wgy)

**About the Meetup**

We'll start at **2pm** on **Saturday, June 23rd** and go for 4-6 hours. In meetups past, it seems that board and card games go over well for icebreakers, so I'd like to focus on that (though, certainly, you won't be required to play anything). We will also have beer, soda, and some snacks - general mingling is certainly encouraged. This will be similar (and probably better) than [Liberty Two](http://i.imgur.com/ZACXo.jpg) (except for the view) - though with an earlier end time so people can go bar crawling if they want to.

**What you ""Need"" to Do**

""Need"" in quotes, because, honestly, all you *need* to do is show up. I do *humbly request*, however, that you do the following:

* **Bring $15 worth** of snacks, soda, beer/wine, supplies (plates, cups, napkins, trash can liners, ice, coolers, cleaning spray, etc.), or make a donation (paypal accepted).  
* **Bring a board game** / card game / playing cards / poker chips. I'd recommend against bringing a 7-hour strategy game like *Diplomacy*, and would rather encourage party games like *UNO*, *Apples 2 Apples*, *Monopoly DEAL*, and *Cards Against Humanity*, or light strategy like *Settlers of Catan* and *Ticket to Ride*.  
* ~~**Email RSVP4rPhilly** [at] hotmail.com and tell me what (if anything) you're bringing. If you want to bring something, but don't know what, I will gladly tell you what we need.~~ `Don't worry about it at this point - just show up.`  
* **RSVP** on the [redditgifts page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/philadelphia-global/).  
* **Have FUN!**

Please feel free to post questions below. I will ask for some set up/tear down volunteers, but that will likely come later. [Previous thread.](http://redd.it/t1w01 ""You'll note that I was able to meet all 6 criteria!"")

Today Geoff and I met real angels on earth. Here is the story:


I am working with a family which needed 2 twin beds for their children. The children had no beds and were sleeping with their mom. When first I met with her all she wanted was for the kids to have their own beds, nothing else. She had been laid off and had held down 5 temp jobs while trying to obtain permanent employment again. The family budget is so tight that beds were a luxury that mom could just not afford. 

I worked to get the beds donated and got funds to pay for new mattresses and box springs. I discovered that I could get brand new beds, mattresses and mattress pads through IKEA cheaper. 
I contacted their customer service personnel for the South Philly store and secured directions on how to use an organization check and get the tax removed. 

Armed with all my documents and specific instructions on where to go to make the transaction, Geoff and I took the truck to Philly today to pick up the beds. 
The two little ones 6 and 9 were waiting for us to bring their first beds ever at 3:30pm after school.


When we arrived, IKEA informed us that they never take checks and we would need a PA tax exempt document. We requested to speak to the manager. The employee we were speaking with said ""I am the manager"". We said, you must have a boss. He said yes the store manager. We said we wanted to speak to him. James the store manager worked very hard to fix the problem but it could not be solved because it was company wide policy.

 He was talking to someone on his phone as I discussed the family situation with Geoff, expressing how disappointed these kids would be, how I was afraid child protection may get involved if I didn't get these beds to the kids and how I couldn't get the money for the beds for at least another week. 


What we didn't realize was a customer was listening carefully to the story and stood up, offering to pay the bill. I expressed my appreciation but couldn't possibly accept her offer as it was a $399.99 bill. She again expressed that she wanted to do this. The store manager felt terrible about the situation and offered his own personal $30 IKEA gift card. 

I composed myself as did Geoff and said that I would accept their kindness if the woman would give me her contact information so I could return the money via an agency check next week. She was hesitant but agreed to the arrangement. The manager also arranged a coupon that would cover the tax so the final charge would not include the tax.

While I am truly devastated by the news, I find some peace that it was what Mikey felt was his duty, and he knew the risks full-well.

What really bothers me, however, is how little we, I included, deserve his sacrifice. How can I help my brothers, sisters, and his friends find some peace in the face of overwhelming grief when I don't feel that we deserve it?

Troops have been dying for a decade, now, and it seems like people would rather worry about the Jersey Shore and the NFL lockout than people who risk their lives everyday because we don't have the balls to take control of our leaders.

I don't want to be okay. I don't want things to go back to the way they were. I want us to deserve what some give so freely, which we can never give in return, that's all.

Thanks for letting me rant, guys. I just miss my Mikey.

**Edit:** Where the hell are all of these downvotes coming from? I just wanted to vent. There's nothing political about this. I'm just sad, and more than a little pissed-off. I understand that some people may think that this is run-of-the-mill hero worship, but take my word for it: Michael was the type of guy that would've been loved and admired no matter what he chose to do. That's just who he was. Please don't dismiss what we've lost, and will continue to lose, simply because you think that we have different views. We're not so different.

Come discuss.,,115,11,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/obe5c/rphilly_house_party_all_ages_of_consent_is_being/,"Good news everyone, now let's have a party!

I can host an event of up to 320 people with minimal costs. The location is in the Italian Market area. What I really would like to see is all of us coming together and contributing what we can to make this a fun time with more entertainment than just each other. Somebody already proposed a band to play at the party, I know some DJs and performers (hoops, poi, fire, aerial gymnastics and others) who would probably be interested in participating. I am thinking of hosting the 1st meeting for this on Thursday evening around 6PM, maybe I can afford to order us some pizza. As far as the party itself - I am thinking early February. Let me know if you're interested in participating.

Update 1 - 1st meeting to plan out the basics - Thursday 1/12/12 6PM around the block of 8th Street and Christian Street - https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=br2v74smiem5enoar2lgt93sns%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York - If you can come then please do. Those who confirm will receive the exact contact info.

**Update 2** - Due to unforeseen circumstances I am pushing this back until mid-March. Sometime around mid-February you should see a link for a survey about party details and that will allow me to see what days in March would work for most people. The way I see it is that there are a few advantages to this: 1) There are transitions at the place where I live and we have people moving in and out, the people that are moving in are definitely on the more favorable side of having ""party"" type of events and they also have experience in putting together events; 2) It will be spring time so everybody will be awakening from their winter slumber to let all the fresh energy rage out into an epic party, this bring me to my last point: 3) More time to put effort into an epic party!

My friend Stephen lives nearby the site and passes it regularly.  About a month ago he reported it to the city because it was being ""demolished in a manner that appears to be clearly unsafe"".  This is a tragic event that could have been easily avoided.

I've copied and pasted the email he forwarded me with some names removed below:

&gt;
&gt;You have another opportunity.
&gt;
&gt;A building is being demolished just a few blocks away at 21st and Race.
&gt;Again, sidewalks and streets nearby are not closed, half standing walls are left unattended.  Perhaps L&amp;I should take a look at this.  Soon.

&gt;
&gt;day of the week is work being done?:  I last observed work being done on May 6 at 9am.

&gt;building or to someone waiting for a bus or exiting the subway at that 
&gt;corner.

Thankfully, there has been a tremendous outpouring of sympathy and pledges of resources.  At this point, it is our intent to help direct this good will toward the affected to help them in their time of need.

###Who are we helping?

Our family - our redditors.  While donations to Philadelphia Fire, the Red Cross, and other institutions are excellent ideas; this reddit drive is meant to focus on the four active, long term members of our close knit community who will not be receiving further assistance from aid organizations.  So far, each one has a temporary place to stay, some donated clothes, and basic food; this all, however, is just the beginning of the rebuilding process. If you’d like to donate funds to the Fire Department, Michael Goodwin’s family, or the Red Cross, we can assist with that - but our drive will focus on our family.

###What are we donating?

Immediately, cash. There are so many things that one doesn’t know they need until the moment arises. By donating financially, the displaced redditors are able to allocate funds personally.  A lot of their immediate necessities (clothes, hygiene items, etc.) have been taken care of and now they need to concentrate on getting back on their feet. We will compile a list of specific items that the affected have asked for and get that list to the community as soon as we know. If you are planning on donating clothes, kitchen supplies, furniture, and the like, please feel free to comment; we will get back to you when the affected are in a position to accept such donations.

###How are we donating?

Out of the need for a prompt response, and the r/philadelphia Mods’ own inadequacies in fundraising experience, we’ll be using Simon’s paypal at **[simon.und[at]live.com](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/send-money-online ""It's an old account, deal with it."")**, with Bevatron as a monitor. Please feel free to ask for proof, screenshots, or other things which may make you feel more at ease with giving. We will all accept cash at any reddit event. Next Friday (4/12), and each thereafter, the accumulated funds will be distributed between the four affected redditors. Further, we are planning a fundraising / donation party in early May, when we hope that the affected have had a chance to assess their situations and, hopefully have new homes in which to restart their lives.

Thank you all for your help!

I literally have no money outside of this, and it is a dilemma that has kept me tethered to my mother for longer than necessary. [Additionally, I am not unemployable, but I am between degrees--my last one being in the Arts--and lack the experience that employers seek for hiring.]  My mother came to me today asking me to provide her with my tuition bill so that she can qualify for a withdrawal from her Vanguard account (she wanted the bill so that she could use it is part of her ""necessary expenses""--she is not contributing a dime to my education).  Her withdrawal is being used to pay for debts she has accumulated from a shopping addiction (I wish I were making this up.  I am pretty ashamed to even be admitting this to anyone, that this is my current situation.) I refused and was told I am no longer welcome under this roof.  I've included a screencap of a conversation with a friend over FB in which I detail the gist of the story; I'm trying to provide as much proof as I can.  [Facebook conversation](http://i.imgur.com/tmjxf.jpg).

So, my question is if anyone has a spare room in which I can stay.  I can't pay rent.  I can try to do whatever else I can for you in exchange for a space to stay and work on my studies.  I will continue working to find part-time work in the hope that if anyone can help, I can try to pay for my stay as much as can, while trying to earn money for my Spring tuition.  :(  

I'm very much in need of help.  Even if you cannot help me, could you at least upvote so that someone who may be able to help me may see this?

Thank you.

**EDIT:**  I would like to add a post-script saying that I am also willing to move outside of Philadelphia for a place to stay.  The only cities I am familiar with are Philadelphia &amp; Providence, RI and I have posted to both seeking for help.  If you know anyone not even in Philly, and can pass this on, I would appreciate that too.  I get paid from my nannying duties this week and can use the pay for an Amtrak ticket to move if necessary.

**EDIT 2:** It is 2:09AM right now, I have to sleep soon to be up to nanny.  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who even bothered reading this, and for upvoting even if you can't help.  I really appreciate it because I have no one else to turn to.  Also, to the comments below and any that may be forthcoming, I have been replying to inquirers via PM.  I am not ignoring any response I get, just taking a personal route to my response.  
Thank you so much again.

**EDIT 3:** It is 11:23AM, I am in the process of responding to the several redditors of Philadelphia who have welcomed me to their couch and/or room.  I want to express my gratitude because I truly did not think that anyone would even consider helping me.  To the people who think I am freeloading cunt, you are welcome to feel that way.  You do not know me and I cannot prove anything to you.  To clear up some things though: (1) I do not have a degree and trying to pursue a second.  I left my previous studies of the arts and am pursuing a science field so that I might be able to make a difference in the lives of others, and (2) I am sorry that many think this plea is way of keeping myself dependent on others.  I have to be honest in saying that I think, if you think this, you have no experience with a manipulative parent or guardian.  Giving in to my mother's request would be keeping myself dependent on a dysfunctional and destructive situation.  I wrote this post following an abrupt dismissal from my home, and I asked for a leg-up in the hope of getting away from this unhealthy situation.

All aside, thank you so much redditors of Philadelphia for your open generosity.  You keep something alive in our community that is fast fading elsewhere.  I appreciate every offer I have received and am trying to get back to everyone!",,False,self,t5_2qh24,1344440020.0,,,True,t3_xuvst,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/xuvst/recently_kicked_out_of_home_by_bipolar_mother_for/,

There are a ton of Pho places which I'm sure you all know of, but if you ever feel risky and want to try other Viet dishes, check out this place. It's my favorite Asian restaurant. Food is very authentic. I may even like it more than my mom's cooking...

[Here's a link to the site](http://www.namphuongphilly.com/), though I'm sure that menu is out-dated and any descriptions of Viet food usually consists of ""Beef Noodle Soup"" or ""meat x in y sauce,"" which hardly gives the dishes ANY justice. It's the kind of thing where you just randomly order something you might like.

Also, this place is pretty damn cheap for quality food.

Per visit, I usually order:

* Cha Gio (Spring Rolls)
* Bun Bo Hue (Beef Noodle Soup) - it's fucking delicious, especially if you enjoy spicy foods. I actually prefer this over Pho. It uses a different noodle type, and the broth is a deep red.
* Muc Xao Sa Ot (Squid sauteed w/ lemongrass) - a bit spicy, squid tossed with onions and peppers.

I typically order two entries, though one entree is definitely proportionally enough. I just like variety.

My friends are black teenagers. My peers are black teenagers. When you look on the news, all you see is black teenagers. Before 2010, I used to think that the unjustified hatred that we receive as a race was just that, unjustified. Now, I turn on the news, and hear stories of people being attacked, and that its always black teenagers responsible. Why are we doing dumb shit like this? Why are just giving away the future that our grandparents and great grandparents have fought so hard for? I have never hated being black, but now I cant even walk around without feeling embarrassed that I share the same skin color as the fools and assholes that now plague our city. There is no fucking point to attacking and robbing anyone, and we are just digging ourselves deeper and deeper to complete lockdown, where things will go back to how they were in the 1950's where the white man would beat the shit out of every single black teenager they can get their hands on, and you know what? I wouldn't blame them.

I moved from Philly to Denver a little over a month ago and am returning as soon as I find a roommate. Why?  
First off, I didn't realize how great our food scene is until I was subjected to the chain-restaurant backwater that is Denver. Particularly surprising is that Philly actually has far better Mexican food, though far fewer Mexicans.  
Second, downtown Denver is like a ghost town on week nights and I'm pretty sure doesn't contain one building over twenty years old.  
Culture? Cross a truck stop with a Mountain Dew commercial and you'll have a good approximation.  
And while we can all agree SEPTA isn't perfect, at least it's generally on time and can get you closer than a few miles to most destinations. Denver RTD, on the other hand, sees schedules as stifling the individual drivers' creativity or something.  
Scenery? Okay, the Rockies are pretty, but Philly has perhaps the best city views in the country with Fairmount Park, the rivers, and the historical architecture.  
Speaking of history, Denver's started a couple of weeks ago. Unless you're into cowboys and whores, you won't find much of interest.  
It's easy to take our great city for granted, but trust me the grass ain't greener oyt west.  
Btw I realize this applies only to Denver, but I know a lot of east-coasters who talk about moving out here, so thought I'd give you a warning.  
TL;DR: I moved from Philly to Denver and it sucks. So don't do that.

Myself and a friend were hit on our bicycles Monday night/ Tuesday morning May 21st by a white SUV (possible Ford Explorer or Expedition,) traveling Westbound on Lombard. As we came down 10th and entered the intersection (having a greenlight,) we were both tossed from our bikes after being struck by the vehicle. Both of us were sent to the hospital and our bikes were destroyed.

I noticed recently in a surveillance video that it looks as though the driver's side windshield was smashed from hitting us.

I am so happy about this that I feel I must say thank you.


A quick thank you to the people of the City of Philadelphia,

This Saturday I had a sidewalk sale at my apartment in Center City. I have to move soon and I'm broke so I needed to sell some furniture, shelving and other stuff. My boyfriend and I hauled my stuff down four floors and sat outside all morning. I sold a few things to people walking or driving by. At noon we had to leave so we decided to try an honor sale with the remaining stuff. We left a sign asking people to pay what they felt was right, put the money in the envelopes we taped to the furniture, and slip it under the front door of my building. 

By the end of the day when we returned almost everything was gone from the sidewalk. I was so delighted to find that all of the associated envelopes were in the vestibule with cash in them!

So, thank you! Thank you neighbors and passersby in Philadelphia. Thanks for your honorable behavior! Thank you for not taking anything without paying! Thank you for being so generous! Thank you housemates (all of whom are new to the building and still strangers to me) for leaving these cash laden envelopes in the vestibule for me. Thanks for affirming that, really, people are good! Thanks for showing me the real, honest Philadelphia spirit! 

With love,

Here's where it gets worse, most of Philadelpia's homeless are not just poor, but very mentally ill.  It's really very sad, these people need help desperately.  The number of ""incidents"" among the very small Occupy Philly demonstartors is eyebrow raising to me.  Wether these incidents, are perpetrated by homeless Occupy Philly participants, or by local homeless unaffiliated does not matter, and really I have no idea who the guilty are.

When I visit the Occupy Philly camp, it calls my attention to one thing, Philadelphia long standing homeless problem and it's severe lack of services for the mentally ill.

When I ask older philadelphian's why there are so many homeless in the city and why they all seems so visibly mentally ill, they all mention the reason for this is the closing of Byberry Hospital, an asylum, in 1987.

The City of Philadelphia needs to address the issues of homelessness and the sad lack of mental health services in a very serious way.",,False,self,t5_2qh24,False,,,True,t3_mef0z,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/mef0z/a_sad_truth_what_philly_really_needs_occupy/,

This guy came to my house, claiming my neighbor has just been in an accident.  He said she has just been in an accident and her car has been towed.  He tells me she was able to pay $43 for the tow, but there's a balance of $19.05 left on the bill.

He had a written note, ""go to xxxx (my address) and ask for xxxx (my first name)""

He tells me if the balance isn't paid they have to impound the car.  So he says he just needs $20 to pay the balance so her car doesn't get impounded, and he'll swing by with the keys and an invoice.  

I'm close enough with my neighbor that loaning her $20 wouldn't be a problem so I figured what the hell.  We gave him the $20.

We called the phone number he left for the auto tow company (1-800-AUTO-TOW) and it rings to a tow company in Oklahoma.  The woman who answered knew exactly why we were calling, and said this guy has been going around Philly with this scam for a few weeks now.

She advised we file a police report, the police know about him, and have been trying to track him down.  Cops are on their way to our house now so we can file a report.

I just wanted to throw a little information your way regarding some goings-on in the subreddit.

41. Don't forget about the [**1/6 Holiday Meetup**](http://redd.it/nj5fe ""three kings day"")! Bevatron has done a shit-ton of work and it promises to be awesome.

264. I would like to cordially invite writers to join our active [**writing group**](https://groups.google.com/group/philly-reddit-writers)! Details in comments.

3645. I'd like to hear your opinions about **meme posts**. They've been cropping up lately and, while I'm not a fan, I'd like to get some feedback before being an internet asshole.

78. Don't forget that we have a [**Google Group**](https://groups.google.com/group/phillyreddit) and a [**Google Calendar**](http://redd.it/ieac0) - they can be great resources if we put a bit of effort into them.

1. Remember that ""[we do a lot of regular weekday meetups](http://redd.it/lwr95)"" post? Yeah, that turned into ""we're too cool for school and don't want to play by the rules."" I, however, can always be found at the **happy-hour meetups at [Cooperage](http://cooperagephilly.com/) on Thursdays**.

Feel free to beat me up about cleaning up the side-bar and the FAQ should you randomly run into me like Henry did at Tattooed Mom's on New Year's Eve (he did the random running into me part, not the berating).

Are you local?

Are you a Redditor? (optional)

Are you interested in meeting other friendly local ladies?


If the answer is yes to all, maybe you'd be interested in helping me form a ""Ladies Club"" or something. No, it's not going to be like a sorority or mean girls club or something. And no, it's not a sexist, he-man hating club either. No I'm not trying to split the group (we love you guys!), so I'd never organize something to conflict with another meetup.


It's just a way for us to meet each other, because let's face it, there aren't too many of us local lady redditors. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging out with the gentlemen variety, but sometimes... I just want to hang out with ladies. I've already met a few of you ladies and I think it's a shame I haven't gotten to know you better (Liz, Heather, Aleela, Beth, girl I met at the bowlup, girl I met at the global meetup that made cookies--sorry forgot your names). This is my attempt.


A little about me: I've always been kind of a guys' girl (I guess because of my nerdy/geeky personality). Get along great with guys, no problem meeting guys, very few/almost no girlfriends. Past few years, I've matured a lot and have come to appreciate the feminine beings in my life. Currently, all my really close girlfriends either live out of state or are extremely busy with work/family, and so I just miss hanging out with the fairer sex. Plus I'm always up for meeting new cool peoples in general, and would be even better if they are women, since I don't know too many local women. And I don't mind putting myself out there, hence, this post. I think these lady meetups will also help the weird, awkward, almost competitive feeling some of us get when meeting other women. I feel like we've been conditioned by a patriarchal society to compete with each other or something. It's weird, and I think it's counter-productive to one's social life. I just want to create a friendly, welcoming,  safe, non-judgmental group catered to the ladies of /r/philadelphia. Plus, wouldn't it be nice if once in a while, you didn't have to worry about if that guy thinks you like him or vice versa? Hah.


So if you're a lady and you're interested in meeting more like-minded local ladies, feel free to comment/introduce yourself. Also, feel free to include your interests, so maybe we can organize an event around a common interest. 


Me: I'm kinda geeky (yeah we all are :D), outdoorsy, love to do physical activities. Love learning, reading. Love dancing--salsa, swing, cooking and eating, drinking.... just a few of my favorite things.


Also, please upvote so all of maybe 13 of us ladies see this? Hah. And if you're a guy and know a lady who would be interested, please help spread the word, would appreciate it!

**EDIT:** WOW! What an AMAZING response! I'm actually kind of overwhelmed--I honestly was expecting 10-15 interested ladies max. This is wonderful. I am keeping a spreadsheet of all the responses and as of today 9/13, I have 56 ladies! I'm thinking a bar meetup would be a great first event for us...some place like City Tap House, where there is lots of outdoor seating, lots of beers (since I saw beer mentioned numerous times), and overall good spot to chat and hang out. We can do something as early as end of September/beginning of October and probably keep this going once every 2/3 weeks or so. And if some of you hit it off, I can definitely see mini/spontaneous meetups happening more frequently--movie night, dinner night, whatever-activity night, etc. 

Ahh, now, the part where I'm unsure of is how to keep in touch with you ladies. How would you like to know about our upcoming events/meetups? Through /r/philadelphia frontpage, or through email? Should we make a google group? Would love any ideas on how to do this most efficiently (welcoming advice from everyone, not just the ladies, hah). *ItHenceEverything* offered to help with planning since she plans a lot of meetups, I look forward to hearing from you, I'll PM you soon.",,False,self,t5_2qh24,True,,,True,t3_kdg8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/kdg8z/all_the_philly_ladies_report_in/,

1351169321.0,78,self.philadelphia,1229y7,Halloween is next week and I have a problem... Adults,mottom24,99,21,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1229y7/halloween_is_next_week_and_i_have_a_problem_adults/,"Before I start, I have been living in Philly for almost ten years and have handed out candy to kids, since I have had a porch to sit on, for 4 years. I am one of those folks who hands out full sized candy bars... because fun size isn't fun dammit!

Anyway, every year I have run into a problem; Adults. I can't buy that many full size candy bar boxes, I have 80 individual bars and last year they were all gone within 30 minutes because there would be groups of entire families taking a bar from the bowl. Dad, mom, big brother, big sister, grandma, the kids, as well as babies, that the adults would trick or treat for, who looked to have been born yesterday. (Obviously babies can't eat candy and I doubt they saved it for them until they grew teeth...) 

This annoys me because they are literally stealing candy from kids. But I have no idea how to approach this. I have heard other neighborhoods have this problem as well (I live just off Baltimore ave near Cedar Park), but I have no solution... Do I just say ""no these are for kids only"" and risk a scene? Or should I get a big bowl of fun sized candy and give those to the adults saying ""the big bars are for the kids, you can have these"". Or am I just asking for trouble regardless of what I do and should just accept the way things are? I have even asked friends to join me with their candy, since they live in apartments, and help back me up on my assertion that the candy is for kids.

Does anyone else have this problem and have they ever found a solution? 



**edit** after some great suggestions I have decided to hand out the bars individually, tossing choice out the window this year. I will say, and truthfully so, that I am low on candy and only have enough for kids who dressed in costumes, no adults. I thought of having a bowl of the candy I have left over from a party (smarties and laughy taffy), but decided against even facilitating the candy snatching behavior of adults. 

Thank you all for your suggestions!",,False,self,t5_2qh24,1351184166.0,,text,True,t3_1229y7,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1229y7/halloween_is_next_week_and_i_have_a_problem_adults/,

If he racks up enough points, is he just going to do a run on Qdoba and try to get 300 free burritos from a franchise? When the franchise declines (obviously, that's a huge loss) is he going to try to strong-arm them by making them look like ""monsters"" for not going along with his scam? He has no respect for this company, he only cares about his own misguided desires.

He also claims it is a plan he and his 9 year old cousin came up with. What kind of man teaches a 9-year-old to scam people?

1363545518.0,69,self.philadelphia,1ah5a5,"Text version of Mayor Nutter letter re ""Being White in Philly"" article",ohiohiohio,91,22,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1ah5a5/text_version_of_mayor_nutter_letter_re_being/,"Dear Ms. Landau:

This month Philadelphia Magazine has sunk to a new low even for a publication that has long pretended that its suburban readers were the only citizens civically engaged and socially active in the Philadelphia area. Its March cover piece, ""Being White in Philly,"" aggregates the disparaging beliefs, the negative stereotypes, the ignorant condemnations typically, and historically ascribed to African-American citizens into one pathetic, uninformed essay quoting Philadelphia residents, many of whose names either the author or the speakers themselves were too cowardly to provide. That the magazine thought a collection of these despicable, over-generalized, mostly anonymous assumptions rose to the level of journalism is unfortunate enough. Worse, some of the residents of the nation's fifth-largest city who are quoted in the piece seem to have ignored every positive anecdote they might otherwise have shared about a positive experience with African-Americans in favor of negative stories, many of them not even clearly attributable to African-Americans at all, to allow the author to feed his own misguided perception of African-Americans -- notwithstanding his own acknowledged daily experience on his own block as an ethnic group that, in its entirety, is lazy, shiftless, irresponsible, and largely criminal. Moreover, compounding the sin of having allowed this article to be published in the magazine - and as a cover story, no less the magazine cynically and hypocritically distributed its March issue with two different covers : reportedly one, for its subscribers, with the provocative article as the cover story; the other, with an attractive woman of color on its cover, for Philadelphia hotel guests and visitors.

Anyone who reads a newspaper or walks through some of the city's poorer neighborhoods knows that the ""vast and seemingly permanent . . . underclass"" is not only black; the poverty rate in the City of Philadelphia is 28.4% and comprises not only African-Americans but Caucasians, Latinos, and members of other ethnic groups as well - ethnic groups that are suspiciously absent from an essay that purports to decry the inability for white Philadelphians to have an ""honest"" conversation about ""race."" More egregiously, the author of this essay, who notes that ""[w]hat gets examined publicly about race is generally one-dimensional, looked at almost exclusively from the perspective of people of color,"" commits the same sin in reverse, by examining race exclusively from the perspective of, apparently, fifteen white people who have used isolated negative experiences to draw pervasive generalizations that the author then ascribes to the belief system of Philadelphia's entire white population. Philadelphia Magazine editor Tom McGrath defends his decision to publish the story by declaring, first, that it ""is a story"" merely because it features white Philadelphians, as opposed to Philadelphians of color, talking about race, as if merely saying that an article quoting the random thoughts of a random collection of people in selected areas of the city is worthy of publication makes it so. McGrath's second contention is that refusing to publish a piece about race would have rendered the problems of the city's ""underclass"" theirs, and theirs alone, to fight, as if the city's African-American population and its underclass are one and the same.

Indeed, perhaps McGrath's description of Bob Huber's essay as a ""story"" is accurate. The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus defines ""story"" as ""1. an account of imaginary . . . events."" Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus, American Edition (Oxford University Press, 1997). However, trying to deconstruct the article's many logical fallacies not only is an exercise in futility but offers the piece unearned credibility. Obviously, unless the resident whose chair was stolen or pumpkin smashed actually witnessed these acts of vandalism being committed by an African-American person, an assumption by the victim or the author about the ethnicity of the perpetrator is patently foolish. Obviously, the many positive, crime-free experiences of the thousands of Temple University students of all ethnic groups, bursting outward on the campus' ever-expanding footprint that has for decades included fraternity houses and University-owned rental housing, belie the cynical presumptions of a police officer whose job, after all, is to focus attention on the criminals rather than the law-abiding citizens. Surely Dennis, the math teacher in Kensington, might have used the criticism he received for calling his young male student, ""boy,"" as a learning experience about the history of the relationship between Caucasians in the United States and African-American males, and identified a different way to discipline or speak sternly to the young man in the future, rather than interpreting it as evidence that ""no one at the school could do anything, no matter how badly [the young man] misbehaved."" Is it ""possible"" that Anna from Moscow just doesn't know that much about African Americans in America or our country's complicated racial history than does Dennis' young student?

Rather than raging against the abject ignorance reflected in this uninformed, ill-advised, ill-considered, uninspired, and thoroughly unimaginative lament, I believe we should take the opportunity this essay offers to conduct a more comprehensive, fact-intensive evaluation of the racial issues and attitudes that provide the prism through which not only Philadelphians, but Americans across the country, view the many challenges that confront us as a community and as a nation. I therefore request that the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, which is charged by the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter with a mandate, among other duties, to ""institute and conduct educational programs to. . . promot[e] . .
understanding among persons and groups of different races, colors, religions and national origins,"" conduct an inquiry into the state of racial issues, biases, and attitudes within and among the many communities and neighborhoods in the City of Philadelphia. Also, because the performance of its duties the Commission may cooperate with interested citizens and with public and private agencies,"" I ask that the Commission take testimony from individual citizens and from organizations including but not limited to community groups, non-profit organizations, community development corporations, law enforcement agencies, and religious organizations — perhaps citizens and organizations representing the ethnic, economic, and social diversity easily found in our great city -- for the purpose of submitting to me and our city a report on the state of racial issues in Philadelphia, identifying the racial attitudes, both positive and negative, that pervade our civic interaction and our discourse; the obstacles and opportunities that those attitudes present; and recommendations for the improvement or enhancement of racial interaction and the encouragement and embrace of the diverse culture that Philadelphia enjoys. Finally, I ask that the Commission consider specifically whether Philadelphia Magazine and the writer, Bob Huber are appropriate for rebuke by the Commission in light of the potentially inflammatory effect and the reckless endangerment to Philadelphia's racial relations possibly caused by the essay's unsubstantiated assertions. While I fully recognize that constitutional protections afforded the press are intended to protect the media from censorship by the government, the First Amendment, like other constitutional rights, is not an unfettered right, and notwithstanding the First Amendment, a publisher has a duty to the public to exercise its role in a responsible way. I ask the Commission to evaluate whether the ""speech"" employed in this essay is not the reckless equivalent of ""shouting 'fire!' in a crowded theater,"" its prejudiced, fact-challenged generalizations an incitement to extreme reaction. Only by debunking myth with fact, and by holding accountable those who seek to confuse the two, can we insure that the prejudices reflected in the essay are accorded the weight they deserve: none at all.",,False,self,t5_2qh24,1364156397.0,,,True,t3_1ah5a5,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1ah5a5/text_version_of_mayor_nutter_letter_re_being/,

We wanted to a little recap/review of the City of Brotherly Love!

**Food**
Sandwiches, sandwiches, and more sandwiches. 

We first went to **Tommy DiNic's** at Reading Terminal. Roast Pork with Spinach (they ran out of broccoli rabe). We were met with an insane line wrapped around the booth but luckily someone had gotten up from their seat and we were able to grab the seats. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My girlfriend on the other hand found it to be not particularly exceptional. The roast pork was super moist and god I fell in love with the sharp provolone.

We also visited the **Amish Bakery** with all the doughnuts and wonderful looking pastries. We don't have much of a sweet tooth but the blueberry fritter caught our eye. She never had a fritter before and we both fell in love with the little glazed thing. We debated going back near the end of our trip just to get another one. On our way back we stopped by a 7-Eleven and she bought an apple fritter just to compare and.. yeah. The blueberry fritter was pretty awesome.

Continuing our journey for roast pork sandwiches, we stopped by **Paesano's** and had the Arista and the Diavlo sandwiches. The Arista was definitely my favorite. There was a nice spice kick from the red peppers and my god the broccoli rabe was amazing! My girlfriend preferred the much spicier Diavlo sandwich which was super tomato-y.

We wanted to avoid the tourist trap of cheesesteaks like Pat's and Geno's. I desperately wanted to go to John's Roast Pork but they were unfortunately on vacation which I'm not going to lie, I was disappointed enough to almost not want to visit. Nonetheless we made our way to **Tony Luke's** and again.. the lines were insane! This city really loves their sandwiches! We got the cheese steak and the roast pork which were good but nothing mindblowingly awesome. The meat was slightly on the dry side.

This weekend was scorching hot and we wanted to cool down with some ice cream. We visited **Franklin Fountain**, the old school ice cream shop. We got the Coconut Ice Cream and the home made waffle cone which was creamy and delicious but not worth $8.

The best dining experience was at a small quaint Italian restaurant called **L'Angolo**. The food was really good, rivaling any New York City restaurant but never have I had service that great. You can tell that the people care about their customers. They offered us wine on the house and I'm not going to lie, BYOB being such a mainstay in Philadelphia is pretty fucking awesome! I would highly recommend this place. It was like walking into your grandmother's house and eating delicious homemade food in a caring and homey atmosphere. AMAZING!

**Activities**

We walked into **Magic Garden** which was an art gallery filled with boobs, penises, and vaginas in the most artistic way possible. The gallery is covered from ceiling to floor in a variety of mosaic tiles, glass, stained glass, glassware, art, pictures, and statues all meant to symbolize the artist's experiences. I wish we were able to spend more time here because it was so interesting and unique but the heat was getting to us. Would recommend!

We went to **Mutter Museum** as well. I wouldn't recommend going before lunch (which we ended up doing lol). The museum is filled with gruesome deformities and diseases of the human body. It was filled with bones, organs, tumors, conjoined twins, crazy contraptions from medicinal history, and all sorts of oddities. It was creepy but interesting.

Our favorite part of the trip was driving to and exploring **Kelly Drive**. We passed the rows of flags of different countries and thought that was pretty cool. We got to the steps and proceeded to play Eye of the Tiger running up and claiming the steps like Rocky did. We sat around for awhile watching everyone else doing the same and enjoyed watching everyone else be silly just like us. The view of the city was captivating!

We did a little scavenger hunt by **Stray Boots**. We previously had done one in Boston and that was a lot of fun. The Philadelphia edition at Center City was a bit lackluster making us run around in circles for random things that never seemed to tie together.

A couple of notes that we really enjoyed about Philly were the random art murals all over the city which were beautiful and made the city unique.

The Love Fountain and the center with all the game pieces like dominoes, chess pieces, etc. were fun!

One thing I really loved about the city was how they embrace the gay community. We saw the rainbow colored street signs and found random [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Wtwfxmj.jpg) and [signs](http://i.imgur.com/sog2AUV.jpg) supporting the gay community and thought that was great to see from a founding city of the United States.

Philly also seems to be a great biking city. I'm not sure how great SEPTA is but everything seems to be very commutable on bike and the city seems to do a great job supporting the biking community.

All in all, Philadelphia was a great experience and definitely worth the trip! I will one day come back just to visit **John's Roast Pork**. We had a great time and wanted to thank Philadelphians for being so great!",,False,self,t5_2qh24,False,,,True,t3_1hsbyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1hsbyo/nyc_meets_the_city_of_brotherly_love/,

I know a lot of you wanted a park, but several problems arose when trying to book one (primarily: lack of facilities, restrictions on alcohol, and already booked by another group).

**What we'll need from you:**

edit: **[TOO LATE TO RSVP NOW!](http://youtu.be/U4MYKmEZT8c)** Everyone who RSVP'd should have gotten at least one confirmation email.

That's really the big thing - other than that, show up!

When you RSVP, *it would be nice* to let me know three things:

* Are you bringing foodstuffs? We're going to need drinks, real food, and junk food, but I don't want 20 people bringing 5 dozen cookies each. Just let me know if you want to bring something and I'll try and keep it balanced.

* If you plan on donating money, just pledge an amount. When we figure out how much everything costs, I'll work out what you owe (which will match or be less than what you pledged, not more). So, if we get $1000 in pledges and the cost comes in at $500, I'll only ask for half your pledge.

* If you plan on doing a talk/performance, just tell me what you'll be doing and what equipment (if any) that you need or will bring. I'm going to try and enforce a 10-minute time limit.

As a special note on talks/presentations: I don't know what the space looks like, but I'll try to have them in a corner/out of the way. I know some people would rather stab themselves in the eyeballs before learning something new, so I'll try to have a 'social zone' where your attention will not be demanded.

I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you there (and, of course, at the after-parties sure to follow)!

[LINK](http://redd.it/h29hp) to the old thread. Also ""**502 = the post went through**"" - I'm starting to see errors elsewhere, so just be careful.

-----

**EDIT** (7pm, 6/11):

* What times would you like to show up? We booked the thing for a wide range (afternoon to mid-evening).

* Also, just to make things clear *donations are only going towards the cost of set-up, not towards food/drink*. Speaking of drinking, it's family friendly, and **you will be ID'd if you partake in any of the available alcohol**.

* Oh, and if you have any thoughts on how to get a few folding tables and chairs, I'd love to hear them.",,False,self,t5_2qh24,True,,text,True,t3_hyrvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/hyrvu/mark_your_calendars_and_get_over_your_fear_of/,
