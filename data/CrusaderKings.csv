The great Norman Family of d'Isigny have commissioned a royal tapestry of their family's history. The realms greatest weavers of Syria, France, Sicily, Greece, and Serbia have come together to weave a phenomenal piece.

It shows the reign of each ruler and their achievements.

In celebration of a strong family line of d'Isigny I present the royal tapestry.

Peasant! Fetch me the Link!

**[d'Isigny Tapestry](http://i.imgur.com/NMpGkvd.jpg)**

*****

*Now to briefly mention before I explain each scene, everyone should note that the Tapestry was made by peasant weavers. History is distorted and exaggerated; as when someone is killed by poisoning, everyone thinks he got his head lobbed off. Favorite gossip among the locals.* 

*As a devout Catholic family, it is also written in Latin.*
*****
1. **Talbot I** | The first d’Isigny to sail the treacherous seas with his Normans and rule in Aintab. Above we witness the “Eastern Star” that brought them here.


2. **Serlo I** | Known as “Magnus (the great)”, who lead his armies to victory. Such as the battle of Masyaf. King of Syria &amp; Mesopotamia.


4. **Henry I** | A warrior King; though only maimed at the battle of Symeon, it is shown he died on the battlefield.


5. **Henry II** | Shown laying in his deathbed. “Breves”, the brief.


6. **Torf I** | The Unyielding Holy Warrior, shown standing strong and defending his lands against the Seljuk Invasions.


7. **Faramond I** | “Prodita (betrayed)” his reign is shown during the great rebellions. People cower in fear and dread.


8. **Henry III** | A sad scene in which he watches the “Great Invasions” and the Ilkhanate Hordes, Mongols (Tatari) pillaging his lands.


9. **Oswulf I** | The Kinslayer, beheaded Henry with his sword. Gossiped that he even killed his wife Krystyna.


10. **Nadbor I** | The last of Syrian Kings, which orders the escape of his son Henry IV. The Mongols trample the last of his people; Normans and Syrians alike sail to the Frankish king. Leaving Behind the “Eastern Star”.


11. **Henry IV** | Sails to Frankish lands and joins the Crusade for Sicily. Crowned the first King after a magnificent victory. A sign is seen in the sky, “the Eagle”. Later to signify the conquest of other lands.


12. **Hugh I** | The Seafarer, a true Norman King. Crossed many seas in his conquest for Greece and other lands. It is said he sailed in a great Longboat that was as high as a castle.


13. **Bertan I** | Warrior King. Only seen on the battlefield, slaying those who opposed him. His Horse was the size of an Ox and his Sword was larger than a man.


14. **Turold I** | The King who struggled with the Frankish Emperor Berneger. He commanded the largest armies and waged colossal wars. It is said he ruled the lands with his Danish Axe.


15. **Eustache I** | First King of Serbia and celebrated as a liberator by the Serbian people.


16. **Turold II** | Reconquered many lost territories. Many say he lived in a large tower to see his distant lands. After the death of his wife Navar, he threw himself into the jaws of the sea.


17. **Eustache II** | Finest Warrior King, fighting in the famous battle of Oria in Sicily. Continued to sail the seas and lead his large armies to glory.

There was a comedian who talked about the history of gaming, free drinks, and even free tickets to get inside the video game exhibition there on Friday. (For the record, it was amazing.) Then he took me out to dinner, we got more drinks, etc. Naturally, we were talking about games all evening.

Anyway, while we were tipsily walking back to his place, we began talking about CKII, which we both thoroughly enjoy. I wasn't paying attention, so I very loudly began to tell him the story of my most recent succession...uh...situation. I went into detail, explaining how I killed roughly ten people to make sure everything turned out the way I wanted it to. 

According to my boyfriend, it was at this point that the middle-aged man walking in front of us started looking over his shoulder at me. The longer I talked, the more he quickened his pace. Poor bugger. I ended my story (still oblivious) by triumphantly explaining how I murdered my daughter and her 1-year-old son without anyone realizing that I was behind it. At this, the man gasped, put his hand over his mouth, bolted across the street, and started running toward his destination. My boyfriend began pissing with laughter.

And now there is a man in town who believes that I, a 22-year-old female, has successfully murdered my *eldest* daughter and my infant grandson.

1371919424.0,193,self.CrusaderKings,1gv1g0,Welcome new CK2 players! Here are the best starting characters:,SpaceGhostDerrp,214,21,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1gv1g0/welcome_new_ck2_players_here_are_the_best/,"When I first bought CK2, I was most intimidated by picking my character.  Here are the starts I had the most fun with.  I only have Sword of Islam and Legacy of Rome, so feel free to correct me or add any other interesting characters.  

Everyone will tell you to start your first game in **Ireland**.  We call it Tutorial Island for a reason: you should be able to create the Kingdom of Ireland before England starts to mess with you.  I recommend the count of (I think) Dublin in 1066: his father dies soon, giving you another province, so you can form your first duchy quite quickly  (edit: comments say that Munster is the better choice).  In my first play though, I went from Irish count to Emperor of Britannica, which is a nice goal for a starting player.  

For a game of vicious backstabbing and incest, I recommend trying to unify Spain.  I recommend playing as **Portugal** in the Latin Empire start, *not in 1066*.  There is a strong, united Muslim enemy, but the King of Portugal starts with a ton of children and bastards, so you can get alliances very quickly.  

If you want to conquer the world, I recommend the Alexiad start as the **Byzantines**, and trying to recreate the Roman Empire.  It's a lot of fun; the Legacy of Rome DLC is completely worth it for this play through.

For a different challenge, if you want to try to unite Scandinavia, I recommend the King of **Denmark** in 1066.  He has great stats, a good relationship with the HRE, and you can steal a lot of land from the pagans very quickly.  It's fun to be emperor of the north.  

Advanced Starts:
1066 **Abyssinia**: people seem to think this is the hardest start, because you cannot call in mercenaries.  I married into an alliance with the Byzantines, which made it slightly easier.  Still, you start as a Christian heresy surrounded by muslims, without any research.  It's pretty fun.

January 2nd 1255 **Golden Horde**.  For some reason, the leader of the Golden Horde starts as Orthodox, so the Mongols immediately splinter and try to kill you.  This character has the fiercest civil war I've ever played.  

These are the ones I remember, I'm sure there are other interesting characters, especially in the DLC I don't have.  Please list out anyone I missed.

Edit: I'd like to get a good list of character starts for the side-bar.  Picking a character was the biggest first hurdle for me, and a solid list would be a good addition to this subreddit.  Since I don't have The Republic or The Old Gods, I'll need help making a good list.  Please post when and where your suggestion starts, and also what goals that character would have, and why they make a fun play through.

Therefore we share our tips to reduce the time spent on iterative actions.

**1. [Fast inviting](http://i.imgur.com/EKLZ6Hf.gif).**

**Why?** You can do this to invite to a plot or to invite claimants or any other case where you have a list and want to access several character's diplomacy sheet.

**How?**  Right-click character portrait. Left-click diplomacy button. Repeat for each character.

**2. [Fast diplomacy](http://i.imgur.com/BJr1ld6.gif).**

**Why?** Some say it's faster. I'm not sure.

**How?** Right-click character portrait. Right-click diplomacy button. Multiple buttons will pop up, one for each diplomatic action.

**3. [Special interest](http://i.imgur.com/1h1DeXh.gif)**

**Why?** By taking a special interest in someone, you will receive events regarding this person. Especially relevant for your sons/heirs.

**How?** Right-click character portrait. Right-click personal button. Three buttons will pop up, the star symbolizes the special interest.

**4. [Fast new vassal](http://i.imgur.com/cwcBqdQ.gif)**

**Why?** Most likely you just won a holy war and got an entire county with all the bishoprics and baronies and now you got the ""Wrong holding"" alert button.

**How?** Select the county. Right-click the holding. Left-click the crown to create a new vassal.

**5. [Pick a good marriage/betrothal](http://i.imgur.com/Usg2A6i.png)**

**Why?** You want good stats or an alliance or obtain claims.

**How?** Character finder, which you can rebind or find below your minimap. One of the best tools ingame. You can set criteria and sort according to stats. There are external tools which parse your save game file so that you can even choose according to traits, I'm talking about [Matchmaker](http://www.couscouscrabcakes.com/matchmaker/matchmaker.html).

**6. [Side panel](http://i.imgur.com/ZRvG9s0.png)**

Use it. It is so much easier to change your camera position, observe the siege progress, control your armies and so much more.

**7. [Manage your messages](http://i.imgur.com/sYlDkag.png)**

You don't need every event to pop-up and/or pause the game. You can disable these pop-up notifications by clicking [the small letter symbol in the lower right corner](http://i.imgur.com/FC86uNx.png).
On the other hand you can alter the behavior of every event that either shows up in [the message log](http://i.imgur.com/uD0o53X.png) or in [the priority tabs](http://i.imgur.com/ur1Lm4Q.png) by right clicking it.
Disabled notifications can be accessed [via the side panel](http://i.imgur.com/1SLdx70.png).

**8. Shortcuts**

You must use hotkeys at a certain point, e.g. I had dozens of upgradable trade posts, so what did I do? Select one trade post, position mouse over green upgrade button and left-click &gt; ENTER &gt; ""."" (which is the next province and "","" the previous) &gt; Repeat.

There are several predefined shortcuts which you already know, e.g. ""w"" for political map mode and so on. But you have the option to create your own shortcuts if there is a graphical button!

First you need to locate your ""interface"" folder, in my case ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Crusader Kings II\interface"".

There are several *.gui files which can be opened in your favourite editor (e.g. Notepad++).

 When you find a ""guiButtonType"" String followed by a name = ""button_something"" it's a good indication that you can set up a shortcut. Let's look at a example:

Example: Raise army of selected province:

-Open province.gui

-Search for ""raise_levy""

-Add shortcut = ""z"", so that it looks like:

		guiButtonType =	{
			name = ""button_raise_levy""
			position = { x=181 y=354 }
			quadTextureSprite =""GFX_military_troop_strip_1""	
			Orientation = ""UPPER_LEFT""
            shortcut = ""z""
		}

You can bind to a uppercase letter if you want SHIFT+$letter behaviour or use identifiers like LEFT.


**Update 1**: Removed 5 (old): Hand land provinces only to family members via ledger and balkanize your realm. To controversial to be a general advice.

I started taking every chance I could to ""tumble"" about with them. My wife found out, killed herself, so I married one of the mistresses (who went on to bear me a lot more children before I died.)

-My only brother disagreed with me, so I assassinated him. Not much to say here, he was really really hideous so I didn't really feel bad. (This sounds weird until you realize just how ugly this man was, you would've taken any chance to stab him.)

-Local bishop was disagreeing with my practices, thought I was immoral or something, spymaster found information that he may be a Sodomite. Totally used it against him and spread rumors, he stopped being such a problem after that.

After watching S03E09 of Game of Thrones, I started a game as Robb Stark during the war of the 5 kings.  The only way I could console myself was to have lots of children as the Starks and play an isolationist ""King of the North"" game.  At my peak I had all of the North, the Vale, the Crossing, and the Riverlands.

**Then the Aztecs invaded.**

I was confused at first, because I had just bought the game during the last sale and I wasn't familiar with the DLC yet.  Then, I laughed at the sight of seeing a new house pop up in Westeros, with foreign titles, sigils, and unpronouncable names.  Next, I felt naively hopeful that I could ally myself with the new foreign power, so I married my sister to their leader... The next emotion I felt was fear.

Fear at the fact that 200,000 soldiers with no homeland just invaded Westeros during the most vulnerable time period in it's history, and all I could muster together was a meager 40,000 troops.  It was all I could do to survive.

40 years later, I had lost the Riverlands, the Crossing, and the Vale, as well as 4 territories in the north.  The Westerlands fell immediately, as the Aztec horde landed right in Lannisport.  They then swept westward, taking bits of the reach with them on the way across the Riverlands and Harrenhall, up through the Vale. They finally ransomed my sister back to me - blinded, tortured, and imprisoned for 40 years.

The Iron throne became a joke, controlling a few territories in between the Aztec Empire's holdings, and occasionally roping down Dorne and half of the Reach to appear like a formidable player.  We all knew who was really in charge.

It wasn't until 60 years later, King Harwin I of the North employed a tactic learned from none other than... Zapp Brannigan.  The Aztecs controlled a lot of land, but the horde they showed up with never disappeared, which means it didn't regenerate like levies did.  Observing this, King Harwin started war after war, sending tens of thousands of men to slaughter at the hands of the Aztecs, and then making peace.  The horde, only 100,000 strong at this point, slowly dropped in number.  80,000.... 60,000... until finally they were defeated at an epic battle at Greywater watch... and then Chased for nearly a year until they were completely wiped out.  

The Aztec empire remained for a time, since they were still leige to a number of powerful families, including the Lannisters and the Tullys.  My game is currently at 200 years since the Aztec invasion, and they only control a few scattered territories in the reach, and a few in the vale.  The rest is the Iron Throne, with the Starks in power, at least 15 generations since the Young Wolf.  

The most striking thing about the invasion is how affected everyone's ethnicity.  Now, certain families like the Reeds, the Baratheons, and the Tyrells have Aztec features and titles.  The pagan religion of the Aztecs is still prevalent, and the cause of much civil war in the heart of Westeros.  Also, the Starks all have the silvery hair and purple eyes of house Targaryen, starting with King Harwin.

1369213192.0,132,self.CrusaderKings,1etoqb,This game is awesome,JuanGuillermo,146,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1etoqb/this_game_is_awesome/,"(warning: big wall of potentially broken English ahead)

This game is awesome. You know that already if you are reading this, but I just wanted to share.

I've been playing video games since 1983... yep, that's 30 years of smashing buttons, so even though I'm not a hardcore gamer, I know a little bit about video games. The two games that I've played the most are by far the Civilization series and close second Diablo II. I used to play the original Civilization  all night long when I was a student only to go to college in the morning to keep playing there. I've played Civ II, III and IV, the Total War series... I've played them all. I love strategy games, but I also love and play much more casual games, like sports (NFL, F1, Soccer...) and some RPGs like Diablo, Skyrim, etc... But nowadays I really don't play much, I can go weeks or even months without touching my console or my PC games. I'm getting old I guess.

Last Christmas. I was thinking to myself ""dude... I really miss a good strategy game... but I don't really feel like installing Civ IV or Medieval 2... again"". So when I saw CK2 on sale on Steam, at a very low price, I thought ""I'm gonna try this"".

Big disappointment. I started the game and was like WTF? The tutorials are confusing as hell, I didn't know what to do, how to advance, how to ""conquer"" territories or build units, and worst of all, I didn't really get the ""pause/play"" mechanics, I'm so used to the turn based paradigm that I really felt lost.  So I said, fuck this, and the game went to gather dust during months.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I saw some ad for the upcoming expansion and I said, maybe I should give this a try again, there has to be something I'm doing wrong. But this time I decided to watch some ""let's play"" videos on Youtube first... this is in my opinion the best tutorial that there is. After 2 or 3 hours of educating myself, I went for it..

Being a native Castillian I decided to start as a Conde there ... only to see my ass raped by the moors in a few years. But this time I had fun as I started to ""get"" the game, so to speak. 1st lesson learned: 11th century España was a big clusterfuck, which is historically accurate, so nothing to object here.

My 2nd game I decide to follow the general advice and started as an Irish count. This time I managed to unite almost the whole island and create the kingdom of Ireland. Then, some Scottish motherfucker with a penis complex and a way bigger army than mine decided to invade me and I had the brilliant idea of hiring some mercenaries to secure my kingdom. I was winning the war. I somehow went bankrupt (didn't notice that you have to pay them monthly). The mercenaries ""some white company"" said that they were going to get paid one way or another and declared war on me. The whole island went white, and I, the glorious king of Ireland, ended up being the vassal of some drunkard captain motherfucker. 2nd lesson learned: mercenaries are called mercenaries for a reason.

But it was awesome. Usually when I put la lot of effort in a game and I lose... I rage quit. I once threw my controller against the wall playing Dark Souls, the scratch  is still there, go figure. But this time I thought, wow, that was awesome. I didn't feel like losing but like witnessing a plot twist in a historical interactive soap opera. I played some more years but I didn't manage to get my kingdom back.

There was a 3rd game, in which Ireland conquered all Britannia and Scandinavia only to experience almos 50 years of constant civil wars between several members of my dinasy. There was a 4th playthrough, with a very successful castillian campaign, and a 5th...  And I'm having a blast everytime. I'm hooked to it. This a seriously addictive game. I can't stop it, I play every minute of my free time. It's been years since I've been so hooked to a videogame.

And I was thinking... what is it? What's about this game that I like it so much? Well, it's been said a lot of times, but you don't get it until you play it long enough: this is the best narrative builder that there is. It's not about conquering, it's not even about grand strategy in the strict meaning of the term, it's about history and stories, it's the most literary game I've ever played (I love reading), the plots that unfold in every game could fill a shelve of Shakespearean dramas.

That's all. This game is awesome.

But, for my question:

It went really well, so I am now able to create the empire of Brittania because I hold England, Ireland &amp; Scotland. But, will this mean that two different people will inherit the empires or will the scandinavian empire be ""above"" the brittish one? I'm still under norse succession laws.

After playing the game for about 300 years, slugging and toiling my way as a lowly count in Ireland to a large empire spanning Britannia, Italy, Spain and Carpathia, I thought I was sitting pretty making 130 gold a month with 5,000 in the bank. How wrong I was.

Looking for new targets to add to my empire, I noticed that the neighbouring Duke of Provence (I had just taken over the Papacy in a vicious battle) had somehow accumulated 131,000 gold (!!). That's more than my entire empire had produced in its history. This man is the medieval Scrooge McDuck with a vault full of money that he swims in.

I *must* have it.

I didn't have the BC to attack him with though, and even if I did, that gold wouldn't go to my coffers after I took over. A more cunning plan was needed.

I looked through his family, and luckily his son and heir *hated* him. A useless slob with terrible stats. Excellent.

A small gift later, his son is now in my court. I granted him one of my personal counties, and a duchy. He is so loving me right now! I didn't want to part with them... but unless he is landed, Provence doesn't join my empire when he inherits.

Next, my spymaster is deployed to Provence and assassins are sent in. The first one fails, but doesn't reveal my name. Useless thug...

Second attempt succeeds! Slobby is now the richest man in Europe and my vassal. All I have to do is banish him, and it's all mine. I just need an excuse to imprison him. Spymaster spends a couple of years with him to uncover plots... nothing. He is just too happy to plot.

I make him court jester. It's not enough. Then an idea occurs: operation Pope Bomb.

With the new Pontiff as my vassal, I had him excommunicate Slobby. Slobby is starting to not like me as much. I use the excommunication excuse to arrest him... he rebels!

His forces are weak compared to an empire, and he is soon captured and imprisoned. Now for the banishment, and I'll have my hands on that fortune... what? A massive opinion penalty for banishing him?

With several counties and two duchies to his name (in addition to the tyranny penalty), I would get an almost -200 point hit to popularity. Oops... forgot about that part.

I needed a new plan. Looked again at his family tree - a young daughter is his sole heir, and then his line ends. His holdings would revert back to me. Spymaster and the assassin get to work on his daughter... and botch it. Dammit... still, it's a small opinion hit compared to the banishment option. Try again. Success!

All that's left between me and 131,000 gold (plus all my lands back, and the Duchy of Provence) is Slobby in prison. He really hates me, more than anyone else on earth. Even more than his father. He knows I killed his family. He knows he's next. He knows.

I didn't want to take another opinion hit, so I plotted for him to die through intrigue. Turns out a lot of people didn't like him (especially since he's still excommunicated), and got a few conspirators quickly.

Six months later, I'm informed that a prison escape will be planned, where Slobby will be accidentally shanked. I approve.

Turns out Slobby is not as dumb as he looks, and pulled out at the last moment. He survives. Dammit. Try again.

A year later, another plan is hatched... which is the same prison escape. This time, Slobby is as dumb as he looks. He dies in what looks like an attempted escape gone wrong.

All the scheming paid off: I got back all the lands I gave away, plus a new Duchy, and a mountain of gold, with only a fraction of the popularity hit compared to banishment. My vassals are ok with it overall, as they got their taxes reduced.

**tl;dr - inviting the richest vassals in the world to your court, then backstabbing, murdering and infanticide makes far more money than being emperor for a couple of hundred years.**


So, my question is this: looking through the map, there are several minor kingdoms with 20,000+ gold. Are there other ways in the game to claim that gold, or can it only be done through complicated inheritance schemes like above?

I'm playing as the Eastern Roman Empire (I use TPATT) and married my dude to a woman with a claim on Hungary. After a war she became the Queen and Empress of the ERE. Twenty years later we've had a ton of children and all when suddenly I recieve a call to arms. I thought it was just another one of those transylvanian lords that wants to take the throne.

I was wrong. 

So very wrong.


It was the Holy Roman Empire that had decided to go to war for a claim on Sopron. usually I wouldn't give a damn about such a small country (let alone my wife's) but since it was the HRE I decided enough's enough. Too many times has the HRE been able to bully everyone to give it what it wants.

I accepted the call to arms.

I raised my 50K troops and decided it was time for war. I immediately put 35k of my troops on ships and decided to destroy the shoreline of the HRE down around Cote D Azur and Tyrrhenian Sea which went quite succesfully. Unloading troops in 5'ks they immediately started conquering the southern shore of the HRE.


Meanwhile the HRE had sent its massive forces to Hungary for what they though would be a quick and easy war. Afterall, its just Hungary right?

Their forces destroyed my Wife's without as much as blinking which I had expected. I sent my other 15K troops up to Hungary to help her hold stand which I quickly found was useless. The HRE send massive 20k's and 15k's and decided it was time to fuck around after it had beaten my Wife's forces and now laid siege to Hungary and picked off my 7/8k army blobs with relatively ease. I imprisoned the Emperor's son which I was satisfied with as the HRE kept on sieging Hungary.


Denmark decided to join HRE's side which I really didn't care about - Fuck Denmark. Petty little nation. Luckily for me, Poland (I married my daughter to one with a claim on Poland (Matri marriage) and pressed his claim a few years earlier) decided to join my Wife's cause. Not entirely sure how that was possible, but Poland decided it had had enough of the HRE aswell.

Poland didn't have many forces but the AI suprised me here. Instead of the usual suicide attack, it laid siege to the northern eastern part of the HRE and destroyed Denmark's forces while doing so.

The warscore was at 5% in favor of the HRE. A good ammount of Hungary was conquered and under siege while I had taken a good part of the southern HRE when the Kaiser dies in battle. Its former capitol was in the heart of the HRE where I'd never dare to move my troops, but the new kaiser decided to move it to the western province of Blamont where I quickly blitz'd 8k troops up to take. The capture went better than expected until suddenly a 13k blob came down and decided I wasn't going to go on anymore.

The war was in my favour as he had to go through a river crossing AND I'm ontop of a hill so after a lenghtful fight I emerged victorious with 3k troops left while having devastated the 13k blob leaving it with 4.5k demoralized troops who quickly went away.

While I had blitz'd the capitol of Blamont, my troops south had made a good work of the HRE and raked me in tons of gold. Hungary in the meantime had gotten quite ugly. Poland for some reason had gone down to try and save Hungary only to get annihilated and destroyed by the HRE's massive forces which was much to my dismay.

Despite the siege on Hungary, the war was now 21% in favor of me and my wife which I thought was relatively good. I was wondering if my wife would sue for white peace but it didn't happen.

The war went on and I had taken the southern HRE while Hungary was quite smashed. I decided to send 1000 gold to my wife to see if she'd hire mercenaries but the AI fucked me over and she didn't. With my remaining 1.5k gold I decided to hire mercenaries to bring some of Hungary back into my wife's control when my wife suddenly dies of illness.

My competent heir now became King of Hungary and took me by suprise. He had married a child off to Sweden which caused Sweden to be called in the war and now 12k troops from Sweden came down to bring salvation to Hungary and death to the HRE.

Sweden had taken back a good deal of Hungary as a lot of the HRE's troops had died to attrition after this long war as the supplies had gone down.

The warscore came to 45% in favor of me and my wife when my son suprised me yet again. In personal combat he slayed the Emperor of the HRE and the Emperor of the HRE got a new kaiser.

This kaiser was slightly incompetent and immediately 2 wars for independence broke out in the HRE which devastated the HRE further.


My son enforced his demands and became the victor with me. 

Limberg, Luxemborg and Bohemia became independent shortly after as the HRE didn't have any forces left to deal with them.


After 6 years of war the HRE got crushed because I stood up to it and decided enough was enough.

I just felt like sharing this since I'm rather proud of my accomplishment to defend my wife and later son's land against the HRE which ended up it being crippled and crumble from within.

tl'dr; Stand your ground against the HRE. Don't let the bullies win.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,,True,t3_1e94ct,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1e94ct/enough_is_enough_hre_a_moment_im_proud_of/,

1. Got to http://www.random.org/

2. Generate a number between 1 and 935

3. Mark number

4. Navigate to http://ckiiwiki.com/List_of_provinces

5. Find Province with number


I like this method as I get to play with different chars all the time. Also getting a king or duke is more likely as they usually have more than one province, thus take more tickets in the lottery. 

I always get people I never played with before, now I am playing a 1 province count in western Italy. I have 2 vassal holdings. The duchy I am de jure part of consists of two other counties, belonging to the same guy. I would have never chosen to play as the Count of Saluzzo. I looked up things about the province on Wikipedia and marked down the names of people related to the county. I plan on using these names in naming my children.

I hope this helps!

I hope this is helpful information for new players. Is there anything else that might need to be added regarding DLC?

**Main DLC**

* [Sword of Islam](http://ckiiwiki.com/Sword_of_Islam) - Allows you to play as Muslims.

* [Legacy of Rome](http://ckiiwiki.com/Legacy_of_Rome) - Raise a standing army, reform the Roman Empire. This expansion mainly focuses on the Byzantine Empire and the Orthodox Church. However anybody can raise retinues if you meet the requirements. 

* [Sunset Invasion](http://ckiiwiki.com/Sunset_Invasion) - Aztec invasion of Western Europe in the same vein as the Mongol invasion in the East.

* [The Republic](http://ckiiwiki.com/The_Republic) - Allows you to play as a Republic. Different gameplay from a Count/Duke/King etc...

* [The Old Gods](http://ckiiwiki.com/The_Old_Gods) - Allows you to play as Pagans, as well as opening up an earlier start date (867) and unlocks a new rebellion system.

* [Ruler Designer](http://ckiiwiki.com/Ruler_Designer) - Create your own Dynasty including your name, coat of arms, skills and traits and customize your portrait.

* [Customization Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/226666/) - The Customization Pack allows you to alter all of these things in-game. It has no effect on gameplay, but perhaps on your peace of mind.

* [Europa Universalis IV Converter](http://ckiiwiki.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Save_Converter) - This save game converter will bring the rulers, religions, cultures and nations of a Crusader Kings II save game to Europa Universalis IV, allowing for hundreds of years of additional gameplay.

**[Cosmetic DLC](http://ckiiwiki.com/Graphical_DLC)**

The Portrait packs add new clothing and thousands of unique face combinations for both male and female characters. Mongol Faces also includes 7 new sprites for Archers, Horse Archers, Light/Heavy Infantry, Pikemen and Light/Heavy Cavalry.

1375722553.0,94,self.CrusaderKings,1jr0rl,"I have a genius son and daughter. If I marry them, are they statistically more likely to produce inbred or genius children?",treskies,107,13,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1jr0rl/i_have_a_genius_son_and_daughter_if_i_marry_them/,"Like the title says.  Playing as ERE and my genius children are the product of an awesome union of the imperial house and the Karling family, and are clearly destined to take over the known world.  But is marrying them together worth it?  I don't care about alliances at this point (who needs alliances when you're the blobbiest blob that ever blobbed), but I'm worried about ending up with a whole brood of imbeciles.  

The way I understand it, nobody is exactly sure what the chance of getting the inbred stat is, but it increases the more related the family members are.  Being direct siblings, I assume I'm flirting with the highest chance possible.  Am I right in thinking that having two parents with genius traits means that each kid will have around a 27.75% chance of inheriting it (15% inheritability roll, firing once for each parent)?  If that's the case, as long as the inbred chance is like 25% or less, it's probably worth a shot.  Also, does marrying your sibling carry any other penalties (church or vassal opinion hit, etc)?

**Edit:** I should mention that another potential motive for doing this would be to reduce the likelihood of a succession crisis, since my heir would be marrying one of his main competitors (who has pretty awesome stats, which would help him out a bunch).  Not sure if this actually helps, but who knows.

**Edit 2:** I understand that the chance that the inbred trait is inherited is 25%, but what I'm worried about is the chance the trait *spontaneously* appears in a child resulting from a sibling marriage.  I also understand that they could inherit both.  I'm only wondering if, on a statistical level, whether such a union is more likely to generate children with just the inbred trait or just the genius trait.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,1375741921.0,,roman-empire,True,t3_1jr0rl,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1jr0rl/i_have_a_genius_son_and_daughter_if_i_marry_them/,

1343515156.0,82,self.CrusaderKings,xbeiw,Story Time! How I went from King of Ireland to having my dynasty on all the thrones of the British Isles in  a few short years,2ndComingOfAugustus,92,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/xbeiw/story_time_how_i_went_from_king_of_ireland_to/,"The game started the same way as any other county of Dublin start, and I quickly unified Ireland and started slowly removing the Scottish presence on the island while working my way into wales. Thanks to an alliance made with the HRE I stomped my way through the duchy of Meath once controlled by the Scots. In the final war however, for the final county on the tip of Ireland, I noticed something strange. The Scots put up no resistance. Not a single field battle happened in the entire war, I besieged the region and as it fell, the Scots surrendered. At first I was pleased at being able to win so easily, but then I thought to look deeper into the Scottish position. I was shocked to find out that a member of the House of Godwin had made his way onto the Scottish throne, and the reason he had ignored my war in Ireland was because he was embroiled in  a war for the English throne which William the Conqueror had successfully taken from his dynasty generations ago. And he was winning.

I was terrified. A unified Scotland and England would rip me to shreds, but I had no valid war the declare against Scotland, and finding one would break my truce, ruining my reputation. But I soon found a more interesting solution. One of my distant relations also had a claim on the English throne, which I immidately pressed. My goal was simply to beet the Scots up and than hopefully make white peace with England, but little did I know how well the war would go.

All my economic investments paid off when my army of 25000 landed in Northampton to find The English and Scottish armies had badly beaten each other in the fighting. I was able to crush both of them and started to take hold of Scotland's captured territories. The HRE had refused my call to aid the war, but I soon began to think I could hope for more than just white peace. I beat off all the English defenders and another wave of Scots when something else interesting happened. A third Scottish army was defeated... and the King of Scotland was Captured! I first thought 'Awesome! Ransom!' but then began to think more ambitiously, for there was knife work that needed doing. I used my leverage over the king to have his daughter to marry my son and heir... then had all of his sons killed.

It's the triad of 

1) **desire,**

2) **promise and**

3) **fulfillment of promise.**

At this moment, characters back your plots and agree to your proposals based only on *current* situtation: their current relationships, titles, etc. But what if you could **promise them a situation that they desire?**

For example, a spymaster who is in good relations with their liege usually can't be persuaded to join a plot against him. What if, however, you promised this spymaster a duchy after the plot is executed? This might change his point of view entirely. However you'd then have a traitorous and probably ambitious duke in your realm who has a high Intrigue. (Of course, should his relations with his liege be really high, only huge promises would make him change sides, e.g. a kingdom or an incredible sum of money).

Another example: you want to ask the Pope for an invasion, but don't have enough piety. But what if you promise the Pope a bishopric or changing the Investiture laws in the realm? This hypothetical situation might benefit you both, and he might consider allowing the invasion.

What if you break a promise? First of all, your reputation is pretty much ruined for a long time. Secondly, wronged party gets a Cassus Belli which would allow it to get what was promised initially.

What it boils down to technically **(skip this list if you don't care about the technicalities):**

1) Characters should have Desires. They currently have ambitions and desire titles (also there are 'Political concerns', which remain a mystery to me). This should be expanded to Base Desires (desire for any title, noble marriage, money, etc.). The Desires should be weighted based on their relevance and current situation.

2) When proposing a deal or inviting to a plot, the player (or AI) should be able to make a Promise. The Promise is described by a situation that should be present after the goal has been attained. This is very similar to how diplomatic actions requirements look like now, e.g. 'Character A has the title X' or 'Character B is married to character C', 'Character D has been given a sum of N by character E'. The Promise should affect the character's disposition toward the current deal. However, he or she should consider whether the required goal is attainable.

3) After the goal that required the Promise is attained, there is a period during which the situation described in the Promise should occur. If it does, the character who made the Promise gets a relationship and a prestige boost.

4) If the situation doesn't occur, the Promise is broken, and the wronged side gets a Cassus Belli to restore justice. The character who made the Promise gets a relationship and prestige penalty.

5) If the goal isn't attained, Promises are anulled.

I realize that this system may not be easy to implement or mod in, but it doesn't require fundamental changes to the game's structure. It does sound like something that would be a bitch to program the AI for. It will also require a coherent UI. 

But think of the possibilities! **For example:**

* Playing as William the Conqueror and promising riches and titles to English nobles who turn to your side. 

* Dividing a weak HRE among France, Hungary, Poland and the Pope. 

* Getting the crown of Rus by backstabbing your brothers.

* Inviting spymasters to plots by promising them untold riches, then murdering them (that's not going to be easy, considering their Intrigue).

* Playing as Iberain muslims, dividing the Jimenas and gobbling them up one by one. 

* Playing as a Russian duke under Golden Horde and creating an alliance to overthrow the Mongols. (By promising other strong dukes large parts of territory; also, by promising territory to ERE?)

* On that note: inviting foreigners to your rebellion against your liege by promising them land. How much of your homeland are you willing to sacrifice to get the desired title?

* Also, while revolting against liege, you may promise independence to his other vassals if they support you.

* Recruit councillors from abroad by promising them positions in the council (thanks to /u/justamathnerd)

* Etc., etc.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. Feel free to comment and criticize this idea. 

**TL;DR:** As a king of France, you should be able to promise an excommunicated king of Scotland the English crown for allying with you in an invasion against England, grant him the title after the victory, and then watch England disintegrate and gobble it's dukes one by one.

*TLDR* (I realised I have just created a massive wall of text so I'll put this up the top): I stopped saving and had my most interesting game so far. Instead of being a massive blob as usual after 150 years, I had to struggle tooth and nail to hold on to a single Kingdom and it has been incredibly satisfying. I would highly recommend it.

In my current game, I made a promise to myself not to reload under any circumstances, and this is probably my most interesting and fun game so far.

I started off as a Count in Norway, and invaded a Duchy in Tuscany, as well as taking Rome. In the subsequent hundred years, I have dealt with many game-ending situations, but the reign of Queen Asta I 'The Fat' of Italy had to take the cake. 

Asta's grandfather Egil created the Kingdom of Italy, despite being a weak craven. He converted to Catholicism after being Holy Warred by the HRE. I'd like to say I was rp'ing because he was craven, but in reality it was the only option as I was about to get steamrolled. He died age 38 of depression, with his son Hakon, a 16 year old diligent kind strong Brilliant Stategist, betrothed to the heir of the Byzantine Empire, inheriting the throne. Everything was coming up roses, until at age 20 he was unceremoniously assassinated, with no children as his betrothed was still under age.

So who was first in line for throne? Hakon's slothful glutonous 10 year old younger sister, Asta. My glorious plans of uniting the Italian and Byzantine thrones were in ruin. This is normally where I would rage quit and reload, however I kept my composure and the result was brilliant. The timeline went something like this

970: Hakon I dies childless, his 10 year old sister Asta inherits. Succession crisis begins

974: Asta gives birth to a daughter

976: Second daughter born

977: Succession crisis finally ends, Kingdom of Italy is bankrupt

977: King of Aquitaine presses his claim to Italy. Asta surrenders immediately as her levies have been devastated by the succession crisis, and the treasury is drained. Asta is now Duchess of Latium

979: Third daugher born

980: Asta excommunicated at the request of her aunt, Duchess of Ferrara

981: Fourth daugher born (succession laws were Gavelkind, so the Duchy would have been utterly broken up between four daughters if Asta were to die at this point)

982: During a war to lower crown authority in Aquitaine, Asta presents the King of Aquitaine with an ultimatum to return the throne of Italy. Aquitaine's levys are already depleted with with current civil war, so the King accepts, and Asta gets the crown of Italy back (less the Sicilian holdings)

982: Immediately following the reacquisition of her independence, the Holy Roman Emperor declares an excommunication war. Italy's armies are quickly devastated. Using every last gold piece, Asta asks for a papal indulgence, and gets her excommunication lifted. The casus belli becomes void (with war score at 95%)

983: King of Aquitaine presses his claim on the Kingdom of Italy and Duchy of Latium. Before he is able to bring his allies the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Asturias into the war, Asta offers to join the HRE's holy war for Mecklenburg. The Holy Roman Emperor and King of Asturias are unable to join the Aquitaine claim war because they are allied to Asta in the Holy War for Mecklenburg.

984: King of Aquitaine surrenders the war, and his claim to Italy

985: Asta I dubbed 'The Fat'

986: Aquitaine's Norse Sicilian vassals rebel. Asta joins the war, and the Sicilian rebels win. They accept vassalisation, and return to the Kingdom of Italy.

987: Succession crisis in Aquitaine, with the King's brother pressing his claim. Asta joins the war out of revenge, and the King of Aquitaine is killed on the battlefield in Provence with Asta's husband and Marshall leading the center.

988: Asta gives birth to her first born son, a genius, at age 38. He becomes the sole heir to all of Asta's holdings

It was an absolute roller coaster ride, but Asta came out on top in the end. If I had reloaded the game when her brother died, I would have continued in an orderly fashion and became a big blob as I normally do.

1367410741.0,80,self.CrusaderKings,1dh6bv,Tip: The Power of Beautiful Women,Pinstar,90,10,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1dh6bv/tip_the_power_of_beautiful_women/,"When people speak of breeding in (or marrying for) good genetic traits, what comes to mind? Genius most of the time, and occasionally strong. 

What many people miss is that of all the good genetic traits, *attractive* has the potential to be the most powerful. 

Howso you ask? Most people's experiance with attractive is modest. Their male ruler gets a freebie +1 diplomacy. Yay... Nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about either. This is because attractive's power is largely wasted on a male ruler. To see it really shine, it needs to be on a female ruler. 

In addition to the previously mentioned +1 diplomacy, being attractive gives you one more, often missed, bonus: a +30 ""Attraction to:"" relationship bonus to adult males (and homosexual females). 

This is a global bonus. All vassals, all courtiers, your Liege, rulers of other nations and even the freaking pope! +30  to them all for free for life. 

The implications of this are HUGE since 95% of the people in power are male. 

1. An attractive female rising to the throne is much less likely to suffer from revolts, pretenders and other forms of civil war. Her short reign penalty is completely nullified by attractive...and then some! 
2. Once her reign is established, her realm becomes even more stable than normal. Vassals are less willing to form, join or remain in factions.
3. The buffer in vassal opinion allows you to run harsher levy/tax laws and reap their full benefits. 
4. Bishops are more likely to give YOU their taxes and levies rather than the pope. 
5. You can carry more of a tyranny penalty without destabilizing your realm, letting you be more flexible with revokes and/or banishments. 
6. You are more likely to find people willing to join your plots, or be within bribing range of wanting to join. This includes courts full of people who would normally despise you. (I've been able to plot to kill muslim rulers as a christian, and get plenty of muslim court members to help me do so)
7. Foreign rulers are somewhat less likely to attack you due to their generally higher opinion.
8. Allies are more likely to come to your aid when called into war.
9. You are less likely to be excommunicated by the pope, even when running free investiture, freeing your Chaplin to either convert or research culture, rather than kissing the pope's rear. 
10. If you are in elective, your vassals are more likely to vote along with your wishes. 
11. You are unlikely to be killed via plot as many people will be unwilling to join a plot against you.
12. Claimants are more likely to accept an invitation to your court.
13. Allies of your enemies are less likely to join them in a war against you. 
14. Changing major laws (crown authority) and/or succession laws becomes easier when all your vassals like you. 

The list goes on. If you can pick up Gregarious (an additional +5 global, plus another +5 to vassals plus a few extra points in diplomacy) and have a decently high diplomacy stat, the effect becomes even more powerful. 

The easiest way to get an attractive female ruler is to be in Agnatic-Cognatic Elective. This will allow you to nominate anyone, including women. Breeding for attractive is the same as breeding for Genius and Strong. 

If you have never had an attractive female ruler, give one a try!

Yes, arabic vikings, you heard that right.

Starting as the count of Urgell in 1066, leading the very aptly named family d'Urgell (They were very creative), I started with a very fixed plan. I would have my arabic vikings and will conquer the whole world with them!

After several decades of trading bows with the independent muslim counts, and the occasional claim fabrication, I managed to step up the ladder by aquiring the duchy of Aragon, then the kingdom of Aragon.

During this time, my eugenics program was well underway, with half of my family being bred into norse (with the occasional mishap of going swedish too), and the other half being bred into christian andalusians.

Eventually, 50 or so years, I have had my first great ruler, the one who will later be known as Sultan Berenguer-Ramon the first. Initially born as a catalan, he was tutored by an andalusian relative, ending up as an andalusian.

By 1125, I had must of Aragon under my control, and was well underway in my holy war for Andalusian, amidst broken truces, assasinating the Jimena rulers that had the very annoying tendency to ball up, and meddlesome French and Pisan imperialists conquering provinces I had dibs on! (The game does not recognize the very elaborate tagging system of ""I saw that province first, fuck off"", so I had to *accidentally* kill some of the more expansionist rulers.)

One of my first measures as a Sultan was to establish an Antipope...this had the very (un)fortunate side-effect of turning the HRE to the Waldesian heresy. I thought nothing of it...until it got ANGRY and started kicking everybody in the shins. France was plunged into civil war and split between Aquitaine and France...Poland was quickly subdued by the HRE, and Hungary, formerly moderately successful in conquering half of Croatia was also besieged by a very angry, snorting HRE.

This, however, gave me the opportunity that I was looking for. Catholics were having a second great schism! It was time to reunite my norse and andalusian breeding lines.

The artificer of this was Sultan Tifilwit d'Urgell the first, also known as ""the Silent"", a catholic andalusian. I like to think that he was sort of a badass who never spoke and only mimed commands. He was very sucessful. Despite not being a genius, he had crazy stats, and no bad traits except his shyness. (I am very certain that later historians will have said that he was so imposing that he didn't need to speak.) During his reign, he created the Kingdoms of Andalusia, Leon, Castille, Galicia and Portugal, as well as switching the capital to Granada and making Andalusia the primary title.

During his time, the kingdom of Aquitane also fell prey to the snorting bull that was the HRE.

Screenshot time!

Here, we see the religious distribution of Western Europe 100 or so years after start.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=126042533

Here, we see the Pope having a VERY bad idea.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=126069314

Nevertheless, the Pope's Bad idea turned out to be a blessing in disguise. While the other Catholic Simpering fools were floundering about in Italy getting their asses handed back to them, the HRE had a sucession crisis...which Sultan Tifilwit seized and led a chain Holy War, claiming southern Aquitane, and western Burgundy.

And then died, 50 years after taking power...a very strange situation because his heir was elected to be...Sultana and later Empress Umm the Holy, the first Andalusian viking queen, or whatever. Suffice it to say that she was a Norse pagan.

She created the Empire of Hispania, and started handing kingdom titles to her co-religionists. Suddenly, a wild jihad appears! And another one! At the same time! This was a very interesting point. While the Whole Muslim world was supposedly, jihading, they arrived in very small numbers, allowing the new Empress to crush them quite handily, and in the process, pass the time so the opinion penalty of short reign+female ruler to diminish.

At one point, it seems that the Jarl of Toulouse, had the very nice idea of marrying a Hungarian princess. Which died after having a daughter and a son. Which inherited her weak claims to Hungary. After, it just so happened that the King of Hungary died (which I had no part in! Honest!), and then the Empress, on a whim, decided to invade Hungary on behalf of her kinswoman, the 2-year old Naila, daughter of the Jarl of Tolouse.

Long story short, the hungarians were caught offguard by the arab vikings landing through Croatia, and little Naila ended up Sultana of Hungary *and* Croatia (a mistake what will have costed me dearly  in about 150 years).

The next few rulers stuck to a tried and true recipe. Badshah Garsiya I  opened two more fronts, in Ireland and in Armenia, and debarked 20k shock retinues in both sites. After, standard recipe. Assassinate leaders, induce civil war, declare conquest of multiple counties at a time, inch across the map.

Empress Dima the Holy opened up a front in Italy too, and basically followed the same procedure.

Here's a screenshot, showing the progress of conquests.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127295311

Yadda yadda, conquest of Aquitaine, France, Ireland, Scotland, Mauretania, Italy, Poland and Armenia at the same time. When HRE was waving a civil war, shave a couple of counties from their fat corpse too. (I was wary of entering a direct conflict, because Hispania was so large and I started relying only on Shock retinues. I did not want to damage the levies, because factions were getting pretty big.)

Ultimately, my hubris was to be my downfall. One of my sultans, predictably the fat bully that held both Hungary and Croatia, kept getting into factions and slapping his neighbors. He began inching into Poland, and Bavaria and Serbia and Austria. I got annoyed at his indiscretions (and his fat 30% relative power), so I imprisoned him and banished him. 

BAD. BAD. BAD. -350 tyrant modifier. The Empire was plunged into civil war, with quite a lot of people demanding independence.

Ultimately, I lost: Portugal, Galicia, Castille, Ireland, Scotland, Armenia, Mauretania, Mali, Ruthenia, Bavaria(MORON, I WAS SAVING YOU FROM BULLIES AND THEN YOU BETRAYED ME :( ).

The end date was about 1325. I still held Aragon, Andalusia, Navarra, Leon, Aquitaine, France, Hungary, Croatia and Italy before the tyrant modifier got down to manageable levels...so it wasn't a COMPLETE disaster, since I still had more army than pretty much everyone except maybe the Fatimids and the Ilkhanate.

However, I only play 'ironman' mode...which means no reloading previous saves, unless the game crashes. In the end, I did not feel like going through the whole motions to conquer everything AGAIN, so I called it a day.

Here's some screenshots of the Empire at its near-apex, before I pissed everyone off.

During a war with the Petty King of Munster, his wife was captured when I took his keep.

Using the song of Ice and Fire mod 0.4.2. Despite the lack of visual aid, I hope you enjoy the story.

Started with a custom character in Thenn, Baldr Volsung. I gamed his stats a bit because I expected this to be extremely hard. Married a Lannister bastard who hated me and tried assassinating me every other year (always failed). She gave me five children anyways plus the two bastards I fathered and legitimized. Started slow, only conquering the Northern Frostfangs to get my Duchy title and defending from the other wildlings.

Eventually, the Frozen Shore pissed me off enough to conquer it. Wasn't as hard as I thought it'd be. Declared myself King Beyond the Wall and the rest of the wildlings willingly bent the knee. Nowhere left to go but the Wall. Made three unsuccessful wars against the Wall over the next few years (The North keeps sending doomstacks to help out). Baldr ended up dying in personal combat with the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Due to the chaos of elective succession in the Kingdom Beyond the Wall, the genius greenseer son that I set up to inherit (even gave him a duchy title) lost the election to his younger sister who was weak in all stats except martial. Oh well, long live Brynnhilde, Queen Beyond the Wall.

Her reign starts off slowly and painfully, since she's 14 years old and her brother was the King's intended heir. She marries a Bolton bastard with mediocre stats (but has ""strong"" trait and an alliance). Peasant revolts are happening every few months and my personal levy can barely keep up with fighting them all off, since movement beyond the wall is slow. Still, putting down these rebellions is filling my coffers with gold from sacking captured castles. Several counties fall out of the realm when the title holder dies and need to be re-conquered.

Eventually, I have a long enough peacetime to feel comfortable with another raid on the Wall. Before I start, though, I sent my Chancellor to sow dissent in Winterfell and start marrying off my siblings to lords in the North. Doesn't matter, still lose the war again. Everyone hates me and my brother tries to rebel. Crush him simply enough, but it won't let me revoke his titles for some reason. Eventually need to bow to pressure and release him or else everyone will hate me more.

Time for another war to get my vassals' mind off of how bad I'm doing. As soon as the treaty expires, I invade the wall again. This time, I rush everyone straight to Castle Black and sack the place, somehow imprisoning the Lord Commander and therefore conquering the place. Basking in my victory and torrent of notifications, I take a look at the rest of the world. The Iron Islands have split up the Riverlands, but otherwise, everything looks not much different from the de jure kingdoms. After a couple years of peace (barring the occasional revolt or title falling out of kingdom), suddenly the Kingdom of the North collapses. I decide to take advantage of the situation and invade. Most of my allies are rebelling against the new Stark king, so I call them in to support my invasion. As my army marches towards Winterfell, I see a doomstack of 15k coming for my measly 8k army. I start to retreat, but just before they catch up, another rebellion starts, removing their armies from Stark's doomstack and bringing it down to 6k. I easily defeat them and in the battle, King Brandon Stark is captured. I am low on cash, so I wait to end the war until I sack Winterfell. In the meantime, both rebellions somehow end and I end the war controlling a unified Northern kingdom including the Wall and Beyond the Wall. All this because of the luck of getting two impossible wins by imprisonment.

THE QUEEENINDANORFF! I move my capital from Thenn to Winterfell and give my rival brother the titles he wanted as well as the Wall so I stop getting spammed with notifications. Seeing the Riverlands are still so broken up and with my ""wildling invasion"" CB being so useful, I start taking them with my Northern doomstacks. Since I'm on a roll, I take the Vale as well without too much resistance. Conquering the Iron Islands gives me both the Iron Islands title and the rest of the territory the lets me create the Riverlands. The Westerlands put up a good fight since it's starting to take a while for my vassal levies from the North to get to the battlefield, but eventually they are conquered too, allowing me to crown myself Iron Queen.

The remaining kingdoms fall like dominoes, despite how much all my vassals hate me for both being a wildling and worshiping the Beyond the Wall Old Gods. I set up my son to become a Northman with regular Old Gods religion so when he inherits, people will like him. I make sure my inheritance is primogeniture, then wait. Iron Queen Brynnhilde lives to be 84 despite constant assassination attempts, has eight children and conquered the entire map in a single lifetime. Her son, Iron King Siegfried is a genius attractive greenseer with decent stats and beloved by my vassals. Everything looks stable, so I decided to just wait until Aegon's landing and see if I can fight him off with a unified Westeros. Unfortunately my game crashed a few years later and the last save I have is from right after I conquered the North (for some reason autosave gets disabled whenever I start a modded game).

This patch rebalances Merchant Republics: There is now a limit to how many Trade Posts you can have, based on palace upgrades and the number of adult male dynasty members in your court. ""Family Dues"" are now paid only to adult male dynasty members in your court, and they all receive the same share. Also, the Seize Trade Post plot has been nerfed in several ways (see the change log below.)

NOTE: Due to various unexpected problems in the engine, there are still known issues with multi-player on Mac and Linux. We will solve these for patch v1.10.

**The diary of King Serlo 'the Holy' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/ursa-minor-88*

21 January, 1107

The LORD teaches us to honour our parents—not to love them. Father is dead; good riddance, I say. I grew tired of his lecherous hedonism and demonic fits.

I am [Serlo d'Isigny, Count of Aintab](http://i.imgur.com/8rMLXAn.jpg). I chafe beneath the greedy, slovenly rule of [Duke Abulgharib Varajnuni](http://i.imgur.com/aAcXjSL.jpg), a godless Armenian heretic. How can someone bear to be godless *and* a heretic? The mind reels.

The LORD teaches us to be fruitful and to multiply; this I have not yet done. Father forbade me and my two youngest brothers from marrying, yet he gleefully wed my twin brother, [William](http://i.imgur.com/zrHr0gu.jpg), to that deceitful [Princess Adalmode](http://i.imgur.com/cdeDyXF.jpg) of France! How angry that made me! *We're the same age!*

For years I had heard whispers of a beautiful young woman in the faraway court of the Emperor. Now that I am a ruler in my own right, I can win her for myself. [Adelheid Salian](http://i.imgur.com/9tUAWdP.jpg), youngest daughter of the Emperor, at last will be my bride.. as well as my stepmother. Why father ever thought he could be the right man for her is beyond me, especially considering his advanced age. Thankfully they never consummated the marriage.

***

6 February, 1107

The wedding is a quiet affair; this pleases the LORD. It is nonetheless a boon to my prestige that I did not accept Royal Aid Duty. At long last, my ambition to marry is fulfilled. May Adelheid bear me many children.

After the wedding, I summon my two younger brothers, [Tybalt](http://i.imgur.com/KrrVbUs.jpg) and [Turstin](http://i.imgur.com/4yegTUM.jpg), to my apartment within the castle. They're both sinners in the eyes of the LORD: Tybalt is proud of his gluttonous ways and Turstin is a cruel little liar. What's worse, they're both Armenian dogs. This castle isn't *that* small, but I have had the good fortune to grow up in the Norman wing of the castle... while my youngest brothers have not. Yet they're still family; the family line must continue somehow. Perhaps I can see to it that their children are raised as proper Normans.

I inform Tybalt that he has been betrothed to [Princess Pernette of France](http://i.imgur.com/SEANmpR.jpg), the youngest sibling of my sister-in-law, Adalmode. She will journey to Aintab when she comes of age.

For my youngest brother, though, there is a surprise waiting in my chambers. From behind a billowing curtain emerges the frail, timid figure of [Princess Rannveig Olavsdatter](http://i.imgur.com/ZrgWk6W.jpg), sister to the King of Norway. Shortly thereafter they are [wed discreetly in the family chapel](http://i.imgur.com/GjVbO9F.jpg), Rannveig quivering tremulously before the Court Chaplain.

***

20 March, 1107

My liege must have been given a copy of my wedding speech by his herald. The speech, in part, had outlined my ambition to be his lordship's new Marshal. Duke Abulgharib agrees; my ambitions are once more fulfilled. If my new position as Marshal can lead me to the slaughter of heathens, all the better.

***

25 March, 1107

My master calls upon my talents for the first time. The Duke's younger brother, the Count of Tortosa, has been in open rebellion since before my rule began. I lead a detachment of over five hundred and forty men into battle against the traitor. I cut my teeth at [the Battle of Rhosus](http://i.imgur.com/LLSDvbA.png); my liege [is victorious](http://i.imgur.com/QI4jO25.png).

I am furious to discover that my liege is at war with the Duke of Armenia Minor over control of the County of Teluch; if that Greek dog seizes my liege's current seat, will he unseat me in turn to retain his position? My rage is incalculably great. I rally my men back to Aintab to consider my next move.

***

1 May, 1107

Word reaches me that the [King of the Greeks](http://i.imgur.com/ejPzBCQ.jpg) has come of age. Fulfilling my father's promise, I send [my elder sister Agnes](http://i.imgur.com/G3tidr9.jpg) to his court to cement our alliance. He may be a heretic and a pretender to the true Roman Empire, but he's got an awful lot of troops I could borrow.

Emboldened by my political ties—the King of the Greeks, the King of France, even the Emperor himself—I declare independence from my mongrel of a liege lord a mere three days later. My father has saved a modest fortune; I send word for the Swiss Band to come to my aid.

***

14 May, 1107

A rag-tag band of ruffians mob to my liege lord's cause. What's next, women and children? These heretical peasants will burn, mark my words. At [the Battle of Perre](http://i.imgur.com/T5ohy6S.png), my retainers swash buckles with the Dukes of Armenia Minor and of Antioch. The fighting lasts until the 9th of June; [we are victorious](http://i.imgur.com/QVXmoli.png)!

I hear a rumour that my worthless brother Tybalt is plotting to kill my beloved twin William. I put a stop to that nonsense immediately. What am I if not my brother's keeper?

***

1 October, 1107

I could strive to become better, or I can be satisfied with who I am and what I have, like my sinful father before me. My way is the way of the LORD; [I will never be satisfied](http://i.imgur.com/6zbfa4g.png) until the heathens and the heretics are vanquished and I stand before GOD on the day of judgment. [I deserve good things](http://i.imgur.com/ZsnBdH1.jpg) and I will work to get them!

***

22 October, 1107

[Princess Pernette](http://i.imgur.com/WHQ74Oo.jpg) comes of age and arrives at court. Like his brother before him, Tybalt is wed in a discreet service within the family chapel.

***

15 December, 1107

Word reaches me that Alp Arslan the Lion, dog-beast of the Seljuks, [has finally rotted away in his degeneracy](http://i.imgur.com/mYbBTeV.jpg). Look to your sins, Alp Aslan; the night is dark and full of terrors. Should the Seljuk succession prove unstable I might yet profit from this.

***

22 December, 1107

My liege lord's demesne has fallen to my forces at last. We begin the march south to Tortosa to unseat his brother who, at some point, pulled a truce from my liege lord's lips.

***

10 January, 1108

The Seljuk Sultanate is collapsing into warring states, or so I am told. What those heathens get up to in their spare time is really no concern of mine.

***

5 October, 1108

The war is won! I have freed myself from that detestable worm. Truly this was the LORD'S work. I had to release the Swiss Band to prevent bankruptcy, but my remaining levies were sufficient nonetheless. I hear word shortly after that my brother-in-law, the King of the Greeks, has usurped my former liege's county of Teluch. Excellent move, Serlo. *Excellent move*.

***

16 August, 1109

Rumours reach me that my other junior sibling, Turstin, is plotting to kill my beloved twin William. I put a stop to that, too. These Armenian mongrels boil my blood.

***

7 March, 1110

Fate smiles upon me. My wife Adelheid is pregnant!

***

29 April, 1110

What better present to give my wife at her baby shower than [the County of Edessa](http://i.imgur.com/SABAAFA.png)? It was a simple coup; the King of the Greeks was instrumental, heathen though he may be. [There is a famous lake there](http://i.imgur.com/7VXmfdX.jpg) where God saved Abraham from Nimrod. It was absolutely beautiful to stroll by the water and to feed the sacred fish knowing that Abraham had stood where I had stood.

***

3 June, 1110

To finance my independence and expansion [I enact a large church tax law](http://i.imgur.com/5MeItgw.jpg). Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's; so fork those tithes over, gentlemen, I have holy wars to finance.

***

6 October, 1110

Praise the LORD! My first son is born. I name him Talbot, in honour of his grandfather. My ambitions have once again been fulfilled. Now if only I had a daughter...

***

12 October, 1110

[A popular writer at court](http://i.imgur.com/eNqKrky.png) proposes to compose my family chronicles in honour of my son's birth. The expense is worth it: the embroidery, the gold leaf, and the penmanship are enough to give pause. I am [proud of my achievements](http://i.imgur.com/g3BqPtk.jpg).

***

1 January, 1111

The Court Chaplain brings a pleasant surprise for 1111/1/1: Edessa's peasantry have flocked to the Christ. My pride is justified.

***

6 August, 1111

Travellers, pilgrims, and merchants rush to the castle with reports that the Moslem duchy to the south has collapsed into even greater chaos than before. This is the LORD'S doing; [I must seize this opportunity](http://i.imgur.com/38WQwXv.png) to control [the County of Tell Bashir](http://i.imgur.com/oveglje.jpg).

***

6 March, 1112

The King of the Greeks is by my side; the heathens are mowed down like lilies before me. My victory over the Count of Tell Bashir is assured. [I am clearly the greatest Count that this region has ever seen](http://i.imgur.com/Gpmw8ap.jpg).

***

28 July, 1112

Victory! [The Moslem surrenders](http://i.imgur.com/mp5Nfem.png). Some day, perhaps, when my finances have recovered, I will be able to establish a bureaucracy worthy of a duke; till then, I must do the LORD'S bidding as a mere count. My Court Chaplain at once begins the task of converting the peasantry of Tell Bashir.

My levies are full; the King of the Greeks is yet by my side. Filled with pride and the zeal of a true Christian, [I announce yet another holy war](http://i.imgur.com/d6zBV2n.png): this time, on the Emir of Murtazid, to seize the territories of ducal Antioch. The King of Norway and the King of the Greeks both answer my calls to arms.

***

2 October, 1112

Woe! At merely 21 years of age, my brother-in-law, Constantine XI, [dies comatose in bed](http://i.imgur.com/SjFuvqq.jpg) doing battle with the Moslem. I wept at his bedside; he was my brother by arms as well as by blood and I had come to love him for it. I cannot convince his successor to join me in my efforts; I must continue with the strength of Norway alone at my side.

***

1 January, 1113

[Pope Romanus II](http://i.imgur.com/qqdhzDt.png), thrilled at my ability to succeed where the Crusade did not, announces the formation of [the Knights of St. John](http://i.imgur.com/jYQCR5K.png).

***

8 January, 1113

My delight at the Pope's announcement is matched only by the discovery that my wife is pregnant once more. We do not have as many children as my brothers, to be sure, but we are trying.

**The Diary of Duke Svein af Reddit**

[15 September, 1066](http://imgur.com/e6I4bqv)

First, things first, I need to find a wife. I don't want to waste any time, because I'd like to start having sons pretty quickly. I'm going to focus a bit on diplomacy, especially this early on in my reign. I decide to marry a Norwegian princess who has good genes, and a nice and powerful father.

[25 September, 1066](http://i.imgur.com/gKnlCoA.jpg)

Alright, my council has been taken care of for the most part. Everyone is starting off with the petty tasks I've given them, and nobody is doing anything exceptionally important. My chancellor, though, does not like me and is also pretty under-qualified. His skill in diplomacy leaves a lot to be desired. I'm going to keep an eye out for people of higher skill to invite in, as I'll want to fabricate some claims. For now, though, I'll give my chancellor the task of keeping relations up – because I haven't reigned long, and also because I am a foreigner, my vassals don't like me that much. Hopefully I can change that a little bit while I look for a better chancellor.

[26 November, 1066](http://i.imgur.com/DBRD0HW.jpg)

I suspect my subjects do not like my high tax rates. I'd like to begin focusing on building up the infrastructure in my own holdings as well as pressing my de jure claim on the Isle of Man soon, so I really don't want a revolt on my hands this early. Stupid peasants.

[29 July, 1067](http://i.imgur.com/nAwKvUB.jpg)

Independence faction formed already. I need to appease my people, because I don't have the strength to hold off any sort of rebellion. This whole “being a foreigner” thing is not fun.

[29 August, 1067](http://i.imgur.com/9B39TfK.jpg)

Count Mac Congail of Carrick is already pushing his independence on me. He took a month to create his faction and then try to push his demands on me. Fuck that noise.

[23 January, 1068](http://i.imgur.com/38BB4SJ.jpg)

Well, it seems that our enemy has died in his cups. Some sort of wine accident. A cynical person might think that this seems suspicious, but I hear that he had many enemies, even within his own court.

[25 November, 1068](http://i.imgur.com/jTQL7UB.jpg)

I am the father of a beautiful baby girl, Gunnhild. I have a dynastic heir, which is nice, because now House av Reddit can continue to procreate! There's a lot more pressure on me to continue my legacy for my future dynasty.

[2 January, 1069](http://i.imgur.com/E7CTXAe.jpg)

Shit.

[21 June, 1069](http://i.imgur.com/GSBKUOt.jpg)

Denmark has agreed to come to my aid, but the King of Denmark is involved in 3 wars currently. His invasion of England is not going well, and I think I am about to become a Scottish vassal. I'm sorry House av Reddit, I know we would have loved to keep our independence, but try not to hold it against me too much!

[27 January, 1070](http://i.imgur.com/7FpMIte.jpg)

Denmark is no longer a part of the war with Scotland. There really is no hope left.

[26 April, 1071](http://i.imgur.com/7GUypwa.jpg)

The war is coming to an end. My only solace is that King Malcolm was killed in battle, and his 4 sons were killed in suspicious accidents. The crown of Scotland rests on Malcom's brother's head.

14 July, 1071

Well the war is over. I am apparently quite the dumbass, and didn't look at what the terms of the war were. Apparently we only lost Argyle. In all the scuffle, we did end up getting the Isle of Man as our vassal. I feel really dumb, and I feel sorry for my future heir. My next goal is to work on getting the money together to create the Duchy of Galloway. I hear distant news of merchant families making thousands of gold coins, and I forgot how tough it is to come by money over here in the northwest!

21 November, 1071

As I'm waiting for money to collect, I'm going to work on bolstering up some of my personal skills. I just finished upping my intrigue, and now I'm working on stewardship. Hopefully I can round out my skills a little better while I wait for the money to roll in.

[31 January, 1072](http://i.imgur.com/loRdFwR.jpg)

As I was looking through my list of vassals (all 3 of them), I was trying to think of ways to increase their opinion without spending any money. Obviously having a son would help. Reigning a little longer will help. But then I noticed that one of the mayors was an imbecile. I think we can all agree that we can't have those kinds of people in charge. It is going to be laughably easy to kill him off. I mean, wait, what? I'm sure he'll be fine, [but there's talk that the roads aren't as safe as they used to be!](http://i.imgur.com/TWiGIrj.jpg)

31 December, 1072

A son was born! Now that I have more than one child, I consider changing the succession laws. but I think I'll leave them for now. I don't have many counties, and I don't know how many I'll end with – and besides, I am rather passive by nature.

17 June, 1074

I've improved some of my skills, and I've sent my chancellor out to try and fabricate some claims in Ireland. I'm getting slightly bored, and a little power hungry. I'm planning on revoking titles from my 2 vassals and filling my plate with titles. Sometimes the shy guy gets power hungry I guess!

[13 October, 1074](http://i.imgur.com/RkMKNwg.jpg)

That was a bad idea. A very bad idea. I think I knew that deep down inside, but it took actually following through to find out.

[12 June, 1076](http://i.imgur.com/QNBFAZV.jpg)

Well this small war has almost bankrupt me. I had to blitz with a small mercenary force, and now I'm finally making my way out of debt. I trust that having this second county will be worth it in the long run.

5 January, 1079

My son is at the age where he can be educated. Naturally I am going to take him under my wing to complete his training. Hopefully I can train him to be a better leader than I am – this war that I'm in is taxing and tedious, and was not my best decision.

[30 July, 1083](http://i.imgur.com/bjX0TLf.jpg)

After waiting around, educating my child, and trying to gain a footing back after my disaster of a war to revoke titles, I found a good civil war in Scotland. The King of Scotland is losing his throne, and so I took the opportunity to try and reclaim Argyle. We'll see if my over-aggression hurts me or not.

12 June, 1085

Unfortunately, civil war in Scotland did not last as long as I would have liked. Once the war was over, Scotland invited an ally duke into the war, forcing my surrender. It seems that I won't conquer any land for the next member of our dynasty to inherit.

30 May, 1086

Scotland invades Soreyar, trying to enforce its de jure authority over it. My allies are busy and weak, and will not come to my aid.

20 July, 1087

The Pope died recently, and the new Pope seems to like my position in the Holy War that Leon is waging. My role in it is primarily for show – I need Leon's alliance if they ever end their warring with the Muslims. Anyways, I have been given 200 gold, just as Scotland will finish me off.

[26 December, 1087](http://i.imgur.com/nhOEhYi.jpg)

Gallaway is forcing their independence. I am unable to raise any levies, and my allies refuse my call to arms.

10 March, 1088

My chancellor has finally come through. I have a false claim on Ulster. Hopefully I can come out of these rebellions relatively unscathed, and move my way into Ireland. Scotland seems too powerful for now.

1 July, 1093

I've fallen ill. I hope I can remain alive, simply so that I can make a move into Ireland and not have my whole reign be a waste of land.

10 August, 1093

I feel alive! The fever is gone and I feel great! 

30 March, 1094

My chaplain tried to convince me to convert the Lollard heresy. I refrained from it – maybe we can go heretic later on in our dynasty. I don't want to fuck it up for everyone more than I have already.

[17 January, 1095](http://i.imgur.com/MkPaRfb.jpg)

I have usurped the County of Ulster! My first good deed for our dynasty. Hopefully I can continue this movement into Ireland.

[31 July, 1096](http://i.imgur.com/yHW4MHb.jpg)

My wife has died of smallpox. A dark day indeed.

13 May, 1102

I no longer have any holdings on Scotland's mainland. Piss on the King of Scotland.

[15 October, 1105](http://i.imgur.com/o47CkB6.jpg)

After saving money and getting lucky (tithes and a papal gift), I had enough money to pull of a blitz of Scotland. I usurped Innse Gall by dodging Scotland's armies and taking the capital. We have our original holding in Scotland back! The war was short and sweet, and it feels good to have the King of Scotland surrender to me for a change.

22 May, 1111

I've managed to change the laws to elective monarchy. My second son seems better qualified than the first, and overall it's a little bit more of a civilized system...I think we can all agree.

8 September, 1114

At 70 years old, I have captured the County of Oriel and created the Duchy of Ulster. I pray that in my old age I have made up for the mishaps of my youth. These last 50ish years have been hard on my body and my mind – I'm getting old. Hopefully my sons can make progress in the af Reddit name.

[30 June, 1116](http://i.imgur.com/F6BfFhw.jpg)

Svein af Reddit has died at the age of 72 in the battle for Tyrone. He died in the midst of frantic expansion of his small realm, desperate to leave a legacy for his sons and their sons to look to. May he find rest in the glorious afterlife.

I didn't know at the time that Paradox actually made one of their own (and have made a new one for The Old Gods), but mine is certainly different. My ambition was to make something approaching the glory of Microprose's manuals. I freely admit that I fell short, but I'm still proud of my accomplishment and would like to share.

This manual is over 3 MB in size and is nearly 100 pages long. It is up-to-date as of the 1.10 patch and includes all of the major DLC (Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, The Republic, and The Old Gods). Cosmetic DLC and Sunset Invasion are not included, as they have no mechanical impact on the game (please correct me if I'm wrong). It is not approved by or associated with Paradox Interactive, and is not intended to replace or compete with any work they have produced. It is made freely available by me, the sole creator, and will be removed if Paradox deems it a conflict with their products.

There are definitely ways I could improve this manual, but I think it is basically functional. It is structured so that the most critical gameplay concepts are described first, with the more specialized information coming later. I have refrained from doing play-by-play instructions, and instead have focused on giving enough information so that a new player could (theoretically) understand what each mechanic does and why, but still have lots of opportunity to be surprised as he or she plays.

Constructive criticism is always welcome!

While I love DLC with new government types, I have no interest in more combat realistic or in depth combat.  I have plenty of other games that do that well.  Instead I would love to see future Crusader Kings DLC or patches that add more ways to interact with other characters in the game.  

For me the game in my head gets better the more I get to know the characters in the world, so anyway that can be deepened and more micro-manage-y would be a big plus for me.  

Things like:

- More ways to influence opinions through interaction with a character.  Maybe the ability to spend something else besides gold (time?) trying to influence another character
- Larger and branching RPG-style event chains that effect your character or other's in your realm 
- Lots of added Family Drama and decision making
- Romance DLC (would have been great for Valentine's Day)

1375815842.0,64,self.CrusaderKings,1jtvmy,Malinese Matriarchy takes over world before 1000!,MarcusOhRlyius,79,15,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1jtvmy/malinese_matriarchy_takes_over_world_before_1000/,"Preface: Once there was a woman. Who like many other people wanted to kill everyone, and everything that did not look exactly her. Or talked funny, or smelled. Either way she wanted to kill everything. And thus was the story of the Malinese Matriarchy! 



Now let me tell you something. Despite the historical Malinese empire being both more technologically, and economically advanced then it's European counterparts. The in-game location in no way reflects this. It is literally the hardest location of any to start. You have 0 boats. Your technology in everything is 0. You only get access to one set of Mercenaries the entire game. Your levies are crap (also despite the historical malinese empire being able to raise 100k men). You get no special options as a West African pagan that other pagans don't recieve. If you are a female West African pagan you get no hunts, no feasts, no special options period. The economy is also nothing to write home about. Also, the idrisid emirate is sitting right on top of you, and you HAVE to fight them. 



Anyways. I played the Mande as if they had similar cultural norms to the Akan people in terms of matrilineal land succession, polygamy, and raiding their neighbors. (The historical Mande were actually patriarchal, and patrilineal like their european counterparts.) Anyways, I tried to enforce Enatic succession as much as I could in game. Even though my vassals never seemed to adopt it wilfully. : P 

I play in Windowed mode. So, I had to take four different screenshots to capture the full scope of my empire!:

Here are the beautiful, and oh so lovely matriarchs themselves!:

[Matriarchy](http://steamcommunity.com/id/herpderpprofile/screenshot/1118302506451232414)

Anyways shower me with your karma, and praise thralls. 

Edit: Game Mods: I used Legacy of rome, Olds gods (obviously), The Republic, The Sword of Islam, The ruler designer (mostly to start as female), and a homebrew mod to make enatic succession available only to the mande culture. Besides that I didn't use project balance or anything. 

editedit: This was my code for enable enatic succession for the mande. If anyone wants to try:

It was controlled by the Fatimid Caliphate, which was massive.

When I joined, Pope Martin had about 67% contribution to the Crusade. I figured I'd just pick up some Piety because I needed to create the Kingdom of Ireland. I sent about 1000 men over and followed the Caliphate's 14,000-stack around re-retaking territories it had retaken from Pope Martin, always staying in coastal counties and having my ships ready for a quick escape if the enemy turned toward me. Many of the provinces I took back were ""main aims of the Crusade) or whatever, which gave me 100 prestige and 100 piety each. I gained like 600 prestige and piety in about 2 years. Then I went home to wage war against Tyrone, thinking my Crusading efforts were through. Nope.

About 3 years later I checked on the Crusade again and found myself about 0.5 percent off the lead in terms of contributions. How? Nobody had ever retaken my holdings in Sicily. I rounded up about 7000 in levies and mercenaries and went back to do exactly what I'd done before: follow enemy armies around, taking advantage of the pathetic garrisons left behind after they conquered lands, and taking them myself. I also found another interesting strategy: when I saw that the main enemy army was about to fight the main ally army (in this case, 14,000 Caliphate forces and about 12,000 HRE and various ally forces) I used my ships to get a quick route and attack the enemy first, taking substantial casualties but getting credit for leading the ultimate victory as well as any prisoners taken in the effort. At the end, my contributions sat at 51% despite only losing about 4000 men in the whole course of the Crusade, and since Sicily was held by a non-Catholic, and all lands taken are given to the ruler with the highest contribution, I was given the whole of Sicily. Including all the counties, baronies, Prince-bishoprics, etc, it came to 35 landed holdings, which was quite a windfall for a King with merely 4 held and 4 vassal counties. After that, the independent Earls of Ireland were quite ready to swear fealty to me, making me King of all Ireland and Sicily after about 55 years of game time, having begun as lowly Munster.

Quite happy with myself.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,britannia,True,t3_1g0tca,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1g0tca/a_note_on_crusades/,

 ''I some cunt''.
The glorious emperor Niketas the Great died after contracting syphilis from his slutty mistress and his son Boethius came into power as the rightful first born son. Now as it happened Boethius was a greedy, lying, lazy sack of excrement and his vassals much preferred the younger middle brother Simeon. barely two months into my rule, there was a coup against the throne and I had no chance of winning a civil war so I ceded the throne to the traitor. Now I shrugged my shoulders, the Byzantine throne was just an assassination away. 
Little did I know it would be a twenty year odyssey littered with bodies. 
Weeks after the coup Simeon had a two sets of twins (who were born in the purple to make it worse). I was still wildly unpopular so no plots could be hatched. 
Meh I thought, I am still  the most powerful militarily. Just wait for the honey moon period to pass but it got worse. Some of lands we revoked in a conspiracy by my youngest brother Ioseph. Fuck. 
But I was in luck. The empresses wife was plotting to murder my son, so I captured her, but I couldnt afford the negative opinion of an execution and the emperor would only remarry, so I had her blinded in the hope of no more kids. It worked.
The emperor loathed me and the feelings were mutual and I could feel an imprisonment looming so I had to act fast.
To make a long story short, I married of a few spare daughters to powerful dukes to build up my alliances. I supported by my brother Ioseph to seize the throne and a civil war erupted. I went straight for Constantinople and captured two of the emperors children, had them executed.  Had his third son murdered by his own guardian (one of the dukes in my pocket) and the youngest luckily died of pneumonia. Simeon lost the war and he was executed by Ioseph. For pure evilness I excommunicated the old wife of Simeon and had her executed. I rapidly set to work on Ioseph, and covered my bets by marrying one of my daughters to the heir. I murdered Iosephs second son in a plot, but he discovered an attempt against his eldest but had no idea about his second (heh) . I had to offload a duchy to keep in his graces. 
History repeated itself and I could feel an imprisonment arriving so the emperor was assassinated in a very risky killing band it cost a fortune. I was firmly in the driving seat and I launched a coup against the heir won and had him imprisoned, excommunicated then executed. Oh it should also be mentioned that I killed off more than a dozen other members (including three of my fathers bastards with the slutty mistress) and of my extended dynasty to forgo any festering civil wars that would tear the realm apart. 
Boom Basileus Boethius the Wicked, kinslayer, murderer, adulterer (told ya history repeats itself.  Murdered half his dynasty, spent up to 9000 gold on various gifts and killings, and caused an extremely bloody and protracted war *for his brother* who he later murdered. I love this game.

Here is a checklist of factors to consiter before declaring. 

1. How many troops do I have, and are they maxed out? (Generally good to wait for your levies to recover. Using the train troops mission can further help)
2. Do I have any factions who are sitting at 20% or higher? (Going to war and losing troops will increase faction % of liege ratios, making them more likely to fire mid-war
3. What is the status of my target's military? (Nations that are at war with someone else are generally good targets... especially if that war has been dragging on for years. Check the warscore)
4. What is the status of my target's allies. (Especially important for holy wars, if your target is weak but ALL the nations it is friends with are strong, you may find yourself overwealmed)
5. What is the status of my threats. (Nations who have claims on your stuff are always a threat...even if they don't care about your initial target. If a neighbor with a claim has been at peace for years, get ready to fight on two fronts or don't go to war until they are distracted)
6. How much money do I have? (Always have enough to hire an additional merc band, even if your initial attack includes mercs.)
7. How much money does my target have? (Very important when attacking republics)
8. Can I weaken my target first before going to war? (Sowing dissent is OK...but murdering a leader with a child heir is better. If you can throw a nation into chaos first, going to war becomes easier. 
9. If my ruler dies during the war, will I still be able to win it? (Unless it will be a quick war, be wary of starting long slogs when your ruler is older or has -health traits. If you have a well-liked heir, this is not as much of a problem). 
10. Will I be able to make use of, and defend my new land if I win? (Snagging a county with a weak claim when they are rebelling is great... grabbing one halfway across europe...not so great.)

Having started as a count in Navarra...these tips have served me very well in establishing a very strong presence in Spain very early in the game.

1367501829.0,56,self.CrusaderKings,1djslz,Tip: Daughters make good council member magnets,Pinstar,62,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1djslz/tip_daughters_make_good_council_member_magnets/,"Having good council members is always important, but sometimes you'll find yourself lacking good candidates.

 Maybe your 21 learning Chaplin just died and the next best guy only has a 12. 

There are a few things you can do... you can try your luck with 'invite noble' or 'invite holy man' and hope that the randomly generated courtier has good stats...but that is often wasteful and very unreliable. 

You could go to the people searching window and look for men with good stats to invite to your court...but this is tedious and very unreliable. Unless you can press a claim of theirs and they don't like their liege, they're unlikely to come. 

The best solution is with your daughters and matrilineal marriage. The willingness of a male to come to your court is now no longer based on claims they might have or how well they like their liege, but now on how impressive your daughter is. This can get you males who would otherwise not agree to a simple court invite. 

By clicking the marriage icon on your daughter, checking off matrilineal and sorting by the desired stat, you can very quickly see if she can attract you a better council member. Once married, he'll come to your court and can then be made into a council member. 

There are a few other advantages to this: 

1. Your daughter will start giving you grandchildren in court...this opens up the possibility of superior future heirs, especially if you are running elective. Future competent council members and generals are also possible. If anything, you'll have more warm bodies of your dynasty to do with what you please. (I like to hand newly built cities to kinsmen or nominate them for my bishoprics to give a little boost to my dynastic prestige without them becoming a powerful potential claimant.)

2. Your daughter will not be giving children with weak claims to other realms.

3. Her husband is ultimately disposable, so if he dies on a council mission, you can always re-marry your daughter in the same way.

4. Her husband can be nominated to be the heir to a bishopric if he has decent stats and you are in free investiture. By making him a bishop, he'll become landed and thus have more children with your daughter (by removing the invisible fertility penalty the game gives to landless couples to cut down on baby spam). 

The two downsides to this are that you lose out on a potential alliance from marrying off your daughter, and that your daughter is likely to take a prestige hit from marrying someone of low birth (since men with real power are unlikely to agree to a matrilineal marriage). You do occasionally get lucky and find bastard princes with good stats who have no choice but to matri-marry. 

Note: this generally does not work with more distant women (Nieces and female kinsmen). Once you get to that level of seperation, very few men will be willing to matri-marry save for extremely old men or members of your own dynasty.

This is where my pettiness pops up. I decide fuck it I'm not going back to being a lowly subject king when my character dies.

In doing so i piss off mightily everyone as I usurp duchies and give them to my favoured relatives. Eventually the Kings of Italy, Bohemia, Bavaria as well as a slew of smaller dukes declare independence and I let them walk away.

My old king is now 78 and him and his son control over 50% of the HRE yet somehow people refuse to elect his son. My king dies and the Salian King of Lothringia comes to the throne.

**14 September 1066**

I enter [the Black Chamber](http://www.kcn.ru/tat_en/history/images/oldtower.jpg), the legislature of my people, dragging my predecessor behind me in chains. Dirt, grime, and pebbles from the ground outside have lodged themselves in his wounds. On either side of me march proudly the courtiers and noblemen who plotted to install me in my rightful place.

The chamber floor is square, with rows of benches on either side of the throne. Afternoon sunlight streams through the stained glass windows of the dome and sparkles on the abstract mosaics along the chamber walls. My chained captive leaves a wide smear of blood and tears on the well-polished floor as I drag him behind me. The assemblymen murmur among themselves, their eyes falling on their she-dog of a former ruler. I speak.

""Assemblymen, welcome. I have patiently awaited this day. You will see that many seats within this chamber sit empty; your brethren who resisted my rise to power are dead. Their lands are confiscated, their older sons are executed, and their widows, daughters, and younger sons will bring much pleasure to me and my men before they, too, are killed.

""Although I will not tolerate treason during my reign, I will endeavor to be a just and honest monarch. And so long as you obey my commands, I will content myself with cruelty against our enemies. Give me your loyalty and I will build up a fortune for the Bulgarians of the Volga not seen since our ancestors swept across the steppe with the armies of Attila.""

The assemblymen are gazing at their feet. Their expressions are far away. One by one, their eyes turn to look upon me. Shaking his head at their timidity, my newly-appointed steward, Mayor Uzluk of Suar, rises from his seat and claps loudly. Like deer bolting from a copse, the rest of the assembly rises in imitation. Some feign joyful weeping; others give forced cheers and praises.

I am [Ishanadl, Duke of the Bulgars of the Volga](http://i.imgur.com/0J1E1Ve.jpg). Beware.

***

[**15 September 1066**](http://i.imgur.com/pQ2Kfx1h.jpg)

A messenger arrives from the court of Biyar, [High Chief of the Mordvins](http://i.imgur.com/Wqc9fCX.jpg).

""Your highness, sovereign Duke of the Volga Bulgarians, lately sending couriers into our land, the Cheremisa, did claim certain villages and strongholds, in right of your great predecessor, Attila the Hun. In answer of which claim, the High Chief my master says that you savour too much of your youth, and bids you satisfy yourself with the shores of the confluence of the Volga, as befits your contented nature. He therefore sends you, as more appropriate for your youthful spirit, this chest of mighty treasure; and in lieu of this, desires to hear no more of you. This the High Chief speaks.""

I gesture to my stewards, Mayor Uzluk, to examine the contents of the small chest borne by the messenger.

""What treasure, steward?""

Uzluk peers into the chest, frowning. He appears hesitant.

""...ankle bone dice, my liege, [with which to play Asik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagai).""

I drum my fingers against the arm of my throne. My head tilts back, and I gaze at the domed roof above me in contemplation. The assembly sits silent, their eyes fixed on me or on the tremulous messenger. At last, I speak.

""We are glad that your High Chief is so pleasant with us. We thank you for his present. And when we have roused our retainers, we will, in the Cheremisa, by God's grace, play a game with him. Tell your master that I will crush him; I will see him and his people driven before me; and I will listen with delight to the lamentation of his women. Go in peace, and tell him. Go!""

As the messenger departs, I summon my riders into the chamber. Scribes hurriedly pen my shouted orders.

""Call up the troops! I want two thousand men assembled in Bulgar by the end of the month!""

***

**17 December, 1066 - 14 January 1067**

The godless horde of High Chief Biyar surround [the walls of Bulgar](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bolgar.JPG) in a foolhardy siege. Hearing the roar of our hooves, the Suomenusko devils flee to [the fields of Ashli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aşlı), where we overtake them. I myself lead the vanguard and delight in the slaughter of over a thousand worthless pagans. Routed, Biyar and his personal guard flee back to the safety of the Mordvin patrimony. The Battle of Ashli is a great victory; that we outnumbered our foe two to one is of no consequence.

***

**17 January 1067**

As we march west into the heart of Mordvin territory we are intercepted by a courier from the capital. I am informed that Pyera, [High Chief of Perm](http://i.imgur.com/mdBcVRs.jpg), has invaded the northern reaches of our patrimony to press his claim to the valley of Votyaki. [The Mordvins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordvins) are weak and spineless; the armies of Perm are not. I must force a northward march to deal with Pyera before returning south to complete my conquest of the Cheremisa.

***

**26 April - 5 August 1067**

Our forces clash with High Chief Pyera at the Battle of Sarana in Votyaki. Our forces are evenly mached, with no more than fifteen hundred men to a side. Although there is no great slaughter, the battle is a tactical victory. We pursue Pyera's host east to the very gates of [Perym, their capital](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Sergei_Mikhailovich_Prokudin-Gorskii_-_City_of_Perm._General_view_%281910%29.jpg)! Pyera's troops are driven against their walls and impaled. Alas, Pyera and his personal retainers escaped through a secret tunnel back into the city. Rather than lay siege to the pagan citadel, I lead my troops south to complete our destruction of the Mordvins.

***

**26 October 1067**

My men toast to my health as news reaches the camp that my First Wife, Ipekel, has given birth to a son! My dutiful wife has named him Ishanadl in my honour. Some day, God willing, all that I rule now will belong to him and his heirs in perpetuity.

***

**6 November 1070**

Victory! I lay waste to the Mordvins and delight in the personal torture and execution of their priests and noblemen. Biyar, his wife and two daughters in tow, flees to Perym. I later learn that my other foe, Pyera, takes them into his care at Perym. I divide the Cheremisa among various courtiers - contented, quiet stewards who will obey me for the foreseeable future - and return to Bulgar in triumph.

***

[**20 December 1070 - 19 September 1071**](http://i.imgur.com/rdq6Ngjh.jpg)

[Chief Tugan of Kerzhenets](http://i.imgur.com/KgOdzUz.jpg), one of my few pagan vassals, is scandalized by my treatment of the Mordvins. He demands I grant him independence! The fool! My harsh treatment is justified. They're barely human!

My forces were ready to depart Bulgar for Perym anyway. At the Battle of Zäy we crush Tugan's forces and [sack his citadel at Qazan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Kazan_cityscape.jpg). My troops lay siege to the fortified villages and temples that surround the citadel, looting and raping as they go.

***

**13 November 1071**

A courier arrives from Bulgar with more troubling news: Begluk, [the High Chief of Tyumen](http://i.imgur.com/7v4v5fT.jpg) - a vassal of the Khan of Cumania - has invaded our patrimony over his claim to one of our counties! I order a small detachment to march north to continue the fight against the pagans of Perm, headed by my faithful steward, Uzluk, while the bulk of my forces prepares to march south to meet the Tyumen host.

***

**7 March 1072**

I find Chief Tugan, the snivelling lord of Kerzhenets, hiding in the cellar of a freshly-sacked temple. His wife and two sons cower there beside him. After a tumble with his wife, and another with one of his sons (I can't remember which, really), I cut off his thumbs and throw him in prison. He'll stay there till he rots, no matter how many times he begs for more suitable accomodations! I strip him of his title and grant it to one of my loyal followers.

As I bathe at camp that evening, news reaches me regarding the Khan of Cumania and his vassals, the High Chiefs of Tyumen and Aktobe. Apparently [the two of them have freed themselves from the Khan's yoke](http://i.imgur.com/UnkELEY.jpg) and now rule as independent lords. Willfully cut off from the assistance of his former Khan, the High Chief of Tyumen may be easier to repel than I had first assumed...

***

**8 - 21 January 1073**

The Battle of Belebey is as brief as it is decisive. Don't these idiot nomads know how to fight? My forces, numbering over twenty-four hundred, caught a mere one thousand troops drunk on wine after sacking one of my vassal's holdings. They were an easy target and died quickly.

***

**25 December 1073**

Word reaches me that my steward, Uzyuk, has successfully sacked the capital city of Perym in the lands of Perm. Surrounded by my soldiers with no avenue of escape, High Chief Pyera has accepted defeat. He will not press his claim further. Uzyuk's men in Perm march south to join the bulk of my forces as we sack the Cuman villages, temples, and citadels of Tyumen.

***

**13 September 1074**

[Tyumen has fallen](http://i.imgur.com/Z9mrWAI.jpg)! My troops have taken hold of the city. After the populace has been subdued and the city walls garrisoned with men under my command, I take it upon myself to inspect the tallest building in the city.

While peering out of one of the tower's windows, what should I see but the face of my own son and heir, Ishanadl, peeking back at me! The boy, who has accompanied me with his mother on my campaign in Tyumen, is about six years old now; it's high time I took him under my wing and educated him! Fatherly discipline will keep him from wandering off so foolishly. I seize him by the waist, pull him inside, and drop him on the floor of the tower.

""Ishanadl! What are you doing?""

""Exploring the walls, father. I'm curious about how they're made. They look very different from the walls we have in Bulgar.""

""Oh, very well. If you can't be cautious, at least be smart about where you go wandering.""

""Curiosity never killed anyone, father!""

""True. Go on, now. Be quick about it.""

What a brave little boy.

She then killed me! So I become her! Every faction turned rebellious and the revolt risk was high in every province. Still I swore to keep the kingdom intact. Gifts here, chancellor there, estates hither and landed titles dither. It seemed I was keeping the vassal in check. 

Yet that emirate in southern Italy looked awfully pretty. 'I must have it' I decreed, and declared holy war on them. Once the war on the infidels was won I realised the terms of the peace were not what I wanted. Those infidels kept their little kingdom but became my vassals. Yet I didn't want my kingdom run by people I didn't know or trust. So I revoked their title... 

Rebellion! It was the moment my vassals had been waiting for, every faction (over 80% of my vassals) rebelled and joined the infidel's cause. There was nothing to do but unadulterated war. Every penny went on mercenaries and the civil war raged on for over a year. The war score was 72% in my favour (hurray for one large force versus many small ones) until I landed in Naples to take on their own turf. Alas it was at this point where I noticed the little crown icon at the top of the screen. My only dynastic heir had been killed in battle! And my Queen was leading the main army in Naples. Before I knew what had happened the King of Lombardy had somehow joined the fray, on the enemy side! 

15 thousand mercenaries and Sardines (I know it's Sardinians) faced well over 30 thousand Italians and Infidels. I lost and with it my queen was killed... my game over. All because of my greed when my kingdom wasn't stable.

Keyboard Shortcuts and Interface Adjust does not change your checksum or any other game balance, it is simply cosmetic/ease of use.

Keyboard Shortcuts + Interface Adjust:

	Interface Adjust:  Adjusts the character selection GUI so that it does not overlap with the character interface.

	Keyboard Shortcuts:
This adds 11 shortcuts to the game: ""z"",""x"",""c"",""v"",""b"",""n"",""m"","","",""."",""/"",""l""

z raises levy directly from any county you have control over

z also toggles siege interface while selecting a province or army in an enemy province.

z also sends units to the left side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit left.  press and hold for rapid rebalancing

z will 'cancel' or 'go to' on event windows (such as disband troops, or after a siege/battle has completed)

z will go to the previous holding in demesne

x dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship), *capital* ""x"" will dismiss ALL selected levies or ships

c raises ships directly from any county you have control over

c assaults holdings when you have an army/county is selected that allows for assaulting

c Confirms diplomacy interactions, and will 'ok' event windows (such as disband troops)

v embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province

v also selects all armies inside boats if a ship is selected

v also will close one army at a time while having multiple armies selected.  The two previously mentioned shortcuts take priorty.  This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking.  (v selects armies, right click all onto a county, press v, right click onto another county, repeat.)

v will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies

b merges selected levies or ships, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally.)  If you have a single army/shipgroup the ""b"" key will open the new unit interface (ship/army rebalancing)

b also sends units to the right side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit right.  press and hold for rapid rebalancing

b will go to the next holding in demesne

b is also back button for the main interfaces

n selects the trade port screen on coastal provinces

m selects the normal holdings screen 

l toggles looter status for pagan armies

, opens the ledger, and closes the ledger

. opens the find characters interface, and also closes it

/ opens the find title interface

_______________________
To manually alter keybindings, download notepad++ from www.ninite.com and install
use notepad++ to 'search in files', select the mod folder as the directory
search for: Shortcut = ""
(leave the quotations open)
this will pull up all the shortcuts listed in the mod files.
doubleclick on the bottom of the screen through each of the results until you see the ""guiButtonType =	{"" that looks like what you want.
you can alter or remove any of the options that say ""shortcut = ""x"""" to your liking
There is some trial and error to this if you are not experienced with the layout of the game files.  Just play with it, you'll figure it out.

can be found [here](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/sites/default/files/pdx7605us_ck_ii_onlinemanual.pdf)

**marking a person of interest**
by  [star_eater ](http://www.reddit.com/user/star_eater)
&gt; Right-click on the character, and the two usual buttons show up. I think the right one takes you to the diplomacy screen, and the left one takes you to the character screen. If you right click the left button, it will bring up a sub-menu with three buttons: one marks the character as special interest (and will show up on the right panel if you set it up to display special interest characters) and give you high priority messages for them

**boats**
by [nvsbl](http://www.reddit.com/user/nvsbl)
&gt;Another thing I learned faaaarrrrr too late: if you click one fleet and hold shift, you can click and drag to select all your fleets. Before this I would try to click and drag, end up selecting an army, and then either move all armies definitively out of my click box area, or click each. and. every. fleet. individually. It was both liberating and embarrassing at once when I realized this.

**messaging**

 * holding ctrl when deleting a message , deletes all the messages
 * holding shift , will delete all the messages from that type.
say you have 34 unread messages and 20 are from construction finished in ... , shift delete will then delete all those construction finished reports , leaving the other 14 messages untouched


**technology**

click on a county you will see the technology numbers (9/16/14 (constantinople 1066))
hovering with the mouse above it will shown you the advances chances .
(in this case only a meager 0.85%/year for bows because of an ahead penalty of -77%, even with the +100% technology focus)

you can use this to see what the AI is focusing on!

**republic tab**

 * holding ctrl when clicking the campaign fund raises or lowers the fund with 100 ( thats 9 clicks saved)
 * holding shift when clicking the campaign fund  raises or lowers the campaign fund with 50 (thats 4 clicks saved)

**updates &amp; additions**

 * chancing names of cities,baronies,counties , bishoprics  , click on the county/city and click again on the name
you are now able to chance the name. always want to be the ""count of the imperial republic of galaxies"" 
now you can, now you know

 *  **time saving in plotting** by [TheGuyWithTheEars](http://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuyWithTheEars)
&gt;I have one that saves time when inviting a bunch people to plots. After opening the potential plotters window right click on their portrait and then right click on the diplomacy button to bring up the mini-menu (same process as marking someone special interest, but with the other button). Clicking invite to plot from here keeps the window open, so you don't need to go back to the intrigue menu every time

 * **reorganizing units**  by ahhheygao on the Paradox forums: thx to [UseHerNom](http://www.reddit.com/user/UseHerNom)
&gt;You can reorganize your unit composition for each of the three ""flanks"" (or combine 3 into 2 or just 1) by clicking [on the arrow button to the right of the unit icons](http://i.imgur.com/xxcq0H4.jpg) and then using [the small left or right arrows](http://i.imgur.com/sx18BMp.jpg) for each individual levy or retinue

 * **tips, tricks &amp; meta gaming** by [SecureThruObscure](http://www.reddit.com/user/SecureThruObscure)
&gt;[another great topic with hints](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/17ok4d/tips_tricks_meta_gaming_for_everyone/)
 
 * **Changing Capital** by [i_like_jam](http://www.reddit.com/user/i_like_jam)
&gt;If you want to change your capital, click on the provence you want to move to and in the top left there will be a small crown icon. The game will prompt you to ask if you want to move. You can only move once in a ruler's life time.

&gt;Changing capital as a republic is impossible

I'm currently in a Wales playthrough and decided to check out the ancestors of my characters and my vassals ancestors. To my surprise Paradox has not only covered the ancestors of the starting characters but also the ancient line of the Lords of Wales all the way back to 300ad.

For those interested:

* [Tegid Prydain](http://i.imgur.com/Xrm9yc6.jpg), [Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegid_Foel). Earliest ancestor of Cunedda, the first king of Gwynedd.

* [Gwrtheyrn Gwerthrynion](http://i.imgur.com/UsyX4fd.jpg), [Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortigern), aka Vortigern, progenitor of the Mathrafal Dynasty and the guy who apparently invited the Anglo-Saxons to Britain.

* [Coel the Hen](http://i.imgur.com/L79q6ssh.jpg?1), [Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Cole), aka Old King Cole, ruler of Alt Clud (Strathclyde) and father-in-law of Cunedda. All the Welsh dynasties are all descendants of this guy apparently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway this got me wondering if there were any older characters in the game.

I think this needs serious improvement in modeling, and would be a fun and depth increasing addition.

Firstly, we need a college of cardinals.  Every dukedom should have an arch bishop of its diocese.  Arch-bishops could be promoted to cardinal based on papal support. or a king could request a cardinalship from the pope.

Naturally the college elects the Pope.

But what we really need is something to fight over, and while we have investiture (which is a good start) adding *money* I think would be better.  

Every kingdom should be able to set it's tithe to the pope.  Excess funds collected above the tithe go to the crown.  Obviously the pope would want *more* money, so he'd like you less for what you set the tithe to.  And would make demands on you to raise it.  A paticularly generous pope might lower it.

Empire level titles should also require papal support, or you don't get your de-jure bonus.  This would help recreate the constant fighting between the Pope and the HRE.

Anyway, those are my ideas.  Does anyone have any others?",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,,True,t3_10zuyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/10zuyk/papal_dlc_ideas/,

I am still in awe over the events that transpired during my father's reign. In any sensible world I would've been the heir to two of the pettiest kingdoms in Europe, instead I have risen to power in the greatest empire in the world!

[Same day](http://i.imgur.com/SWCTUpf.jpg)

As wonderful as this is to the glorious house af Reddit, my new vassals do not seem to be overly thrilled. Orthodox greeks do not take kindly to being ruled by a catholic irishman, it seems. For the sake of the realm I will make sure to educate my child in the greek ways, hoping his future rule will be easier to swallow.

[Same day](http://i.imgur.com/LtCHASn.jpg)

I am wary of the huge mongol empires right next to my eastern border. The young khan of the Golden Horde is yet to be married, so I quickly propose a betrothal between him and my daughter. Better have the monstrous horde as an ally than an enemy, I always say.

[2 may 1257](http://i.imgur.com/ZtDC1eg.jpg)

Oh dear, my fears are coming true. I can't believe these obnoxious greeks would rather have that sorry excuse of a man rule them than me! I fear this may be a little much to handle...

[29 may 1257](http://i.imgur.com/uY0T9q0.jpg)

I'm in luck! It seems the pretender had an... unfortunate accident... meaning the war is settled undecided. How nice!

[3 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/Mg1TpDA.jpg)

Despite this obviously being an accident, everyone is suddenly blaming me for the poor chap's death! I'm not getting any more popular, that's for sure.

[13 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/u069CQC.jpg)

And to top it off this spoiled brat goes complaining to the pope! What did I ever do to her? Anyway, a generous donation to our beloved church will surely change the pope´s mind. I still won't forget this, Queen Elen!

[27 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/Ra3NZoj.jpg)

Well isn't this cute! My little brother and his single county is trying to usurp my throne. This will be easily taken care of.

[29 september 1257](http://i.imgur.com/gD2mktb.jpg)

Son of a bitch! I just can not catch a break, can I!? Just about all of Greece and a good portion of Britain is supporting my brother, I can't believe this, is he any different from me in their eyes?

[22 november 1258](http://i.imgur.com/c1stmnt.jpg)

Lady luck smiles upon me again as another tragic accident removes my rebellious brother from my list of problems. Amazing how these things are working out for me...

[28 november 1259](http://i.imgur.com/T5tfKfs.jpg)

The calm doesn't last long, however. Another major revolt, and this time a well-placed assassination...err, I mean, strange accident - won't buy me out of the trouble. It seems I'll have to stand my ground and 
actually fight them off this time.

[7 december 1259](http://i.imgur.com/IjKUd1M.jpg)

But this is where my strategic diplomacy earlier pays off! A quick bribe to the Mongol Khan and he is happy to aid me in my war. Amazing how a savage pagan like him actually seems more honourable than my Christian vassals. With his help I might just pull this through.

[2 april 1260](http://i.imgur.com/zEWcQSN.jpg)

...that is unless a second wave of traitors comes a' knocking. Will they ever give up?

[5 april 1260](http://i.imgur.com/k15fMGL.jpg)

But once again it seems trying to usurp my throne is perilous to your health. They say throwing a coin in a well will make your wishes come true, but I find throwing it in the hands of a shady man with a dagger works just as fine.

[2 august 1260](http://i.imgur.com/BtvfvK4.jpg)

Never losing faith, are they? This seems to become an annual tradition! In order to save time in this retelling of my rule, [**let me just say this...**](http://i.imgur.com/MFkSdFG.jpg)

**THIS WENT ON FOR A WHILE.**

[12 june 1265](http://i.imgur.com/pJc9ppC.jpg)

In happier news, the independence faction has been put down. The continuous stream of pretender wars did become an annoyance, but thanks to all the lucky accid... ah screw it: THANKS TO ME KILLING THEM ALL, there shouldn't be many claimants left to bother me.

Gosh, still things to bitch about, isn't there? Very well, I'm sick of these wars, I'll just give in to their demands. I won't lose any land and maybe some secessions will keep these troublemakers quiet for a while.

OH GOD DAMN IT! The luck of af Reddit strikes again!

[8 february 1267](http://i.imgur.com/Riztx6l.jpg)

Keep the good news coming, will ya! So a jihad from the Shia Caliphate, this can only end well. My trusty killing machine-ally The Golden Horde is still on my side and enthusiastic as ever when there's infidels to be crushed. Let's hope that's enough, having to deal with the full force of the muslim world while suffering a major civil war is not what I signed up for.

[1 march 1267](http://i.imgur.com/lCR3ieF.jpg)

Luckily my christian brethren do not stand idly by. Many were called, all were chosen!

[30 march 1267](http://i.imgur.com/FMGHgst.jpg)

Now this was an unexpected turn of events. When infidel hordes are invading it finally seems like my vassals are getting their priorities straight and suddenly they support me whole-heartedly. Who would've thought this jihad could turn into something positive?

[4 august 1270](http://i.imgur.com/HqkzFop.jpg)

As much as I'd still like to properly punish these scum for their dishonourable actions I, too, need to get my priorities straight. A white peace with the rebels will free up my armies to deal with the larger threat at hand.

[30 august 1270](http://i.imgur.com/RxRCtlz.jpg)

Now, you rotten infidels, taste the full power of the fully unified Byzantine Empire!

[22 october 1274](http://i.imgur.com/7lkMUPq.jpg)

In the midst of everything the Golden Horde has found the righteous path. I like to think my enlightened rule has inspired this spiritual awakening.

[24 may 1275](http://i.imgur.com/MeitawJ.jpg)

Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish when you set aside your differences and work together? The muslims never stood a chance!

[19 august 1275](http://i.imgur.com/ojR8V25.jpg)

Now that my vassals have finally accepted me as their rightful ruler I can focus on more important things. Namely, taking revenge on a certain Queen for that lovely excommunication she gifted me with all those years ago. I'm not even sure who's claim I'm pushing, the important thing is that Brittany will soon be under Byzantine rule!

[13 february 1276](http://i.imgur.com/B3xfA9z.jpg)

But for the love of...

[11 may 1280](http://i.imgur.com/g7cwOpS.jpg)

In the midst of these wars (which I were totally winning by the way) the smallpox has gotten to me. On my deathbed I think back on my rule, and while I've accomplished little in terms of expansion I'm still proud I managed to hold on to my great father's gains through all the difficulties. May my son not screw this up now...

**The Diary of Duke Trond af Reddit**

[30 June 1116](http://i.imgur.com/6BHvuFc.jpg)

Wow, I actually became Duke.  The second son doesn't often come into power...I'm going to need to keep a close eye on my brother, he's likely going to try to kill me.  I see father left me with a war with the Countess of Tyrone. At least the blasted fool had it almost won.

[27th August 1116](http://i.imgur.com/nDZJE5s.jpg) 

I'm rather upset that I ran out of troops, but luckily I have enough money to buy some mercenaries to try and finish of this blasted war.  It will be worth it in the long run in order to get our hands on more sweet, sweet Irish land.

[28th December 1116](http://i.imgur.com/5Mi8UjG.jpg) 

Finally put down the Countess. Tyrone belongs to the mighty house af Reddit!

[4th February 1117](http://i.imgur.com/kCqoEZB.jpg) 

I quickly go to war with the last county in the Duchy of Ulster.  It will be min...er...ours.

[23rd March 1117](http://i.imgur.com/cywowUC.jpg)

It didn't take long to win the war.  I've seemingly become the most powerful person in all of Ireland, which feels like a big accomplishment until I look behind me and see Scotland and England breathing down my neck.

[20th January 1118](http://i.imgur.com/KepGX3E.jpg)

Scotland has declared war on me! I don't have the troops, or gold to continue this war! I shall be bankrupt! I might have to give in...

6th July 1119

It's been a horrid couple of years. My Scottish holdings are under siege by that pig of a Scottish king, the coffers are empty and the traitorous Earl of Tyrconnell has risen his banner in rebellion! I promise my enemies will burn when I am through. If not by my hand then my family and heirs...

[25th October 1120](http://i.imgur.com/t0qd3k5.jpg)

I had to surrender to the Scottish king, I have not the manpower or the will to continue. He will pay...

[15th May 1121](http://i.imgur.com/HFJ5YwH.jpg)

Tyrconnell has finally been put down like the dog that it is! I am the sole ruler of Ulster!

[23rd December 1123](http://i.imgur.com/mAKtv7B.jpg)

I have been able to fabricate a claim on Connacht! After 2 years of trying, I have it!

[7 February 1125](http://i.imgur.com/QV4vaQ3.jpg)

Kildare has been brought to heel...

[27th November 1125](http://i.imgur.com/MgrzA4v.jpg)

I have declared war on Breifne! They cannot hope to win.

[21 November 1126](http://i.imgur.com/cIY3EQK.jpg)

Nearly a year into this war, I have finally forced a surrender.

[24th July 1127](http://i.imgur.com/Exq7qH9.jpg)

I'm sweating profusely, I've vomited four times in the last 3 hours, and I have a strange rash. What is this disease?!

[3 February 1129](http://i.imgur.com/KaEusxR.jpg)

My goodness, am I 50 already? How the years fly by...

[25 July 1129](http://i.imgur.com/Qg56i2U.jpg)

Finally! I have formed Ireland!

[24th September 1129](http://i.imgur.com/YXrd1kA.jpg)

The Scottish King has had me excommunicated! Damn it! Damn it all to hell!!!

[17th November 1129](http://i.imgur.com/wwY40Xt.jpg)

I hope you enjoy heretics you holy bastard!

[1st October 1137](http://i.imgur.com/5LDyPQc.jpg)

All of the Emerald Isle is now mine! Long live House af Reddit!

[12th May 1152](http://i.imgur.com/gTzxje6.jpg) 

I have warred for most of my adult life...soon...soon I will become King of the Welsh!

[7th December 1155](http://i.imgur.com/NUyNwht.jpg)

On the eve of his victory, our lord King Trond I died a natural death in bed.

The Umayyad Caliphate was revived after Islam retreated west but they can't keep their realm together.

[Republics.](http://i.imgur.com/ryvzr0Q.jpg) No Christian republics remain. They spent themselves to death in wars and were turned into mercenary camps. Navarrese Company Venice was conquered by Vikings, who attempted to raid Karen Syria and were destroyed. [Muslim Sicily](http://i.imgur.com/qcEA5KN.jpg) and [Zoroastrian Abkhazia](http://i.imgur.com/YUgddLe.jpg) are left.

[Abyssinia.](http://i.imgur.com/HPcMcWe.jpg) They've existed without the threat of foreign invasion since the Muslims lost power in Egypt. Infighting between Miaphysites and Monophysites has ripped the country in half since the start of the century. The queen's husband and son are both Monophysite at the moment. It's unlikely that Miaphysites will last another century.

[Byzantines.](http://i.imgur.com/P1G5sjX.jpg) At the very least, they don't have to worry about Turks or Mongols any more. No Shahanshah has attacked since the last war for Syria. Unfortunately for them, the Shahs and Satraps aren't so easily satisfied.


[Persian borders](http://i.imgur.com/3OLSgJ1.jpg) and [vassals.](http://i.imgur.com/QoGL72M.jpg)

The dynasty started with three increasingly brutal warlords, culminating in the Saoshyant claiming all of the de jure Persian Empire and setting in motion the end of the Abbasids. After his power was established, a young unmarried Saffarid with a weak claim on the Abbasid Caliphate appeared. He was matrilineally married into the Karen family and placed on the throne. The Persian army protected him during three major rebellions consisting of every vassal at one point or another. The Saffarid puppet ruled by keeping all of his vassals in prison. He lived past 80, much to his benefactors' chagrin.

Meanwhile, the Arabian imperial family was kept safe at Khozistan. The first Karen-in-name to become Shahanshah of Arabia was able to reach medium authority and revoke every ducal title. His loyal Satraps and increasingly powerful territory proved him to such a degree that he was made successor to Persia a generation ahead of the plan. The unified empire took all of its de jure land, moved through Georgia to Crimea, and then ceased all expansion.

[States by military size](http://i.imgur.com/7jgroV9.jpg)

[Religion](http://i.imgur.com/6k4jlaR.jpg)

In the decades since, the emphasis on military and conquest has faded away and hardly any generals remain in the Karen dynasty. Persia, Mesopotamia, Jerusalem, and Crimea make up the imperial realm while [Egypt](http://i.imgur.com/yDSJ9yl.jpg), [Arabia](http://i.imgur.com/CZIyG0D.jpg), [Syria](http://i.imgur.com/vhqIb79.jpg), [Khiva](http://i.imgur.com/pu4bpu5.jpg), [Turkestan](http://i.imgur.com/Yr09aCu.jpg), and [Georgia](http://i.imgur.com/uHK79vI.jpg) were delegated to Shahs. A Karen Byzantine emperor is currently being planned and missionaries are waiting for a more tolerant Khan to take power in the Khazar Khaganate. Otherwise, there are no intentions to increase the size of Persia.

[Shahanshah](http://i.imgur.com/sBE3Gu8.jpg) and [Shahzada](http://i.imgur.com/HFqSmIo.jpg)

The Karens' rejection of Abrahamic marriage laws has been vindicated by the quality of their leaders. In all branches, the dynasty is full of naturally blessed and increasingly well educated superhumans, tarnished only by the rare monster. Election is by most able, although one line has come to prominence as exceptionally ~~incestuous~~talented. In the past, attractive women were made head of state during the most difficult transitional period. As it currently stands, a Shahanshah's sister is made wife and successor until their children come of age, after which the best son and all Karen Shahs and Satraps are considered.

The number of Satraps in the realm mean that even the most rebellious of them can be allowed a voice without exerting disproportionate influence on the elections. As a result, political assassinations are increasingly rare, with less than five ordered from the capitol in the current generation. The Jazira Karens have a particular reputation as the empire's gadflies but nonetheless hold a place of honor as honest critics of imperial policy.

[Law](http://i.imgur.com/aGEVwp1.jpg)

The trend is towards centralized power and decreasing imperial intervention. Future candidates for the throne are bred and educated as communicators and benevolent rulers after the model of Cyrus the Great. The government exhibits tendencies towards constitutional monarchy, although the concept doesn't exist yet and the Shahanshahs officially claim rulership through their relation to the Saoshyant.

[Jan 1181](http://i.imgur.com/NWgv0da.jpg)

I am king Peter the First, and I shall take back the lands my ancestors lost.

[Jun 1183](http://i.imgur.com/hgTTEbqh.jpg)

I have gained the control of Tyrconell, my coffers have been emptied, but hopefully the economy will be back on track, and the Emerald Isle shall be subdued.

My traitorous vassal republics have revolted, the crown law is now limited. I can not wait for the shackles of regency to be removed, these traitors must pay.

[Jan 1192](http://i.imgur.com/g9exuj9h.jpg)

Scotland was plunged into another series of civil wars, from which I have profited! I have gained Oriel, but Oriel came with a great price. While my troops were  in Scotland, King of Englad retook my county in Wales, greatly outnumbered, I had to surrender.

[Jul 1192](http://i.imgur.com/A5Cy4clh.jpg)

That wretched child has attacked me once more, another war with Scotland, this time a unified one... My only hope is the new alliance with the HRE, I hope my chancellor preforms well, there is no time to lose!

[Apr 1195](http://i.imgur.com/0VGrkrfh.jpg)

My prayers were answered, the Emperor shall assist us, the Scots shall burn for this.

[Jul 1195](http://i.imgur.com/y7NibNVh.jpg)

I am of age, the regency is over, and Scotland was plunged into civil wars. I believe the bastard would accept a white peace, but I shall do my best and win this war,for my family, for Reddit!

Jan 1197

I have won! The king has surrendered to me, a great day for Ireland and the house af Reddit!

[Sep 1199](http://i.imgur.com/6besiYFh.jpg)

I am now a father to a cute little girl, I can't wait for her to become a pawn in my political games...

[Apr 1204](http://i.imgur.com/ygDqqd1h.jpg)

In a series of rather crazy events, my brother is the heir to Byzantine Empire.  If you will remember back, on a whim my father, King Findlay II, married Princess Helene of the ERE to gain an ally when House af Reddit was struggling bad.  Well, her father, Basileus Basileios (can we just take a second and sit in awe for this incredible, incredible name?) died of natural causes, leaving Helene's brother Stephanos in charge. He died in battle, so the ERE went to Helene's sister Palagia, who died after a period of illness. So Helen ends up in in charge of the ERE and she's my freaking mother!  Since I am a genius and Findlay II named me, his younger son his heir, that leaves my older brother heir to ERE.

I have nominated him as my heir as well to merge the families.  This is the first time I am thinking of killing myself, for our house, for Reddit... Or I'll just kill my brother, seems like a better choice.

My dear brother is dead, but alas my name was revealed... At least I shall inherit the Byzentine Empire when my mother dies, I shall try to 'fasten' the process.  Finally, some major good fortune has stuck af Reddit!

[Oct 1204](http://i.imgur.com/6eIjsNPh.jpg)

I have been granted the casus belii to invade England. First, the civil wars in England must end, and hopefully the HRE shall become our ally once more, maybe I won't have to raise a single levy.

I have declared war for the English throne. The pope has given me the blessing and for the first time in history, the two Empires shall unite and help me fulfill my goals! Let the war begin!
I have won. Not a single levy raised, I'm thinking of destroying the title of England, those laws might cripple our dynasty. [Here's what it looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/QkuiPGyh.jpg)

My mother has passed away, let us pray for her soul... I am the Emperor! The first of my dynasty... My house is finally recognized and is enjoying the glory it always deserved! My name shall always live, my name shall always be repeated, my legacy is now immortal, and I am just beginning.

The bloodshed has ended, the rebellion is over, I wonder if there will be a period in time when I am not so dependent of this traitorous filth... I am 50 years of age, I fear the reaper watching from the distance...

(Sep 1239)

My embargo war on Pisa had to end with a white peace, nobody at my court expected this jihad on Armenia, luckily, many Christians responded and are helping my cause.

I accepted the Greek culture, for it is superior, and my vassals will like me more.  And besides, I couldn't let down the af Reddit tradition of changing cultures! My son is Irish though, so the tradition will continue for at least another generation after me.

(Oct 1242)

We have lost the war, we were overpowered, overrun by the infidels... I have failed you, my son... I hope you forgive me.

(Mar 1257)

My death has come, I hope I am remembered and praised for my victories, and forgiven for my defeats. I was a soldier in youth, and a diplomat in age. My legacy must live.

When he dies he hands the game to someone else and so on and so on until the game ends at either game over or the end date. 

I think we might be able to do something like this on here. Transfer save files that we then play until our character dies.

-Loot transfer trick:

If you split a fleet with loot on it, all of the loot goes to the left stack.  This can allow you to ferry back all of your loot on a single ship while your main raiding force stays in place.  I have pointed this out before but it is useful for other reasons.

-Prestige bombs to help with succession:

If you are in no immediate need of cash but have troops available for raiding, you can use a loot transfer trick to store a huge amount of loot on a single ship just offshore of your territory.  On succession, you can ambition:become exalted (if available), land the ship and build a runestone for a huge boost to relations within days of succession.  A blot will also provide a nice boost if the timing is right.

-Skirmisher retinue raiders:

It is no secret that archers are by far the best assault troops.  Skirmishers set as raiders can finish fully ransacked raids before the victim can respond at all.  I highly recommend using your retinues exclusively on skirmishers for this purpose.

-Double ransacking:

  If you have even one non-raider troop in your raider stack, you can ransack a holding then siege it down for bonus gold.  The second siege will be quick because the garrison will be depleted.  Some care needs to be taken to ensure that you ransack before sieging if you want to do both.  This is easy to do.  Order the stack to move out of the territory while paused, then select just the raider unit and cancel the move.  Then cancel the move of the non raider.

If you wished to siege but bypass ransacking (for the stealth war trick below) do the same trick with moving, but cancel the non-raiders move first.

-Stealth wars:

Because you have the ability to siege and occupy territories while not officially at war, you have the ability to prime the pump for a 0 day war.  If you declare war while you are occupying territory, it does not remove your occupation, thus allowing you to potentially start wars with 100% (or very high at least) war-score immediately.  Occupied territories eventually go back to their owners control and I'm not sure what the timing is for that, so you have to be at least moderately quick about it.

The uses of this are two-fold:  Finishing wars quickly can remove the potential for war allies to ever be called against you.  Handy for dealing with Karlings.

Another use is being able to ""prime"" a series of small wars without reassembling your levies.  For instance, if conquering the irish counts, there are typically 2 methods:

a.  Declaring each war individually, thus necessitating the assembly of levies after each successful war.

b.  Declaring all wars simultaneously, which while more efficient, still pales to the new third option.

c.  Use stealth warfare to occupy all of the irish counts without ever officially declaring war.  Disband levies, declare all wars and peaces simultaneously.

-Theocracy vassals are good.  Whenever possible, make your count and duke vassals theocracies.  They provide tax revenue and eventually get a big relations boost from ""head of religion"" modifiers.  Once you get a mostly theocracy based empire with a reformed norse religion, succession should no longer cause you to even bat an eyelash.

-That being said, do not reform too early.  The pros and cons of reforming:

Pros:
Succession becomes easier, unlocks more succession laws.
Unlocks the ability to holy war for duchies.
Unlocks great holy wars (crusades) at 1100.
Relations boost for temple vassals.
Allows demand conversion and makes conversion easier.

Cons:
Splinters your vassals religions.
You lose 1/3 of your retinue cap.  The 50% retinue bonus that unreformed norse get is multiplicative with the tech bonus.  So it hurts to lose it.
You now get raised levies opinion modifier with all of your vassals.
Supply vs pagans is bad.

I cannot stress how much you will miss the levy bonus if you reform too early.  Ideally, you would want to reform right after hitting and taking advantage of a retinue break point (for example, reaching 3 military organization, buying all the retinues you can hold, then reform)

-Keep only one top level title.  Don't make a second duchy until you are ready to make a kingdom.  Don't make a second duchy until you are ready to make an empire.

-Now that norse can form it, Brittania is the empire of choice.  You get all of Ireland for essentially free, most of England off of a prepared invasion of Mercer followed by a usurp of Jorvik and offered vassalization to the resulting counts.  Scotland is usually one subjugation away.

-It pretty much goes for everybody, but use your tech points on Military Organization, Town Infrastructure and Legalism.

My primary drive was to play as old Walder Frey and just spread the old Walder seed around, naming every spawn some variant of Walder.  Unfortunately, the game did not want it to be, as the time frame I chose had old Walder as a 91 year old man, and he died soon after.  I think the Frey family had over 60 members at the begining of that play through, so every turn I was getting hit with a barrage of whining family members wanting land.  It was rather annoying.  
  
The entertaining part of the playthrough was that within 10 years of the start of my game, I joined a conspiracy and managed to successfully murder Joffrey.  Oddly, he was 16, and his wife Margaery had already shot out a baby.  The 0 year old baby inherited the Iron throne, and in the same turn, won the battle against the north (Rob surrendered and the Starks gave up their war of independence) and defeated Stannis.  The 0 year old infant decided that Stannis was to be executed, but the Starks were to remain in power in the north.  The onion knight along with a ton of other lords immediately join the faction that supports the iron throne.
  
This has to be the most badass baby ever.  In less than a year he united the 7 kingdoms.

1366719090.0,46,self.CrusaderKings,1cxijx,Tip: The Ultimogeniture Gambit,Pinstar,53,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1cxijx/tip_the_ultimogeniture_gambit/," I was originally leery of this new succession law when it first came out, but after doing some testing, I'm finding I like it better than Primo. This is how I made use of it: 

**The Law itself:**
The youngest eligible heir of YOUR direct children (no grandchildren are factored) becomes the first to inherit. It will follow your gender laws the same as Primo.

**The Gambit:** 
Marry your ruler/heir to someone with good stats...but focus more on genetics and favor any +fertility traits. If your ruler gets the option to go the hedonism route, take it. Marry a young fertile wife, as you want lots of babies really early. 

While she's busy pushing out babies for you, make nice with the pope, parking your Chaplin in Rome if need be. More on that later. 
Keep having your wife pop out kids until she gives you a son with a good genetic trait. (Strong/Genius/Quick/Attractive). Once she blesses you with that wonderful child... divorce her (or kill her if the pope doesn't like you enough). If the RNG isn't on your side and you get no genetically gifted children, divorce/kill her when your character turns 30 anyway to give your youngest time to turn 16 before your ruler starts becomming more likely to die. (Alternatively, if you get the hedonism event chain and it progresses to the end, you can always choose the celibate option if you are happy with your youngest, thus eliminating the need to divorce your 1st wife). 

When you go looking for a 2nd wife, pick someone who is 45 years old or older (Or Celibate, that works too)...and focus purely on stats to maximize your state attributes. Since you won't be making babies with her, you don't care about her genetics. 

By choosing when to turn off the baby fountain, you can effectively control who your heir will be without the need for murder. 

**Risks:**
Just because a child starts life with a good genetic trait doesn't mean they'll be your star heir. Bad trait events (and bad luck during them) and bad stat growth can lead to a sub-par heir. 
The early death of your ruler can put you into some very long regencies. With their older brothers already adults, you may have more problems with pretenders and claimants from them than you would in Primo, where the eldest is an adult but all their younger brothers are still children. 

**EDIT: Female Rulers**
Female rulers present a problem to this tactic. Since you are the woman, simply divorcing your husband at 30 and re-marrying someone older won't work because even a 75 year old can knock you up. And there is no 'tell husband no more sex' button besides the chain that leads to the celibate trait. In that sense, it is very difficult to turn off the baby fountain as you might sneak out one more little tyke at age 44 and face the need to live to 60 in order to avoid a regency. Your only recourse is to either imprison your husband (probably eating a -40 opinion penalty) or divorce him and re-marry someone who is celibate...hoping there is someone with decent stats with that trait on the market. You could also make your hubby your spymaster and send him to steal tech from the ERE and hope they castrate him. Or you could switch to Agnatic Ultimo to avoid the female ruler (and female claimants too) problem completely. If you're loading up on +fertility bonuses, you should be able to get some boys. 

**Emergency Switches:**
There is always the option for murder...but if your youngest and #2 and #3 in line are ALL mothballs... there is always the option to flip over to Primo (if you have the proper crown authority). By having the ability to switch to primo (and when in Primo, the ability to switch back to ultimo next generation) you can effectively have your choice between two heirs. Grooming your first AND your last child will give you a better chance that one of them will turn out for the best. Failing that... there is always a love affair event. If your youngest is starting to turn out to be a moth ball, you could always have a bastard and (provided they have no bad genetics) legitimize them. 

**Conclusion:**
While it will never rival the sheer power and flexibility of Agnatic-Cognatic Elective with a 100% controlled election... that is not always an option when there are too many dejure dukes with voting powers. Ultimogeniture holds the next best way to control your heir. It doesn't even need high crown authority! 

If you haven't given this law a spin, I highly recommend it.

[My greatest emperor](http://i.imgur.com/nVbfx5ah.jpg), and possibly the greatest ruler ever to live.  75k prestige, lived to 82 and reigned 68 years, sired *fifteen* children on three mothers over 65 years, all born in the purple, half of them geniuses (the youngest was a year old when he died!); father to three kings, two queens, and an emperor; drove the Mongols out of Germany and Poland, and the Ilkhanate out of Africa and Arabia.  His personal score alone beats the entire Hapsburg family.  That said, he was an inveterate breaker of truces.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/5mLlLaah.jpg) is why cataphracts are worth every penny.  It's also the only major battle against the Timurids, who were doomed before they even got started.

At this point, with the world conquered, I set about revoking all the king titles.  [It didn't always go as planned](http://i.imgur.com/wEZIOI5h.jpg).

I am now [the last king in the game](http://i.imgur.com/duAVzq5h.jpg) (I hold all the titles except the weird ethnic ones that I can't create as a Greek).  Also, the Ecumenical Patriarch is still a king... kind of?  I don't think his title is revocable, though.

[Mostly Greek world](http://i.imgur.com/Fg39H7sh.jpg).  [People seem to like me](http://i.imgur.com/rbKnpHVh.jpg).

The Doukai are less a family than a [ruling caste](http://i.imgur.com/nYsgn4Nh.jpg) at this point - something like half my vassal counts and 1/4 of my dukes are Doukai, and for the past few generations I've always married Doukas wives - they're like a free 1000 prestige bonus, and there are enough of them to ensure that one or two will be a genius in every generation.  To be fair, most of the cadet branches are basically cesspools of idiocy and dwarfism.

[8th January, 1349](http://i.imgur.com/5Rcebip.jpg)

I, Basileus Findelios, first of my name, heir of Ceasar and Augustus, refuse to be crowned. A man of... of my sheer power cannot be crowned by a mere Bishop or  Cardinal, I must be crowned by His hands alone, or the earthly ones of the Pontiff in Rome. But the old fool refuses me, and my ancestors have allowed his wretched reign to continue for too long.

[Later that day...](http://i.imgur.com/t8qzW1P.jpg)

Pontiff Adrian IV, Christendom no longer requires you. I have found an alternative, the distant successor to the Legate of Tuam. Their reign had started over 200 years ago in Connacht, but they had attracted little attention outside Ireland, and thirty years ago they were evicted by the Irish King. But  my agents have found him, hidden in Cumania, and brought him to the Seat of the World.

[Later that day...](http://i.imgur.com/Wny9Mit.jpg)

Telesphorus II, it is time to find you a golden cloak.
 
[28th January 1349](http://i.imgur.com/eKKNFQb.jpg)

I have dispatched notices to all of my vassals, declaring the withdrawral of my personal armies from their lands. My ministers are arranging the formation of a force to assemble for the trip to Rome at Nikaea, and a fleet at the Bosphorus. They insist it will take months to assemble the force at such short notice... so I shall have to be patient. Meanwhile I sent a letter to my second cousin, Arsenos who rules in Sicily, informing him to await the arrival of my force in Napoli.
 
[26th March 1349](http://i.imgur.com/HJrNlc9.jpg)

The Lords of the East (Valerios of Anatolia, Gennadios of Georgia and other such old men) are busy launching invasions on the Moslem. Gennadios has his army at Jerusalem I hear, busying himself with seiging the remaining holdings in that area, whilst Valerios is trying to defeat the Khan of all Persia. God bless his expedition, but I fear that bringing his sons with him will end poorly. I'll have someone look into the region.
 
[9th July 1349](http://i.imgur.com/J1HFKmj.jpg)

I am out of patience! The forces we have mustered will be enough I am sure, though I have instructed the petty Doux of Greece to muster and join us at Napoli by October. I had my Steward list me the expected forces. 14,000 of my own men so far mustered at Nikaea, sailing with several hundred ships, a further 10,000 mustered across the Aegea and up to 30,000 men under the command of my dear Arsenios in Sicily. With such a force, even the will of God may be changed!
Alas, I have one last task to perform here. Constantinople is the city of heaven, and the old ways have been removed by my forefathers. I must finish their task. I have left orders for the Varangian Guard to remove Patriarch Basileios II from the city and set him up in exile at the fortress of Peolpia, constructed by my late father. They shall conduct the raid in the fall, so that should it turn poorly, I will be far out of earshot of the complaints.
 
[12th September 1349](http://i.imgur.com/b5xgJ4k.jpg)

I have arrived in Neapoli. About that voyage I can only say that we lost a couple of thousand men, and many ships were lost... He works in mysterious ways, I suppose. Legate Telesphorus assures me that it is just a test of my will to see through His commands. The next test is on the horizon. Adrian of Rome has amassed an army and is marching south after hearing of the fall of Benevito. The 'voice of god' leading an army! His claims grow more laughable each moment. Naturally, cousin Aresnios has been busy, he has matched our force in size and is sitting at Avellino to the north. We shall march to meet our enemy wherever he walks!
 
[26th September 1349](http://i.imgur.com/Rk4UbZn.jpg)

I hear that the Guard have succeded.
 
[15th October 1349](http://i.imgur.com/9MkuQrU.jpg)

Adrian marches on our position at Aquino, Arsenios is coming with his overwhelming force! DEUS VULT!
 
[25th November 1349](http://i.imgur.com/W2Tttmu.jpg)

He breaks, he breaks! What a holy slaughter! We'll be at the walls of Rome in a week and all the devils in hell couldn't stop us from entering the city!
 
[1st January 1350](http://i.imgur.com/YkKRNDT.jpg)

Happy New Year.
 
29th March

I hate Italy. The conquest of Rome only rallied the soldiers of this damnable country into opposing me. Overnight, the roads have been flooded with volunteers and supplies across the region, and mercenary armies amassing into unpreceded sizes. The Doux of Sardinia, my second in Command for these efforts, called the war a disaster of Logistics. We've lost 20,000 men since we took the ancient city, and are about to face an assault. [**And then, right on queue...**](http://i.imgur.com/ny44ty9.jpg)
 
[2nd April](http://i.imgur.com/K4CrLfJ.jpg)

Crap. I don't know if I have the men to hold this off. Rome comes first. I can clean up the rest later. With a god given crown upon my head these idiots will kneel for the axe blow willingly.
 
[8th May](http://i.imgur.com/5HpcOnY.jpg)

At last, Adrian flees Italy, and his cardinals agree to appoint Telesphorus II. As a present of goodwill, I grant him the old basilica of the Patriarchs to do with as he likes. But now I have more serious buisness to attend to. The rebellion of England has led to copy cats closer to home, and I need a stable realm for my appointment to Emperor. The Fleet prepares for voyage.
 
[28th June](http://i.imgur.com/up9EANl.jpg)

I have heards no news from the Irish, and I fear that my ancestral homelands are suffering greatly at the hands of their neighbours.
 
[5th November 1351](http://i.imgur.com/iB2N7nN.jpg)

The situation remains grim. Our men campaign in Carinthia, staving off the English victory for now, but what little news that has arrived from the Via Franca is grim. The Danish are beseiged, our German Holdings are the same. The English are launching a full invasion of the Kingdom of Ireland. We've heard only defeat from Portugal and my own position in Cyrencia is about to be threatened by the Norman King Mauger of Africa. The campaign continues.
 
[4th February 1352](http://i.imgur.com/x1aF7ef.jpg)

I speak here through an interpreter. I, Findelios of house Reddit, Ceasar of all the Medditerranian, do, in light of my sudden deathly illness, command that I shall be sailed back to Constantinople without delay. Should the almighty wish for me to perish for my actions, then I would pray to see his greatest city one last time...
 
[11th March](http://i.imgur.com/ZvDNwAw.jpg)

And Broen of Ireland kneels, and with him, the whole of the North. The rebellion has been successful. The lords within France and Germany who once bowed to us still do, but that is all... My dear Arsenios, you must withdraw from Carinthia. My brothers will need you when I die. The Empire must not collapse.
 
[16th March](http://i.imgur.com/4luDrOU.jpg)

Fair people of Constantinople, I am well.

We have suffered greatly, as have I, but this is not an ending. Not quite yet. The Empire remains. The Empire is all that matters today. We shall celebrate our continued existance, our freedom from unappreciative vassals who have no more claim to our protection than the Italians!  We shall celebrate the mind of the Empire: my own coronation, the heart of the Empire: an Empress to be beloved, and finally the body of the Empire: free Chariot Races for all the people of Constantinople, Green and Blue alike! And then, once we have gourged ourselves heavy on the prosperity of our might, I shall return to the field and win us victories anew!

[**For Rome! For it's Emperor! For God!**](http://i.imgur.com/RTcrtzw.jpg)
 
[11th April](http://i.imgur.com/Dmsv9Pw.jpg)

Sadly I do not appear to have a choice in brides, the whole affair was arranged for me whilst I was knee deep in mud on Campaign. Theophano seems pretty enough, and is daughter to the Despot of all Armenia, whom still holds the ceremonial title of Ceasar. I barely know anything more about her, but I'm sure the quiet little thing will do well enough to give me a son. We'll marry before the Coronation and then be crowned together, that'll please her father most.
 
11th July

I am finally crowned as Emperor, in front of the voice of God, spared by the hands of God, and in front of a cheering crowd of God's people. During the games I was even awarded an award in the Melee! This is truely bliss.
 
10th October

It seems my campaign plans are delayed until the next year. The whole of the east is up in arms with each other over territory, and my wife is laiden with my heir. Somehow, I miss the field.
 
[9th March, 1353](http://i.imgur.com/ZiLUi3i.jpg)

My son is born! My advisers chose wisely, it seems. Such a... strong looking boy. Damianos, after my father, I think. Emperor Damianos II. Now I must secure the Empire he is to reign. Where to go... I think perhaps back into Italy. The Despot of Sicily has requested leave to conduct his war into North Africa, and I have no interest in marching an army all the way into Cumania... and I certainly can't sail to the North without preparation. So, let's secure Telesphorus II against the Waldesians in Tuscany. It'll be like good old times.
 
[4th June, 1354](http://i.imgur.com/xKFrpiV.jpg)

I hate Italy. Leading an army north to the Po, I hoped to screen my main forces, besieging the forts of Tuscany, from incoming German forces. However I found not a sign in this wild, eternally conflicting country.  I passed north, crossed the Po, and headed for one of the more famous passes of the Alps, where I anticipated... resistance. Anything really, a fort perhaps. Thankfully, we encountered an army of Dutchmen loyal to my foe beseiging Milan, and gave chase. We forced them into a conflict but one of the blasted fishermen got me with an arrow! I'll have to watch this from the sidelines with this damnable doctor, but it looks like we'll win. We have the numbers here.
 
[24th June](http://i.imgur.com/cKxWEnd.jpg)

I survived, albeit with a nasty scar. Damn fishermen. We routed them. A few weeks later, we caught Prince Walram af Reddit, the son of the King of Lotheringa, and executed him at Mantua. Hardly a Redditor, that one. Our family is spread to thin to be merciful simply due to a shared name. Actions define us now, not names.
 
4th November

Success! Firenze is in our hands. I'm granting all lands to my brother, Athanasios, if only to shut him up about a damn fief to govern. He's too smart for his own good, that one.
 
21st June, 1355

Theophano died today, or so I hear. Murdered, by all accounts. I didn't know her long enough to... well, she gave me my beloved son. And she deserves all respects for that. I've been looking at the Histories, Theophano is only the second wife of my line to have been murdered, after one of the many wives of my Great Grandfather. I suppose that will have to be honour enough.

The rumours of my complicity have begun, of course. Not much I can do to stop them.
 
[24th February, 1356](http://i.imgur.com/mkkMdjy.jpg)

A small group of Islamic Counts have declared Jihad upon me, but so long as the Khan of Persia is not involved I am not worried. The Despot of Egypt has asked for my help in this matter, and I suppose it would do good for me to win a campaign on sand for once. I'm assembling a force as I write.
 
August 17th

Our voyage was much calmer than the one to Italy, I must be getting accustomed to it. Alexandria is a beautiful city, though somewhat worse for wear. I'll be giving my vassals here a few words regarding what it used to be and perhaps that'll persuade them to tidy up the place. Rebuild the lighthouse, perhaps! It has not been so long since it collapsed, I'm sure we can work something out. After the Jihad is done with, of course.

Anyway. My expedition is equipped, supplied and embarked, as I will soon also be. It seems that the Shia forces heading up the Nile by boat, and so we shall be sailing down to greet them. I do not know when I will return, or if this is a wild goose chase or not.  I assign my brother, Despot Athanasios, as regent in my absence. Keep men on the frontier. I am curious what the heights of the nile are, the locals don't seem to care upon questioning, so I won't keep my hopes up. Whatever is down there, I shall honour it with my presence, clear it of these Shia and be done with it.

http://ckiiwiki.com/List_of_duchies

Then factoring these criteria in order of importance:

1) Coastal holdings (ports, shipbuilding)

2) Capital sites (6 or 7 holding provinces)

3) Coastal holdings per county (for more access to 'bonus' holdings)

4) Tech level


*Rankings*
#1: **Flanders**. All but 1 are coastal. One 7-holding. 4.5 coastal holdings/county. 26 coastal. 31 total.  

#2: **Sicily**. All holdings are coastal. One 6-holding. 4.6 coastal holdings/county. 28 coastal. 28 total. 

#3: **Brittany**. All are coastal.  No 6-holding. 4.1 coastal holdings/county.  25 coastal. 25 total.

#4: **Nikaea**.  All are coastal.  One 6-holding.  5.25 coastal holdings/county.  21 coastal.  21 total.

#5: **Tunis**. All but 2 are coastal. One 6-holding. 3.1 coastal holdings/county.  19 coastal. 28 total.

#6: **Normandy**. All but 1 are coastal. No 6-holding.  4 coastal holdings/county.  19 coastal. 23 total.

#7: **Barcelona**. All but 2 are coastal. One 6-holding. 3 coastal holdings/county. 18 coastal. 26 total.

#8: **Cherson**.  All are coastal.  No 6-holding.  4.5 coastal holdings/county.  18 coastal.  18 total.  

#9: **Holstein**.  All but 1 are coastal.  Two 6-holdings.  4.25 coastal holdings/county.  17 coastal.  22 total.

#10:  **Thrace.** All are coastal. 5.3 coastal holdings/county.  One 7-holding.    16 coastal.  16 total.

Runners-up: Tripolitania (16 coastal) Skåne (16 coastal) Moray (15 coastal), Seville (15 coastal), Crimea (16 coastal)

*Bonus Holdings*:
Criteria: coastal low province duchies to also hold but not create:

#1: **Venice**: 7 holdings.

#2: **Genoa**: 6 holdings

#3: **Slesvig**: 2 provinces, 11 holdings.

#4: **Adrianopolis**: 2 provinces, 11 holdings.

Notes:

Sicily has 28 coastal holdings to Flanders' 26 and better tech, but Flanders has the best capital site in the game. The only other coastal 7-province counties are Rome, Venice and Constantinople.  Brugge and Venice are the *only* counties in the game that can have 5 cities (consequently, 5 universities).  These can and should become the richest single county in the game.  

While Normandy has a better rate of coastal holdings per county and is on par with many others for total coastal holdings, it's lower tech and lacks a suitable capital site.  

Many other duchies have better 'total holdings' but are partially or fully inland. Toulouse has only 2 coastal provinces, so you can't ship your men anywhere, nor can you build ports. Its best province is inland. Baghdad has a 7-province capital site and the most holdings in the game...and it's inland. The same is true for most of the others.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,1372857659.0,,,True,t3_1hi2yb,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1hi2yb/best_duchies_for_your_demesne/,

**The diary of King Torf 'the Unyielding' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/Krastain*


My name is [Torf d'Isigny]( http://i.imgur.com/yZY0pqv.jpg). I am three years old. 

**17 june 1177.** This is the worst day in my life. I've been lying in this bed for such a long time, and I'm thirsty and I have bloody water coming out of my behind. And this morning my mommy told me my daddy died in battle against the [muslims]( http://i.imgur.com/c1hokX1h.jpg). 

**18 june.** Mommy says fathers old friend [Gaillard]( http://i.imgur.com/kvpfRa1h.jpg) is going to help me be king. I'm a king? I just dreamt that the bed was full of bugs but I couldn't get them. There was a ferret too. 

**19 june.** I'm feeling much [better]( http://i.imgur.com/gtv49K5h.jpg). I haven't pooped blood all night and I'm even hungry again. 

**Summer, 1178.** I hear people talking about lost battles, damned heathens and their brilliant general Rasul, mercenaries and an empty treasury. But I'm not afraid, the war is far away and my castle is the strongest in the world. I also heard that some German Catholic is now the king of Jerusalem. 

**Spring 1180.** The war is going better my mother says. The heathens are fighting [among themselves]( http://i.imgur.com/GT4mFeRh.jpg). I am six now, so I am a big boy now and I get to start my education.  Gaillard thinks that six year olds shouldn't be allowed to choose their tutors but I am the king so I choose [Lancelin] (http://i.imgur.com/Y7wT7Kbh.jpg). Mommy always tells me stories about the island of Sicily where she grew up. My [aunt]( http://i.imgur.com/aWqBZGSh.jpg) is queen there and if she dies I'll be king of the Island as well. 

**September 1181.** Gaillard, Lancelin and my mother wanted to talk to me. They were very serious. I was afraid that I had done something wrong but they were only talking about the war. We have no money to buy more soldiers and some band of steppe [mercenaries broke their contract and the muslims are in my country]( http://i.imgur.com/24kduVnh.jpg). I think that we should be patient and my aunt will come help us from across the sea.  

**January 1182.** My mother came to me today and told me that she had very bad news: my armies are almost completely gone. Defeated by the muslims and the Cuman oathbreakers. My father's friend and vassal the Duke of Basra rebelled against us. And on top of that my great grandmother died. [Luckily she she left us so much money we can raise some new troops]( http://i.imgur.com/ZKHY2KHh.jpg).

**April 1184.** My troops have captured the [enemy general]( http://i.imgur.com/zzf3knyh.jpg)! With dilligent work en some patience this is the beginning of the end for the heathens. I also have a new regent: Marshall Torf d'Alexandretta is my closest advisor now. I traveled with him to the land we have been fighting over, and it was big dissapointment; it is a strip of desert. Just that, only sand and sand and a man with a camel. I don't like camels. 

**16 February 1185.** [We have finally won this terrible war]( http://i.imgur.com/CfyYqMQh.jpg)! Finally this last legacy of my father, this mad useless war over sand is done. I order my administrators to start rebuilding while my regent and I chase the last of the traitorous Cumans out of my land. 

**April, 1185.** The Duchess of Mosul and the Duke of Basra are trying to [force me to give my throne to a distant cousin of mine]( http://i.imgur.com/QSOziDTh.jpg). They want war. And to make it even worse, [thousands of adventurers have come to fight in their armies]( http://i.imgur.com/X07qd9Eh.jpg). 

**January 5, 1187.** Woe! The Califa has [declared a jihad on Syria]( http://i.imgur.com/BDSXvA5h.jpg)! We are surrounded by enemies! My advisors tell me we have no money and no friends! And in these darkest days my trusted regent and marshall Torf dies of severe stress. My mother has heard of a military genius living in the lands of duke Geoffroy of Syria and has invited him to become our main general and given him one of the conquered provinces to bind him to us. Count Richard is now our only hope. He sends letters to the headmasters of the Knights of the Temple and the Knights Hospitaller to come to our aid and a letter to the pope for money. All three react favorably and the papal money is used to hire a company of Italian Mercenaries to help deal with the traitors.

**March 3, 1190.** [I have finally come of age]( http://i.imgur.com/rYrX8izh.jpg). Apparently all this talking my mother, my tutors and my regents always did about balancing the budget and allocating resources has paid of: I have become pretty good with money. Now comes the time to actually do things. Let the crushing of traitors and heathens begin. 

**August 19, 1190.** And [that]( http://i.imgur.com/h8KGHhQh.jpg) is the heathens crushed. On to the traitors!  

My mother and steward tell me it's time to marry. I'm not quite sure I want to give up my tumbling days and settle for just one woman. Another problem is that the traditional marriagepool of my family (the spawn of emperors) is currently very dry. My mother introduced me to Emeleline, a kind and shy girl from the duchy of Syria. She's kind, a bit shy and she loves money just as much as I do. [I think she'll do]( http://i.imgur.com/xEaWTCeh.jpg).

After years of war among the ruling clans of Persia the Seljuks are back in the saddle, and they have celebrated this by annexing the lands of my wayward traitorous sheep the duke of Basra.

**27 Januari 1192.** Peace! The traitors have been forced to their knees. Sadly my beloved chronicler Efelefen wasn't there to record the signing of the peace treaty, but my [cartographer]( http://i.imgur.com/iElq913h.jpg) was. All conspirators have been jailed, and I was just in their punishment. The claimant to the throne has been banished. His titles in the duchy of Bagdad are mine now. The inbred Duchess Giselle of Tigris shall have to give her ducal title to one of her more sane vassals, and Judit of Mosul, the instigator is sentenced to life in prison until such time as I need money. 

I shall leave from my ancestral castle of Maison de Souris. The muslims may be wrong about many things theological, but they are right about one thing: Bagdad is the navel of the world. To celebrate my victories and the moving of court to more civilized parts of the kingdom I call a grand tournament. Fighting men from all the realm come to show off their skills. I fight pretty well and I declare me the [second best]( http://i.imgur.com/ZdO6ph8h.jpg) fighter in the kingdom. In the mean while I'm setting up my the basic conditions for prosperity and economic growth. Stability and trade make for a happy people, with rich townfolk and fat farmers. 

**November 23 1192.** I have a daughter! I shall name her [Astrid]( http://i.imgur.com/zCklgc2h.jpg).

**Januari 2 1193.** The [great Turk declared war]( http://i.imgur.com/LT8kLUVh.jpg) on me. He wants the whole of Mesopotamia for himself. I shall give him some hard men to chew. Call the militant orders! 

The [king of Francia is coming]( http://i.imgur.com/wOhx9M1h.jpg) to help defend our lands against the Turk. Heil Simon de Bourgogne!

In the middle of the fighting my wife gives birth to a son, [Lambert]( http://i.imgur.com/ifSEnUCh.jpg). My succession is safe. 

**September 1196.** I've had messages from my spies in Persia and Egypt. Baybars Seljuk, the great Turk is dead. On his deathbed he asked his heathen brother the Sultan of Egypt to help his son, Kilic Seljuk in the war against me. The same day he died and his son took over [a great revolt of Turkish Beys]( http://i.imgur.com/YVplcJWh.jpg) took place. The Turks are Christianity's greatest enemies and it's greatest friends. And on the other side of Mesopotamia the family of the Fatimids have revolted against their lord in Cairo. And although we still have great odds to overcome and many hard battles to fight this is a sign that God surely is with us. 

**July 7, 1197.** Today I met my cousin [Sylvester]( http://i.imgur.com/HBuVkUoh.jpg). He is remarkable in that he is the most boring person I've ever met. 

**December 7, 1197.** Today I made a decision. I shall take a rather blunt knife, no, make that a spoon, and use it to cut off the heads of duke Mleh d'Isigny of Aleppo and duke Wymund de Zweitina of Antioch. Because HOW DARE THOSE TRAITOROUS UNGRATEFULL [BASTARDS DECLARE WAR ON ME](http://i.imgur.com/4A0ZeLth.jpg) WHEN THE KINGDOM IS BESIEGED BY HEATHENS ON ALL SIDES!

**Januari, 1200.** While the greater part of my forces is busy laying siege to the castles of the traitor dukes in the west the war in the east is going splendidly. The militant orders are happily chasing small groups of Seljuk soldiers the small great Turk is rapidly losing his civil war. I'm now at war with a kid without much power. [I'm taking his offer of white peace]( http://i.imgur.com/Mvr98gGh.jpg). It gives me more than enough prestige and it frees up the rest of my armies to take them west and fight off the Fatimids who have mixed themselves into the war by calling a holy war for Antioch.

**21 June, 1206.** After many long sieges, hundreds of battles, long marches, the loss of the duchy of Antioch and the needless death of many ten thousand good men duke Mleh d'Isigny cornered and agreed [to sign the peace]( http://i.imgur.com/RXl1fZ2h.jpg). After eight years and six months of fighting the soldiers can go home to their families. It is finally done.
 Except that it is not. Punish the traitors, ransom the prisoners and reassemble the armies again. I'm going to take back what is rightfully mine.
[**May 1208: Basra**]( http://i.imgur.com/G9bBKteh.jpg). [**January 1209: Antioch**]( http://i.imgur.com/w140EN4h.jpg). [**April 1210.  Damascus**]( http://i.imgur.com/uVvAxDbh.jpg).

In between all this violence the apple of my eye, [princess Astrid has grown up]( http://i.imgur.com/bLjZf3Eh.jpg). Only the best match is good enough for her. I shall think of a way to make her Duchess of Damascus.

I found the ideal boy for my beautiful daughter. [John de Huntly]( http://i.imgur.com/1NOvCsCh.jpg) has a weird accent but that doesn't matter, he is patient, charitable and chaste, as a good Christian should be. And he shall be the new prince of Duchess Astrid of Damascus. 

**5 September 1210.** My son [Lambert has come of age]( http://i.imgur.com/qIbCdbhh.jpg). He does not disappoint too much. I'll put him to work as steward before he get's lazy. 

**April 29 1212.** During a little war (more of a skirmish) of the revokation of Tortosa from the hands of a greedy priest my dear old enemy-vassal Judit of Mosul, whom I spared so many years ago when she tried to put her nephew on my throne has decided to once again [stick a dagger in my back]( http://i.imgur.com/6XcONPFh.jpg). Luckily she has been sewing patches of land to her domain while I was busy sieging other traitors out their shells, so at least this will be a challenge.

**June, 1213.** While cracking castles in the north the Fatimids have decided it is time for [their decennial declaration of war]( http://i.imgur.com/BXSxnW5h.jpg). I don't know what they want this time, and I don't care. No Dawlat Fatimid, I have broken you. You are now beneath my notice. The steel boots of Christ shall step on you while I deal with more pressing business. 

**January 1215.** There are tales drifting from the east about a [Khan of Khans]( http://i.imgur.com/MQS5IMEh.jpg). For some reason I distrust steppe nomads.

**March 28, 1216.** Today [my mother died]( http://i.imgur.com/SL44wayh.jpg), from a common disease. My best and truest advisor. And I wasn't even there to hold her hand. May she rest in peace. 

**November 1219.** While I'm once again trying to hold off both the traitors and heathens [the horde invades this side of the continent]( http://i.imgur.com/glr7ZQIh.jpg).

**December 1219.** Old traitors die and get replaced by new traitors. The new duchess of Aleppo [thinks she has a good chance of beating me]( http://i.imgur.com/1S5roJqh.jpg) while I'm distracted by all kinds of foreign and domestic enemies. Sadly, she's right. 

**April 1220.** My heir Lambert has decided to [die from leprosy]( http://i.imgur.com/C9Ot7TPh.jpg). No worries, plenty more sons. [Faramond]( http://i.imgur.com/Da5sQHGh.jpg) is first in line now 

**February 1221.** I had to [offer duchess Judit of Mosul a white peace]( http://i.imgur.com/gFoLvMOh.jpg). All these wars are starting to drown me. 

**1225.** The Muslims have once again joined the fray. They are trying to take my rebelling provinces from me. I am so very grateful for the militant orders. 

**December 1225.** I've had an 'alliance' with the Byzantine Basileus for a few years. [My youngest daughter married a son of his]( http://i.imgur.com/9taa1Klh.jpg). Since then he systematically refused to take part in any war of mine, then asked me to fight in a border dispute with an independent count, which I refused (because fuck you, you egotistical bastard) and now the vulture, the swollen drowned dog, the heretical barbarian [declares war on me for the province of Farkale]( http://i.imgur.com/FM81stmh.jpg). Fine. [He can have it]( http://i.imgur.com/bFhQqckh.jpg). My ancestors are spinning in the grave but I'm willing to wager they have never been continually at war for 40 years.  

**June 20, 1226.** Alas. After 49 years on the throne [I am no more]( http://i.imgur.com/JMvoPwph.jpg). I started my reign hoping to build and prosper. I have only warred. My life was one in the saddle, always on campaign, always on the go. I spent more nights with my generals than with my children. I was so tired of all the bloodshed, so very very tired. I hope my son takes care of [his sister]( http://i.imgur.com/4E1PEuNh.jpg). I hope he reads my diaries, in which I wrote down [my plans]( http://i.imgur.com/yZY0pqv.jpg).

I started playing as the count of Napoli, a single-county count in the middle of Catholic Sicily (which muslims also like to Jihad), so swearing fealty to the ERE was a *pretty good* idea.

Two generations later I'm now the (female) Despot of Sicily and I managed to get a matrilineal marriage to one of the Emperor's brothers and, once I have an heir secured, install him on the throne taking advantage of my huge treasury and Byzantine's depleted levies (lost both Anatolia and Armenia to Seljuks/Fatimids respectively).

Now his brothers are still around, and I think to myself *""Those factions aren't trouble. I still have huge amounts of gold, and they barely have any support""* until, finally, inevitably, one of the factions demand a new emperor be installed.

And then my husband relents, gives up the throne of the byzantine empire, goes to rule (as a count) over a couple of counties he conquered while he ruled.

And starts a faction to get himself back on the throne.

**The diary of Count Talbot d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/franjdea*

[26th August 1071](http://i.imgur.com/pFcH3OW.jpg)

On one side of me there are orthodox rulers and on the other there are Muslim rulers. I am content with what I have and hope they won’t cause any problems. At least I have the ladies of the court to keep me company, but I’m starting to see a sense of disapproval from the church so I suppose it’s time to find a wife.

[3rd September 1071](http://i.imgur.com/lcPjjHz.jpg)

I am betrothed to Princess Cecilia of England, eldest daughter of King William ‘the Conqueror’ of England. I marry her in the hope of an alliance with England and Normandy and also to retain my family’s identity - Norman Catholics!

[28th September 1072](http://i.imgur.com/kDcyOJ2.jpg)

My foolish and greedy liege, Duke Vahram I has decided to press a claim against the independent county of Tripoli. Has the idiot not considered the fact the Caliph of the Fatimid Sultanate might not appreciate a Christian army attacking his neighbour?

My 262 men and I will be the first across the border and into Tripoli. Although I was taught growing up to fight and to lead, I have never been to war before. This will be my baptism of fire.

[16th January 1073](http://i.imgur.com/ghkJtCt.jpg)

My wife, Princess Cecilia has arrived! Due to the on-going war there is no ceremony or feast, but it’s a comfort to know there will be someone waiting for me if I should be so lucky to return from this war fought for nothing more than greed.

[6th March 1073](http://i.imgur.com/9YZYKly.jpg)

Today I had my first taste of combat; the desperate defending troops attempted to counter attack and push us back but failed miserably. I was rather hoping this war could end without bloodshed on both sides.

[12th April 1073](http://i.imgur.com/iZMH2rV.jpg)

My scouts have handed me a report. An army of over 5000 men led Caliph al-Mustansir I has been spotted approaching Tripoli from the east. I had a bad feeling this would happen, but my greedy liege was too desperate to gain a scrap of land which has belonged to Muslims for generations!

We are in the middle of nowhere; we cannot escape in any direction. The intelligence suggests the army will arrive within 2 weeks; we can only stand our ground and fight.

[30th April 1073](http://i.imgur.com/T9Euize.jpg)

The army of the Fatimid Sultanate arrived yesterday, we may have the advantage of being defenders but we are outnumbered by over 2:1. I won’t abandon my army but it is clear the battle was lost before it has started.

[9th May 1073](http://i.imgur.com/Q37v8VL.jpg)

The battle so far has been rather chivalrous, each day we attack again but each day we fail to take the advantage from the enemy. They have had reinforcements arrive from the East, but it was very unnecessary of them to do such a thing.
Although only being at war for a few months, I know my ability as a soldier and a leader has improved by learning from my mistakes. However, I know this will be enough to save myself and my men.

[21st May 1073](http://i.imgur.com/aOyP71N.jpg)

The battle is lost. I arrived with 262 men and leave with 48, all of whom have suffered wounds. I wonder how many will survive the long march home.

[6th August 1073](http://i.imgur.com/qIvqLYr.jpg)

I’ve only been home and recovering for a few days when my liege decides to offer me the position of Marshal. As much as I despise him for the foolish decisions he made, motivated purely by lust to expand his own demesne; I know I need him to protect my land and I.

28th September 1074

My county of Aintab has been converted to the Catholic religion. For the first time in several years I feel I am making progress again.

[28th August 1075 ](http://i.imgur.com/2BFqoNv.jpg)

I am blessed with a child!

Unfortunately, it’s a Girl. I need to produce a male heir before I call it a day, which with this idiotic liege embarrassed by defeat and craving another war might not be too far in the future. How would a Woman ruler of Aintab survive more than a year?

[1st October 1075](http://i.imgur.com/Z9bjKQz.jpg)

On a hunting trip celebrating the birth of my daughter, Joan, my vassals and I decided to go hunting.

Unfortunately, I stubbed my toe and had to be carried home by a filthy peasant. My vassals just don’t have the same calibre as me!

[1st October 1076](http://i.imgur.com/SV8s71k.jpg)

My toe has healed but isn’t a pretty site. I’ll have to tell people I was injured in the Holy War for Tripoli which my idiotic liege still hasn’t called off. The last news I heard was that a 13,000 strong army of the Fatimid Sultanate is sitting in Tripoli waiting for us to try again.

I can only hope they don’t choose to go on the offensive. We wouldn’t last a week.

[21st February 1077](http://i.imgur.com/gYsUuWT.jpg)

Myself and Duke Vahram I are on the right track to becoming good friends, my chancellor recently returned from Antioch after from his mission to improve diplomatic relations. It worked!

[11th November 1077](http://i.imgur.com/fO2mFkF.jpg)

I caught a spy in my castle, who on earth would want to kill me? I am not trying to expand my demesne and I have no grudges against anyone..

LEAVE ME ALONE!

[3rd February 1079](http://i.imgur.com/dGLMvkH.jpg)

I had to remind myself of my identity today. It’s hard to forget my roots whilst so far away from my homeland. I am proud to be Norman!

[4th April 1080](http://i.imgur.com/by1Hu3R.jpg)

The perpetual war, the lack of a male heir and a fool of a liege has taken its toll on me. I’m far too stressed to handle all this merde!

[24th December 1080](http://i.imgur.com/GeJAkL6.jpg)

Another child!

Another daughter. This just won’t do. I was on track to recover from my stress but now I just want to jump out of the tower and leave it all behind.

[16th April 1082](http://i.imgur.com/ALsn9j7.jpg)

Today I found a spy again. It reminds me of an incident which happened almost 5 years ago.

Who has a problem with me!?! I just want to be left alone and in peace. I AM CONTENT!

[24th April 1082](http://i.imgur.com/VyI7oKs.jpg)

ANOTHER DAUGHTER!?! WHY OH WHY. WHERE ARE MY MALE HEIRS? WHY DOES THE STUPID PRIEST THINK I AM BLOODY STRESSED?

[8th November 1082](http://i.imgur.com/gFilXEI.jpg)

My court chaplain has lost it and become a heretic. What I find most unusual is the fact is he converted to the Waldesian faith. Surrounded by Muslims and Misaphytes, I can’t get my head around why he chose to become a Waldesian.
Needless to say, I have no choice but to throw him in the dungeon.

[3rd February 1084](http://i.imgur.com/32bS2Ld.jpg)

For some strange reason my liege wants to educate my daughter. He isn’t my best friend at the moment so I see no reason why  I can’t send her away for a few years, it’s not like she’s my son!

[24th April 1085](http://i.imgur.com/SuUFJsY.jpg)

I am blessed with a son. Not one son, two sons! Twins!

They are named William (in honour of his grandfather) and Serlo.

[3rd July 1086](http://i.imgur.com/WP237TK.jpg)

My content lifestyle is expensive; therefore I have no choice but to start taxing my mayor even more. The day after I told him he would be the perfect candidate to educate my favourite daughter. I don’t know how I kept a straight face - Sucker!

[8th November 1087](http://i.imgur.com/JxJbnFW.jpg)

I am blessed with another son, my patience is rewarded.

[22nd January 1090](http://i.imgur.com/G4tAdmu.jpg)

Dues vult!

The pope has called a crusade for Jerusalem. As the only Catholic in the Middle East I was of course quick to mobilise my army and help the cause. I have learned from my mistakes in the last war and hope to assist in a swift victory, this time without losing the majority of my men.

If the worst should happen to my men and me, I take comfort in the fact this is a just war. I have sorted out my affairs and know that my children will be looked after in the event of my death.

**The life of Smperor Svein II af Reddit as written by /u/Geter_Pabriel**

[5 December, 1407](http://i.imgur.com/kCxJlQi.jpg)

I am told that now is not the time to grieve mother’s untimely passing, for we are at war against the Timurid scourge and the Empire needs it’s Basileus to be strong. I hardly feel like one though, they think because I’m only twelve I can’t manage my Mother’s Empire. I’m a fraction of my regents age and more eloquent than he’ll ever be. Mother called me gregarious, but my regent calls me a “little diplomat”. I miss my Mommy.

*** 

[8 February, 1409](http://i.imgur.com/YfXVHm9.jpg)

My Mother’s holy war for Baghdad has ended in another glorious victory for the Empire. There was a grand celebration after which was the most fun I had ever had. The Despot of Syria was very grateful for being giving control over the newly acquired duchy. It felt great celebrating our latest conquest. I remember Mother loving these celebrations as well. She was one to conquer and gain lands for our Empires name, she told me about how she was pregnant with me during another of her holy wars. I too will conquer land for Byzantium.

*** 

[1 April, 1409](http://i.imgur.com/luqSRKF.jpg)

The regent thinks I am oblivious but I hear the whispers in the court. Many lords of my realm believe that they are deserving of independence, how ungrateful! My regent’s fear is entirely evident. I heard that he hired assassins to murder a bishop that had gained quite a following among the lordship with his cause of rebelling for independence.

*** 

[June 7, 1409] (http://i.imgur.com/7K4Wlkb.jpg)

The war we feared had begun. The opposition had less number than us but they were quite spread out and would be difficult to subdue. The regent had many meetings with our marshal to discuss a strategy. I had been studying under a brilliant strategist and I had plenty to offer in the war room, despite my regent’s thoughts. It was only by my suggestion that the plan became to end the war quick by having a force larger than normally possibly. Mother had left me a substantial amount of wealth for me, more than enough to hire every [Mercenary company] (http://i.imgur.com/XMXz3eE.jpg) available. This war will be quick.

***

[April 4, 1410](http://i.imgur.com/7LhMLLg.jpg)

Mother is truly watching over me. The war was as fast as I had predicted, Egypt was swallowed by my professional army. Now all I must do is enforce the stability of my realm and wait out this regency.

***

July 28, 1410

I have decided to extend mercy to all of the traitors. My regent attempted to argue against it but I had it in my head that the best way for me to create a stable realm was to have vassals that trusted me. If they saw my mercy than they would truly respect me right? The regent is making me second guess myself but I believe I am right. Sometimes I’m mad at Mother for leaving me with this, but then I realize that’s me just missing her.

***

May 2, 1411

I am finally sixteen! The regency has ended and it’s time for me to be fully recognized as Basileus. My meticulous studies of war paid off.  I will pair the might of my armies with the prowess of my command to bring my Empire to glory. I think I will announce myself to my realm with a grand tournament!

***

[September 14, 1411](http://i.imgur.com/N32RidI.jpg)

The tournament came to a close and the victors had been crowned. Seeing men from all over that possessed such great martial talent gave me new aspirations for my Empire. I now had confidence that these men could lead armies in many wars being fought on many fronts simultaneously. I could see all of Europe coming under my control, leaving no other great nations but my own, leaving no great families but Af Reddit!

June 24, 1413

After several conquests in Abyssnia, my armies redirected their attention to a simple yet important target. My father had lost the Isle of Man to greedy King of Scotland. It came to [war] (http://i.imgur.com/t5zb4bU.jpg), to regain the Isle of Man for my Father.

It occurred to me that Europe would never kneel before the throne being in Constantinople. I had to restore the Roman Empire to what it once was. I had to bring the throne back to the center of the world. The world would recognize my Empire to be the true Roman Empire.

I fell in love with a German Duchess. I never thought it could happen to me so fast. She was beautiful and had power. She carried her authority so well, I could hardly resist attraction to her and she had to be mine. She actually reminds me of my mother. Time flew between meeting her and our wedding, she would be excellent alongside me at the throne.

May 22, 1415

The Italian Despot had to solidify his de jure holdings before we could declare ourselves to truly be Rome, we had already begun gaining control of [small](http://i.imgur.com/YK7adhNh.jpg) [holdings]( http://i.imgur.com/4iF8K35h.jpg) [that]( http://i.imgur.com/FWBj2aPh.jpg) were already within my realm. But we needed the independent duchies of Venice and Ferrara. Italy had already started a war to claim Venice, and luckily my chancellor had “found” documents proving my [claim] (http://i.imgur.com/In3rMTXh.jpg) on Ferrara, enough for me to declare war.

[August 15, 1415] (http://i.imgur.com/AFJeNO3h.jpg)

Venice was overwhelmed with Italy’s forces and fell under the Despot’s control.

My beautiful Wife had passed away. She was with child. I am devastated but I remember back to Mother’s death. The Basileus must be strong. The campaign shall continue.

[February 18, 1416] (http://i.imgur.com/faanjKnh.jpg)

The war for Ferrara had ended and I gave the land the Despot of Italy. I thought the Empire was officially ready to be recognized as Rome, but as it turns out the German Pretenders still have holdings in the true Roman land.

***

March 1, 1416

Bodeno. I will forever remember that name. There was nothing special about Bodeno itself. In fact it was quite unremarkable, and not worth any amount of bloodshed. What was worth bloodshed was what the barony meant. It was the final piece of land held by the Holy Roman Empire in my realm. Taking it meant finally having total control over all of the true lands of the old Roman Empire.

***

[October 2, 1416] (http://i.imgur.com/Hju3gD8h.jpg)

There was but one battle in this war. It took place shortly after the siege of Bodeno itself. The armies of the two Roman Empires met north of the Barony. Many lives were lost, but the result was clear enough to declare myself and the men I led to be victorious. Their surrender arrived today and Bodeno was mine. Walking around the castle ground I never would have thought a war would be fought over it.

***

[January 4, 1417] (http://i.imgur.com/aihKIx6h.jpg)

Today is the first day of my long campaign to restore Rome fully. Rome was once again the capital of the greatest empire in the world, but that was only [the beginning] (http://i.imgur.com/At38uSgh.jpg). My glory was recognized by all on this day as I was solidified into history. My name would be uttered in the same breath as Augustus himself. No longer Basileus, I was now the Emperor of Rome! I know Mother is smiling upon me from heaven.

[November 11, 1418] (http://i.imgur.com/CJn8G23h.jpg)

My brother fought along my side in the remainder of the holy wars for Abyssnia. As reward, I gave him the kingdom. I had confidence that we would become a very loyal despot.

It was time for me to remarry. Despite still loving my first wife, Rome could not continue without an heir. I had arranged to marry a Princess of the Golden Horde. There would be a grand [feast] (http://i.imgur.com/6MUU3YGh.jpg) to celebrate the new marriage and alliance.

After pressing many claims and breaking several truces, I had gained enough land to be able to take the kingdom of France away from the Prince-Bishop! Once that central power had crumbled, the smaller holdings would become part of my Empire.

*** 

[February 8, 1424] (http://i.imgur.com/5gcuDmbh.jpg)

In a process similar to the one I used in France. I was able to usurp the Holy Roman Empire. However this process was much harder. I had to fabricate and press many more claims, assassinate many more men, and fight many more wars based on broken truces. But eventually I held enough German land to take and destroy the pretender title that once dominated the region. Like in France, all that remained were smaller holdings, ready to be taken.

***

[November 17, 1432] (http://i.imgur.com/HlF7QXth.jpg)

After several more campaigns, the last bishops controlled duchies in the west came under my control. Both Francia and Hispania were under total roman control.

[March 6, 1434] (http://i.imgur.com/ZyQTb1Vh.jpg)

Following my formula for conquest, I had gained enough land to usurp the Kingdom of Scotland. It would soon be in the hands of Af Reddit. During these campaigns 

***

[May 25, 1439] (http://i.imgur.com/72bKPQkh.jpg)

All of Britannia is now under my control; all of the Holy Roman Empire’s former holdings were under my control. I had finished my campaign to restore the borders of the old Western Roman Empire. I was able to spend time with my family. My wife had birthed several more sons at this point and even a daughter. I rarely saw my family as I was always out leading troops. However, this was all for them, as I making my family greater with each conquest. I must now turn my attention east, towards the Mongol Hordes. Both the Golden Horde and the Timurids were in a splintered state. Several successful civil wars lead to many small independent nations in their areas. The Despot of Ruthenia had already began to campaign against these small states in [Russia] (http://i.imgur.com/D7nm28Ih.jpg), and it was apparent he was going to continue them.

***

19 May, 1448

So far the holy wars had been a great success. I had conquered all of Arabia and given to my sons. Meanwhile I bring the nations of the Baltic under my control, and turn them other from Orthodoxy into Catholicism. Throughout my conquest of Islamic lands, I had discovered the base of the Hashshashin was now in my realm. I took swift action against them besieging their fortress and driving each of them from this world. I still remember the way they terrorized my family when I was but a young boy. Mother would have loved to see this order that once struck fear into her children now [destroyed.] (http://i.imgur.com/lrYTEmGh.jpg)

***

[September 12, 1452] (http://i.imgur.com/P9IlY02h.jpg)

I have driven the Timurids back into Persia making them a shell of what they once were. My series of Holy Wars were a successful and now the true faith could be brought to those lands. I could consider my campaign against Islam over, just as I could consider my campaign to restore the Roman Empire as such. [I no longer desired to campaign and to conquer] (http://i.imgur.com/twOzS2Ph.jpg). I was able to return to Rome feeling satisfied with myself.

January 1, 1453

I decided to celebrate the New Year with my half-brother. After our Father passed I decided to give the holdings I inherited from him to my half-brother, along with the rest of Scotland for that matter. We decided to visit the [Isle of Man]( http://i.imgur.com/RXZyHqZh.jpg), where our Dynasty had started.

**The Diary of King Åmund af Reddit**

[8 May 1156](http://i.imgur.com/q5EzeI3.jpg)

It's about damn time, took father ages to pass - I don't have much time work with before I kick the bucket.  As I sit on my throne and start hearing from my advisers about the state of things, I have three words: ""Fuck, fuck, fuck"".  Apparently fathers excommunication also applied to me, fantastic.  I've also got Scotland and England breathing down my great. Oh, and all my vassals hate me. Yay!  Ok, first things first, I need to get rid of this excommunication immediately.  Time to ask the pope nicely.

[Later that day...](http://i.imgur.com/Za8QxNg.jpg)

Oh wait, the Pope hates me (not really, but enough that he won’t lift…which hurts).  Oh well, wait till a little bit later, once my Court Chaplin has had enough time to sit in Rome raising his opinion.  I really need to do something about my vassals before they rebel against me.  I notice that they all have a problem with how much land I personally own - I find this offensive.  I just because my family has been successful you are going to look negatively upon us? I give away a county to appease these jealous idiots.  I've got a couple unwed daughters that I decide to  matrilineally marry to geniuses.

[Even later that day...](http://i.imgur.com/bsubrVd.jpg)

In an effort to get the pope to like me more I switch from ""free"" to ""papal"" investiture. 

[25 May 1116](http://i.imgur.com/qzYb86p.jpg)

I decide to let a little time pass to let some things play out, but a mere fortnight later the King of Castille goes to war with me because I am excommunicated. Fuck.  Castille isn’t too strong... My army is slightly larger than theirs... So time to get some troops together and put them down. 

[31 May 1116](http://i.imgur.com/HBJw8lg.jpg)

Fuck.  The King of Scotland has gone to war with me.  I cannot win both of these wars.

[26 July 1116](http://i.imgur.com/m6UPiJs.jpg)

Now I’m feeling a bit in trouble … Scotland can field twice the army I can, and I have very little gold… Well, why not go fight the war I can actually stand a chance in, down to Castille…

[18 October 1116](http://i.imgur.com/TRUOUnC.jpg)

Some minor good came from this (and I emphasize minor), as I won a couple battles, massacred their troops, and came away a better leader

[2 April 1117](http://i.imgur.com/6CLty60.jpg)

Well, might as well go back up to my homeland, since this is going really poorly…  While I was away, England joined Scotland in their war against me, leaving me outnumbered about 4:1.  Scotland has been happily taking my land, leaving me no recourse.

[22 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/lKiCiE1.jpg)

Fuckkkkkk.  I guess my vassals could tell my situation was tenuous at best, as they went to war with me to push the claim of on Ireland for a relative of mine.

[25 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/wrn3tbn.jpg)

Well, this is certainly not going well, to put it mildly. I could take it like a man, and accept peace, or fight it out, and destroy the realm. I’ve got no choice; it’s for the betterment of House af Reddit…I'm forced to relinquish my title to lift this excommunication.

[25 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/LJLSYm6.jpg)

So, in the end, it was a terrible reign, ended in a pretty bad spot for my son King Findlay.

***

Eight-hundred and twenty-seven years [from the founding of the city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita), Vespasian and Titus [being consuls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul#Consular_dating), a great tragedy befell my family. Robbed of our [Pontic Kingdom](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Pontic_Mountains.jpg) by the intrigues of an ungrateful court, [Marcus Antonius Polemon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemon_II_of_Pontus) - mighty king of Colchis and Cilicia - fled to the shores of the Baltic. Sailing far, far up [the gentle Nemunas](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/Jeffas/nemunas3.jpg) with his fleet of ships, he landed at a bend in [the Dubysa River](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Kernave_Neris.jpg). Beyond it, no boat could travel. There, upon a tall and formidable hill, he founded [Kernavė](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Kernav%C4%97_-_Hill_forts_01.jpg). The Lithuanian race was born.

Centuries passed. Our people grew weak and complacent. Our culture changed, became more barbaric than romantic. We abandoned the gods of the city and embraced the gods of the forest. Once cousins to the Caesars and kings in our own right, we became no more than eminent chieftains. Glimmering hopes of victory and of conquest had faded from our eyes.

Until now.

***

**13 Vasaris, 867**

It was evening when it happened. The family was at supper, musing together yet again on the summer that was to come. To my right, [my son and heir](http://i.imgur.com/kxA9gauh.jpg); before me, [my wife](http://i.imgur.com/hSt862Kh.jpg); and beside her, [the wife of my son](http://i.imgur.com/fFZbZehh.jpg). The younger children were in bed. [I heard a sound at the window](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrHXmV1yWYo) and turned my head, straining to hear it. It was the horn call of the Yatviag clan. It grew louder, closer. A cluster of torches was visible on the plain beyond the city; the rumble of horses grew apparent.

""Halloo!"" was the cry. ""Halloo, Halloo! [High Chief Palemon](http://i.imgur.com/0ZJneQzh.jpg), Halloo! I bring urgent news from the court of the Yatviags!""

""What news?"" I bellowed to the horseback figures in the courtyard below.

""Woe! Terrible woe!""

I leapt from the table and ran to the highest window in the castle. I unhooked [the family horn](http://i.imgur.com/YBMcMfA.png), **Dalia** *(Fortune)*, from her belt. I raised her to my lips and let out a rapid burst of notes that signalled: ""come quickly, with arms"".

By the time I had dressed for combat and stumbled to the front entrance with my son and our wives, more than two thirds of my men had assembled in the courtyard. Dusk had set in and many were wielding torches. The messengers dismounted at the sight of me and bowed. I nodded, and indicated for them to begin.

""Great Chief: our lord and master, High Chief Pergrubrius, has died suddenly in a hunting accident. Your daughter-in-law, the Lady Giltine, his sister, is his sole surviving relative. She is the true heir of the Yatviags and must rush to our capital in Lyck to take her place. Her husband, your son, must go as well. We must move quickly, and with arms; even now, rival warriors duel in the very corridors of the castle for the right to the High Chiefdom!""

I turned to face Giltine. Her gaze was far away, as though in grief, but her lips betrayed a poorly-concealed sense of satisfaction.

""It seems I'll be your spymistress no more, O Chief"", she crackled. ""We are equals now, you and I. And two generations hence, our two great nations will be united under a single family: *our* family"". She struck out a claw-like arm on the word *our*, grasping at my son in a well-executed imitation of affection. This was no ordinary hunting accident, I thought. She had a hand in it. She *had* to have a hand in it: all those years of practiced intrigue at both our courts.. surely she had arranged her brother's death to secure her own succession.

Two can play this ambitious game, Giltine. But my capacity for deceit far outmatches yours. I underestimated you, but I will not underestimate you again.

It was a long and dreary ride at the edge of nightfall to the Yatviagi capital of Lyck. Let in through the city and castle gates by sympathetic loyalists, my men and I stormed the castle keep with axes raised. By dawn, the city was ours.

Or, I should say, [Giltine's](http://i.imgur.com/ToKaCYJh.jpg). Cunning trollop.

***

**1 Lapkritis, 868**

[Butavas](http://i.imgur.com/6t5ECtBh.jpg), tutor to my children, has been spymaster since Giltine's departure the previous year. Yet, somehow, I still have not grown accustomed to the sight of his disfigured back. I watch it bob gently - to the left, to the right - as he shares with me this latest news.

""Your wife's brother, High Chief of Zemaitija, has died and been succeeded [by his infant son](http://i.imgur.com/alM2Hvfh.jpg), Bubilas. With the future of that chiefdom uncertain, my sources argue that you should press your wife's claim to it. Her claim is strong enough that the people will accept her as their leader. Sir, what are you going to do? Sir? My eyes are over here, sir.""

I snap back into the present, locking eyes with Butavas.

""Yes, hm. A little campaigning would slake my ambition momentarily. Excellent suggestion, Butavas. [I'll assemble the troops at once](http://i.imgur.com/nswwhdNh.jpg).""

As my forces gather to wage war on the infant High Chief, my thoughts turn to cynicism, deceit, and darkness. Slowly, silently, I formulate a plan - a dark and terrible plan unprecedented in the history of our family. If I am successful in my intrigues and deceptions, our family may prosper, and my legacy may endure. If I am successful, I will be the father of a great and Lithuanian nation and the sire of a strong and vigorous noble house. But if I fail..

If I fail it will be my ruin.

***

**30 Birzelis, 869**

[Marshal Ragutis](http://i.imgur.com/JttBmugh.jpg) is an incompetent fool; the campaign for my wife's claim to the Zemaitija tribe has not been concluded as rapidly as I had hoped. Cynical as ever, I see fit to massage him for money. For the good of the realm, of course. If he wants to retain control of his distinguished office, he'll have to pay the price. Prestige isn't free, you know. And for the good of the realm it is: the freshly-acquired coin frees me to hire a band of professional mercenaries, the Lithuanian Band, to compensate for Ragutis' failures in the field. The first phase of my plan nears completion. Will you forgive me, darling, for what I have planned for us?

***

**29 Lapkritis, 869**

Curses! [Kodere, High Chief of the Curonians](http://i.imgur.com/fyKfePdh.jpg) to the north, has also declared war for the conquest of Zemaitija. Although we are not technically at war, we now vie for the same set of territories and must inevitably come to blows. If I allow him to continue unopposed he will ruin the careful plans I am laying out for my family legacy. [I have no choice but to declare war](http://i.imgur.com/k5Jakqxh.jpg). At the decisive [Battle of Varviai](http://i.imgur.com/tIdNrMrh.jpg) our armies are victorious against the Curonian menace. Although the conquest of the Curonians had not been factored into my initial plan, the acquisition of their territories should prove advantageous.

***

**23 Geguze, 870**

Days later, [the war for Zemaitija is won](http://i.imgur.com/dX1Kkhrh.jpg). My wife's opponents at the Zemaitijan court are dead, imprisoned, or placated, and she herself is crowned and enthroned as High Chieftess. As I ready my men to depart Zemaitija - to take the fight once more to the Curonians - my wife and I share a tearful, emotional farewell. [A Zemaitijan choir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3subUnkjUHU) performs a traditional song of the city. It is very beautiful; my wife, bedecked in the regalia of her office, is also beautiful.

This is difficult. This is so very difficult for me. But it must be done.

""Goodbye, my love,"" she whispers. ""But do not despair. We will always be together, even when we are separated by the needs of our respective states.""

""I won't despair,"" I assure her. ""[We will be reunited soon](http://i.imgur.com/K82bSzph.jpg). I'll celebrate every feast with you, I promise.""

I love you, Zemyna. I love you so much.

**11 Spalis, 870 - 13 Kovas, 871**

My wife's spymistress, the lowborn Danute, [writes to me yet again](http://i.imgur.com/Zvlomcdh.jpg). Her letter brings me [expected but discomfiting news](http://i.imgur.com/g45DHKwh.jpg).

I do what I do for the family. A hundred years from now, no one will know what I did. They will only know that what we did was good, and that we were noble.

My son [rises peacefully](http://i.imgur.com/3q56Rbsh.jpg) to the High Chiefdom of Zemaitija. At all three courts - Zemaitija, Yatviag, Lithuania - the people thrill at the notion that my grandson, [named Kunos after his father](http://i.imgur.com/nG35pG5h.jpg), will one day succeed us all, to unite the Lithuanian High Chiefdoms under a single, mighty banner. But the minds of men have a way of [helping nature to move more quickly](http://i.imgur.com/TkiSmjTh.jpg). I cannot spend my life decaying in the hope of a future I will never see. I do this for the family. I do this for my children, and my children's children. Not for all of them, however; just for those who survive. What's an infant to a mother? Nothing, I tell you. She can make another in a year. Things will be alright.

To celebrate the coronation of my son and heir in Zemaitija, I send to him [a carriage](http://i.imgur.com/nS8ssACh.jpg) as a gift. ""Surely"", I insist, ""your wife would delight in its luxury.""

And she does. Oh, she does. She eagerly boards the carriage as soon as the weeks of feasting and celebration are concluded in Zemaitija. It is high time, she says, that she returns to the Yatviags to resume her reign. [She was never seen again](http://i.imgur.com/WIoLNFHh.jpg). How fortunate that she produced an heir before the unavoidable incident. Little Kunos.. Kunos Jr. He would be ""Kunos II"", I suppose. He would be the man to unite all three of our realms. In due time, he would become High Chief of Yatviag, Zemaitija, and Lithuania. [The gods favour him and will bless his reign](http://i.imgur.com/8DnWBWmh.jpg).

As I have already said, man has ways of [helping nature to move more quickly](http://i.imgur.com/iWDEYdah.jpg). Crib death [is not an unexpected end](http://i.imgur.com/oZnLD4Bh.jpg). Children die all the time. No one will know. No one will ever know these things, these things that I do for the good of the family. In all things, I must protect the members of my family.

May the gods be good to me.

***

**25 Geguze, 871**

No longer required to besiege nor occupy the Zemaitijan cities, my forces have regrouped for a final assault on the Curonian capital at Ventava. Months careen past us with little to no success. It is not until the end of Geguze that [the bastard finally submits](http://i.imgur.com/FDh5lFG.jpg) to me. The lands of the High Chiefdoms of Curonia and Lithuania are united at last; and, through my son, are connected intimately to the Yatviags and the Zemaitijans.

My courtiers clamour for me to reach for the Lithuanian kingship. In time, perhaps. But not yet. I need to recover from the necessary actions I have taken.

***

**1 Sausis, 872**

[Borkus, my second-eldest and wisest son](http://i.imgur.com/4J6w4cEh.jpg), comes of age. We celebrate his accession to the age of majority [with vodka, dance, and song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt4v_2xuT2Q). He has lived in his brother's shadow for much of his life. Should he ever be freed of his elder brother's influence, I've no doubt he'll achieve greatness all his own.

Borkus is a humble man, and a temperate one, but he is just as cynical and deceitful as his father. He almost makes as good a spy as he does a diplomat. He outshines even his tutor, the hunchback Butavas. I may very well find room for him at court.

***

**6 Vasaris, 872**

The former High Chief of the Curonians, my vassal, has died of old age. He has been succeeded by his daughter](http://i.imgur.com/Lcm6PFFh.jpg). Should I do nothing, the counties of Kurzeme and Memel shall pass out of my control on her death and into the hands of a foreign power. I must act to wrest these counties from her control before she can bear her husband any children.

1375799419.0,39,self.CrusaderKings,1jt9jc,Tip: Making Bastards can Make sense,Pinstar,45,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1jt9jc/tip_making_bastards_can_make_sense/,"Unless your ruler is Chaste or Celibate, you will occasionally get a pop up giving you an opportunity to make a move on a woman besides your wife. 

While this seems to be an invitation for trouble, there are some circumstances where doing so can be helpful. 

If you are in a position where you can pick your heir (controlled elective), where you have no heir yet or are in ultima and don't like your current heir, going for roll in the hay can be a useful gamble. 

The key benefit is being able to see the stats on the child before having to decide if you want to legitimize them or not. If the child is born normal or with negative traits, you can safely keep them a bastard so as not to anger your family too much. 

However, if he is born with a positive trait, you can legitimize him (or her if ag-cog elective) and make them your heir. 

Since positive traits in your ruler only have a 15% chance of being passed down, the more children you produce, the more likely it is that one of them will get the trait if your ruler has such a trait. Even if your ruler and the mother have no good traits, there is always a chance that a new good trait will emerge. 

Of course, if you already have a good heir that you are happy with, or are in a succession law that doesn't play nice with naming newborns as heirs (Primo, Senority and Gavelkind) then it may be best to resist the temptation completely and take the 10 piety.

I've never used Ultimogeniture but it only requires low crown authority so I thought it was worth a shot and actually it turned out really well. 

I found that young heirs help you prevent the stagnation where you have one ruler say reign to 70, his eldest son would be 50 or so and then when the ruler dies, the heir only gets to rule for 10-20 years before it again passes to a younger character. 

It's also easier and cheaper to create new children rather than kill off unwanted sons. The only downside I found was that your older children will grow quite restless and people would be quite eager to press their claims to the throne, but other than that I was very surprised with how good ultimogeniture was.

**The Diary of King Findlay af Reddit** (*as written by /u/xmlns, with heavy modifications from /u/privatemajor*)

[Jun 1157](http://i.imgur.com/0sMxSJ0.jpg) 

Alright, so it's my turn to try and lead our family to glory.  My dad never really got a fair shake, but nonetheless, he was pretty much a failure.  I vow to be ""King Trond the Kind"" reborn! I decide to nominate my uncle, Prince Ossor af Reddit, as heir to Ireland and Wales.  I ask myself, what would Tron do? I think he would do the same.  

July 1157

Unfortunately, the de jure duchies of Leinster and Muster are warring against me for Ossor's claim to Ireland.  At the same time, England is warring me to take Gwynedd.  To make matters worse, I have 24 gold total and my arms is only 890 people. Not even Trond himself could win this, I decide to surrender to both.

[1 Aug 1157](http://i.imgur.com/aGWzlRJ.jpg)

I have already sent my surrender, but it has not yet been received. All of Ireland save my two counties and Tyrconnell are warring against me, this is a bloodbath that I cannot wait to be over with.

6 Aug 1157

I am imprisoned by my uncle and can't afford the ransom, which is slightly disappointing. The Kingdom of Ireland includes only the Duchy of Meath and County of Tyrconnell in Ireland, and Gwynedd, Glamorgan, and Gwent in Wales, the English CB claim on Gwynedd is no longer valid, so Ireland keeps it.

7 Aug 1157

My father is my heir and regent, but I'd rather have my uncle so that Wales and Ireland reunite

15 Aug 1157

My uncle is my heir again, which is the first piece of good news I have had in...well...ever.  I have a few burgher duchies (which are pretty rich), so I'm raising city taxes to make up for my lack of wealth,
well, I would, but I can't change laws during a regency.  I try to explain this to my regent but the gaoler doesn't appear to speak any intelligible language. I think he's fucking with me.

24 Sept 1157

I get a message that Scotland wants to take Oriel from me.  I plead with Ossor, King of Ireland, to help me.

29 Sept 1157

Uncle Ossor has accepted my request; now I'll sit back and let him fight Scotland, since I didn't really have backup plan seeing as I'm in jail and all. 

[19 Nov 1157](http://i.imgur.com/CuTBShF.jpg)

I get a message telling me that Scotland has a 5,400 person army attacking Oriel... I don't think uncle Ossor can win this for me.

[8 Dec 1157](http://i.imgur.com/6gPJ0MA.jpg)

Scotland is reinforcing their already unbeatable army.  This isn't good.

11 Feb 1158

the County of Oriel and the Castle of Dublin are taken...I surrender for the good of my people.

29 Mar 1158

My uncle decided to put me in the oubliette, I hear him mutter something about him being my heir and me calling him into an unwinnable fight.

12 May 1158

My spymaster slips me a note to tell me that a courtier decided to plot to kill me, which I find funny.  I wish I could tell this courtier to bring some damn food and wine with him when he comes to visit me.

[2 Feb 1160](http://i.imgur.com/ABzIvEL.jpg)

I become Zealous, which is much better than becoming a raving lunatic...which I am close to becoming. Someone please talk to me...I miss hearing voices...

[19 Aug 1161](http://i.imgur.com/jf8qkin.jpg)

A gaoler tells me that Prince Findlay, my son, is now my heir. This all comes because I got a new regent, the elegantly named Grand Mayor Máel-Máedóc I of Leinster.  He's really not that awesome, but his name really does make up for it.  Grand Mayor Cellach I of Meath thinks that the Duchy of Connacht is rightfully his... how about no.

[1 Sept 1161](http://i.imgur.com/GQkl4Wx.jpg)

I dream that there is a revolt in Dyfed and that I don't even have enough levies to defeat them.  I'm sure it was just a dream. 

[15 Feb 1162](http://i.imgur.com/FY73twe.jpg)

I'm Ill, I think it might have been the rat I ate this morning.  I keep dreaming of this damn revolt.

[27 Mar 1162](http://i.imgur.com/k3B6U0O.jpg)

I have recovered, but that was 12 days of hell.  Now back to the luxuries of hanging out in the oubliette nice and healthy. 

[4 May 1162](http://i.imgur.com/0USCBb3.jpg)

My uncle died, now I need to make my father, King of Ireland, the successor to Wales.  How the fuck did my disgraced father become the Kind of Ireland again? That asshole wants 314g to ransom me; I have only 240.'

[5 May 1162](http://i.imgur.com/EfOQyO0.jpg)

It would appear that my dad is now my heir.  Åmund back in control of the house? Ugh, that would be horrible.  

[1 Jan 1165](http://i.imgur.com/1lzTFgN.jpg)

I have a dream of the rebels being defeated in Dyfed, and I think this might be the end of the plaguing my sleep.

[2 Mar 1165](http://i.imgur.com/1CMXpCk.jpg)

I have the requisite gold, but my dad still won't let me out of the oubliette. I hate him so much.  I am in jail because I started my reign with a war that was begun with him as leader.  

[5 May 1165](http://i.imgur.com/YScH4xA.jpg)

Åmund died! I'm FREE!  Now I'm going to get Ireland due to elective laws, I'm the most qualified af Reddit left!  

I lose the vote by a landslight to Cathal Mac Carthaigh, the Duke of Munster, now King of Ireland.

[16 Apr 1166](http://i.imgur.com/B8YS7Yk.jpg)

I have died at the ripe old age of 33, one year after I got release from the oubliette, where I had stayed for over 7 years.  The worst thing I ever got there was a fever, and now I'm dead. Great. Just great. At least my son has the same name as me.

Downsides might be something like a penalty on piety and an opinion penalty towards religious leaders and characters with high piety. There could also be special events during crusades and so on.

1356707454.0,38,self.CrusaderKings,15kow3,Hair-lip heir: Not having a wonderful time. ,nilhaus,38,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/15kow3/hairlip_heir_not_having_a_wonderful_time/,"I've only been playing about 30 hours so far, mostly in Ireland. Writing this from memory, so sorry if a few minor details don't quite make sense. I hope you enjoy this tangled tale that took me a few hours to fully understand. 

I finally got a good strong Irish kingdom by starting with Desmond. After conquering my way through most of Ireland I crowned myself King and the remaining Dukes and Earls bent knee immediately. I only lacked a single providence, the northernmost one, which was held by Scotland. My king was first King of Ireland and he had two sons. My first son was strong, well liked, and ready to be king when the time came. My current king had a hunched back, but my first son had no such malady. My second son, on the other hand, had a hunchback and a handful of other negative traits. 

I didn't want hunchbacks being bred into my line, so I did a stupid thing and married him matrilineally to a weak Scottish Earl. I thought I'd never see him again. 

A few years later the current king of Ireland dies, and his hero of a son becomes the king and takes a young bride at the age of 18. Before he can sire any children he dies in a tragic ... nothing. He just died in his sleep. Or he was assassinated and I have a terrible spy master. Things were chaotic.

Now my hunchbacked, matrillineally married loser of a son inherits the throne. But low and behold his seed managed to spawn two children in this time. A hunchbacked, hair-lipped, moron, and a perfectly normal second son. Well, how am I going to fix this so that my line remains pure and unbroken. I struggled a while with killing my wife but she was surprisingly resilient. Fortunately for me, she died on her own not a few months later, and I remarried a very nice HRE princess. NON matrillineally. 

However, I still had the pesky sons to deal with who were vassal to a Scottish Earl. Then Scotland imploded, and I hope to get lucky and see the Earl stripped of lands, but instead that Earl is the King of Scotland when the dust settles. My son and heir to the Kingdom of Ireland is now vassal to the King of Scotland. Due to the marriage, my hair lipped, hunch backed son is also a 2 year old Scottish Duke.  

So now I just have to wait until I have a son, which I do shortly thereafter, then kill my two sons from the previous marriage. Before I can kill them, my son's liege, the upstart King of Scotland loses control of his Kingdom in a civil war, and when the dust settles the Duke of Ulster, who had a claim to the Isles, is now the owner of some new Counties in Scotland, and my son is his prisoner. This was the most confusing part, and I'm still not exactly sure what happened, just that when the Scottish war ended I had two new counties via the Duke of Ulster. 

So now my son is no longer vassal to Scotland since his liege was stripped of all lands and titles, but he is a prisoner of one of my vassals, Duke of Ulster, who now controlled 7 counties. The Duke of Ulster had every right to imprison my son as a Scottish Duke, but he was also Heir to the Kingdom of Ireland and his future liege. Very confusing. He also wouldn't release my son because my son had a strong claim on two of the counties he now controlled, and this duke was rather ambitious.

In an attempt to free my son, I revoked the title of the Duke of Ulster on the county where my son was being held, but this only made him rebel. I now went to war, therew the Duke in jail, and put down his rebellionExcept my son was still in jail because I didn't have enough backing to strip him of titles without causing widespread revolt and he still wouldn't release my son. I had already spent a fortune bribing people to like me and keep further rebellion from spreading. Nobody likes a hunch back. 

Tired of the scheming, I changed the laws to an Elective, and elected my two year old male heir from my new wife as my heir. Well, that was easy enough, I thought, and I'm ready to put all this behind me and focus on bigger things. Except my heir, the first male from my second wife, dies! And I become celibate pining for my first wife. 

Now I have no good male heirs except for my second son from my first wife, so I decide to do the right thing and elect my imprisoned first son from my first marriage, excommunicate the imprisoned Duke of Ulster, and then execute him. My imprisoned, hair lipped, hunched backed, heir and son is now 18 years old, and has been in jail since he was 2 years old. 

And then he dies of illness in jail before I can save up the money to ransom him. That poor hair lipped, hunch backed, King in waiting lived his whole life in jail and was used as a political pawn his whole life.

My second son from my second marriage, lacking any maladies, being well liked, haver of many positive traits, becomes my heir at the age of 18, having never really done anything, held any lands, or titles, or really ever been noticed. At the age of 22 he becomes the King of Ireland, 2 counties in Wales, and 2 counties in Scotland. 

Then his mom dies and he inherits more counties in Scotland. I couldn't have planned this if I'd tried. I completely homered my way into the largest Kingdom in Britannia. 

I'm now a eight years into his reign and he is one of my best Kings. All positive traits, every vassal's opinion is 80-100, and things are looking good as I plan my take over of a very weak Scotland. Now if I could just get my Scottish Dukes to stop warring with my Irish Dukes!

Edit: Forgot to mention that, the current king is the only living male descendant of William the Conquerer some how. I think it was meant to be. Britannia shall be mine.

It has been awesome and I have gotten further than I ever have before. Here is my current map at the year of 1253
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110722446

Now one of the things I have been focusing on this game is strong vassals. I have put in place tons and tons of kings, as well as some very strong Dukes. Here is a direct vassal map so you can get a feel of it.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110722340

Now my primary way of creating these vassals has been landing the family. The early Kommenos were prolific breeders and I focused on incumbating my close family to make kids, but not be a threat to me so I have an army of kinsman with no claim to the Byzantine Empire. Whenever I win a holy war or a Roman reconquest I generally will give half the land to kinsmen who are unlanded and not heirs or likely to become heirs. The dynasty buff is simply nice. 

Of my 17 kings, 14 are dynasty and the three non dynasty are really just glorified Dukes (Poland, Ruthenia, and Volga Bulgaria) In addition many of my independent dukes and even many of the dukes under my kings are dynasty. 

This has created extreme stability among my kingdoms and duchies as they are all allies. I really noticed this when I had set up a far removed prince of Anatolia as the Duke of Upper Burgundy. He was a 4 year old imbecile and since it was an imperial conquest his counts were old germans who were more loyal to the HRE. I figured him screwed as he had 4 counts against his one county. I attend to other affairs when suddenly I notice Italy, Sicily, Armenia, and Rus mobilizing. I check the war and I find out they, in addition to many others had joined the child Duke to protect his territory.

This prompted me to do some further investigation. Every Kommenos has a base of 68 lords in their ally tab. During my early game, the kingdom of Hungary was a mess of constantly changing kings until a Kommenos king rose to the top about 75 years ago and since then Hungary has been relatively stable. Most of my kings are able to do quite a bit of expanding on their own not simply because of their personal strength but because they can generally get 10 people to help. The holdings of kingdoms of Armenia, Egypt, and Jerusalem, and Sicily, were primarily made by themselves not me. The Roman Empire simply expands on it own. Sure I do my own aggressive expansion, the map at the beginning of the post was after the end of my war with essentially every Christian ruler left in Europe at the same time. And I just keep putting my dynasty in.

I finally got the GoT mod, and started my first game as Eddard, right at the start of the series.  I'm eager to keep him alive, as well as trying to see exactly what I can do with this situation.  I married Robb to Margaery Tyrell, started educating Arya with the Greatjon.  I also started training Bran with numbers, and eventually started Richon with Knighthood.  Sansa stayed betrothed to Joffrey, and was trained to be a lady.  All of my vassals join the liege loyalty party, and will stand with me until the end.

I almost immediately started plotting to kill Ramsey Snow, and sent a very loyal Roose off to Casterly Rock to improve diplomatic relations with Tywin, the new Hand.  Ramsey dies pretty quickly to a snake bite and no one cares.  Robert Arryn keeps asking for Arya's hand and I keep denying.  She's better than that.  Soon after I started that, Robert imprisoned Mace Tyrell for no real apparent reason.  About four months later he was beheaded.  Margaery was probably not happy about this, but didn't really say anything. 

About a year later, Prince Aegon landed in Dorne, ready to take the Iron Throne.  The whole kingdom of Dorne immediately rose up to back him.  Robert executes Prince Doran, who was apparently a part of the small council, which is honestly the one place I wouldn’t want to be if my kingdom is about to declare for another king. Aegon’s invasion basically stalls in the Dorish Marshes and he ends up hanging out in Dorne married to Arianne Martell.  

By this point I've married Arya off to Theon, who is of course the heir to the Iron Islands.  Sansa and Joffrey ended up married, but I did it matrilineally so I can keep an eye on the little shit.  I was surprised that Robert agreed to that, but I imagine that he trusts me.  Basically everyone north of Harrenhal is happy and laughing at the political strife of the South.  Jon Snow has decided to go to Essos, and I happily tell him to find himself and be safe, and that he is welcome back at any point.

Soon after this, I am met by an envoy of the Iron Bank.  It turns out that they want to collect their debts on the Iron Throne.  They offer me 500 gold and 10,000 soldiers if I march on Robert.  If I defeat him, they’ll back me on the throne and I’ll inherit his debts to them.  Well, I decide that I’m still loyal to Robert and respectfully decline.  

Anyways, things are running pretty smooth up until around 307, when Tywin declares that he wants the Iron Throne.  King Robert has become very tyrannical by this point, executing people left and right.  We’ve now seen two Lords Paramount executed by this King, and Eddard is starting to feel like the Mad King is back.  I get the option to back Robert, back Tywin, sit it out, or become the King of the North.  At this point, after seeing everything that has happened in the past seven or so years, Eddard is tired of the evil King Robert the Fat, so he declares independence.  Hail to King Eddard!  King of the North!!

So, I ask my allies through marriage to help me out, and Balon jumps to my aid.  Hoster also rallies to my banner, and I get ready to move troops south to keep out the Stormlanders.  Now remember, I’ve got Joffrey living in Winterfell, and I get a notice that I can execute him, imprison him, or acknowledge that he has nothing to do with this.  I decide to imprison him.  He has never really done anything too bad to Sansa, and they have two kids at this point.  So, I decide to keep him alive. 

I march south to meet Hoster’s troops while Balon starts sailing south.  Eddard is leading the center column, while Robb leads the left and Maege Mormont, as my strongest commander, leads the largest force, the right.  As I reach the neck, I get a notice that Joffrey is demanding trial by combat.  I get the choice of honoring his request, using champions, ignoring him, or executing him.  Well, Eddard isn’t one to have a champion, so he decides to battle Joffrey himself.  After a long battle, he defeats Joffrey, and stands over him.  Joffrey knows that his life is forfeit, but Eddard decides to send him to the Wall, rather than execute him.  He can still be a great asset, and hopefully he will learn honor while protecting the realms of man as a member of the Night’s Watch.

At this point, Sansa is free.  I use her freedom to marry her off to Robert Arryn.  He’s been begging for Arya for so long, but I figure that Sansa would like the Vale.  This allows me to call them into the fray.  Now we have troops in the west, north, and east.  I continue the march to the Crownlands, and meet King Robert in battle.  In a massive battle that costs me three-quarters of my troops, Robert is slain.  So ends the tyrannical rein of Robert the Fat.

I decide to let the Southern Lords fight it out while I head back north to my frozen throne.  Once I get back and disband my troops, I get a notice from Lord Robert Arryn inviting me to his and Sansa’s wedding feast.  Of course I’ll go to that!  It’s the marriage of Eddard’s mentor’s son and Eddard’s daughter!  I march down to witness Eddard’s eldest daughter’s second wedding, and as soon as I cross into the Vale, the entire North falls back under the control of the Iron Throne, along with the Riverlands and the Iron Islands.  I get a notice that the War is over and I have lost.

Eddard gets taken captive by Robert’s troops.  Turns out he’s loyal to King Tommen and was never on my side.  I get a long notification about loyalty and how I’m a traitor to the crown.  In a full screen notice, I’m told that King Tommen views traitors in a harsh light, and I’m to be beheaded as soon as possible.  It appears that Tommen takes after his late father, and I have just led the Riverlands, the Iron Islands, and the North right under his boot.  The game ends as he turns his eye to the Westerlands, and I wish Tywin luck.  Sansa gets to witness a different Baratheon son order the execution of her father, as her fiancé stands there, helping this time rather than giving the order.  

I sat there staring at the screen, amazed that Robert Arryn was capable of such deceit.  In one fell swoop, three kingdoms fall, all because I trusted the Vale.  Unfortunately, the game ended at this point.  I would have loved to be able to continue playing as Robb, fighting to avenge my father.  It’s too bad that the game decided that everyone in House Stark was persona non grata at that point.  At least Jon got out.  I hope he comes back at some point, leading the Golden Company.

The verdict: they're lacklustre place holders for what could, in future patches, be marvellous additions to vanilla CKII. My thoughts:

* Hellenic characters can currently take concubines, but Greek and Roman marriage was a strictly monogamous institution.

* Despite being ""reformed"", the religion has no head. There should be an option in the Intrigue menu to reinstate the Pontifex Maximus, much like how Zoroastrian rulers have the opportunity to reinstate the Moabite priesthood.

* Although I don't like the weak conversion rates and the susceptibility of Hellenic characters/regions to missionaries, this is an historical accuracy. Hellenic religion did not fare well against monotheism.

* The game uses northern pagan terms for Roman Hellenic rulers: Hetman, Chief, High Chief, King, Emperor. There ought to be culturally-unique terms for Roman rulers, as for any other fleshed-out ethnic group in CKII. One might use ""Praetorius Praefecto"" for a subordinate king, ""Princeps"" for an independent king, ""Imperator"" for an Emperor, ""Legatus"" for a baron, ""Vicarius"" for a duke, ""Proconsul"" for a count, or what have you. Something - anything - to make Romans and Hellenic pagans feel *different*.

* The only ceremonial titles available to a Roman Hellenic ruler are ""Cupbearer"" and ""Court Jester"". Obviously there are many, many ceremonial titles of Roman origin that could be added here.

* Romans are unable to form the Kingdom of Italy because they are not Christian and are unable to form the Empire of Italia because they are neither Italian nor Christian. Romans are likewise unable to reform the Roman Empire (!!!) because they are not Christian. The checks for certain events need to be rewritten to allow Roman and Hellenic players to restore the glory of the Empire.

* Hellenic pagans get the subjugation cassus belli but have no one to subjugate. Not particularly useful. Hellenic pagans also have no special pagan bonuses to keep them safe from attack like the other pagans do. They also seem to lack the ability to holy war or to call ""crusades"".

* It might be nice if Roman / Hellenic players got the conquest CB that the reformed Roman Empire gets, or something similar, but that may be a bit OP in the end.

* The addition of Roman names and surnames is a nice touch. I have no complaints there. The use of the Mediterranean portrait set for Romans is also adequate.

That's all I can think of at the moment. What about you? What are your thoughts? What do you want to see happen to Romans and Hellenic pagans in future patches?

Oh, and one last thought: Plenty of fans of CKII have clamoured for a Roman culture or a Hellenic religion; plenty of fans, too, have clamoured for a Jewish culture or a Jewish religion. If you're going to toss Romans and Hellenism into the game to please the former then you can certainly toss Jews and Judaism into it to please the latter. Once you've willingly added *yet another* superfluous religion to the game, your explanations for omitting Judaism start to sound like prejudice-covering excuses.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,1370471865.0,,lithuania,True,t3_1fr2rp,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1fr2rp/thoughts_on_roman_culture_and_hellenic_paganism/,

Here is a tip to remove them.,Pinstar,42,6,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1clph1/got_a_bad_heir_here_is_a_tip_to_remove_them/,"Find yourself in Primo (or Ultimo) with a [Sketchy Successor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchySuccessor) occupying the heir slot? Here is a tip to make murdering him a *little* easier. They need to be an adult male for this to work. 

1. Make your heir your chancellor, regardless of his diplomacy stat.
2. Send him on a mission to fabricate claims in another nation. (even if you aren't actually interested in a fabricated claim)
3. Park your spymaster in the same county as your heir with the 'build spy network' mission.
4. Assassinate heir. 

In the two times I've used this, I've found my % chance of success to be very high for the heir of a king (~50%) and chance of discovery extremely low (~3%). 

Your numbers will vary depending on your ruler's, your heir's and your spymaster's intrigue skills... but it seems to be much better than trying to murder him in your own court. My guess is that there are more potential witnesses in the court of a king then in some backwater foreign county. 

Once your heir is dead, you can fill your chancellor slot with a proper candidate.

EDIT: 
If you fail to kill your heir and need to wait for more money to build up, there is always a chance that they'll be killed by the county they're in as a freebie.

We started at the Robert's Rebellion scenario, which has half of Westeros rebelling against the rule of the ""Mad King"" Aerys Targaryen. I started as the king and my friend as the neutral Westerlands. The way the war played out was surprising even to me. The twists and turns, the Targaryens coming back from the brink of defeat, the groundwork laid for the struggles of power to come: it's all there. What follows is an AAR of the war's events. Unfortunately I do not have screenshots (the idea to take them only occurred much later).

-----

King Aerys Targaryen and Lord Commander Gerold the White Bull of the Kingsguard met Robert Baratheon on the field of battle southeast of King's Landing. Robert cut down the White Bull and the Mad King as well. Crown Prince Rhaegar inherited the throne and petitioned Lord Tywin of the Westerlands for aid. Rhaegar promised Tywin Lannister the Riverlands if he rallied his banners in support of the crown. Tywin accepted the offer and joined the war to fight for his king.

Rhaegar had a low-key coronation ceremony in King's Landing and then returned to the war. Only 6 months after becoming king, he met Robert on the field of battle, near the same place his father had fallen. History is doomed to repeat itself: Robert cut down Lord Commander Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard and King Rhaegar. Aegon, the sixth of his name, inherited the Iron Throne as a baby. His mother died when he was 3 from a weak physique. Ser Alyn was appointed Regent of the Iron Throne and would govern the realm until Aegon came of age. Barristan Selmy became the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and eventually Aegon's guardian. As Aegon grew, Barristan trained him in the ways of sword and shield. However, the Crown apparently never had enough money to pay for a formal education. Aegon's uncle Viserys finally gathered enough to pay for a court education when Aegon was about 9.

Robert Baratheon also slew Lord Mace Tyrell of the the Reach in the same battle where he killed Arthur Dayne and King Rhaegar. The new Lord Paramount of the Reach was young like Aegon and his regent declined to rejoin the war. The Reach soon fell into civil war for several years, keeping them from joining the main war on either side.

Lord Hoster of the Riverlands was slain by Tywin in the decisive Battle of Bramsfort. Tywin later slew the traitor Robert Baratheon during the chaos of the Battle of Maidenpool. Though Tywin lost the Battle of Maidenpool, this was a decisive point in the war. Stannis claimed himself as the rightful ruler of Westeros and continued his brother's war.

Tywin was later killed by Lord Eddard of the North at the Battle of Brindlewood, leaving Tyrion Lannister in charge of the Westerlands. At this point, things were looking grim. Edmure, the new Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, rejoined the rebellion. Stannis, Eddard's, and Edmure's forces occupied much of the Crownlands, closing in on King's Landing. The war was heavily in favor of the rebellious Lords Paramount at this time, with them nearing victory. Strategic strikes by Westerlands-Dorne-Royal forces kept dragging the war out until they were finally able to band together and win several decisive victories in the Crownlands.

The seventh year of the war was the turning point in favor of the loyalists. Stannis Baratheon died in an accident (not a suspicious one!), leaving his young brother Renly in charge. The vassals of House Baratheon were unhappy with this arrangement, and started a war to raise Robert's bastard daughter Mya to Lady Paramount. The loyalists crushed the remaining rebel forces and liberated the bulk of the Crownlands.

Advantage shifted to the rebels once more when Tyrion received word from Casterly Rock that Lord Gawen of the Crag started a war to press Cersei Lannister's claim on the Westerlands. Kayce and Golden Road also joined in. The neutral Iron Islands decided this would be a good time to raid the Crag and plunder the western coast of its riches. Tyrion's forces marched back to Casterly Rock to suppress the rebellion and deal with the vicious Ironborn as the North and Riverlands rallied their hosts in Darry and marched on the Crownlands once again.

The diminished loyalist forces went into battle against a 9,000-man strong Northman-Riverlander army. Morale of the soldiers was low, as day after day they were getting destroyed by the rebels. But then Lord Willas of the Reach sent a raven to King's Landing informing the king that he was gathering his forces and marching in support of the crown once again.

Lord Willas arrived just in the nick of time to defeat the rebel forces at the battle of Sow's Horn. With the massive armies of the Reach again fighting in support of the king, the rebels were routed time and again, and Renly finally offered peace. After almost 10 years of bloody fighting, the Targaryens remained on the Iron Throne as was their right. House Targaryen and House Baratheon were decimated. Only 7 Targaryens remained alive, and Renly was the last Baratheon. The rebels were brought before the Iron Throne, and young Aegon decided their fate personally:

* Lord Eddard: Lord Eddard was spared and allowed to return to Winterfell. His brother Benjan and sister Lyana remain in King's Landing as guests.
* Lord Renly: Renly was imprisoned and the Castle Rainwood taken from him.
* Lord Edmure: Aegon honored his father's promise and demanded that Edmure forfeit the Riverlands to Tyrion.

Edmure refused the royal command, and declared himself independent. The rebellious Riverlanders crowned him King of the Trident. This second revolt was put down in a matter of months. Edmure was imprisoned, and Tyrion named Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. As the king is kind and just, Edmure was banished to the Night's Watch to serve the realm as a Black Brother. His three year old daughter Lysa Tully inherited Riverrun.

The civil war to place Mya Stone in the Stormlands' Lord Paramountcy ended, and she is now a vassal of the Iron Throne. However, another civil war to place Renly back in Storm's End has started. The war is currently in favor of Lady Mya. Tyrion mopped up the revolt in the Westerlands and had his sister executed. This cemented his claim on Casterly Rock and the Westerlands.

After the War of the Usurper ended, Aegon the Young came of age. He married his sister Princess Rhaenys, as is the tradition of his House. The two quickly fell in love and gave birth to a boy named Maekar. Although Maekar does not have the traditional features of a Targaryen, he is certain to be a great military ruler. Aegon the Sixth of His Name was officially crowned as King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men; Lord of the Seven Kingdoms; and Protector of the realm at age 15. The coronation ceremony was to be held on Aegon's wedding day, but it was delayed due to the High Speton unexpectedly dying.

Prince Doran of Dorne, the king's uncle, was made Hand of the King. Tyrion Lannister was appointed Master of Coin. Lord Willas was appointed as an additional member of the small council for his loyalty to the Crown. Lord Paramount Balon of the Iron Islands was imprisoned and banished to the wall: the Master of Whispers discovered that he was plotting treason! His much more amicable son now controls the Iron Islands.

Though he remains in prison, Lord Renly has apparently been wed non-matrilineally to Arianne of Dorne. Any children they have will be able to lay strong claim to Dorne and the Stormlands. Such an alliance could lead to a potentially disastrous situation in the future...",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,,True,t3_1cmvy0,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1cmvy0/the_war_of_the_usurper/,

1342976881.0,34,self.CrusaderKings,wyzvu,The Polish Emperor of Rome: Redux!,Snigaroo,37,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/wyzvu/the_polish_emperor_of_rome_redux/,"I've had some requests to tell a few stories, so I've decided to pick up an old story of mine and see if I could recreate the Polish Emperor Boleslaw I ""The Conqueror"" Piast.

For background, in one of my games I managed to have Boleslaw Piast conquer the Holy Roman Empire; his dynasty went on to conquer the Byzantines as well, and thereby became the ""Polish Emperors of Rome"", holding two Empire titles. [Here's a picture of said game.](http://i.imgur.com/IOJLo.jpg) I wanted to see if I could get Boleslaw to conquer the Reich in his lifetime again; I also decided I'd take a few pretty pictures and see if I couldn't make a guide out of it for any fellow enterprising Poles. As such, what follows is the story of Boleslaw II Piast, asshole of the year, all years.

Note that I lost a few pictures on my way through converting them all to .jpgs (damn saving as bitmaps), so there are a few portions missing. I'll do my best to fill in what happened from memory. Also note that I'm using a few mods: one of my personal creations (it doesn't change anything too drastically; you can easily recreate what I do here) and a few ones posted to the paradox forums, such as Shaytana's Better Looking Characters. Again, nothing too drastically different from vanilla.


**The plan, Sniggles, what's the plan!**

A few of you might right about now be saying, ""Well, Snigaroo, what precisely *is* this plan of yours?"" Well, that's simple. To the north of Poland there are a horde of pagans: I'm going to take their land and place some nice Polish dukes there instead, and those Dukes are going to give me the levies I need to conquer the Reich. This is the part where you say, ""but that'll take forever!"" And then I retort wittily, ""not if you never stop fighting!""

And this is the part where you tell me I'm a mad, mad genius (or dipshit). Yes, my plan is to literally never stop fighting. Declare war, call Kaiser, attack, win war, lower levies, and declare war again, even if there's a truce in effect. This takes advantage of two CK2 mechanics:

**1.** Although you take a prestige hit from breaking a truce no matter what, you only get a -20 opinion versus the religion type you broke the truce of. That means only the Romuvans will hate me as I declare Holy War after Holy War, and they hate me anyway.

**2.** An ally will almost always join a holy war, no matter the distance. In addition, allies can be called back-to-back time and again, provided they don't refuse a summons.

So, in short, I'm declaring a constant state of wars on heathens. That might seem odd to you. Land is nice, sure, but is it ultimately worth that -70 raised levies opinion you have from declaring war back-to-back for so long (and yes, it does get to -70)? Well, yes. My plan is to conquer the Reich by the Invasion casus belli; to gain this CB, I have to be *very* friendly with the Pope, and have quite a bit of piety to boot. I'm sure you see where this is going.

So, how exactly does this work out? Well, let's start our journey into the life of Boleslaw and see.


**We begin with...**

[Marriage, of course!](http://i.imgur.com/bjOZo.jpg?1) This being Crusader Kings, though, of course I'm not doing it because the wench is comely, I'm doing it because of the alliance she provides me. From the very start I intend to conquer the Holy Roman Empire with Boleslaw, and to do that requires a few very specific maneuvers in the early game. First, ironically, you must actually ally with the Reich. Only they have the manpower necessary to help you win the dozens of Holy Wars you're going to be throwing yourself into; in this case, I married the Kaiser's sister. Rather than request the gold, I took the Prestige bonus; playing a game like this, truces will mean *nothing*. Take what Prestige you can get, and hope it'll keep your vassals happy.

Before marrying my old lady I took the time to set up my councilors, activate the ""get married"" ambition, and start work on Max Feudal Levies. After we're married and I've gotten the piety bonus I switch my ambition over to Paragon of Virtue; if I'm going for a piety boost, I might as well go all-out.

Now, conquest. Max Feudal passes and I've got my ambitions set up; I declare war on the Duke of Mecklenburg for nothing less than the Duchy of Mecklenburg, and call the Kaiser for aide. Naturally he comes to my defense and, unsurprisingly, his 10,000 men steamroll the Romuvan resistance with naught but a little help from my own levies and [wins me the war by mid-1068](http://i.imgur.com/zDZwJ.jpg?1). For the first war, this isn't a bad timetable. I throw my court chaplain over there to convert the local heathens and pat myself on the back.

Now, why Mecklenburg? Well, tactically speaking, two reasons. First, Mecklenburg borders the single-county Lubeck, which is easy pickings. The newly-landed Duke of Mecklenburg, whoever it is, has a chance to fabricate a claim on that county, and more land is never a bad thing. A more pressing reason, however, is that the King of Denmark and the Kaiser himself both eye Mecklenburg early-game. If you take it you prevent it from being held by either of those two--we are trying to keep the Kaiser weak, after all--and you also can land a Polish duke who has the ability to vote on the successor of the Reich, since Mecklenburg is de jure a part of the Holy Roman Empire. It gives you a vote, yay!

With Mecklenburg now added to the great Kingdom of Poland it comes time for me to land vassals in my newly-conquered territory. When choosing bishops, be careful! Make sure you get the [piety boost](http://i.imgur.com/UrCw2.jpg?1) from landing them; only certain characters will give you this, but the piety gain is worth it, [as is evident by how much the Pope likes me](http://i.imgur.com/rwnVO.jpg?1). I could've had good ol' Heinrich excommunicated right then and there, but I don't yet have enough piety to even request and Invasion and, well... it would go badly for me even if I did. 1500 troops total, anyone?

So, for the time being, I ignore the juicy Reich and focus on my own expansion. I usurp the Duchy of Mecklenburg and give it to a vassal landed in that territory, then attack the now-count of that once-proud land. Losing the 100 prestige for breaking truce is worth [letting the Kaiser win me the war with his doomstack and subsequently] gobbling up half of Pomerania--which I rapidly follow up with another holy war, this time on the Duke of Pomerania himself, for none other than the remnants of the Duchy of Pomerania under his control. At the end of this third Holy War I fulfill my ambition to become a Paragon of Virtue, as is evidenced by [the Pope being even more willing than before to excommunicate Heinrich](http://i.imgur.com/SCKbl.jpg?1). It's like he's baiting me, the cheeky bastard. But luckily I know I'd get slapped down so hard I wouldn't live to see straight again and restrain myself; conquering the Salian line comes later.

Some images got lost here, but by about right now I'm suffering -20 raised levies penalties. I stop and take a breather while the Kaiser has obligations elsewhere; ideally you want to *never* let him rest long enough to even contemplate joining another ally's war, but in this case I didn't catch it in time and he sailed off to help the King of Hungary. Nevertheless, his timing was fairly ideal; there's an infant Queen of Sweden and a new King of Denmark, so they're unlikely to try any holy wars against my soon-to-be-destroyed northern neighbors, and letting my vassal levies rest gives me time to implement Max City Levies and Low Crown Authority, perfect for later conquest.

As soon as the Kaiser's back from his trip to Hungary I get right back up and force him to get up with me, launching holy wars for years on end to completely wipe out the remaining Romuvan scum; unfortunately there are no pictures from this period, either, except for one [oddly hilarious case of William de Normandie trying to conquer England in 1085](http://i.imgur.com/wcsvK.jpg?1) (he failed). Simply suffice it to say that between '72 and '86 [I was a very busy Pole](http://i.imgur.com/xzRvn.jpg?1). Of course, even with the military centralization in the form of laws and building prep I was doing during this period (such as building castle villages and whatnot, upgrading my economy) Heinrich still did most of the work. He's really a Godsend; it's too bad I'm going to kick his dynasty's ass, he's been a real grade-A chum, helping me beef up for the sole purpose of destroying his family and whatnot. Great guy.

Now you'll notice that the evil scumbag Dane-Swede confederacy have moved in and cockblocked my total control of the Lithuanian duchies there. ""But Snigaroo, you crazy bastard, that doesn't even matter at all, *ever*!"" you insist. Well, yes, actually, you're completely right, but I like to have my Kingdom be nice and orderly, especially when it comes to integration of duchies into a Kingdom. Perhaps the [duchies mapmode](http://i.imgur.com/8s0wQ.jpg?1) will help illustrate my anal-retentive angst against the viking threat. It will certainly help illustrate just how long I've been at war; it's a testament to Boleslaw's stats that none of his vassals are pondering rebellions right about now. Or, more accurately, it's a testament to me being very free with duchies and counties, as you must be if you're going to be abusing your vassals' levies long-term like this.

As a result, the old practice finding ways to break the truce early has grown in importance. 

While the fastest and most direct way to break a truce early is to murder the ruler, but that isn't always an option. They may be too well liked to be plotted against... to well guarded to have any reasonable assassanation attempts. There is another thing you can do to hasten another war without resorting to murder. 

Mark the person with whom you have a truce as a 'person of interest' (Right click their portrait, right click the mini person icon and click the middle option, which will turn it into a silver star)

This will keep you informed of the person's dealings. It will also let you know if this person dies... or is deposed, something the game won't tell you if you aren't following them as a person of interest. The game will tell you of truces about to expire due to time, but not when one of the truce holders dies or is deposed. 

Striking after the death of the ruler is ideal as the new ruler is unlikely to command the same loyalty and thus may suffer from smaller levies and/or internal revolts. And since you waited for them to die, you have 0 risk of any penalties or expenses associated with murder. This is especially useful against republics and senority succession kingdoms, as both tend to have older, shorter-lived rulers. 

Also don't forget that when YOUR character dies, their truces expire too. If your heir can stabilize the realm, you can go to war again without having to wait for the enemy ruler to die, since the truce was nullified on your end. 

This can let you expand faster than you otherwise could normally without suffering the massive penalties for breaking a truce. Once your person of interest is dead, you can un-star them to reduce clutter on your UI.

Now if someone (say, succession game #3 participants) were to save independent realm maps more often, this could be made more fluid.

[Keyboard Shortcuts](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?672542-Couple-Minor-Mods-Keyboard-Shortcuts-and-Interface-Adjust)

This adds 12 shortcuts to the game: 1,2,3,4,z,x,c,v,b,n,m and (tilde)

1-2-3-4 allow for all event decisions to be chosen with the associated key. 1 is the top (first) decision, 4 would be the 4th or bottom decision. In situations where the ""Enter"" key bind would work, this has been replaced by ""1"" to allow for consistency. 

z raises levy directly from any holding you have control over, or from the building screen.

x dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship), *capital* ""x"" will dismiss ALL selected levies

c raises ships in selected holding or building

v embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province

b merges selected levies or ships, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally.) This just replaces our old friend the 'g' key. If you have a single army/shipgroup the ""b"" key will open the new unit interface

n selects the trade port screen on coastal provinces

m selects the normal holdings screen 

(tilde) is a back button. please be aware that (tilde) is usually used to open the cheat interface. This does not prevent that functionality, in fact it is a logical button choice considering you can only access the cheat interface when there are no open windows.

I hope that you use these, they make a huge difference in my enjoyment of the game.  They might help you too!  And again, it does NOT affect game play balance or anything else in the game.  Its more about utility and ease-of-use.

20 - 26 October, 1357

The whole court is in an uproar. Someone killed some far away [despot](http://i.imgur.com/1xRqH3D.jpg). I didn't hear about this until they told me two of my cousins also died, [Annie](http://i.imgur.com/0Lg5uFP.jpg) and [Eulie](http://i.imgur.com/jne4QlZ.jpg). They were always nice to me and come play with me and my kittens when Theo would have the other boys call me names or throw things at me. Some people look at me funny now though, some whispering I stole [something](http://i.imgur.com/3fW6OT7.jpg) that wasn't mine.

***

[27 November, 1357](http://i.imgur.com/zvv8lsS.jpg)

I saw someone die today. One of the nannies. I tried my best to be a good Basileus and not cry but there was a lot of blood everywhere. I overheard my nannies talking with my “uncle” Neophytos that they should send me away for my own good. I don't want to leave!

***

[8 June, 1359](http://i.imgur.com/gmA5L1Z.jpg)

My nana and nannies were all there today at the docks. Apparently I am going to some place called “Portogalia” to live with an uncle and my cousin Arsenios. I was allowed to bring as many toys as I want though and *all* my kittens, even the big kitten I got for my sixth birthday! I can't play with him like the other kittens though. There's always this man with him but he makes the big kitten do things that are fun!

***

[7 November, 1359](http://i.imgur.com/q8WqA8s.jpg)

My uncles are always complaining about my other uncles. I overheard one saying something about a “regent,” but Arsenios tells me not to worry about it as I have to get back to my studies.

***

[17 November, 1360](http://i.imgur.com/GFuBcON.jpg)

Arsensios brought me into his study today for a special history lesson. He told me all about House af Reddit and why we have such a funny name. (I mean it's not even Greek!) Our long ago ancestors were a mighty warrior people who came from far to the north. But their lands were poor and so they conquered richer lands on islands to the west, *Vretania* he called it. Then there was my great-great-great-grandfather Peter 'the Conqueror,' who rightfully inherited our great Roman Empire. My father before me who I never really knew, and his father before him, and his before him, worked long and hard to ensure peaceful rule in the Empire, even though many conspired against them. He said their work was done now and it was up to me to bring glory the house and to bring all of Europe under the enlightened rule of House af Reddit!

***

[14 May, 1362](http://i.imgur.com/dWqFpji.jpg)

My cousin Anakomos showed up unannounced a few weeks ago but my uncle thought not much of it. Today I was surprised to see my uncle Neophytos (who Arsensios told me was never really my uncle)  to appear in the grand hall as we all thought he was very busy back east. He came bursting through the doors with the household guard and pointed straight at Anakomos. He quickly made his way up to my uncle, the despot of this far off west land, whispered something in his ear and presented him with some documents. I tried to ask what was going on but Aresenios quickly rushed me out of the hall followed by a large group of guards, while I overheard Anakomos shouting some rather nasty things.

***

[18 February, 1363](http://i.imgur.com/RYIYAqU.jpg)

I was thinking today while in the palace garden about those history lessons Arsensios had given. I was destined for great things. To be greater than Arsenios himself, who would one day be a despot. But I was Basileus! The rightful heir to Rome, to be anointed by God's own hand on earth, the Bishop of Rome! These other children I play with are nothing next to me, me who sits higher than their own father!

***

[19 December, 1363](http://i.imgur.com/4DrTT81.jpg)

The Count of Rama, my regent, would often make the trip west to Portogalia to visit me and would speak at length with Arsenios. I learned through him the conquests of our realm and the Count would make frequent promises how the realm was in good hands and would be ready for me on my sixteenth birthday. That was all fine to me, but as I recall it was my regent who forbid me to take up jousting until I was sixteen as well! I would show him just how well of a jouster I could be!

I ran around the corridors on my (stick..) horse, broom pole in hand. I spotted the Count moving towards one of the balconies. “Chaaaaarge!!!” I yelled, but he didn't respond. What kind of warrior is he to forbid me from jousting if he isn't even aware of his surroundings? I ran straight into him, missing with my broom pole. He was knocked straight off the balcony and landed straight on top of a statue in the garden several floors below. I made a hasty retreat.

***

[20 December, 1363](http://i.imgur.com/v84oBzr.jpg)

Rumours were flying around the court of an assassin. I knew otherwise. I also knew to keep my mouth shut unless I wanted the strap. Some way to treat a Basileus! I was told that being a senior member of House af Reddit and an esteemed member of my council, my kinsman Arsenios II the King of Cyprus would take the Count's place as my regent. I would hope he knows better than to tell me what to do.

***

[19 March, 1364](http://i.imgur.com/7PS2835.jpg)

I demanded of Arsenios that I be allowed to train and joust with the other boys, my eleventh birthday had just passed and they were only a year or two older! Besides, I was Basileus! He acquiesced and instructed me to speak to the sergeant in charge of the training grounds. The sergeant laughed at me and said this was not my place, but gave me a wooden sword and shield anyway. I had some practice with a tutor but never fought against the other boys. The sergeant matched me up with a boy he said to be only one year my senior but I thought that a bold faced lie! I prepared to fight anyhow and kept my mouth shut. Blow after blow glanced off my shield and it hurt even through the wood. I was too slow and he connected with a hard knock to my head with his sword. I fell to the ground, the world a blur. The next second I could see the older child coming at me again so I lunged at his feet, bringing him to the ground with me. The sergeant yelled something and then was in between us the next moment. He laughed and said he would speak to Arsenios about my returning to the training grounds.

***

25 April, 1365

I had a fine time the other day making hell for the kitchen staff! I raided their pantry for sweets and found where they kept all the fine crystal and silver. One dared tell me what to do! I threw a [goblet](http://i.imgur.com/nUElbn1.jpg) at his feet for his trouble and shattered into a thousand fine pieces. Then today when Arsensios heard of what I did I was in for quite the [beating](http://i.imgur.com/UNR6v0c.jpg). He would not stop until I told him what I did wrong. Perhaps there are limits to what I can and can't do, even as Basileus.

***

[21 May, 1366](http://i.imgur.com/oFFd5YK.jpg)

Another child thought he could come and take an old toy horse of mine. The gall of it, taking something from a Basileus! I had one of the guards beat the other boy senseless and to take his toys to let that serve as a reminder to him. What is mine is mine and belongs to no one else!

***

[23 January, 1367](http://i.imgur.com/QIz3hWe.jpg)

I have been informed that some petty dukes are unhappy with their king and would rather live under the wise rule of af Reddit! Perhaps these dukes may be petty, but there is likely a brain or two amongst them.

***

[21 August, 1368](http://i.imgur.com/wKSucZO.jpg)

I have come down with some dreadful disease! Is this some divine punishment? Have I done something to offend God? My innards seem to want to leave my body and are doing their best. I can not keep anything down. I am seen day and night by the house maids and a barber who leeches me daily but none of it seems to help.

***

[24 August, 1368](http://i.imgur.com/5JsvFKd.jpg)

I am told of a glorious victory over the heathen Moslems to the east. They are holding a great Triumph apparently honouring me for this victory. They asked me to come back east to preside over the Triumph despite my illness. I declined, but they insisted saying the people believed it to be the work of God through the young emperor. They had to have me or there could be riots they said! I remembered Arsenios's lessons, I couldn't allow anything to hurt the realm. No indeed it was my duty to make the realm greater, so I agreed to the dreadful voyage. Surely God must be testing me.

***

[9 November, 1368](http://i.imgur.com/WOe3UwE.jpg)

I made an appearance at the Triumph, as was asked of me and the people cheered for their beloved ruler, for me. It was quite overwhelming but I managed not to vomit on the litter as I was carried through the crowd to the great palace. My council was very pleased, telling me all I had to do was show up and recognized the great sacrifice I made to take the voyage. Soon enough though the vomiting ceased, followed by the other end. I've never felt more alive! I have survived God's trial. This must be a sign of great things to come as my sixteenth birthday fast approaches and the regency shall officially be over!

***

[31 March, 1369](http://i.imgur.com/VDsqAXF.jpg)

The regency has ended and I am in full command of the mighty Roman Empire and the destiny of House af Reddit! It seems the war for Oualía has been all but won, so I look to another task of great importance – my choice of bride! A pretty young girl had appeared at court one day and I was pleased to learn she was the Eunike I, the Queen of Georgia and Jerusalem. Having learned much about the instability of the Empire in the past I thought it wise to forge an alliance with a powerful vassal. It did not hurt that I found her quite the charming young thing as well. I soon had heralds throughout the realm announcing our betrothal, awaiting the end of her own regency and her sixteenth birthday.

***

26 May, 1369

The war in Oualía has been won and the [crown handed over to me](http://i.imgur.com/kAXasyp.jpg). The Triumph was truly God's work, for if I had not returned to Constantinople, I would not have been able to convince the regent to send armies to the aid of the Welsh. A good thing too as the English had decided to back the old despot, but their armies were no match in size or quality of our Roman Legions!

Later that day, I announced a [great tournament](http://i.imgur.com/jHpq2IU.jpg) honouring my ascendance to the throne and the glory of House af Reddit!

***

[11 August, 1369](http://i.imgur.com/mIaHI1e.jpg)

I have been entertaining a distant kinsman in court for the past weeks and finally my efforts have come to fruition. Swayed by the obvious might and benevolent rule of the Roman Empire, he has agreed to reenter the fold and has sworn fealty to me.

***

7 September, 1372

The business of the realm hums along nicely. A war rages in Ireland but I am confident in the ability of my Marshal to handle it. Instead I have devoted much of my time to [gardening](http://i.imgur.com/qGfUh2h.jpg), that I may study my organizational skills to better oversee the realm. I have overseen the reconstruction of the palace grounds which had seen much better days. Of course I never did any of the weeding myself, choosing to delegate such tasks! But in the end I learned much about [organizing large projects](http://i.imgur.com/j91iEWL.jpg), and indeed when another court entertains me I ask that I might have a look at their gardens and even suggest projects for their improvement!

***

[12 August, 1374](http://i.imgur.com/dbXZnnb.jpg)

Glory to House af Reddit and praise Jesus! My wife has given me a daughter. I still ask God for a son, but rest easier knowing now that I have an heir to carry out my work when I am done. There are many wars to be fought, rightful lands of the Roman Empire to be brought back under heel. Many who still manage to control lands within the border of the Empire itself! I can devote my attention to these wars now without the bickering and petty gossip of the courtiers wondering whether I could consummate my marriage.

***

6 April, 1375

No sooner had I learned that the lords of Anglía were unhappy with their lord and wished to [install me](http://i.imgur.com/U85OIs7.jpg) as their rightful king, than I had learned that the Anglían king simply [gave in to their demands](http://i.imgur.com/efmZMxx.jpg)! Truly the might of the Roman Empire is something to behold. No doubt the might of our armies as well had impressed the Anglíans during our war with Wales.

***

[17 September, 1376](http://i.imgur.com/ckEThEc.jpg)

Deus Vult! The Bishop of Rome has called for a crusade against the heretical people Lotharinkías. God has been good to me and I shall answer his call!
***
[30 May, 1377](http://i.imgur.com/6ggaW96.jpg)

Glory to god, another daughter! Surely a reward for my prompt response to his call and my mighty efforts to bring the heretics to see the light. Still I pray for a son, but I know he shall reward me when the time is right. He has seen fit to provide for me before and I know that it is his will and will provide for me in the end.

[**16 Apr 1166**](http://i.imgur.com/vBzIeNU.jpg) 

Alright, my turn in charge of House af Reddit.  My last two predecessors really made a mess of things – so let’s right this ship.  

I nominate my sister as my heir and decide to fire my old chancellor who was doing an atrocious job.  His replacement is incredible, so hopefully we can fabricate some claims.  I’m still a child so I get to pick who gets to educate me, which doesn't seem like that effective of an education model, but regardless...I choose a courtier with huge skill in diplomatic relations. He’s also possessed, so hopefully that doesn't bite me in the ass. 

**21 Dec 1167**

I am now Irish – continuing the fine tradition of my family seemingly changing cultures every fortnight.  Norwegian, Scottish, Breton, and now Irish.  Also I have been commissioning the building of improvements in many of my holdings starting with the castle towns.

**27 Jul 1170**

The King of Brittany has declared war for Wales.  It wouldn't be all that big of a deal, but they are allied with the HRE...which suddenly makes it a very big deal.

**6 Feb 1171** 

I have usurped the kingdom of Ireland.  If I am going to lose Wales, which I am, I might as well still be king of something. I tried assassinating my aunt whose claim the Bretons are trying to push but I failed. Even worse they sent an assassin for retribution and I was maimed.

**27 Apr 1171** 

Wales and Glamorgan have been lost in this war.

**11 Sept 1171** 

I have decided to marry my sister and heir to the Holy Roman Emperor, hopefully he doesn’t try to push her claim for my throne.

**10 Feb 1173** 

My regency is over and I have become so skilled in diplomacy that I am a Grey Eminence. I have married Princess Helene of the Byzantine Empire just in case the HRE decides to push my sister's claim. Besides it can't hurt to be allied to both Romes.

**11 May 1173** 

I have invited Robert de Normandie to my court as he has a claim to the Duchy of Munster which is currently held by the old king of Ireland. I plan on building a barony and giving it to Robert then press his claim to Munster.

**11 Aug 1173** 

My sister has died and I am no longer allied with the HRE.

**4 Nov 1173** 

My wife is pregnant.

**5 June 1174** 

I have a son and named him Patrick. 

**2 Jan 1176** 

I am now in an embargo war with the Duke of Munster, which is frustrating. Unfortunately The Basillisa of the Eastern Roman Empire will not assist me. Better not ask her for assistance and save her strength for something more dire.

**13 Jun 1176** 

I have surrendered. They were simply too much for me.

**26 Oct 1177** 

I am now known as the fat. Lovely.  I decide to try and get Medium Crown authority but the votes are slightly short.

**5 March 1178** 

I now have a daughter I have named her Helene after her mother. Fortunately his Imperialness the Holy Roman Emperor has yet to be married I suggested a betrothal to my newborn daughter and he accepted.

**2 Feb 1179** 

Medium Crown authority has finally been approved. 

**7 Mar 1179** 

I have also gotten small Feudal tax through. Should help with my war chest.

**13 July 1179** 

I have a new son I have named Peter, he is a genius! I immediately nominate him to succeed me so that I can start doing something positive for this family.

**10 Aug 1180** 

My mother Helen has passed away.  May she rest in peace.

**16 Jan 1181** 

My old wound finally caught up to me. Never should have tried to assassinate my aunt a decade ago.  I have passed on to the next life.

1359385543.0,31,self.CrusaderKings,17filz,A lazy guide to making a republic in CK2 ,wrrrry,36,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/17filz/a_lazy_guide_to_making_a_republic_in_ck2/,"I'm aware most of you probably have never tried to mod this game, and just looking at it the files might make it seem insurmountable.

However I also know a lot of you would probably like to create a different republic and play as them, instead of the few that exist in the main game, so I've made a guide I hope is easy enough to digest to create your own republic out of what already exists in game.



**Step 1. Find Your Mark**

Let's look for where you want your republic to be, and when you want it to be. It must be at least a Duke or higher, and have coastal provinces with cities (This excludes anything on the Red/Arabian, Caspian and Aral Seas sorry).

I will be following this with an example, I will make my republic in the Duchy of Holland, on the first start date of 15th September 1066.

We will need the Mark's Character details. Look for who owns the desired duchy/kingdom in the game and write down their first name and birthday (you can see this by hovering over their age). In this instance I'm looking at Dirk, who was born on 1st January 1054.

We also need to note down the provinces he owns and the names of the cities in these provinces. Technically we only need to know the capital province, but it's probably better to have all their demense details written down. Click on each province owned by your Mark, and hover over the city picture to find out the names of the city in each respective province. Take these down with the province names.

In this instance, Dirk owns two provinces, Holland which has a city called Dordrecht, and Westfriesland which has the city of Hoorn.

So I've got all that written down now, the date i want is 15th September 1066, his name is Dirk - Birthday 1051.1.1 (ck2 parses dates as year.month.day). He has Duchy of Holland, and is count of Holland (City is Dordrecht), and Westfriesland (City is Hoorn).



**Step 2. Find our Mark's Details**

We'll need to find this guy (no gals allowed as Republics unfortunately due to paradox's game design) in the game files to get some information. Find your Crusader Kings 2 folder (where you installed it, or in Steam/steamapps/common/Crusader Kings 2), and from there go to the history/characters folder.

This folder is split between cultures/regions so you'll need to find which one is most relevant to your Mark. In this case I know Dirk is in the Duchy of Holland, so would be in the dutch.txt file.

In the relevant file we want to search for our Mark. There will probably be multiple people with the same first name, so we'll want to find the guy that has both the correct name and Birthday.

Once we've found them in the files, we want several things that are listed in their character info.

The Character ID will be the open bracket just above his name. For Dirk, this is ""106520 = {"", so 106520 is Dirk's character ID.

The Dynasty ID is just below, marked by dynasty=. For Dirk this is dynasty=432, so his dynasty ID is 432.

We will also need the characters culture and religion which like dynasty are just below the name. For Dirk this is culture of ""dutch"" and religion of ""catholic"". These are CASE SENSITIVE so don't write it down as Dutch/Catholic.

So Dirk is Character number 106520, and of dynasty 432 in the game files, he is culture ""dutch"" and religion ""catholic""



**Step 3. Makin' the mod**

We should have most of the information we need, now we're going to make a custom mod for this. We do NOT want to edit the main game files because then you would have to reinstall or revalidate files to multiplayer with other people or have the game back to normal.

Go to the folder - My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/

Create a folder in here called ""mod"" (without quotes). In this new /mod/ folder create a new text file called ""MyRepublic"" and a new folder called ""MyRepublic"".

In this text file we just made, put in the following lines and then save the file. We don't need to name it ""MyRepublic"", but if the name is changed we have to make sure all references to ""MyRepublic"" are all as the new name.

&gt;name = ""My Custom Republic Mod""

&gt;path = ""mod/MyRepublic""

After that we want to rename this text file to MyRepublic.mod, as in we're going to change the extension from .txt to .mod, if you cannot see file extensions [here's a helpful link](http://www.mediacollege.com/microsoft/windows/extension-change.html). We can still edit this file later if anything needs to be altered, just you'll need to right click it and specifically open it with notepad.



**Step 4. Creating the merchant house - Part 1/2**

In this new /mod/MyRepublic/ folder, we're going to need to create a new folder called ""common"" and inside this new folder make a new folder called ""landed_titles"". The underscore is important.

Create a new text file in this /landed_titles/ folder. You can call it anything except landed_titles.txt (that's the vanilla game file), so lets just call it ""my_new_republics.txt""

In this file we want to make an entry for this character's patrician house. The example I will use for Dirk is as below.

&gt; b_gerulfing = {

&gt; 	culture = dutch

&gt; 	religion = catholic

&gt; }

The b_xxxx name is the titular title of the patrician house. It can be named anything except one that already exists (eg. b_dandolo for the Dandolo family in Venice, or b_rome which exists as the temple barony within rome). It's usually good form to name it after the Dynasty of the character, but it can easily be b_misterpoopypants and it will work fine. In the game the Patrician House will always show up as the character's dynasty and not misterpoopypants.

Culture and religion are pretty obvious, and you should have both of those from when you were looking at the character earlier. Once again, these are case sensitive.



**Step 5. Creating the merchant house - Part 2/2**

Go back up to the /mod/MyRepublic/ folder, you will now need to create a new folder within that called ""history"" and within that folder make another subfolder called ""titles"".

We'll be making a new text file for the Patrician title we just created above. For the example of Dirk, it will be b_gerulfing.txt, you need to make sure both the entry you made in the previous step and this new text file are spelled exactly the same. These are case sensitive.

In that new text file we need to make an entry defining our new Patrician house. For our example of Dirk it will be the following:

&gt;1066.9.15={

&gt;	holding_dynasty = 432 

&gt;	liege=""d_holland""

&gt;	holder=106520

&gt;}

So I've put in the date that I wanted, Dirk's dynasty and character numbers as ""holding_dynasty ="" / ""holder ="" respectively. However we also need to include the title we're turning into a republic.

In this example, the game has the Duchy of Holland referenced in the code as d_holland, to find the title of your Mark, you'll need to look through the list of them in your Crusader Kings II/history/titles folder. It should be easy enough to find but let me know if you can't find it and I'll look it up for you.



**Step 6. Provinces Turning Castles into Cities**

In the /mod/MyRepublic/history/ folder, we need to make a new folder called ""provinces"".

We need to head back to the actual CK2 folder with all the game files now, and go to Crusder Kings II/history/provinces, and search the folder for the provinces our Mark owned. For Dirk, this was Holland and Westfriesland, which are ""80 - Holland.txt"" and ""81 - Westfriesland.txt"" respectively.
If you can't seem to find yours don't panic, sometimes they're named differently in the game than in the files, search for a province next to it and look around that file, the order of provinces isn't random so provinces are grouped up by general area in this folder. If you're really having trouble just ask me and I'll find out for you.

We're going to copy the files of all these provinces and paste them in this new mod/MyRepublic/history/provinces folder we just made. For Dirk this is ""80 - Holland.txt"" and ""81 - Westfriesland.txt""

When I open up ""80 - Holland.txt"" I can see the line: b_dordrecht = city. If we remember back, Dordrecht was the name of the city that existed in the province of Holland, so I'm going to go down the file and insert the line:

&gt; 1066.9.15 = { capital = b_dordrecht }

When I searched before, I wanted to have this republic on September 15th 1066 (remember that the game treats dates as year.month.day), and we're changing it so this county's primary holding is now the city instead of the castle/temple.

You do not need to do this for all your provinces, but you will need to for your Mark's capital at the minimum. I decided Dirk's second province should also have the city has the primary holding. So for Westfriesland I had to put in: 1066.9.15 = { capital =  b_hoorn }


**Step 7. Test it.**

Now is the moment of truth, assuming you've entered all the things above correctly, it should now be a mod you can play. Use the Game Launcher and tick the mod's checkbox. Once in game you'll need to select the republic manually in the game as if it was a count, as it's not listed in the republic. I could add that step in this but I'm trying to make this as small a guide as possible, so ask me in comments if you're interested in that step.

If you're having issues, I've uploaded the mod for [Dirk's Dutch Republic](http://www.filedropper.com/mydutchrepublic) if you needed to see how it all fitted together.



**Notes:**

This was the quickest and easiest way I thought to show you all how to make a republic in the existing map, all we've done in this guide is created the Doge. The other patricians will automatically be generated once you start playing as this character.

You will be able to use the character designer on this person if the original character is not to your tastes.


Ask away if you wanted anything else or had any further changes you wanted to know how to make. Be aware that paradox modding can be rewarding, but also difficult and infuriating as one wrong letter or bracket can be difficult to find and make you shit bricks when you finally find out what is wrong. Don't be afraid to ask for help cause someone probably can.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,,True,t3_17filz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/17filz/a_lazy_guide_to_making_a_republic_in_ck2/,

Rather than submit a series of links I thought it would be better to just make a text post that I can add to as more of these videos come online.  This is a 12x playback of my ""Hungry Hungary"" series, each video consisting of 10 slower videos combined together.  All audio was stripped and replaced with the beautiful in game CK2 music.  All DLC is owned so you will hear the entire sound-track for the game over the course of the series.

So far there are a few episodes live:

There are a variety of playstyles on my channel, many of which tend toward world conquest.  Look for the ones specifically described as ""Role play"" if you do not want to see endless war, but if you want help with vassal management and expansion then the world conquest series are for you!

That's ~~seventeen~~, no, eighteen — I forgot to expand Énna mac Diarmait's line, and he has a granddaughter — eighteen daughters across two generations. I managed to set up some matrilineal marriages to keep the dynasty going a little bit, but still no sons. The *only* son we've managed to produce is Steffen, but he was sired by some Welsh cad and is not of our line.

I figure the odds of this happening by chance are somewhere past 200,000:1. What's the deal? Is this some sort of genetic defect you can get? Or a conspiracy of midwives?

I also can't help but note that the last son fathered by anyone in House Ua Cheinnselaig was a bastard. And given his name, we never let him forget it. King Murchad carried a torch for Bastart's mother for much of his life, although he later went celibate and married her off to some Cilician courtier to try and remove the temptation.

Perhaps she carried a grudge. Might she have hired some sort of gypsy to put a curse on the entire House Ua Cheinnselaig? That would be some strong magic indeed.

***

[3 dec 1309](http://i.imgur.com/qYBKP4I.jpg) 

Well, here I  am, a six year old emperor. My dear late father has seen fit to betroth me to some 3-year old Russian daughter of a nobody, as well as handing out all the kingdom titles in the empire. At least the kings of Anatolia and Armenia seem content with their lot in life, but the heretic King of England is pretty pissed. I promptly proceed to revoke his title and hand it out to someone more suitable, starting a civil war that will last 8 years.

[1 jan  1310](http://i.imgur.com/A0zFobT.jpg) 

I’ve inherited a nice war for a single county against the Syrian Sultanate, which the Fatamids have decided to join. God help me. Luckily they’ll soon fall into a succession crisis.

[26 jan 1310](http://i.imgur.com/8KWAASj.jpg) 

Our beloved half-sister has married the heir to the kingdom of Cyprus. Great, as if we didn’t already have enough financial troubles…

[17 dec 1310](http://i.imgur.com/FaE8zPx.jpg) 

The king of Jerusalem thoroughly hated my guts, enough reason for imprisonment in my opinion. He didn’t seem to think so but I got him in the end. Now I shall revoke his measly kingdom as punishment for his sinful ways.

14 april 1311 

The time has come to reclaim my ancestral homelands, I have declared war on Norway and Sweden.

[2 aug 1311](http://i.imgur.com/a7VkMWM.jpg)

Pisa looks like a ripe fruit for the picking.

[17 sep 1312](http://i.imgur.com/QilPWB6.jpg) 

I have contracted and been cured from slow fewer on the same day.  Must be my royal blood.

[20 nov 1312](http://i.imgur.com/LZdsMjK.jpg)

I seem to have pushed the wrong claim. Some fellow named Torgeir Amundsson is now the King while the lazy nitwit who’s claim I meant to press is still hanging out in Tortosa. At least my sister managed to find her way to the throne of Sweden like she was supposed to.

[9 feb 1317](http://i.imgur.com/zCY9I4w.jpg) 

My first independence war! It feels like my initiation into the af Reddit family.

[25 dec 1318](http://i.imgur.com/ELbQpWu.jpg) 

My regency has ended! And on such a symbolic day no less. Surely this must be a sign of good things to come. Hopefully they don’t require any decent stats.

[4 march 1320](http://i.imgur.com/kvfKmWs.jpg) 

Somehow an Yngling has found his way back to the throne of Norway. At least he’s my vassal.

[25 aug 1320](http://i.imgur.com/wDsHt9J.jpg) 

Why it seems the pretender Kaiser bears a striking resemblance to me. I’m marrying my sister to him.

25 june 1321 

My dearest brother isnow the King of Portugal.

[24 aug 1328](http://i.imgur.com/X0nyQ5V.jpg) 

Pisa once again presents its ripe offerings.

[1 oct 1329](http://i.imgur.com/cCPDOya.jpg) 

The Queen of Wales has married the King of Ireland. Jerusalem and Georgia have also been consolidated. This can’t be good…

[1 sep 1335](http://i.imgur.com/whI27uK.jpg) 

The time has come for the Egyptians to the south to embrace Catholicism. Their  sultanate is no more.

[6 sep 1341](http://i.imgur.com/FcdG3gS.jpg) 

Kaiser Ludwig V has converted to some heresy and the fraudulent roman empire is going up in flames. I have made use of this opportunity to claim Flanders.

[8 march 1342](http://i.imgur.com/VMwM0ge.jpg) 

Word has reached me that I have pissed off the people of some far away land. Well, surely nothing will come of it…

[27 march 1342](http://i.imgur.com/2s3fFic.jpg)

a! After having fired many pathetic chancellors and decades of waiting I have finally managed to convince the world of my rightful claim on Pisa. Those greedy bastards with their funny hats will have to relinquish their grasp on all those nice tradeposts of theirs now.

[15 july 1345](http://i.imgur.com/es6Xw1L.jpg) 

Europe has going up in flames. Ludwig’s blasphemous practices have infuriated pope, he has called for a crusade on Germany.  Lackey, grab my armour!  

[8 jan 1349](http://i.imgur.com/hj32jZ7.jpg)

I have lost interest in reigning over this empire. My son has reached sixteen and it is time for him to take over. Maybe that Malinese fellow can give me a hand…

This game is insane.  Coming from a huge Total War fan, this game is so much more in depth.  The combat sucks, but everything else makes up for it.

Within 3 hours of starting the game, I effectively turned the county of Leinster into the Kingdom of Ireland.  I married my heir to the Princess of Scotland and by some fluke she becomes the ruling Queen.  My heir becomes the Prince Consort.

I send my Duke (not yet kingdom of Ireland, can't afford it) to fight off his wife's enemies in Scotland, thus consolidating her power.  He dies in combat leaving the heir to the throne of Scotland as my Duke.  

What do I do next?  Have him assassinate his own mother at the age of 6.  Ireland and Scotland combine to become one huge united Celtic Kingdom.

The Empire of Britannia is on the brink of collapse.

The young Emperor Finn I is desperately looking for a way to keep his Family's nation together.

16 year old Finn was never born to be Emperor. It's something his older brother Daniel wanted. But, Daniel's death, along with the death of his father, the Ill-ruler, Connor II, the responsibility was thrown at him.

In this time of uncertainty, Finn looked to the past. More specifically, the time of the Blood Wars.

Both Finn and Daniel would often listen to their father tell them about the heroics of their ancestors. Connor would often speak highly of the man who ended the Blood Wars, their Great Uncle, Jon, who died at age 28 and left the throne to their grandfather.

Finn would later decide to read more about the Blood War. And search for the way to hold his Empire together in the books of old...


About 100 years prior the Empire went through a series of grabs for power which has been grimly called the Great Blood War because the family members fighting, and just how much blood was spilt. This era is what started the inevitable decline of the Empire.

The beginning years of the era saw massive rebellions resulting in the SECOND EMPEROR, Emperor Dúnchad, being deposed. Still the King of Ireland, not all was lost. But for Dúnchad, the Throne would never again be his.

His son, King Gabrán I, resolved to recapture the throne which was rightfully his. A throne, now held by his younger brother, Aèd.

Gabrán would spend the majority of his life preparing for a war he would have no part in, for his brother, fearing his growing piwer, had Gabrán excommunicated and subsequently imprisoned, where Gabrán would die at age 32.

His son, now King Lukas the Noble, would continue his father's work and, with assistance from the other Kings, would lead a massive rebellion against the granddaughter of Aéd, Empress Dervorgilla I. Who, at the time her reign began, was only 5 years old.

By the time of this war, circa 990, Britannia had seen so much continuous blood shed it was ready to fall apart at the seams. But, by War's end, Lukas stood victorious over the Usurpers who dared call themselves Royalty. At age 26, Lukas was crowned Emperor Lukas the Noble.

The Reign of Emperor Lukas the Noble was a much welcomed reign of peace and prosperity, in sharp contrast to the chaos that gripped the land less then 5 years ago.

But, it was not to be the end of the Blood Wars, as Lukas would die peacefully in his sleep on July 20, 1027 at age 56. With his death his son, Iacob, rose HIS flag in rebellion. Claiming the throne as his and fought against his brother, the inept Emperor Carlus I.

Carlus was not the great leader his father was. And he shared the same fate his grandfather did and lost the throne his father fought so hard to retrieve.

King Carlus didn't seem to mind, however. And made no attempt at reclaiming what he had lost. The remainder of his life would see tje throne be usurped by many more who would call themselves Emperor, including the now fully grown Empress Dervorgilla I, who would reclaim her throne and passed the throne to Muirchertach I, who, within a year of his reign, would be assassinated by his cousin, the now Emperor Hoël I(it says III but he was the first Hoël on the throne)

Hoël's reign was immediately challenged by the rightful Emperor, King Jon of Ireland. Whose victory would mark the end of the Blood Wars, although Jon, and his daughter and only heir, would both die young and leave the throne to Emperor Carlus II the Handsome, father to the Ill-Ruler.

This expansion gave me a shit ton to do after kind of feeling like I did all I could do in CKII. There's always a new challenge with this expansion - from re-taking all the counties you lost on gavelkind, to uniting kingdoms, to finally reforming religion only for warfare with other pagans to become incredibly harder.

**The diary of King Nadbor 'the Forlorn' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/ArticPanzerWolf*


[**31 January, 1265**](http://i.imgur.com/7jea5V8.jpg)
 

I have inherited the Kingdom of Syria from my father.  During my studies I learned the history of the house d’Isigny, that we came from Normandy in France.
 

While it is true that my great house once ruled much of the lands around me, our recent history has been a tragic one.  I cannot sit idly by and let the remainder of my family be slaughtered by these heathens. Today I make plans to leave this god-forsaken place and return to our homeland of France - so I arranged a betrothal with the Duchess of Bourbon.  I feel it is only there that we can be safe.
 

 

[**1 February, 1265**](http://i.imgur.com/aT9e1kQ.jpg)
 

I sent a large gift to the Khan in hopes that it will by me some time.  While it pains me to hand so much gold to those who do not follow the LORD I fear I have no choice.
 

 

[**13 February, 1265**](http://i.imgur.com/2RxPgds.jpg)
 

I was to study under the Bishop Osmond, as his knowledge of religious matters is quite impressive, and I wish to learn more.
 

 

[**14 February, 1265**](http://i.imgur.com/AV2FrPR.jpg)
 

Great news! The fair Duchess of Bourbon has agreed to a betrothal.  Soon we will be able to regain land in France.  Let us hope the godless armies that surround us can continue to be bought off with shiny trinkets.
 

 

**1 March, 1265**
 

A large revolt started in Bira today, over 3000 strong.  I will have to hire some more swords to put this down.
 

 

[**13 March, 1265**](http://i.imgur.com/ns2FwsN.jpg)
 

The Knights Templar ask to build a new castle in Acre, I happily oblige.  This also gives me some more of the Pope's favor.
 

 

[**15 November, 1266**](http://i.imgur.com/6Jg9Uht.jpg)
 

Today I have become a man.  I am finally able to start changing some of the very harsh laws that are on the books, especially those aimed at the church, which I have grown fond of.
 

 
[**5 December, 1266**](http://i.imgur.com/s9w7TC2.jpg)
 

I married the lovely duchess Rosa.  My house is one step closer to returning to France.  I will begin straightaway trying to consummate this marriage and produce an heir.
 

 

[**5 April, 1286**](http://i.imgur.com/gk6hwOK.jpg)
 

Still working on getting my new wife pregnant, we both seem to be busy with our respective positions.  In the meantime I have been plotting the removal of a rather pesky Orthodox Mayor.  It turns out he is quite unpopular.  Those who do not follow the one true religion deserve death.
 

 

[**5 August, 1268**](http://i.imgur.com/BPaNynl.jpg)
 

Successfully dispatched the Mayor, I have been having a summer fair in celebration!
 

 

[**17 August, 1268**](http://i.imgur.com/wD3FXPG.jpg)
 

The Mongol threat continues to spread West, now Vienna! What next?
 

 

[**8 October, 1268**](http://i.imgur.com/DUKpnnU.jpg)
 

I have received word that my wife is with child, praise the LORD!
 

 

[**9 May, 1269**](http://i.imgur.com/mcmTJqW.jpg)
 

The LORD has delivered to me a healthy daughter; she will be named Emelenine after my Norman Great-Grandmother.  I realize that I was raised in a Polish household; I would like all my children to get back to our Norman roots.
 

 

[**1 December, 1269**](http://i.imgur.com/9T6Iyrc.jpg)
 

Curses! The Khan has decided to declare war on me.
 

It only took two attempts to have the heathen Kahn murdered. I was hoping to start an internal conflict due to rumors that his son and heir is a sodomite.
 

 

[**26 January, 1270**](http://i.imgur.com/L8TL25q.jpg)
 

I have raised a force and will try to attack the smaller segments of the Kahn's army before they can combine.
 

 

[**3 May, 1270**](http://i.imgur.com/mALX0dy.jpg)
 

My attempts proved futile, I was no match for these damn pagans, and I must surrender.
 

 

[**19 July, 1270**](http://i.imgur.com/OPNDpmK.jpg)
 

A little too late, but a full blown succession crisis is happening with the Ilkahnate.  Perhaps I can try to make the best of this.
 

 

[**1 August, 1270**](http://i.imgur.com/XSA558b.jpg)
 

An infidel in my court? I think NOT!
 

 
[**24 March, 1274**](http://i.imgur.com/Yep0PLE.jpg)
 

I was able to take back the lands of Damascus, but it feels like a lost cause.  There is nothing left here for my Norman clan; I still hope to get a male heir to the duchy of Bourbon.
 

 

[**27 January, 1275**](http://i.imgur.com/j97A4iE.jpg)
 

One of my courtiers attempted to woo me with carnal pleasures, but I will remain faithful to my wife in the eyes of the LORD.
 

 

[**9 May, 1275**](http://i.imgur.com/2VYz3Ys.jpg)
 

God bless, my wife has given birth to a son, and his name will be Henry. I wanted a strong Norman name for my son. I have prayed every night for this; I truly feel that the LORD has listened to my plea.
 

 

[**24 October, 1275**](http://i.imgur.com/6Xyq46c.jpg)
 

I was too slow to put down a rebellion in Damascus and I will lose it to the Egyptian Sultanate, damn them!  It is clear that our time in this land is running out, I must make haste to get my son and family back to France where we belong.
 

 

[**2 May, 1275**](http://i.imgur.com/swd5F1S.jpg)
 

Because of my love of holy literature I have become quite the scholar, I continue to study the roots of my house in hopes that I can have my children learn of their past.
 

 

[**15 September, 1276**](http://i.imgur.com/VmNLyqw.jpg)
 

The Egyptians have declared war on me, this is NOT good.  I will pray that someone will help me in this fight.
 

 

[**16 November, 1276**](http://i.imgur.com/KKp2lFT.jpg)
 

The Kaiser and other fellow Catholics are coming to my aide; we will need GOD's full blessing to fight back these Muslims!  But I have a rising fear in my gut that even with this force we are no match for the Egyptians.  If I lose Acre I will have no land and my house will fade into nothingness.  I must think of a way to get out of this, to keep the d’Isigny name going!
 

 

[**9 March, 1277**](http://i.imgur.com/8ghWhyj.jpg)
 

I ... I have done a terrible thing.  To insure that my son would inherit land in France I had my wife murdered.  It was truly the hardest decision I have ever had to make.  It goes against ever moral fiber in my body.  But it must be done to insure the future of my dynasty.  I know that God can forgive me but I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself for what I have done.
 

 
[**11 August, 1277**](http://i.imgur.com/oeYrDyJ.jpg)
 

The Egyptians have crushed all the remains of the Kingdom of Syria.  I have disgraced my house by losing the crown, and I have disgraced my LORD by having my own wife and mother of my children murdered in cold blood.  The hope of our entire house is on the shoulders of my 2 year old son Henry, Duke of Bourbon.  Godspeed Henry.
 


[**12 August, 1277**](http://i.imgur.com/VLuV0LO.jpg)
 

Now without title, I ask my Son’s Regent if I may give the remaining years of my life to the church.  I hope that through intense prayer and seclusion I can eventually come to terms with what I have done.

Hey guys, /u/ursa-minor-88 here. As you know, I promised you earlier that I would transcribe the text of that museum display I was looking at the other day on [**King Talbot the Forgettable**](http://i.imgur.com/DMBv9u5.jpg). Unfortunately I just can't make the time to do it anymore. I'm too busy with end of term papers. But I figured I owed you guys something, so I went onto JSTOR to see if there was anything useful I could give you instead. This article looked promising.. it seems to be about Talbot. Sorry to let you down, guys, but there's not a lot on him.. this was the best I could find.

""...If you will permit me, gentlemen, I would like to update you on the findings of our dig in the catacombs of the Maison de Souris. This portion of my presentation is not officially on script, so forgive me - as I know you so often do - for any incoherence that may manifest itself in my speech. 

As you'll recall, His Majesty's Government granted our Archaeological Department exclusive access to sections of the palace vaults which have remained untouched for up to nine hundred years. As yet there are no signs of the Frieze of the Jugglers - yes, I know, many of you were hoping for that - but we do have a few minor artifacts from the early and pre-Norman periods, including a small clutch of written documents that appear to have been deliberately buried. We've yet to examine all of the papers but it appears that they originate from the court of Talbot the Forgettable.

Now, now, no need to laugh. Talbot kept the kingdom together after Serlo passed and was at the very least a competent administrator. We may know little about him beyond his drunkenness and habitual mental difficulties, but there's enough evidence to suggest that he played a positive role.

Syria at this time was in a precarious position. Our forebears were trapped between Persia in the east, Egypt in the west, and Islamic Abyssinia in the south. Fortunately, both Persia and Egypt had experienced regime changes around this time - the Hizirid dynasty seizing Persia in 1164 and the ad-Daula family taking Egypt in 1154. Whether the peace seen under Talbot's reign can be attributed to his statesmanship or to the instabilities inflicted upon his enemies by chance are unknown.

[**We know that at the coronation of Henry I that the Maison de Souris looked something like this**](http://imgur.com/a/OzgFK). Much of that construction was new at the time; Talbot commissioned a number of building works during his brief reign at Farkale. In all we can probably estimate that there were about thirty nobles in residence at the Maison de Souris at the time of his death in addition to approximately fifteen-hundred professional soldiers and guards.

We also know that Talbot had maintained tied with the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of the Greeks. His late sister, Agnes, had been wed to Constantine XI, and his own bastard daughter, the lowborn Stephanie, had been wed patrilineally to Prince Staurkios, a son of Leon the Great. And although enmity existed between them over a claim to the Syrian throne, Talbot was still joined to the Duke of Burgundy through the latter's marriage to his sister, Adelheid. All of this is corroborated with documents from later reigns.

Only four years before his death, Talbot seems to have clashed with his two landed brothers, Prince Serlo and Prince William of Tigris and Kermanshah respectively, as well as with Duke Herman the Wise of Mosul, husband to his eldest daughter, Constantine. The three of them remained locked in his dungeons until the day that he died.

Talbot, like his father, hand-picked the tutors for his Armenian relatives, such that by the time that he died more half of the living members of those branches of the family were Norman.

...alright, I'll admit it, he was dreadfully dull. We can all have a laugh. But if our diggers find anything else related to Talbot - a chronicle, perhaps, or an inscription, or some sort of marketable art - you'll be sure to hear about it in one of our circulations...[**in the meantime, here is his obituary picture.**](http://i.imgur.com/b47miVc.jpg)""

Well, I see my predecessors have taken up writing in personal journals. I find the whole idea stupid, but I might as well carry on the tradition lest anyone will read this thing. 

Anyways, It seems the King of Sweden does not like me. The bastard had me excommunicated. I really do not see why though. What could he possibly have to gain from it?

[8 July, 1282](http://i.imgur.com/KRg4YG5.jpg)

Here I am writing again in this confounded journal. I ""repented my sins"" just because everyone hates me if not. It cost a pretty coin as well. 

[2 June, 1285](http://i.imgur.com/kRAWVKf.jpg)

I forgot about this journal. I can never seem to find it when I want to write in it. I found it today when I was banging by head against the wall after I heard the news that 3/4 of my empire had revolted in favor of my brother. It fell from the ledge above and now here I am writing in it again.

A short description of what has happened since the last entry. I decided to purge my empire of undesirables. Those who qualify for this esteemed distinction are people who do not like or are orthodox. I have found a way to be rid of these people Thanks to my bureaucrats I can revoke Ducal titles at my whim. It is jolly good fun really. 

Anyways, I must kill my brother. That is the only way to keep me in power.

[10 June, 1286](http://i.imgur.com/r5qXCu5.jpg)

My dear brother has died in a tragic accident. How terrible.

Oh, cruel fate! First my brother, and now my dear sister! What is with my family that makes them so... so... stupid! Now she may have to meet the reaper.

My sister has met her end. Not by my hand, mind you, but at the hands of those who specialize in solving problems. Tis a terrible turn of fate for my family.

My illegitimate son. Only my love and I know this. My dear brother thinks it is his. Fool. I shall do what I can for him, as he may die due to his position.

I have finally had a son after 8 daughters and 3 wives. Praise be God!

[12 June, 1305](http://i.imgur.com/olr9waH.jpg)

So much death for so little gain. Why can this not be easier? Why do they have to fight me so? All I want is what is rightfully mine...

[12 December, 1307](http://i.imgur.com/pYLwgRn.jpg)

My son has sent an assassin after me. It is justified, sadly. Why did he have to marry that old woman? She was almost barren at the time he married her, but now she definitively is, as she is dead. Hopefully he marries some young tart.

[3 December, 1309](http://i.imgur.com/Yg7GS2p.jpg)

A couple of weeks ago I remember some people being interested in a West African success story, so here I am. I'm quite bad at thinking of taking screenshots when important stuff happens, so there won't be many, sorry. Also please forgive my english, as it is not my mother tongue.

First, some words regarding the West Africans. Gameplay-wise, they exist on a spectrum somewhere between the norse pagans and a good old-fashioned Christian kingdom. Like other pagans, they have a defensive attrition bonus, can raid, and can use conquest and subjugation CBs but no holy war. Unlike other pagans, raising levies will upset vassals, short reign penalties are normal and you have access to ultimogeniture succession laws to keep your demesne together. Oh, and the Mandé cultural retinue is pretty amazing. It's a combination of light infantry and archers, with bonuses to light infantry defense. They're skirmishers so they work amazingly well in sieges, and each unit only costs 1 towards the retinue cap so you can have a shit-ton of them.

Geographically, It can't really get any worse. You're completely landlocked (good luck using that raiding ability without boats), separated from the outside world by large swathes of desert, surrounded by muslims, and there is essentially no West African pagan on the map outside of Mali. So once you've united that kingdom, you're on your own. No marriage with infidels means no alliances and no land gain through inheritance. Good luck taking on the muslim hordes at your door.

So our tale begins in 867, in the province of Songhay, with the Zuwa dynasty. My larger neighbour Ghana quickly forms the kingdom of Mali and makes me swear fealty, forcing me to spend the next hundred years or so building support inside the kingdom. Once I control every single province in the realm except for the queen's own county, I make my move: start a faction for independence (which is promptly granted without a fight), then use my subjugation CB against the queen. She stands no chance, and the Zuwa become rulers of Mali. At this point we're in ~960, and it's time to break free from subsaharan Africa...

... Which won't happen until about 300 years later. Turns out I don't stand any chance against the sultanate of Mauretania in a direct offense. First they try invade me, but I'm able to repel them despite their much larger numbers. Thank the ancestors for West African paganism being a defensive religion and gaining bonuses to garrison size and unit defense inside own territory. I'm able to get them to waste troops on direct assaults on my holdings, then manage to get them to attack my army across a river. They outnumber me 2-to-1, but with all these bonuses I win the fight and pursue them until I can force a white peace.

However I still can't break out of Mali unless Mauretania is having a crisis, so I bide my time... And that's about when the Arabian Empire decides to invade Mauretania. From this point onwards, my chancellor in improving relations with the sunni caliph 24/7; fighting defensively might have worked against the Idrisids, but won't do shit against the Arabs. 

So, I'm stuck with waiting for major successions crises before I can expand. And then again, I can only use my conquest CB, so it's one county at a time. If I'm lucky and several neighbouring counts go independent at one time, I can maybe get 2 counties during one Arabian crisis. Which happens every decade or so. So the next few centuries are spent playing the waiting game, very slowly but steadily taking over Mauretania and hoping the Caliph doesn't decide to retaliate. He never does. My chancellor is a pro.

Around that time, I realize that there is, in fact, one West African county outside of Mali. The Canarias islands are apparently populated by fellow pagans, and they've been left alone since 867. Conveniently enough, they're led by a countess whom I promptly marry. Also conveniently enough, she can't build up tech, so she amassed an *enormous* fortune she can't spend. Further, having the islands fall into my demesne means I'll *finally* be able to build ships and raid properly.

And that's pretty much the gist of it went. The hardest part at least. I conquered counties in a straight line across the West African holy sites, then reformed the religion once I had all five, [in 1273](http://imgur.com/WgON9PX.jpg). Being able to holy war considerably sped up my expansion from then on. Also, the Arabs had been kicked out of most of Mauretania so I didn't have to be afraid of them quite as much. Andalusia, the second major Sunni power in the area had just been reduced to practically nothing by a successful crusade. Slow but steady blobbing ensued until I held all of Africa, Iberia, and Sicily.

Might as well post the endgame maps and some further comments:

[Maps](http://imgur.com/a/h2WTJ)

Other highlights: 

I briefly had a [white Mansa of Mali](http://i.imgur.com/64vgImC.jpg). A Frankish adventurer tried to take Canarias and was repelled. I kept his wife and daughters as concubines, which led to the aforementioned white Mansa. Here's another picture of him [looking serious with a silly feather hat.](http://i.imgur.com/HDuzCbk.jpg)

Counterintuitively, kidnapping muslim women and keeping then in your dungeon for a decade before forcing them into a life on concubinage makes muslim leaders like you more. Well, assuming she's a Sayyid, which will make her sons Mirzas. I haven't yet found a way to become a Sayyid myself. At least, it certainly isn't possible through concubines.

The concubinage system leads to some [pretty](http://i.imgur.com/THE2bat.jpg) [fucking](http://i.imgur.com/K6boQbf.jpg) [sad](http://i.imgur.com/UAW1m2t.jpg) [situations](http://i.imgur.com/OPcR2sz.jpg). Seriously, this is twisted.

I was counting on the mongols to carve a path of destruction through the Arabian empire and make things easier for me. So *of course* they didn't. The Ilkhanate went north into Cumania instead of south into Persia. Then the Golden Horde just kicked their ass into irrelevance. [And then they went full retard.](http://i.imgur.com/Xhludzx.jpg)

Gangs and Syndicates are often played out like a Feudal System (Bosses on Top with various people at the bottom doing all the real work), provinces would just become city blocks, cities and churches would become storefronts/factories/warehouses that could house legal and illegal businesses.

All the intrigue would stay, make things more difficult maybe. The pace of the game would obviously slow down and new features would be needed to keep the game exciting. Republics and Horde civs can also be tweaked to show different kinds of gangs.

Raddillon, William. Trans. Trond af Reddit. **The Military History of the Normans**. Brussels: Writer's Guild, 1929.

... Let us turn now to the last of the great Norman families that swept the Medieval world, that of the House of d'Isigny. Unlike the earlier Norman Invasions of Italia and Britannia, the d'Isigny's, though being forced from their ancestral homes in Syria to Francia, and finally to Sicily, never went extinct, unlike the afromentioned de Hauteville, and never lost power, again unlike the House de Normandie. Indeed it became a common rumor in European courts of the time to speak of the d'Isigny vault, where it was said the house kept stored immense riches from far-flung Syria which the family valued above all else, even the blood of their own line. Of course such circulations have long tarnished the name of d'Isigny, and so it is the charge of modern historians to attempt to reclaim the past and offer a better understanding of this often neglected royal family. To do so we must turn to a different set of primary documents on which to draw from; the d'Isigny royal archieves, discovered just over a decade ago by *West et. al*, which shine new light on...

... By the dawn of the 15th century the House d'Isigny however was not what it once was. Let us turn now to the reign of [King Eustache 'the Hypocrite'](http://i.imgur.com/p8JMPcD.jpg)...

**20th October, 1402**

Today Father died, and the lords of the realm have named me King of Greece. [King of a patchwork kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/1zUYMFH.png), more like; the realm is divided into far-flung distant lands and islands. I must begin to consolidate our family's fortune if we are to survive. First I have granted both the County of La Marche, Duchy of Bourbon, &amp; independence from the crown to Niketas, a distant cousin through our ancestral father King Torf the Unyielding, who has a shaky claim to the Duchy of Potiu through his wife, Èmelenine. We cannot afford to be brought into another conflict in Francia, and I particularly do not wish to be drawn into the [civil war](http://i.imgur.com/SEuAMrU.jpg) between [my dear cousin Lambert](http://i.imgur.com/JcjYWOq.jpg), Emperor of Francia, and his [far-flung Capetian cousin Thiébaut II](http://i.imgur.com/XYTt29u.jpg), King of France. Next I awarded the County of Bari &amp; my own Duchy of Benevento to Torgil, a proper Norman Theologian much like myself.

I then decided to revoke the Duchy of Cynecia from Duke Vincentello, who was imprisoned during my Father's reign and has remained in the dungeons for some two decades now. His son-and-heir, [Count Guy of Tobruk](http://i.imgur.com/LHro9aA.jpg), is married to Countess Carola of Foggia, who is in turn as well the Heiress of the Barony of Termoli. This makes the House d'Appiano almost as powerful as that of the royal d'Isigny within the realm. Though my feudal vassals will not appreciate this, I fear I have no choice. I shall hold on to his title until a more appropriate claimaint comes to my attention.

As well I reorganized my Father's small council. I have appointed Zacharias, the Greek scholar as my Chancellor; though he suffers from a sever stutter he is a renowned grey eminance. In the place of Simon de Butrint I have appointed the celibate warrior-poet Norman as my Marshal. Finally I have decided that I shall make Khubilai, the a mongolid shadow from the far east as my Spymaster. My father's court certainly is a diverse and varied place. My son Turold and Bishop Géraud my stay on as my Steward and Court Chaplin, respectively. I have sent them all new assignments, primarily on the isle of Sicily.

Finally, the is the matter of the inheritance. As as of now my unmarried son [Turold](http://i.imgur.com/Ck4gLdu.png) will succeed upon my demise, which, as my Father has shown me in this world of wickedness and sin can come about at any moment. Turold certainly would make for a better ruler than his younger brother, [Fraunk](http://i.imgur.com/JTI2578.png), who despises me, his own Father, in a way no good Christian child should. However the experinces of my own good-Father have taught me that alliances come easily in peace, and even being an upright Christian ruler will not mean that the Holy Father in Rome itself won't turn against you. My Father was a good Christian man, a Masterful Theologian who [could debate the finer points of the Good Book](http://i.imgur.com/DWLW6JX.jpg) with Pope Mark II, as well as Pope Callixtus II before him, and even old Pope Paul III before that, and yet he was still Excommunicated, and tarred with the vile rumor of Kinslaying. I refuse to believe such lies, my Father was a good man, a good man!

... I will allow Turold to marry for love, which is certainly a more Godly arrangement.

**21st October, 1402**

Though I have offered my assassitance to Lord Mayor Chiaffredo in placing the Duchy of Dioclea under my control he has refused. Worse yet, the war appears to be over with a *status quo ante bellum*. Though I myself have a claim to the Duchy that I could press, the whole experince has left me simply exhausted and [unable to even think of such a thing](http://i.imgur.com/Pm6k9VU.jpg).

**15th of November, 1402**

[I shall deal with you in time, Mogens..](http://i.imgur.com/f3uL8UF.jpg)

**22nd of November, 1402**

[Prince Antonio of Maurentania](http://i.imgur.com/eKfKaLO.jpg) has approached me claiming he would make a better Marshal than Norman. While this is technically true, I do not believe that Antonio has my best interest at heart, considering his own claims upon the Francia empire. I told him to wait; let us see how far his patience can reach.

**23rd of November, 1402**

Queen Anna of Denmark, wife of my youngest brother Simon, has sent a letter requesting a call to arms in her wars against her rebelling dukes. Unfortunetly I was forced to decline as Zacharias has informed me that Anna is quite likely to lose her throne in either contest against [Duke Svend or Duke Jens](http://i.imgur.com/AI7z9xn.jpg).

**14th of December, 1402**

My son seems quite taken with the young [Navar of Brindas](http://i.imgur.com/mVwCa3d.png), an Occitan Baroness from Lyon whose intellect matches his own and is being mentored by a gifted negotiator. Though she is somewhat young for him he is adamant that he will wait for her, and I dispatch Zacharias to contact the girl's father in order to arrange a betrothal.

**20th of December, 1402**

Baron Richard agreed to the betrothal. Turold is ecstatic; I only hope his merriment and appreciation can last through the next five years.

**12th of March, 1403**

I have designed to grant the Duchy of Cyrenaica to Count Adam of Benghazi, whose bastard son Hamelin is the most skilled warrior in the whole of the realm.

**1st of May, 1403**

Perhaps [this is a sign](http://i.imgur.com/h51vYEx.png) from the LORD that Duke Adam wasn't the correct choice? I certainly hope not.

I decided to decree a summer fair in Siracusa to take the peasants' minds off of the pestilance in our south.

**13th of July, 1403**

Well, [it was great fun while it lasted!](http://i.imgur.com/UhwUurz.jpg)

**_24th of August, 1403**

While her heart is in the right place, my dearest mother is [not acting like a proper Christian lady](http://i.imgur.com/KR7nVJN.jpg). I shall have to talk to her about this immediately.

**14th of September, 1403**

Thinking of my mother made me realize I had yet to visit with the other prisoners in the dungeons beyond now-Count Vincentello. There I met a man named William who had been imprisoned for the [crime of Heresy](http://i.imgur.com/kdUPARY.png). He actually believes that there is but one Sacrament, and that any Christian can give it, not just a priest. He also claims to abstain from all killing, even going so far as to refuse to eat the flesh of animals. While I do not agree with what he says, I cannot find a fault in his faith. I have prayed hard for his salvation these past few nights.

**21st of September, 1403**

Joyous news, William has renounced his former ways and rejoined the Holy Church. I have released him from the dungeons; already the people, high and low, of Siracusa have begun to call me merciful, though it was not mercy but justice that moved my hand.

**16th of October, 1403**

My daughter Geva has come to the age where she must begin her lessons, and I can think of no one better than my Marshal, Norman.

**28th of October, 1403**

Adam has died, and now his bastard-born son [Hamelin](http://i.imgur.com/piHkrwB.jpg) rules in Cyrenaica. He is such a masterful warrior, I have appointed him my Marshal, and removed young Geva to his care as well. Norman surely will understand.

**4th of January, 1404**

[Mayor Silvester has passed on](http://i.imgur.com/BHGmO1o.jpg), taken by the Pox which haunted him all his life. I have decided to take Richenda and Fraunk into my own household to raise for the time being.

**12th of January, 1404**

Berenguel approached me today asking to be made my [new Steward](http://i.imgur.com/nr9Wfex.jpg). While he would be better than Turold in this regard, he is not the best I could hope for; and I am not sure I trust Turold not to get into trouble without something to occupy his time. I polietly but firmly refused Berenguel request; I hope he isn't too upset by it.

**7th of February, 1404**

A [delegate from the Byzantine Empire arrived today](http://i.imgur.com/IpQ1YCQ.jpg), bearing news that Basileus Bosporios II, whom the Greeks call 'the Lion,' was attempting to strengthen the power of the crown within his realm. I politely listened to, and then politely refused, the messengers' request for a vote on the matter, as the Greek emperor's still believe my land to rightfully belong to them. This is ill-news indeed. I am a good Christian lord of peace, love, and charity, but I must put the needs of my kingdom first.

**27th of February, 1404**

It seems my fears were ill-founded, the Greeks have taken to [rebel against the Lion of the Bosphorus](http://i.imgur.com/RNHg4CK.png) for his efforts. Still, I do worry. Ruling a kingdom so far is nothing like what the Good Book led me to believe it would be.

**16th of March, 1404**

Perhaps [Fraunk](http://i.imgur.com/E8btV4W.jpg) won't turn out so bad after all.

**16th of April, 1404**

Now I understand why poor Silvester, GOD rest his soul, could never keep up with little Richenda! [She is the apple of my eye](http://i.imgur.com/GGk4E3k.png).

**9th of August, 1404**

As much as I love my dear cousin, I must take back what is rightfully mine so that I may stand a chance defending against the heathen Greeks to my east. Now may be the best and only chance I will ever have, while [young Lambert is distracted](http://i.imgur.com/7dDgz9a.jpg). I have declare war on my own kin; GOD save my soul, GOD save us all.

**29th of August, 1404**

I have recruited a band of Swiss mercenaries to our cause, and while they aid in me in laying siege to the city of Syracuse, Duke Hamelin has attacked a Francian army in Catanzaro laying siege to one of Lambert's rebellious Dukes.

**6th of September, 1404**

[Victory!](http://i.imgur.com/67GDCD2.png). Duke Hamelin has defeated the Francians, and now marches on Lecce, to lay siege to the holdings of the false Queen Marguerite of Sicily, who herself has been imprisoned by Lambert for several years.

**26th of September, 1404**

Word has reached me of another victory in Krete, this time against the levied men of Duke Mogens. Ha!

**7th of September, 1404**

[Duke Niketas](http://i.imgur.com/RvsyVHq.png) has joined our war!

**8th of September, 1404**

Lady Khulan sought me out on the battlefield this morning to tell me that young [Richenda had insulted her](http://i.imgur.com/jVmxUeT.jpg). Doesn't she know I have better things to do!? Is she so soft that the words of a mere child can bring her to tears!? Why did my Father bring such weak vermin into his court I shall never know.

**21st of January, 1405**

In order to finace this war I have appointed [Ossor as my new Steward](http://i.imgur.com/hCz4Kq5.jpg), infirm though he is, and sent him to collect a tith from the peasants of Palermo. I have also decided to call upon the lords of the realm to support me in raising the church tax in this time of need. Surely the Holy Father will not disapprove.

**8th of March, 1405**

The lords of Sicily loyal to Marguerite have attacked Duke Hamelin in Lecce with an enourmous army equally as strong as the Duke's. I fear and pray every day for word of a victory to arrive..

**5th of April, 1405**

[The worst has come true](http://i.imgur.com/zdZwVYb.png). I feel weak, powerless. I prayed to my LORD every waking hour and this is how he answers me? I do not know what to do.

**14th of May, 1405**

Finally, GOD has answered my prayers! [We have taken Syracuse](http://i.imgur.com/2IZ5UO0.jpg).

**24th of June, 1405**

I have placed [Turold at the head of a might force](http://i.imgur.com/90NbWZY.jpg), and sent him north to relieve Duke Hamelin at Lecce. My GOD protect him.

**15th of September, 1405**

In seems the peasants prefer Ossor's reign as Stewart over that of Turold. Perhaps he shall stay on my council even after the war..

**16th of October, 1405**

It appears that Hamelin &amp; Turold were successful in Lecce, though no messenger arrived telling me of their victory, one has arrived today stating they were moving on toward Taranto. The road is a dangerous place in these times of war, even for innocent runners &amp; carriers.

**4th of November, 1405**

I [greive for Antonio's](http://i.imgur.com/ikVfnry.png) widow, Mafalda, and his young son, Ansur, but part of me thanks GOD that it was not Turold. Does that make me a bad person? I shall have to pray on this tonight.

**21st of November, 1405**

It appears as though the Serbs of Dioclea have eleced my dear brother, Adam, as their new Duke, [and he has agreed to join our war.](http://i.imgur.com/dl6RWwS.png)

**31st of December, 1405**

On this somber New Year I tried to [warn Richenda](http://i.imgur.com/gIu1kMh.jpg) about the dangers of Gluttony, and guide her towards the path to Temperance, telling her that if she did't stop eating she would turn up like my grandfather, King Bertran. This message was perhaps lost on her though, as my illustrious ancestor was a great warrior-king.

**4th of January, 1406**

[Damn them all to hell!](http://i.imgur.com/BrHbTQ4.png)

**5th of January, 1406**

That was unworthy of me. I have prayed day and night for my transgression. As the LORD said on the Cross, ""Forgive them, for they do not what they are doing.""

**18th of May, 1406**

I'm beginning to have high hopes for young [Fraunk](http://i.imgur.com/OJVifqO.png), who joins me my prayers regularly.

Crusades would be more like prepared invasions and an event chain like the hajij for Muslims, you get an event where the pope calls for a crusade and you decide if you join it or not. Not joining would piss off the pope and maybe give a piety minus.

If you do join then you start spreading the word to your vassals and the people, this would result in events where ''Faithful subjects join your righteous crusade'' and you get an event army, to counter balance the muslim's tech and levy troops advantage and that army would then only be able to attack heathens, so that you can't abuse it against your christian rivals. Then you have, like with a prepared invasion, a time limit in which you have to join the war. If you don't then you get a massive piety hit and get a lot of angry vassals and peasants and if you join the war you get a regency. 

Then you'd march towards the crusade target, most likely Jerusalem. On the way you get different Piety/prestige/plunder events. Then when you arrive in crusade target, where you try and conquer the area. There you also get different events, like '' You arrive in the enemy city where you are greeted by large buildings that dwarf those in your homeland, you tell you engineers to study these building.'' and then you'd get technology points. Or your enemies fight with tactics that you haven't seen before, you tell your tacticians to study the enemy carefully'' and then you'd get techpoints in military.

If you win the crusade then you get an event where, if you did most of the work, you get to choose what happens to the land, you wouldn't be able to keep it and your own realm for your self, but you could choose it a new realm is set up with a new ruler or that you stay there and rule yourself.


So what do you guys think?

I apologize if this has been posted about before, it was just an idea I had.



EDIT: This idea would also apply to muslim Jihads.


EDIT 2: had some more ideas:


you'd get an event army, but the regency stops you from using your levies. Do you risk problems at home for possible rewards of a crusade?

the pope gets an event vanguard force to lead the charge.

the Muslims get event troops to defend themselves from crusades.


EDIT 3: Another Idea,

if you have unlanded sons and you don't join the crusade there would be a chance that they join it, seeking fame and riches, the same way that unlanded sons can join the Varangian Guard if you're Norse.

Also feel free to post if you have your own ideas. :)",,False,self,t5_2tgic,1376226847.0,,scandinavia,True,t3_1k3aoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1k3aoz/an_idea_regarding_crusades/,

**The diary of King Turold d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/CaptainReallyObvious*

**10 June, 1371**

My father passed away today. 

Father, you have given D'Isigny glory and honor. Power and prestige. You were brave, kind and always patient with me as you tried to teach me the art of war. You were a brilliant strategist, as you've demonstrated so often during your rule and many conquests. You have done well and lived up to the great name of D'Isigny. [I am proud to be your son] (http://i.imgur.com/sSTBNGjh.jpg). May you rest in peace, in the Lord's warm embrace. 

Goodbye, father.

***

**11 June, 1371**

I do wish father's death hadn't been so untimely. Suddenly everyone's looking at me for directions on what to do. All these councillors are bothering me with a million inane questions. ""Milord, where should we send the army?"" ""Milord, our enemies are gathering for a counter attack."" ""Milord, the Basileus hates us."" Bah. I had no idea being a King was so time-consuming.

So I hid away with Richenda and we had a lovely 'stroll' in the garden, if you get what I mean. I'll get to them tomorrow. This war isn't so urgent. 
We're doing excellent - I mean, we're the great House of D'Isigny - what could possibly go wrong?

***

**12 June, 1371**

Richenda and I stole away again, and then afterwards I played with little Aubrey. She's seven already and such a terribly bright girl. When Marshal Armand came stomping around the corner, I told him to bother me another time. I was busy playing with  my beautiful, bright and amazing daughter. He demanded I take action. DEMANDED. Well, that does not do. I ordered him thrown in the dungeon for his insolence. He then proceeded to kill the guards, fled the castle and raised his men in rebellion! The nerve of that man!! TO ARMS!!

***

**13 June, 1371**

My council is incompetent and they keep whining about the war and about Armand's false imprisonment. Well I've had it up to here with you all! I had them all replaced! 

Except for my lovely wife Richenda. She will remain my ever faithful Spymaster. And also except for Ildebrando, my Steward. I'm quite impressed by his beard. Anyone who can grow such a thing must be competent at his work too. 

***

**9 July, 1371**

Hah! It turns out Armand can't raise any troops. I will come and crush you later, my not-so-dear friend. In the mean time, my new council does as I say and they don't bother me. I sat in the garden, enjoying the sun, with Aubrey sitting on my lap. She was telling me all sorts of stories. Little Eustache, my eldest son (4) tried to emulate his sister. They're both such bright children!

In the midst of the story a trembling messenger entered and I gave him my best annoyed look. He told me the Basilissa had perished. What wonderful news! I gave him 50 golden coins as a reward and he left, pleased

The second messenger that arrived I ordered beheaded. I didn't like this tunic. It was the most hideous shade of blue. I dislike that color. What did he want again? Oh yes, he delivered an ultimatum in which my treacherous vassal Attilio of Apulio, a lowly Count, [named me a pretender] (http://i.imgur.com/sSTBNGjh.jpg) in favour  of some cousin. 

I'll get to that later. The sun is so nice and Aubrey and Eustache smell so sweetly of child and innocence.

***

**14 July, 1371**

My new Marshal informed me that [Attilio declared war] (http://i.imgur.com/UCFtpzFh.jpg). Bah, what can one man do? I'm the ruler of a vast empire with more than 20.000 men who fight and die for me. He is but a small insect. I'll get to it later.

***

**14 December, 1371**

Well. [This is unfortunate] (http://i.imgur.com/8UpRbMMh.jpg). The Emperor of Francia declared war on me. My councilors weren’t very specific about why and I didn’t really care.  I suppose it is about our lands in France. I wonder if I should just give it to him. Managing a war is hard and a lot of work...

I suppose I'll have to take some action now... Maybe. Eustache came to show me how well he can fight with sticks. Hah! He shows the true D'Isigny spirit, what a wonderful lad. He will go far!

***

**18 December, 1371**

I've decided a war for our ancestral lands is [meaningless] (http://i.imgur.com/p3cdyS6h.jpg) and have ordered [the armies to return] (http://i.imgur.com/kLgPci7h.jpg) to destroy and crush the traitors that seek to destroy D'Isigny. Mark my words, you shall rue the day you ever lifted a finger against me! I will CRUSH my enemies! Until there is nothing left but paste!

***

**22 March, 1372**

I've learned that [a cousin] (http://i.imgur.com/kP516EJh.jpg) is the instigator of these claimant wars. Him? He is dim-witted and ugly. Why do they prefer him over me?! Oh well. I had him killed. He died bloated and green like a toad! When I heard the news I laughed and laughed until I could laugh no more. 

[Then I was told that everyone else knew.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZtboLrVh.jpg) Oh well.

***

**5 April, 1372**

Ohoho, it seems our dalliances in the garden have been fruitful. [My wonderful Richenda is with child once more.] (http://i.imgur.com/KuKrh4Xh.jpg) Another royal addition to our Great House! I couldn't be more proud!

***

**11 May, 1372**

It seems [another pretender] (http://i.imgur.com/6eiiUZgh.jpg) to the throne has stepped forward. Brother... Why do you betray our house for your selfish desires?

***

**17 May, 1372**

Duke Humbert annoys me with his slothfulness. [Get some work done, you lazy man!!] (http://i.imgur.com/miTSsNFh.jpg) Duke Humbert was [very angry] (http://i.imgur.com/j9edEaLh.jpg)  with me that I spoke to him so frankly, and then I felt guilty, so I ignored him and left to sit at the parapets and let the wind play with leaves and straw. I like dangling my feet over the parapets. It's soothing.

***

**August, 1372**

News keeps reaching me of sieged and plundered cities by the French. Everyone in the castle seems to avoid me. Nobody is talking to me anymore. This annoyed me, so I had some of the maids lined up and had them recite poetry. There were three that knew none - absolutely none! How uncultured. I had them thrown out. 

***

**8 September, 1372**

Little Eustache is old enough to be educated already. Such a bright lad, I will personally guide you, my boy! 

***

**8 November, 1372**

My lovely wife gave birth to our fifth child, and fourth son: [Simon] (http://i.imgur.com/zjiFA2Qh.jpg). Welcome to this world, child. You have been born into the finest Royal House in this world.

***

**18 November, 1372**

Word reaches me that one of Armand's holdings has been destroyed. Good. As soon as my army is done crushing him, they will march to fight the French.

***

**26 February, 1373**

The French enemy has been seen in the lands nearest to Saracusa. Yet Armand's holdings still persist! I will crush him first before I focus my attentions towards the invaders. Setting priorities for yourself is vital in things like this. My council has been nagging again, but I told them to shut up or take a trip to the dungeon. 

They shut up.

***

**27 February, 1373**

I sent my sister [to marry Kaiser Ordulf] (http://i.imgur.com/EtMJWE8h.jpg) of the Holy Roman Empire today. Along with my sister, I sent 200 gold pieces and a request for aid against our enemies. [The Emperor graciously agreed] (http://i.imgur.com/7ARaKuyh.jpg). Let our enemies tremble! How convenient that we have such a mighty friend who can do all the heavy lifting. 

***

**15 June, 1373**

MY REVENGE IS SWEET! YOUR LINE IS CRUSHED AND YOU AND YOURS WILL NEVER WALK IN THESE LANDS AGAIN.  Ahem. [Armand has been imprisoned and executed!] (http://i.imgur.com/RL6ZlvKh.jpg)

***

**21 June, 1373**

Time to set sail homewards from [Armand's pathetic country] (http://i.imgur.com/hfed00Qh.jpg)and hope the 30.000 troops of Ordulf reach us soon. [Sicily doesn't look so good] (http://i.imgur.com/tvdUYHih.jpg).

***

**1 December, 1373**

Our men are in the midst of a [vicious struggle for our survival] (http://i.imgur.com/tvdUYHih.jpg) in the neighbouring lands. They are our last defense. 

And then Richenda came in to give me some wonderful news. [She is with child once more] (http://i.imgur.com/GGDOdXkh.jpg)! Oh, I love you, my darling. You give me, us, D'Isigny so many beautiful and gifted children.

***

**11 December, 1373**

[Humbert] (http://i.imgur.com/faFx7Crh.jpg).

That asshole.

I. Will. Crush. You. Into. A. Million. Pieces.

***

**3 January, 1374**

Aubrey asked me why she couldn't have any strawberries anymore. I... I didn't know what to say. Our enemies have hold of all trade posts and trade routes. They have occupied our neighbours. We have enough food to last us a while, but I didn't know what to say to my little girl. Have... have I failed her? Her and my family?

No, that can't be. I'm D'Isigny, after all.

***

**15 January, 1374**

This is unfortunate. Orwuld has amassed nearly 30.000 troops. Yet it seems [they have no ships to cross the sea] (http://i.imgur.com/bSMI86zh.jpg) to Sicily and come to our aid. I wonder if there was something I could have done to prevent this.

Father, I wish you were were. You would have known what to do... has it been four years already? I hope you rest in peace.

***

**7 March, 1374**

My [troops have launched a counter attack] (http://i.imgur.com/fLaay40h.jpg) at France. I fear it is too little, too late. Yet I WILL NOT GIVE UP. Not until they force me to. I will fight until the bitter end.

Well. Actually my troops will. And my marshal. I’m still at home, receiving these worrisome messages.

***

**8 March, 1374**

Aubrey asked me about war. ""What is war, daddy?"" I told her it was an unfun game adults play. Some truths are not meant for the ears of little girls.

***

**10 March, 1374**

Both Aubrey and Eustache have been giving out candy to some of the other children in the castle. They made sure to divide it up evenly. I see Richenda's hand in their education. Sometimes she can be troublesome, but I do love her for all she has given me. I shall honour the educational choices she makes for our children and encourage this behavior.

***

**2 July, 1374**

An accursed day. The wretched Francian Emperor has STOLEN what is rightfully mine! He has crowned himself KING. [KING of SICILY] (http://i.imgur.com/wpcNYQeh.jpg)! How dare he!? This is far from over - One way or another, you will regret this, Bérenger... My de jure vassals have thrown themselves to the mercy of the usurper, we will see what happens to you when I can summon my armies once more...

As I stewed with righteous wrath, a maid came in bearing other news.

It seems Richenda gave birth to our new child. A girl. Ah, my poor child. To be brought into the world on THIS particular day. I hope your life shall be filled with more guidance from the lord and better luck than your birth has brought me. Despite your lineage of this great House, it seems you do not inspire any favours...

***

**3 July, 1374**

My chancillor approached me with a map of our new borders. I am only the King of Greece, now.

Yesterday on my lunch break I was playing as one of the Muslim rulers in Spain (sorry for the vagueness, it was kind of a random choice and I can't fire up the game until lunch to double check), and for once I hadn't made any adjustments to the character using ruler designer. His first son was kind of meh, so I married my character to a genius for his second wife. BAM, infant genius son. After a year or two fighting the Christian rulers and growing his borders, my first character died and his second, genius 5 year old son inherited due to some land granting dear old dad had pulled off just before kicking the bucket.

Now, everything seemed to be going well--my older brother rebelled right away, of course, but after a quick and brutal fight I put him back in his place. A bribe later, and he was at least okay with me being alive, as opposed to hating my guts (I can't help it if I'm a genius!). I get through a year or two of peace and tranquility, when out of no where I get the popup, ""Hey, I get to go on a boat ride! It's going to be SUPER FANTASTIC AWESOME FUN TIMES!""

My reaction: ""NOOOO DON'T DOO EEET GET AWAY FROM THE BOOOOAAAT *clicks the only option, to go on the boat ride* 

Game: ""lulz u ded""

Me: ""Godamnnit so much.""

So of course the conniving bastard of an older character inherits, and I have to play as him. The guy who killed the character I actually wanted to play as. RAWR.

I told all of this to my fiance, and he responded with the title. Sigh. Of course, we also have these conversations all the time.

Me: ""Dammnit, accept my bribe!""

Him: ""... Are you trying to kill your children again?""

Me: ""... Noooo, it's my grandson/nephew's son this time. See, if he dies, then his brother, a genius, will inherit, and I'll have an easier time in the future. And since his father/my nephew was an idiot and made me spymaster, it should happen pretty quickly I just need a few more conspirators.""

Him: ""... And I'm marrying you and want to have children with you... why?""

Me: ""I promise I won't go on murderous rampages! Just as long as we have an elective succession.""

Him: *facepalm*

Hopefully there are people on this sub who aren't sadistic, opportunistic bastards, but this being Crusader Kings perhaps this thread will be a flop.

Anyway, I was playing as Poland, and a few people here may remember that my general strategy when playing Poland consists of 4 steps: ally the Salians, conquer the Baltic, fuck the Vikings, conquer the Salians. A very convoluted order of events, to be sure, but it makes sense when you're doing it.

So I started the game by marrying Adelheid Salian for the HRE alliance. Heinrich IV (for whatever reason) absolutely loved me, although at first I didn't like the guy (after the fifth time he agreed to join a war in the Baltic for me he started to grow on me). I pursued my usual tactic of total Baltic dominance, running in and swinging swords and such until I'd nabbed Mecklenburg, Pommerania, Prussia, Lithuania and Estonia. Huzza!

By this point my good old King Boleslaw was about 70, but so many Holy Wars had made him powerful; 2000 piety, the love of the Pope, the Crusader trait, a ton of prestige, Low CA, Max Feudal Levies, etc. With so much land under his belt--even if much of it was only recently conquered--he had over 17,000 men at his disposal.

Well, he and Heinrich were still very good friends. Boleslaw had even agreed to join that good 'ol German in some wars in Croatia and Hungary to repay him for his service in the Baltic campaign. But when Heinrich IV died and was replaced by Heinrich V, Boleslaw didn't think the grandson of his friend the Salian was worthy to rule the HRE, and this is where I become an inglorious bastard: I requested an invasion, conquered the HRE and imprisoned Heinrich V. I know, I know, bad form, and from a dynasty that had been so good to me, I know! But the story's not done yet.

Boleslaw now-the-first and Boleslaw II die with Heinrich V still in prison. When good 'ol Heinrich finally dies his son Heinrich would-have-been-sixth takes over under the reign of Boleslaw III. The Pope calls a crusade on Jerusalem, and naturally B-3 wins it. Well, what does he do with it? He feels guilty toward his family's old, betrayed allies the Salians; he gives the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Heinrich would-have-been-sixth-but-is-now-first, King of Jerusalem.

From here, the Piasts and the Salians are back to being the best of friends; the Salian dynasty never betrayed me, conquered much of Arabia independently, and was at the forefront of Imperial defense when the German Dukes got uppity. Even though they eventually followed the example of the Imperial Piasts and went Polish, they retained the friendship they had held during their time as Germans, and as many Salians were landed throughout the Empire as Piasts (specifically Jerusalem, Egypt, Aragon and Italy were all Salian titles, and they really did never rebel against me).

So c'mon, this story sucks because I'm an asshole and betrayed my friends. Somebody tell a good one!",,False,self,t5_2tgic,False,,ireland,True,t3_14ggy9,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/14ggy9/weve_had_a_thread_about_dynastic_rivalries_lets/,

I've been using it to shove large, forged, sharpened objects up the bums of my neighbors. It's amazing.  

I invest heavily in tech, especially as a Norse.  I make a beeline for retinues and heavy infantry, build out a few universities/monasteries (the REALLY expensive ones in your vassals holdings).  These increase tech gain speed, the earlier you get these the better.

Also, set your councilors to improve tech anytime they're not actively needed for something else.

You can end up with a 20K stack of housecarls with **massive** buffs to their attack/defense.  These things (single type retinues with high tech backing, eg housecarls and heavy infantry) make them punch massively above their weight class, and if you have your king leading the center you'll get huge amounts of prestige, tech points and, this is a big one, the possibility of some cool modifiers (berserker, Viking, general battle improvements, etc).


I recommend taking heavy infantry and/or organization/leading the center combat options, when possible... If you're a heavy infantry unique retinue.  If you're cavalry, choose that, obviously. 


I hit way over my weight class, turning back a 15k stack with 5,500 men and very few casualties, ~700 or so, mostly in the skirmish phase. And I'm pretty sure the casualties were only that high because my high martial, defense/foot soldier cousin up and fucking croaked one day into the battle.

I'm still learning how to play this properly, and haven't yet experimented with Byzantium, Islam or Republics, which is a testament to how extensive this game is (or how slow I am...)! 

Anyway, I thought I'd share a few tips which I haven't managed to find in casual browsing of this subreddit. 

* When starting with a single county, I find it useful to revoke my vassals. This gives me increased prestige, income and most importantly: levies. Revoking the mayorships, bishoprics and baronies gives you full access to all the associated levies which is extremely helpful when attacking other small counties. I continue doing this for the first few counties until the demesne penalty gets too much. At which point I invite some holy men to court and grant them my stolen baronies, bishoprics and mayorships. Happy vassals all round! 

* If I create my own ruler, I tend to give him the quick and lustful traits. Lustful so that he has a greater chance to procreate, and quick as it's genetic.
