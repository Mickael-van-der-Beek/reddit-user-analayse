My life after early retirement:

... years ago I watched a fantastic TED talk given by Stefan Sagmeister called The Power of Time Off. Stefan owns a design studio in New York. Every seven years Stefan chooses to shut down his firm for one whole year. He uses this time to rejuvenate and recharge, taking time for creative experiments he would normally not have time for.

There was one part of Stefan’s talk in particular that I thought would be very valuable for my life after early retirement. Stefan’s first year off started as a bit of a disaster. His plan was to leave a huge void of time, thinking that this “vacuum of time would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation”. What he found was that his time was just absorbed by little menial tasks. He says that he simply became his own intern.

To eliminate this problem he sat down and made a list of the things he was interested in and created a schedule, similar to a class schedule in grade school. Each day of the week was divided into chunks of time. Each chunk was dedicated to one of his interests.

Although not specifically used for financial independence I thought it was a fantastic idea! It’s an idea that would be prefect for my own life after early retirement.

In my life after early retirement I want to challenge myself to learn new things. I want to be there for my family and my community. I want to stay healthy by exercising daily. I want to learn how to cook new and delicious meals. For me, this type of “class schedule” will help me remain productive and use my life after early retirement to its maximum.

I am immediately paying off a smaller debt and going into debt kill mode for the rest of the year. My Xmas present to myself by the end of the year will be no debt and several grand in savings. This is the first step on my long (but possible!) path to complete financial independence. 

EDIT

Okay since you guys wanted to hear it, this is how it's happening. I currently have $900 total. I am going to college using my GI Bill benefit (USMC vet) so I receive a monthly income of $1075 from that. My monthly basic bills (car debt, personal loan debt, insurance, cell phone, gym) are aprox. $600 . Clearly that's not enough to get my own apartment, so I'm forced to live with my parents while going to college. By the end of this month I will either be in a VA work study program, or have a part time job I am estimating about $700 a month income from that. I am getting $1200 back on my taxes, which has already posted and will be in my account by midnight. I am immediately going to take $550 of that and pay off a personal loan. This will drop my monthly basic bills down to $470. That splits up bi weekly so because of timing, I will have around $1300 before my next GI bill payment comes in. So starting in March, my average income will be $1700 monthly (going to school through summer, everything stays constant). Tack on gas, personal allowance ($50/week so $200/mo) and overestimate costs, rounds up all my expenses to $750. In order to pay off my car loan by the end of the year, I will have to contribute an extra $410 a month (mar-dec). Round all of that up to $1200, take it out of total income, and there's $500 spare to throw into savings. Over the next 10 months that means I can have my car paid off and $5000 minimum in savings. Drop the car payment off of my expenses for 2014, rinse and repeat until I move out of state for the fall 2014 school year at another university.

Perhaps it's part working out things in public, part shout for help and part warning to others.

I've had a good deal of financial independence for well over a decade. The first few years were pretty easy. There was a good chunk of money set aside, a massive downgrade in living expenses and enough contacts sending money my way to keep things comfortably afloat. I still had to work but the choice of *when* and *how hard* to work was all mine.

Then I got married and had a child.

Actually, supporting a wife and child wasn't even a problem. The huge mistake was getting distracted and leaving my main income source to languish for too long. But again, the distraction wasn't my wife and child, at least not to any significant degree. The problem was getting sucked in to helping my in-laws with their family businesses.

My in-laws are pretty conservative types but also quite well-off and well-connected. They couldn't understand why I was always home and didn't seem to be actually working. Money ""coming from the internet"" just wasn't in their sphere of comfort. To them, the ideal son-in-law would be a high-flyer, mover-and-shaker type. I'd left the corporate world behind. So, for a number of reasons, I felt compelled to help out in their various family start-ups. Yes, that's *start-ups* plural. Most of you can probably see where this is going.

My father-in-law put me in key positions in the businesses. At first, the new situation seemed like a great opportunity drastically *increase* our financial independence. But there was a catch: for almost a year, all my work ended up being unpaid. Further, while I had huge responsibility, I had no authority at all. Virtually all decisions, both macro and micro, had to be run by him. My father-in-law, you see, is a powerful man, used to getting his way and consequently an overbearing asshole. The relationship was destined to fail from the beginning and so were the ventures. 

So here I am, no longer involved in the family businesses and trying to piece together my own that had taken so much effort to build. It would be easy to point fingers but the truth is that blame lies completely with me. I'd become complacent and neglected our source of stability.

In the past we would be living more than comfortably. Now, every unexpected expense is a kick in the gut. It's tempting to pack it all up and return to being a wage slave. Very tempting. But I couldn't do that; it would go against my core values. Besides, I'm no longer a young man and have developed a stubbornly independent streak. No employer would have me anyway.

All that's left is to get up and trudge on. It would be nice to leave you with an uplifting message. Perhaps something about being wiser, more experienced and ready for the new challenges ahead. The truth is that I'm a little more tired, a little more jaded and even less sure of myself than at the start of this journey.",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_1g8uw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1g8uw2/losing_financial_independence_a_warning_to_others/,

With some fairly conservative numbers, he was able to retire at age 53, but that made me think of this sub, since I already had all the tables and formulas filled out, I tweaked a few things to see what he would need to do to retire early.

Again, this is an average guy (used median numbers for just about everything) with a bachelors degree that started work in 1981.

For FI specifically I adjusted his starting retirement contribution up to 15% (Instead of 10%), increasing by 1% per year until he hits 25% (Instead of 15%). I calculated out some various ""annuity"" amounts that would be needed to have a steady income based on stocks and bonds (No side jobs or rental property management for this guy, just golf and cocktails until the grave!), and then worked him until he hit that point, here's the numbers.

* $12k (Poverty line) - Age 34  
* $15k (First quartile of personal US incomes) - Age 36  
* $22k (MMM's yearly spending also half the median household income) - Age 37   
* $27k (Median Personal Income) - Age 39
* $45k (Median household income) - Retires at age 46  
* $50k (Third quartile) - Age 51  
* $88k (Top 10% of personal incomes) - Age 58

What's really interesting to me about all of this, is that this is just one guy working his way along with a bachelors degree. He doesn't do anything magical, he just follows bonds = age, and invests in index funds and saves around 25% of his income.

If this guy found and married someone doing the same thing, they could have both retired at 34 (working only 12 years each) and lived the same life that MMM and his family does.

Even more impressive, he could retire as one of the top 10% yearly ""earners"" in America just by working until he was 58. That's still 4 years before ""retirement age"" and he would be bringing in a ""salary"" higher than 90% of Americans.

There's no telling what the future may hold, but this average guy from the 50's was able to retire before he hit 40 by spending less than he made and investing in index funds.

I rewound my life by 10 years, and applied what I know today to me 10 years ago. I invested purely in index funds, no attempt at market timing. I deposited roughly 50% of my paycheck each month (without doing anything to my wife's paychecks), and applied that with my raises and whatnot over a 10 year span.

Once I had that end of 10 years working lump sum- I invested it into my index of retirement indexes to see how I would have done during 2012. The results were pretty shocking. 2012 would have brought in $35k in dividend payouts, and my total stock market value would have increased by nearly 7%. That plus the $1k my wife makes from her hobby of photography means we would be able to quit our 9-5's.

**I could have retired by now if I was smarter 10 years ago.**

A couple of notes.

I really haven't looked into health insurance once retired. I know that several people have done it affordably (MMM, ERE, others), but I really haven't looked into our own costs. And considering I won't be retiring for another 10 years at least, I'm not really looking into it right now.

September 2007 was my best month. My net worth was approximately 171% of the total amount that I had invested up to that point. However...

February 2009 was a terrible month. My net worth plummeted to roughly 77% of the total amount that I had invested up to that point. I bounced back out of the negatives by July '09 and I haven't fallen anywhere near that since.

As I said above, I invested purely in index funds, I invested at the end of the month, every month, no matter if it was high or low, there was zero market timing involved.

All investing was done through Vanguard indexes and I didn't account for any fees. Because this was purely a thought experiment, I didn't want to go through the hassle, so if I had actually done this 10 years ago, my results would have been slightly different.",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_16uekw,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16uekw/i_would_have_been_able_to_retire_this_month_if_i/,

____________________________________________
One summer, many years ago, a banker was vacationing in a small village on the coast. He saw a fisherman in a small boat by the pier with a handful of fish that he had just caught. The businessman asked him how long it took him to catch the fish, and the man said he was out on the water for only a couple of hours.

“So why didn’t you stay out there longer to catch more fish?” asked the businessman.

The fisherman said he catches just enough to feed his family every day, and then comes back.

“But it’s only 2 p.m.!” said the banker, “What do you do with the rest of your time?”

The fisherman smiled and said, “Well, I sleep late every day, then fish a little, go home, play with my children, take a nap in the afternoon, then stroll into the village each evening with my wife, relax, play the guitar with our friends, laugh and sing late into the night. I have a full and wonderful life.”

The banker scoffed at the young man, “Well, I’m a businessman from New York! Let me tell you what you should do instead of wasting your life like this! You should catch more fish to sell to others, and then buy a bigger boat with the money you make so you can catch even more fish!”

“And then what?” asked the fisherman. 

The banker’s eyes got all big as he enthusiastically explained, “You can then buy a whole fleet of fishing boats, run a business, and make a ton of money!”

“And then what?” asked the fisherman again, and the banker threw his hands in the air and said, “You’d be worth a million! You can then leave this small town, move to the city, and manage your enterprise from there!”

“How long would all this take?” asked the fisherman. “Fifteen to twenty years!” replied the banker.

“And then what?”

The banker laughed and said, “That’s the best part. You can then sell your business, move to a small village, sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take naps in the afternoon, go for an evening stroll with your wife after dinner, relax, sing, and play the guitar with your friends. You would have a full and wonderful life!”

The fisherman smiled at the banker, quietly gathered his catch, and walked away.

**What is it:** Disability insurance is essentially insurance on your income.  For most of us in the wealth accumulation phase, our most valuable asset is our ability to generate income.  If you have a high income, this is especially true; if you lose your 100k/yr job because you get some disease that prevents you from working for 10 years, you are out a million bucks.

**Why we need it:**  Disability is more common than you think.  The Insurance Information Institute in New York estimated in 2009 that 43 percent of 40-year-olds will have an incident causing long-term disability -- defined as lasting 90 days or more -- by the time they turn 65. [source](https://origin.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/disability-primer-obtaining-full-coverage-1.aspx). 

**Why ""group disability insurance"" sucks:**  Unlike car insurance where your car is either wreaked or not, there are many nuances to disability insurance.  *The strength of an insurance contract is in its wording*.  In most group disability plans that are offered at your place of employment, the definition of a disability is weak.  Example: if you are a highly paid IT worker and you get hit in the head so that you can no longer work in IT but can drool all over yourself at walmart acting as a greeter, you *are not considered disabled*.  This is just one example of how coverage varies.  Some terms that denote a strong disability insurance contract are:

* own-occupation definition: this means that if your disability prevents you from doing you main line of work (IT in the example above) then you can be deemed disabled and get your money

* non-cancellable: this means that if the insurer finds out that you got AIDS or inflation in the country spikes to 20%, they cannot cancel your policy or raise your rates.

**Downside:**  A good disability policy is expensive.  I pay about 1.5% of my salary for my premium.  The application process is long; I had to do a blood test, fill out a long application, and submit medical history. 

**Recommended action:**   Based on the above, I recommend finding a good independent insurance agent, and getting MULTIPLE quotes from the major Disability Insurance providers in this country (Guardian, Mass Mutual, The Standard, MetLife, etc).


I hope we can have some good discussion here.  If anybody has any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

For most people, the word ""travel"" conjures up images of expensive resorts in Cancun or shopping in Paris. But that's not how I travel. I travel with a backpack on my back, a pouch around my neck with a passport, cash and debit card and nothing else. I stay in hostels in expensive countries, or nice guesthouses in most of the world. The only trouble is, because I work full time at the moment, finding the time.

In the early 2000s I spent three months in Europe for $35 a day. (Admittedly, this was in the brief period when the dollar was actually stronger than the Euro.) Then I spent months more over the following years traveling in Eastern Europe, Central America and Asia. I am still astounded how well I can eat and live on a paltry amount of money.  My wife and I can travel just about anywhere in the world for $50 a day or so. The only costs that interrupt this are plane tickets, or lots of bus/rail travel, which depending on the route, can be minimized.

The other day I discovered this sub-reddit and began to study up. I'd like to retire early and I think lowering costs and living simply -- as backpacking around the world has taught me to do, are a natural connection with the principles of financial independence. I decided I want to try and become independent, both financially and physically. And then it hit me:

$50 a day.

$50 x 365 = $18,250. That's it. Round that up to $20k because of a couple airfares and you could travel indefinitely.  Backpacking could become a perpetual motion machine for as long as you cared to do it. Most people are trying to save $1 million dollars in order to draw down at 4% and become truly FI in the USA or other Western countries. But with low enough costs of living, such as in Asia, Africa, Central/ and South America and even in Eastern Europe -- most of the world in fact, you could live on half of that sum. $500k drawn at 4% would be all you would need. If you could do a little freelance work on top of that you could even slowly add to the sum, providing a buffer against unforeseen costs.

I know there would be a lot of details to work out in terms of figuring out the best way to have the money invested, but I think the underlying principles are sound. You don't need a million bucks to achieve true freedom, it could be as little as half that. 

I don't know what most people's goal are, and many people may not find the idea of ""vagabonding,"" as Rolf Potts calls it, to be very attractive. But I think the idea is thrilling. And very achievable, even on a middle-class salary. 

Does anyone else share this goal?

Firstly, I'm posting with a throwaway because I'd prefer anonymity (my IRL friends know my account). Thanks a bunch for the help in advance.

Recently, the last of my grandparents passed away and is leaving a sizable amount of money to members of my family. I was just informed that I'll likely be getting at minimum $50000, but most likely more.

Thing is, I'm 20 years old and still in college. I have basically zero experience with managing any significant amount of money (minus ~$3000 I have in a stock account to play with) and have no idea what I should be doing with it. I don't have a job, nor a house, car, or anything that causes significant income or expenditures at the moment. 

I'd like to make a smart decision that would help me live better in the long run. Where do I begin? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!


EDIT: For reference, I am located in the USA.

In addition, to clarify tuition/debt: 

- My parents had a college fund for me and the rest of my tuition is covered with scholarships. I'm not paying out of pocket for it at the moment, but plan on repaying my parents once I establish myself financially.

- I have a credit card, but no debt on it. I've only used it when I've had enough cash in my savings account to immediately pay it off.

For example, skiing can get expensive quickly when you have to rent everything.  If I spend the money now, its delaying me from reaching FI in the future by several weeks.

It seems a reoccurring question here is one of, ""how sure am I of this pension still existing in 30 years?"" I've shot a quick message to my wife in this regard as she has much more training in financial matters than I do. Her response is as follows:

Definitely sure. The pension portfolio/account is balanced and adjusted every month by PWGSC. Because the fund is a defined benefit plan, pensioners are contractually obligated to be paid the agreed upon amount from the pension fund. The way I understand pension accounting, forecasts are made on a yearly basis as to fund performance and pension expense. During monthly reconciliation, actual fund performance is measured against these forecasts. If a shortfall is predicted, the only thing that can be changed is the fund contributions amount. So future pensioners will bear the brunt of that cost. The cost of the pension may go up leading up to retirement, but we will always be guaranteed our full pension. Barring a huge financial crisis with government collapse. But then, I think we have larger issues at hand than just losing our pensions...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings FI community!  …long-time listener, first-time caller.

I’ve got a plan for a fairly early retirement that I think is solid but I would love to get your input.



Goal:  


FI ASAP!  I’m not against the idea of working *per se*, I just hate being on someone else’s schedule.  That being said, I’m so risk adverse that I’m not willing to assume any income (other than passive) after quitting my 9-5.  So, effectively, I want enough money to outright retire even though it’s probably overkill.



Details:


House: Valued at approx. $400,000 with $180,000 left on the mortgage (5 year variable @ Prime -0.85% …currently 2.15%)

Debt: Nil besides the aforementioned mortgage.

Income: $160,000 gross split between my wife and I; however, we only net about $100,000 due to taxes, dues, mandatory pension deductions, etc.

Living expenses: Aside from the mortgage we spend roughly $2,500 per month on everything else: property tax, food, insurance, utilities, entertainment, etc.

Savings: Effectively nil.  We have $20,000 - $40,000 scattered in various investments, cash, emergency funds, and whatnot but they’re not really worth talking about in this context.

Pension: Here’s where the magic happens.  My wife and I have AMAZING pensions.  Defined, indexed… they’re stellar.  Right now our combined pensions are only worth $15,000 per year but that value grows by ~$4000 per annum.  The only catch is they’re not collectable until we turn 60 …we’re both about 30 right now.



The plan:


So, I think you can probably guess where this is going.  With living expenses of about $30,000 per year, and an indexed pension that will be able to cover those expenses after only 4 more years of working, our only real challenge is getting by until we hit the age of 60 and can begin to collect.


I think we can accomplish this with only 7 more years of employment.  Our current lifestyle allows us to bank about $70,000 per year ($100,000 net - $30,000 in expenses).  We’re dumping all this money towards the mortgage.  That puts us with the house owned outright in 3 years and ~$300,000 in investments by the year 2020.  We then retire, sell the house (likely worth ~$450,000 by then), and move to a lower cost-of-living area.  At a conservative 3% withdrawal rate our $750,000 nest-egg would give us about $22,500 per year to live on.  This should be more than enough for us to live fairly well in some of the world’s poorer tropical paradises (Thailand, Indonesia, etc.).  
Once we hit 60 we can return to Canada and use part of our nest-egg (almost all $750,000 should still be there) to buy a house and then live comfortably off of the remainder of the egg and our pensions (valued at ~$43,000 per year if we worked until 2020).
 

The obvious objection I see some of you raising is, “Who the hell wants to live in Thailand for 20 years?!?”  This is an excellent point; to which I would respond, “If we tire of foreign places (or our health declines) we can always move back to Canada as $22,500 should be enough to live decently in the lower cost-of-living areas of this country as well.”



I should also mention that my wife suggests working an additional 10 years instead of 7.  The “I don’t like working” side of me isn’t so keen on that plan but the overly cautious side of me can see some merit in it.  Working 10 years would adjust our numbers to: Nest-egg of ~$975,000 for a 3% passive yearly income of $29,000 and a pension of $56,000 per year starting in the year 2040.



As a final note, all these numbers are in today’s dollars but the pension is indexed for inflation and the conservative withdrawal rate of 3% on the nest-egg should allow for it to grow at a rate equal to inflation as well.


So, this plan seems pretty sound to me; however, being the cautious person that I am, I would like to get some outside opinions on my numbers and assumptions.  I’d be very grateful if you would point out any mistakes I’ve made or potential problems you foresee.

Right now it is Me, my wife, and my son. My wife is currently pregnant (due at the end of the month)... so we will be a family of 4 at that time. I'm the only one working because my wife's entire paycheck would be [going to childcare](http://community.thebump.com/cs/ks/forums/thread/55466584.aspx). It is cheaper for her to stay home and do the childcare. We are paying $775 for a two bedroom apartment.

We can't really afford to move into a 3 bedroom anything unless we move way outside of the city, making the commute 1 hour each way.

Over the past couple months, we have been getting dozens of posts from FI bloggers attempting to post links to their blogs, presumably for the purpose of generating traffic. Much of it has ended up caught by the spam filter, and has been marked as spam by the mods. We have also gotten messages and reports from community members identifying particular blog posts as spam. If you are the author of a spammed link, you may be confused. We'd like to explain.

Rather than state what spam is, we will direct you all to read [Reddit's own rules](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) on the matter. With those in mind, there are clearly some users on r/FI who are only involved with the community as a way to further their own blogs- the vast majority (if not all) of their posts are links to their own blog, and they only post comments to answer questions about their blog posts. This is spam- it has not, and will not be tolerated by the subreddit, and if you are one of the above authors, we would ask you to please stop, for nothing else than the sanity of the mods and consideration of other community members. Bans may be enforced if it gets out of hand, although we're not close to that point yet. We will clarify this stance in an update to the [rules of r/FI](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/financialindependence?version=7).

Granted, there are still ways to get your blog posts into the subreddit. These include:

1. Submitting one of your best links in our monthly reflection thread. [This recent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/142afo/community_thread_reflecting_on_november_and/c7ak9cs) is a good example.

2. Being actively involved in the community **before** posting **occasional** links to your blog. This means posting links to other great FI websites/articles, and commenting on other posts, before posting an occasional link to your blog. In short, treating r/FI as a community (as it is intended) instead of a revenue stream. Reddit's spam guidelines (linked above) suggest that no more than 10% of your activity should be links to your own website- we think this is a good guideline to follow.

Although this policy only affects a small percentage of our readers, we feel it is important to establish it as a present solution and precedent for the future.

Hi FI. I just hit a milestone I'd like to share with you all. This represents about 10x my yearly pseudo-budget and is a nice round number to have passed.


I just turned 29, and estimate that I have at least four more working years before FI at my current savings rate with no windfalls or emergencies. I plan to take a year off before then to ride a motorcycle down to Argentina though.


Some notable events:

July 2006 - graduated, first salaried job working as a grad student

Dec 2007 - gifted 60 shares of ISRG as part of my parents estate planing

May 2011 - started consulting and reading MMM

Nov 2011 - graduated, first ""real"" job, saving ~80% of after tax income

(Dec 2011 - went hiking with MMM when he visited Phoenix)

Sep 2012 - gifted 1k shares of TCAP for estate planing again, this is why I don't consider 100k a personal milestone

Jan 2013 - NFLX takes off, I had purchased them in Oct 2011 at around $80.

I've had a few people doing initial testing for the past 2 weeks, and I've realized that I need more help working out the kinks. 

This is a work in progress and an application that lives off of community feedback. Because of this, I've realized that I probably will never think it's ""polished"" enough to be released.  But, I can live with it being called a ""Beta test"" for awhile.

So, what can this thing do that FireCalc can/cannot do? As of right now, I think that it can do 95% of what FireCalc can, plus a few other things like:

* Allows for using Gold as an asset. Uses historical gold prices. Allows for simulations like the Permanent Portfolio.
* Allows for cash as an asset. No good historical data for this. I currently allow for a fixed % growth on cash, inputted by the user.
* Allows up to 40 separate recurring portfolio changes, each adjusted for inflation or not (user input). I believe Firecalc allows 3.
* Allows up to 40 one-time portfolio adjustments, each adjusted for inflation or not (user input). I believe Firecalc allows for 3.

Things I'm working on immediately, unless someone points out a glaring problem with the current site:

* Ability for Monte Carlo simulation
* Ability to log in, save simulation runs, and compare multiple simulations side-by-side
* Along with many other features I have on my list in the forums

What can /r/financialindependence do?  Well, you can head over to www.cfiresim.com, and register in the forums (link at the bottom of the page). If you find anything wrong, post it in the forums! If you find there is a feature you want, post it in the forums!

Also, please don't judge my graphic design... I wasn't the best art student.

I appreciate any and all feedback. I probably shouldn't have posted this on a weekend that I'm going away, but oh well. :)

**Edit:** *Welp, I knew this would happen. Right when I release it to the semi-general public, I notice a lot of issues.*

The page used to be split into 2: A form and an output. To properly validate that the user isn't putting in garbage info, I had to merge them into 1 physical page.  Doing so caused me to need to rename a lot of variables on the page.

From what I can tell, Advanced Spending inputs, Retirement Year (for anything in the future), and the Test String are all either not working or are very quirky right now.

I'm sure that Firecalc had a period of issues during initial testing too. I'm just anxious about the whole thing, and need to just document the issues and work on them.

More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,48,12,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/17m4s2/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/financialindependence! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, here is my updated version that I revised with your critiques!. Background: I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card. I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid? Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%(Ally Bank), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used Kawasaki KLR 650, which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! That's my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate!

I feel like I should clarify a bit; my post does seem somewhat ambiguous.

I grew up on the coast of Washington state, which was mainly a logging and fishing community of about 30,000 people. My dad mainly provided for my mom and me, and he made somewhere in the mid 60k's most of his life. 

I would describe us as living fairly comfortably on that salary; we had a couple older used cars, and we never really struggled. However, my parents always made it seem like we had to life frugally, and I always had just assumed that we were ""making it,"" but not by much.

I'm 23 currently and I'm finishing up a graduate degree. The median salary for someone in my field is roughly 50k/year, and I'm finding myself a little freaked out at the prospect of raising a family on that salary. But, I also recognize that my perceptions of financial stability are probably skewed because of the way my parents approached money.

1) Is there any truth to that? If that happens, are you SOL?

2) Is there any way to avoid that problem? Pay more to lock yourself in at a rate so that if you do get sick, your premiums don't go up? etc.?

If I keep them and rent them out, they'd rent out for about $450 per month net (gross income minus expenses).

I've been doing tons of reading on the ERE and MMM blogs and have figured out the basics, including frugal living, the 4% rule, etc. My goal is to achieve early semi-retirement: I'd like to have income which takes care of my expenses so my part-time job/business/whatever I do can be reinvested or used for luxuries like travel.

But what I'm stuck on is the details of how FI works. I know you can learn to live on 15k a year and your investments will magically compound themselves until you start getting 15k a year from them after a certain number of years, and I know the basics of compound interest and all, but I would like to see someone explain the details and math behind this magic in a concrete example so I understand it before throwing my money into investments. It would be more helpful to see how someone has actually achieved this. I feel as if I have all the blueprints and instruction manuals but don't actually know how to start. All the suggested portfolios are basically 25%-30% each in stocks, bonds, index funds, and REITs... but that's such general advice. I tried using Firecalc but I'm probably not doing it correctly because none of my result numbers make any sense.

In addition, I was hoping to open a Roth IRA in case my whole FI plan doesn't work out and I'm not sure if I should prioritize that over the income investing. Do you keep an IRA if you're income investing? Or is the IRA perhaps a vehicle (but then don't the dividends and interest just go back into it)?

Also, once you start getting dividends and interest, do they go back into the portfolio and get reinvested automatically? Or do they come to your bank account and then you reinvest them? How do FI people get their income exactly? What do people mean when they talk about withdrawal if the whole point is living off the dividends and interest?

I'm a finance newbie and just started getting into this a couple months ago so my knowledge is piecemeal. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

Here is a breakdown of where I'm at.

**Age:** 34

**Marital Status:** Married (we have one 5 year old special needs child, no others on the way). My wife doesn't work because she cares for our child. If she were to work, she could easily earn $40,000/year with her education/qualifications.

**Citizenship:** Canadian

**Housing:** I own my home free and clear. Worth about $320,000.

**RRSP assets:** $115,000 (This is a tax-deferred retirement vehicle. IRA-like)

**Debt:** Vehicle. Currently owe $18,000 (bi-weekly payments of $198) I have no other debt at all.

**Real Estate:** 50% ownership in 5 properties. My share of net income is ~$2,000/month. If sold, my share of the equity would be ~$200,000.

**Business Assets**: I'm a 50% partner in a business, which is also my full-time job. I could get about $150,000 if I were to sell my half. I currently earn about $80,000/year from this job.

**Other Income** I have a couple of small assets that earn me ~$200/month, but I can't count on this long term.

**Eventual Inheritance:**I can easily count on $200,000 (likely much more), but this is at least 20 years away.


Based on my budgeting, I could live a very nice and comfortable life on $5,000/month. I'm living on that now, because I sock away everything else.

I plan on keeping the real-estate because it produces 2/5 of the income I need to live. The buildings are managed, so there is minimal effort on my part. Once they are fully paid off (~15 years), the income will increase significantly.

Based on this information, what would you do in my situation to get to $5000/month indefinitely and how long would it take? Keep in mind that I'm not opposed to *some* work, so semi-passive income assets don't bother me much. What's most important to me is the ability to get up and go whenever I want, so nothing that ties me down to one location on a long-term basis.

Throw whatever you have at me, even if it's complicated. I love to learn and research.

I will work as long as needed to get to my goal, of course, the shorter the time-frame the better. My wife would consider working if need be as well because our son is starting a specialized school-program, which will free up much of her time.

I financed the 2.5i at ~$20,000 @ 3.9% for a $325/mo payment over 5 years.  Since then, I've paid it down to a little under $8,000 but have put on 83,000 miles.  While at the dealership, I made the impulse decision to trade in the 2.5i for a 2008 STi with 63,000 miles.  When all was said and done, I owe a little over $28,000, for a monthly payment of $434 over 5 years at 4.25%.  I'd guess that the car is worth about $25,000.

The thing is full as hell to drive, but every single day, I second-guess my decision.  I can afford the increased payment, but now I can't invest as much as I would like to.  I'd be lucky to be able to invest 10% next year..or save for house downpayment.

I've been trying to think of a plan of action, and would like some feedback.  Since I'm upside-down by about $3-4k, I could trade it in for a cheaper car after a few months of accelerated payments.  Another idea would be to just suck it up and trade it in for another car and tack on any loss from this car onto the next loan.

The next car would probably be another 2009 or 2010 2.5i which go for about $16,000 pre-tax.  If I trade in the STi, I would need a couple months to save up for all related taxes.  I love Subarus, and living in New England has me convinced that AWD is the way to go.

I am stressing and hoping you guys can help me out here.. I have a great job, about $35 an hour (at least 40 hours a week) so about 72k a year.. I currently still live with family to ""save up"" for a house of my own. I pay 250 a month cable bill to help out.

I also have a car payment at about $400 and insurance at about $400 and a cell phone for ~$215 a month. Gas only costs ~$30 a week..

As you can see I should be in a great state but I can never ""save"" and really am stressing. Every other week I end up very close to broke and struggle to get to my next paycheck.. I setup saving for $250 a paycheck to be taken out but end up always having to transfer it to pay for gas or food.

I only have 2 credit cards, once for $500 and the other is $300 and they are ALWAYS maxed out.. The problem is I can even pay them off but then get so broke I need to put more on them. 

Other than that I have an old credit card that was shut down when I got out of the military so it only has 1,200 and trying to pay it down... 

In the end I want to SAVE and be able to never worry about money obviously like everyone.. I think I'm almost addicted to shopping but really ""don't know"" where the money is going, I do eat out every day usually but in my job I work at client sites all days so its almost required.. 

Every paycheck is about 1900 so even if I pay my bills all in one (it should be only $1300) minus food and gas (maybe another 200) which should ALWAYS leave 400 left to save.. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?! :(

Dave Ramsey, Mr Money Mustache, ERE, this s ub, frugal, investing, etc. MMM and a few other blogs state that a 'safe withdrawal' rate from an investment account is 4%.

Questions in **bold** rest is information/rambling.

 [MMM says](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/) to reach this number, *To apply it in real life, just take your annual spending level, and multiply it by 25*. 

Currently my expenses for the past two years have averaged 27k. 27,000 * 25 gives me 675,000. So with this rule, the amount I need in an investment account is $675,000 before I can live off the interest. Based on my calculations at a 7% return rate, $675,000 minus the [Vanguard fee for VEXMX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0098&amp;FundIntExt=INT) of 0.028% will earn interest of $43,057.06. That's 40 years of saving $450 a month with 7% return, to be able to retire in **2054**.

Not exactly 'early'. 

My calculated expenses are $28,000. **Why am I waiting until I have nearly double this amount before it's considered 'early retirement safe'?**?! Based on my calculations as well, with a 7% return, at $475,770.12 in an investment account, I'll have enough to meet my $28,000 expenses off the interest! If I meet that goal, why does the 4% rule tell me to save up another $200,000?? 

 **Why is it not a good idea to just go ahead and retire at the $425k earning interest above/at my expense level?** I am asking this, because that difference at 7% is 5 years additional saving for me (about $450 a month I could save). 5 years early would be 35 years to retire. Better, but still not ideal. 


For the above calculations I'm assuming 'a safe return of 7%'. With this, and my savings amount of $450 a month... well, FI is impossible before year 40. That's a lot of damn years to be saving that much. That's about $120k. To put that into perspective, if I put $450 a month into paying my mortgage down instead, it'll be paid off in 13 years. No savings/investments though. Don't really want to go that route as I'd then be starting over for retiring early. **Should I be paying down debts/mortgage with my $450 a month instead of trying to invest?** I know the EARLIER you get started investing, the better off you are. I need to get started!


If I use the Vanguard ""10 year"" as return rate (10.7) on the [Vanguard EMF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0098&amp;FundIntExt=INT), then I could reach FI in 2032 with interest paying out over $28,000 on a balance of $329,990.12.  That's 18 years instead of 40!! That's my idea of early retirement!! That is my goal. That's great, but not realistic I know. Still, this value of $329,000 is way less than the $675,000 using the MMM method. It's more attainable to me, especially at only being able to put in ~20% of my earnings into savings. There is absolutely no way currently, that I could save more, I'm not even out of debt yet (~$80,000). 

Last few questions. 

Obviously investing all my money into one index fund is probably not the smartest idea, and so 'diversifying' is key. If all I have is $450 to save, even if I go with just one other index fund (say the Vanguard 500 one) then I have to split my $450 down to $225. This seems counterproductive to reaching FI. $225 into two accounts, compounds much slower than $450 into one. It would take me twice as long with two accounts to get to FI than with just one! The related question with this is **if I where to open another index fund account, should I open it at the same time as the first one, splitting $225 a month or put $450 into the first account, until it has enough money earned in interest ($3000) to open a second index fund THEN split the savings $225?**

I'm in my late 20's, not married but probably will be soon to long time gf. 

I make about 110-120k per yr depending on the yr, and she makes 60k. We live in one apartment in a small building that I bought a few years ago and fixed up, tenants in the other units cover mortgage, taxes, and insurance. The apartment is fine for now, but we'll need more space eventually. I plan to buy another multi-unit to live in, or a single family home and cover the majority of that mortgage with the income from the building I live in now. We live below our means and are debt free. There are some small expenses we could cut out like cable and eating out, but for the most part they're reasonable and are small conveniences that are worth it at the moment.

I've been contributing 20% to my 401k each year and she's been contributing 18%. Between the both of our 401k's, we have about 100k, and I have a Roth IRA with 30k in it as well. I also have an investing account with another 30k and then we have around 55k in cash. We didn't really plan on FI or early retirement, but I think we can pull it off. My only worry is that we've contributed too much to our retirement accounts and haven't been keeping enough invested outside of that to live on the returns before we hit the traditional retirement age.

As of June 1, 2013 we will have around $900 a month in total bills.  The house will be paid off.  We have no car payments or student loans.

However, at some point in the future we will need car issues fixed, possibly a bigger house (country living!), etc.

My husband likes to have money for his hobbies.  I encourage that.  We each put 50% of our paychecks towards bills.  As of June 1st, I'll be contributing significantly more money to my 403B.

He likely will inherit quite a bit from his parents as he's an only child.  I have no idea how much, but at least two very modest houses will be included.  I think this along with his modest income make him less likely to save more for the future.

Anyways, how much money are we going to need to retire?  How do I know if we have enough?  I've been trying to read through here and can't find much info.  Combined monthly income to the checking count is about $2004 (-$900 for bills as of 6/1/13).

Edit:  I'm checking out MMM right now.  If we take half of the $2004 a month and save that, maybe we could get closer to this FI.  We don't have cable and eat mostly at home, so we save money there.  I do garden for produce.

I have read this Bogleheads article on tax efficient asset placement (great read by the way): http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement

But I keep coming back to the Vanguard Tax-Exempt State Municipal Funds. (I live in a state that Vanguard offers. Here is an example for Florida: https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0518&amp;FundIntExt=INT) They seem to have many advantages: federally tax exempt, state tax exempt, decent return/risk for a bond fund, low expense, etc. 

Am I missing something? Are these funds a bad idea for some reason I am not seeing? I understand they may not have as high of a return as riskier investments and are still subject to inflation risk, but I like the tax-exempt side of it.

My tax-advantaged accounts are low cost index funds of about 80%/20% stocks/bonds and my Roth IRA is mostly in REIT's. I wouldn't put all non-tax-advantaged money in the municipal bond fund, but I was considering putting a majority there. Is this a bad idea?

Any insight is appreciated. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_1a8794,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1a8794/thoughts_on_vanguard_taxexempt_us_state_municipal/,

I'm 25 and I live in Berlin where I enjoy a high quality of living with comparatively low costs of living (right now my costs of living are less than 700€/month but I'm in the process of reducing that even further). I came across this subreddit and all the great blogs in its sidebar only this week and got absolutely hooked by it. I've basically been looking for something like this for a long time now.

Do any of you happen to know some places where I can get good info about achieving FI in Germany? Maybe you already found out some interesting bits in your research so far. Either links to good sources (like the thread you just mentioned) or tips/advice you yourself can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Any **books** or **websites** you can recommend that help me get into the whole investment/interest aspect of things as I'm not too familiar with that world so far. And most FI-related sites only reference US laws and options like the 401k and such. Right now I don't really understand much when I read things like 

&gt;I manage my finances myself and use low cost ETFs for the equity portion of my portfolio. I have read most of the books recommended here, and I hold a Master’s degree in Finance, so I understand quite well why index buy and hold investing is superior to actively managed funds.

(from the link by /u/adioz- above) partly due to English terminology but probably mostly because I don't have a Master's degree in Finance. I did my Abitur in Leistungskurs Wirtschaft/Recht if that helps though. ;P

I'll start off with my update. Goals were:

* Max out 2011 Roth IRAs ($10K)
* Max out 2012 Roth IRAs ($10k)
* Pay off remaining ""low-interest"" debt ($24k @4.99%)
* Start saving for a house

All DONE. We maxed out the 2011 Roth's prior to tax time in April, aggressively paid off the $24K in debt with the final payment sent in October, and I just transferred the last $2K to max out the 2012 Roth's. As for the house? We opened a savings account and have $1000 saved already!

How did we do it? The vast majority was made possible by a deployment - half of our living expenses virtually disappeared for the last 5 months with no decrease in income. However we also continued to cut even further with a variety of frugal tactics. I temporarily cancelled a cell phone, stopped eating out at restaurants or going to bars and instead started cooking for myself and having parties at home, turned down the thermostat/saving electricity, took in a roommate that cut my rent/expenses in half, etc. etc.

As monthly expenses go down, the need for monthly income drops. Thus putting us closer and closer to being able to live off of savings.

It is possible to do this! We're in our very young 30's and have cut our monthly bills by over 75% in the last 12 months. The next 25% will take much longer (due to less cash ""windfalls"") but we'll benefit from the mental momentum we've gained.

Definitely critique that as much as you can/want, I'm looking to make something useful, not feel good about myself.

So... here's my plan for now...

I'm planning on putting my next two months etrade $3k in VFSTX (maybe VFINX, Although I'm also considering Coca-Cola or Walmart, maybe even McDonalds...), I have two months to worry about which one... (suggestions?) (you have to put $3k to start on funds like those right?)

I have $400 in Ford (F) I was pulling $100 from each paycheck for two months and decided to dick around with it for fun.. figured ford was safe enough to not lose it all, but I'm not expecting to do anything other than clear my buy/sell commissions...

then adding $1,500 each month to that, pulling it out about this time next year to put 20% on a house ($90k-$100k not horrible for my area (central OK)) 10 year mortgage, try to pay it off it 5 (don't think it'll be a problem...)  around then my parents are moving to CO, I'll try to buy their house (worth ~$250k) and rent out the first house (dad owns a hardware store so I'm pretty handy, hopefully can take care of any issues myself)..  I'm expecting a 10% raise this month (part of agreement when I took my job)

in 2 years my gf (by then wife I hope) will be out of school and working (both are CS majors) hopefully pushing our income to &gt;$100k/yr  and I'm hoping with that we'll be retired 10-14 years from today (maybe right as 2nd house is done getting paid for) making me 34-38 and her 33-37 with 2 houses and hopefully ~700k invested

if you don't want to read through my entire post above (I don't blame you) I'm putting away $1500/mo (~60% of what I earn).. I hope I can tighten that up to 70% (I left my budget a little loose until I get a few months of tracking expenses figured out and can form a better budget)

I'm a software engineer in central OK, so ~50k isn't horrible starting for the area (nothing to brag about though), but I like my job, and it's close to home, and in the town I want to live it.

It's not important for me to be rich, I would just like to spend my days with my future family

I have no college degree, I didn't finish high school, my one saving grace is that I earn a good salary. I will make 105k this year and expect to be able to maintain or beat this amount for at least the next five years.
I want to pay off all my debt by June. I'd like to what an achievable time frame is for me to become FI?
 
I pay $28,800 in taxes (I'm in Australia) and $9,880 in rent. My insurance is $860 a year for car, $400 a year for contents, $520 a year for health insurance.
 
The rest has been put down to terrible spending, I've been an idiot for the last 12 years and want to turn this around. Please offer advice &amp; goals.

I recently turned 20 and tomorrow I am starting a one year education, with the purpose of preparing me for unknown, future university studies. I have now come to the sudden realization that, first of all, I have no idea what I want to do with my future, and second of all, I am becoming old (I have actually passed the 20-year-mark, which to me has always been the final line of transition into adulthood). 

I come from a swedish middle-class family. My parents don't make little, but they don't make much either, and (as with any 'regular' family, I guess) the discussion of money and resource has been ever present. 

I have always been terrified of living the regular 9 to 5 life with a villa, car, dog and two kids. I don't want that for myself. I don't want to ever have to worry about not having enough. And the thing that scares me most of all things is the possibility that I will hit the 40 mark, hating my life and wishing I had done things differently. I don't want to be AVERAGE. 

I consider myself lucky, and I consider myself unlucky.

Unlucky, because I am realizing this now, and not five or ten years ago.  

Lucky, because I am realizing this now and not in ten or twenty years, and because I am 'starting fresh'. I haven't yet decided on future studies. I haven't taken any loans. I am debt free. I have the ability to choose my path almost entirely from the beginning.

I am HELLBENT on reaching my goal of being a millionaire before the age of 40.

Obviously, I have come here for advice, but I will be very careful with any advice that is given to me. I understand that everybody is willing to give advice, especially those who do not know the answer. What I want is opinion and choice (if you are inclined to give uninspiring feedback, which I am sure some will be, please spare us both the time.)

Here are some of the things I am wondering:

1) How important is education in becoming very wealthy? 

2) What education would bring me closer to my goal of becoming a millionaire (except for doctor, lawyer or engineer)?

3) If I want to become a millionaire, will a 5 year long education strengthen or cripple me in my endeavour? Is it better to skip the education and start a business immediately if the reason I want to get an education is simply 'to have one'?

4) How much must I know about stock and similar investment to get started? (I know nada.)

5) If this sort of investment is recommended for reaching my goal, what are the best sources to learn from?

6) How likely am I to make money from real estate, and how difficult is it to get into that business?

7) Any other thoughts?



That's about it for now. I might add to the list later.

What investment returns would you need if you wanted to retire today? What dividend stocks have posted consistent returns annually? How much did you spend last month on food? How much did you earn in dividends? At current rates, how long do you have to wait to retire? If you’re laid off, how long will you last without a job? What percent of your income have you saved each month? Is your savings rate better than last year? If you want to travel, what type of hotel costs the same as staying at home? Exactly how much do you have saved in checking accounts, safety deposits, investment accounts, your 401k? What were your big expenses two months ago?

So I am wondering if I am investing/ doing things correctly, as it seems I may be quite ignorant to long term investing techniques, and would like some opinions on the matter.

Background:

    * Age: 26 working in the Computer Industry
    * Salary: 78k/Year Pretax +3k Bonus +3% Avg Raise
    * Savings: 45k
    * 401k: 12k, Set at 6% of Salary, with 3% Company Match Capped
    * Roth IRA: 10.5k (at fidelity, currently invested in few stocks and fidelity etf, though overall majority votes for vanguard etfs)
    * Some cash in company stock via Vested RSU's, and options avg. 15k, excluding espp.
    * Single, saving while living with parents, own my own car/motorcycle, no debt, no loans, credit cards paid off every month.
 
 
My only cost is food for myself, a girlfriend, and some bills, but not much.
 
 
I am wondering what else I should be doing as in terms of saving, investing, as most of my paychecks go into savings(70%, 10% into ESPP,  20% to spend).  Should I transfer all my roth into ETF's instead of playing risky?  What should i do with the 45k in savings, as it would not cost me much in case of emergency (my assumption is 4k for 6-8 months)
I am already contributing to max match for 401k, but that is only 8~9k a year.  Should I max that out?

I always wanted to try to flip a house or do other side jobs as an extra income, or purchase and rent out a house.

The plan I have just laid out puts all my eggs in one basket, but that basket is filled with property. Is this a good plan, bad plan, needs work plan? I have run the numbers on the stock market, and my plan seems to be superior.

Recently I paid off my all my debt, and landed a high income job. Currently I have a piece of land worth $60,000.00 with the neighbors itching to buy it. I also have $15,000.00 in cash, which amounts to about 6 months living expenses. Starting next month, I will have $6,000.00 to invest every month, after my bills are paid.

I currently live in a state where housing is cheap and rent is relatively high in comparison. A friend of mine has five rent houses, each with a purchase price of $40-50,000.00 and rental rates from $500-800.00.

I worked my way through college for a property management company, so the maintenance and upkeep of property would not be a problem. In fact I love to work with my hands and managing the property and doing repairs, would be my retirement dream job.

My current plan is to start buying rental property, once I have saved up the cash for the full purchase price. Assuming I don't get promoted, assuming I can keep the house rented the entire 5 years, and assuming each house needs minimum work to be ready to rent. At an average purchase price of $40,000.00 and an average rental price of $700.00, I could purchase 13 houses in 5 years. This would give me a annual income from rental property alone of $109,000.

Now let's talk real world situation. I will probably not be able to keep them rented, and will likely need to make repairs on each purchase. Worst case scenario puts me at 10 houses. However I will likely be promoted in 3 months, which will put me at an average $7500.00 per month available for investment. In two years, I will likely be promoted again, to $9,000.00 per month available for investment. With these increases in income, I should still be on track to purchase 13 houses in 5 years, even if I can't keep them rented.

I can here the skeptic wheels turning. To show you the kind of house one can buy for cheap in my area, [example rent house](http://www.century21.com/property/1002-frisco-chickasha-ok-73018-C2137546057)

Well this feels awkward, first time I've shared my plans with anyone except my girlfriend - but you guys seem pretty like minded!

Ok, a bit about me and my girlfriend we're both 22, I'm starting Uni in September for 3 years, my gf the year after for 4years (possible PhD after for her too so +3years maybe) I'm studying Computer Science she will be studying Physics.

We're planning on saving our asses off to be able to buy a smallholding in somewhere around 15 years where I will start to help us live more frugally off the land, whilst working part time hopefully from home at that point. Then we plan to rebuild savings and live off the interest eventually (we aimed at £250k in savings to live off the interest, mostly for comfort - wouldn't actually need that much I think.) This should take another 8 years. So Semi-Retirement in 15 living the simple life, total financial freedom 8 years later.

Now the background info is over I have a spreadsheet I have made some basic plans on, and I would sincerely appreciate any constructive criticism! I believe it's pretty straightforward, if you're not from UK an ISA is a tax free savings acct that you can put in £5,640/year each tax free! The spreadsheet handles any tax on interest over this amount with the interest put in at (a very conservative) 3% constant, however it's relative.

Expected income is joint (2 people) career projection, I believe I have been conservative but please tell me if I'm wrong or severely off track.

Over the last 2 years or so, my salary has increased quite a bit from switching jobs (boss put me in for promotion at my current one too) and my wife was promoted. Even though we live in a high cost-of-living area, we've been really trying to figure out our retirement savings and are pushing for a retirement in our mid 40's. Here is the current skinny:

* My salary: $97k (probably 10% raise soon, which I plan on putting toward the mortgage)
* Wife's salary: ~~$72k~~ $43k (She's gone part time so that she can stay home with the little one. We currently pay for zero daycare)
* Home - Approx. Worth: $400k.  Mortgage: $285k @ 4.75% (refi'ed last year)
* No other debt (just paid off my student loans after 8 years, yay!)
* 2 cars paid off (2003 Jetta w/ 85k miles, 2009 Mini w/ 35k miles)
* ~120k in our 401k's between us. We both currently contribute 12%
* ~60k in Roth IRA's between us. We currently both fully fund our Roth's.
* $35k emergency fund, between a savings account and a fairly liquid taxable mutual fund account. 

Ever since I paid off my student loans, we've been firing an extra $800/mo at the mortgage (min payment is $1550ish).  We might start putting more toward it, but we haven't *fully* figured out how our budget will be effected by A) a baby  and B) my wife at 60% salary.

My wife and I make ~150k per year, putting us in the 28% tax bracket. She has the choice to withhold into a roth401k or traditional. If your plan were financial independence in a few years, you would defer all of it into a traditional, and then slowly move it to a roth over 5 or 10 years [401k to trad IRA to rothIRA over time]. 

Is there another way of thinking? If the stock market goes up by a factor of 2, our 100k deferred turns into 200k, and it'll take much longer to move it into a roth (assuming 35k living costs, 35k conversion and attempting to stay under ~70k taxable income during early retirement). In this case, it may have been better to just pay the tax early on and be done with it.

What are your thoughts? I feel like getting a significant fraction of our net worth into a tax-free account (tax free growth and distributions) is good in the face of fiscal trouble (national debt, rising taxes).  the roth 401k is a way to do that quickly. 

What are your thoughts?

After taxes, getting married and paying off our student loans we have about $500,000 saved up from the sale. Majority of it is spread across index funds. Our monthly expenses are about 5k. 

I'm still employed at the acquirer and have really hit a wall. The work is slow and uninteresting. I'm thinking about quitting soon and I'm not sure what my next move will be, but I definitely want to take some time off. So my question is - 

1. How can I invest my existing capital to ensure that I don't have to work again? Is it even possible?
2. What would you do if you were in my position?

This is my first post on this section, and even on reddit as a whole so feel free to correct me if needed :)

I am a french guy, now living in the netherlands with a permanent contract. My girlfriend and me are both engineers so we make quite a decent living.

I read the blog of MMM for some time now, and started to apply some of his advices. We dropped the car, reduced my phone/cable/internet/energy bills, changed my work schedule to reduce commuting costs, . . .
I want to keep putting some money on the side in case something happens, but combined we could invest a monthly amount around 800 euros without problem.
We don't have any loan or mortgage, but we still rent our house though.

For now, the money is all going to our basic saving account, with a net interest of 1.60%.
We want to do better with that money, and invest in something and obvisouly better than the current 1.6%.
Thing is, we plan to change country every 4/5 years (it is our own way to discover the world :)).

I considered buying a house in France a few months ago and rent it(as this is the only place where I am sure to have reliable people for a long time), but my banker said that in this case I would be taxed in both the netherlands and France. Basically, that would mean something like 40% from the rent to the netherlands system, and 35% on top of it for France (yeah, I love my home country :S). That would reduce the interest rate to something equivalent to the current saving account, so far from beneficial :s.

And we don't really want to buy a house in the netherlands and end up in the same situation in a few years when we'll relocate.

So far, bankers have been less than able to give us good advice about investment, and basically stop at ""put all the money on the simple saving account"".
The only thing is that I would like to avoid going into stocks, not so much for the crisis or else, but simply because I am against the current stock exchange system as a whole. Other than that, I am quite open to anything that could bring us more than those 2% and even started to look at peer lending and bitcoins ^^.

Would you have any advice/ideas/options for us?

I know that closing accounts can have a negative effect on the credit score because it can lower your utilization ratio (I think thats the correct term) and multiple inquiries can lower your score because that tends to indicate you are higher risk. But my question is how significant are the negative impacts of opening an account just for the bonus, then closing it and moving to the next one? 

Does it have an additive effect where by continuing this behavior I could go from 750 down to 450 based solely on that one tendency (I don't think this is likely)? Or would it have some measurable effect, but then plateau?

There seem to be a lot of cards that I could open for big bonuses without having to pay fees, meet certain spending requirements, then close and move on to the next one. Does anyone know of someone that has done this on a large scale and what the effect was? Any articles addressing this possibility?


I'm not sure this is quite the right subreddit for this question, but I figured that if you can get something for almost nothing (other than spending time signing up for and cancelling cards) you guys might have an opinion or knowledge on it.

Five months ago, my boyfriend and I adopted our first dog, Frank. On just his second day in our home, he got pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. In all, his vet bills were over $800. We paid the bills without thinking about it much - we just adopted him after all, and $800 didn't seem like *too* much.

Last night, we adopted a second dog, Curly, who we are taking to his first check up with the vet tomorrow.
Then this morning, Frank broke off his leash, dashed away and ended up breaking his leg.

With our recent adoption and Frank's broken leg, you can see why this has been on our minds. Depending on the nature of the break, Frank's vet bills could be anywhere from $200-$5,000.
Curly's vet check up could result in who knows what.
    
So how do you put the price on your pet's life? I'm trying to find a balance between not jeopardizing my finances and keeping my pets healthy.

I know opinions on this vary widely and emotions come into play. My boyfriend and I both grew up in rural Indiana with old fashioned views on dogs. Growing up, our dogs rarely went to the vet and if a bill was too expensive, my dad put him down with a shotgun in the backyard. So now that I have pets of my own, I am in this space where I need to consider what value I give to my dogs. I love them so much. But with so much student loan debt and a goal of financial independence, how much should I really be spending on my dogs?
    
I'd be interested to hear from others and start a discussion.

We've been thinking about setting a lifetime dollar limit on each dog, say $5,000. But then once a dog reaches $5,000, then what? If he gets put down and we adopt again and the $5,000 lifetime limit is reset, then what was the point? 
Setting an annual dollar limit seems ineffective, because large vet bills usually come sporadically.

I learned most of these from guys at work that also have a decent chunk of income each year.

* Max out your regular 401k contributions, even if you don't get employer match. Go for the roth 401k, most likely your employer match will be with pre-tax dollars anyway, but with the roth you basically end up saving more. This year that should be $17,500.
* This won't work for everyone. But if your employer allows for ""in plan withdraws"" from your 401k while you are still employed there it should. Max out your after-tax 401K contributions. This year you can have total contributions of $51K into your 401k account. That means if your employer matches 0% (assholes) then you can contribute $33,500 into an after-tax 401k given you have $17,500 going into your roth 401k. Afterward, roll over the $33,500 from your after-tax 401k into your roth IRA.
* Make a non-deductible contribution of $5,500 to a regular IRA. Afterward, roll that over into your roth IRA. Now you have ~$56,500 in your roth IRA + 401k that grows tax deferred forever and no taxes on withdraws.
* Now max out your HSA contributions. Your employer might help here as well, but check for that. Depending on the family situation the total going into the HSA can be anywhere from $3K to $6K or so. Not only are those funds taken out your paycheck before taxes, but they also grow tax deferred and can be withdrawn tax-free for qualified medical expenses.
* Then go buy $10K worth of I-bonds. Interest on these will grow tax-deferred. Later on in life you'll try to time the withdraw of these so that you're in a lower tax bracket upon redeeming them.  You can also buy $10K of series EE bonds.
* Got a kid? A niece? A nephew? Contribute to their 529 account. Earnings in these accounts grow tax deferred and can be withdrawn tax free if they are used for qualified educational expenses. For me I put around $6K per kid into these accounts each year.
* Have a low income family member you trust? Maybe a sister / brother? You can gift to them up to $13K each year. Make sure they use that money to put into their own Roth IRA / I-bonds (they can always get the I-bonds but make sure they have taxable income so they can do the Roth IRA contribution)


For me this adds up to about ~$105K each year in investments that are in tax-deferred or tax exempt vehicles. Naturally, you put the most tax-inefficient investments here. Stuff like REITs, TIPS, stocks or bond funds that have large amounts of income / dividend payouts.
Now with any remaining income, you buy stock funds with very low dividend yields and place those in your taxable account. If they have low turnover and minimal dividends, they will basically grow tax deferred.

Have ~$3K saved up.  Own a condo (put $60K down) that costs me ~$1,600/month (includes HOA, Insurance, Taxes, Interest).  Only contributing 1% to my 401K (company matches up to 5%).

Definitely feel like the condo was a bit too pricey for my current situation, but I love it, love the area I'm in, and, from what I believe it will have a higher chance of appreciating in value compared to other properties in the area.  I've been living in it since Oct 2012.  

Short term goals (before the end of the year):
- Save $10K as 'emergency funds'
- Contribute more to 401K once I have a decent amount saved in bank or if I get a raise.

Mid term goals (sometime next year):
- Move out of condo and rent it out.  Hoping to rent it out for more than the mortgage.  When I bought it, I just tested the waters by putting it up for rent and found at least 5-6 people interested in paying $1750 a month for it.  Back then, I was paying roughly ~$1450/month.  It went up this year because my HOA went up $50 a year and there is now a special assessment which will result in a price hike of $75 a month for the next 5 years.  I will also find myself something cheaper to reduce my monthly payments.  If I want to live by myself in the same area, I can easily find something for $1000-$1200.

Long-term goals:
- Once I'm contributing my max to 401K and have my emergency funds lined up, I wanted to save up another 10K to invest in stocks, but that will be a while from now.

So basically I have a rough plan as to what I want to do for the next year or so.  I'm a software engineer, so I want to get off my ass and earn some money on the side some how.  Anyway, wanted to hear from other FI'ers how I can modify my goals and what else I should be focusing on.

Thanks!

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for the helpful responses.  I guess I'm not in as good of a position as I thought.  I realize my mortgage is what is killing me now, and I expected this to be difficult because of that, but I didn't realize how much I should be saving for this goal to really happen.

This is my first post.. I've been a bit of a lurker, but this environment seems so friendly I wanted to ask all of you a question! :)

I'll make it short and sweet. I bought a car last year. I think out the door it was like 19-21K. I put a 7K down payment. My car loan over 60 months is $250/month. 

Since I bought the car last June, I have been putting down $500/month. When I got my tax return I put that all towards the car as well. So I'm currently sitting on a balance of $9100 left. 

Ideally, I'd like to pay off the car this year. I think I can do it but I would be sacrificing a lot of my money on doing this.

My question - should I pay my car off as soon as I can? This way I won't have any debt and can start saving a lot of money once I have the car paid off?

OR

Should I chill out a bit. Start putting around $300/month allowing me to have more money/month that I can use towards saving now so I can start investing sooner, and just pay off the loan over time?

The interest on the loan is sub 2% so I'm not concerned about that. 

Sorry this post ended up being longer than I thought but I just really need some advice I'm so torn between what to do! Thanks for any help :)

tl;dr - have a balance of $9,100 on my car loan. Do I pay it off as quick as I can  so I can start saving lots of money once it's paid off or spread the payments out so I can have more money to play with now?

I was planning on putting all extra money toward the loans to pay them off in 3-5 years.

I make $75k and my employer contributes 15% of my salary to a retirement account that I will be setting up with Vanguard in July.  I then have the option of contributing any of my own money to a 401k.

I wasn't going to contribute anything to the 401k until my loans were gone, but I have been contemplating contributing some because of my high tax rate.  I know people say putting $1000 toward a 6.8% loan is like getting a 6.8% return, but how does this work when I am getting taxed 29.1% (federal and state) on my top dollars?

I would like to retire early, so I would go from single $75k to married ~$50k or so in today's dollars.  I imagine this would be a reduction in tax rate, although nobody can predict the future.  So if I saved 29% now on the invested money and paid 15-20% when it came out, how does that affect my return?

The way I see it, I could max out my 401k for only $12,408 a year due to the tax savings.

Here is my situation: I am 24 and working as a design engineer. I have remaining on my student loans about 50k. After all my expenses and my loan minimum are paid I am left over with, depending on the month, 1400-1600 extra. I have been struggling with where to allocate this money. Would you recommend:

1. Using all of it to aggresively pay down the loan to get out of debt (6.875% interest rate).
2. Contribute monthly to a Roth and use the remaining on the loan (would obviously take longer to pay off the loan).
3. Increase 401k contribution to 10% and use the remaining on the loan (I already contribute 6% which my company matches 100%).

Also, I have about $12k in an investment account that I trade individual stocks with. Not frequent trading, but I keep it active as I learn how to be an investor. Another thing I struggle with is should I remove that money completely and make a big payment on the loan? Or continue to have it invested.

I really dislike having the student loan debt and its my goal to get out of it quickly. But I feel like a plan for setting myself up greatly for the future while taking a little more time on the loans might be more appropriate. What does everyone think? Thanks!

It's time again for our monthly reflection thread. For those of you who are new to r/fi, the reflection thread is where we open discussion to Financial Independence-related items that have come up in your life in the past month. Seeing as I wasn't able to post one last month, this one will cover both October and November, 2012.

* Reflect. What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (For example, a recipe we might like like, a nice photo of your awesome commuter bike, or a link to a great DIY guide, go ahead and post it!)

* Newbies (and there are many of you!), introduce yourselves. What brought you to r/fi? What are your life goals? How do your financial goals fit in with them? We love to hear from our new readers, don't be shy!

My question relates to the timing of purchasing property if my goal is to achieve an *almost* independent lifestyle within the next ten years by creating a mostly self-sufficient homestead. I expect that eventually our yearly budget (two people here) will be around 5-6k once we finally get everything set up and our only expenses are insurance/property taxes/emergency food.

I plan on working at least part-time until I retire, because I am a workaholic and become bored without a job.

Basically my question is whether it is better to purchase a property as soon as we have enough for 30-40% down so we can move onto it and start making improvements, or is it better to save up and have a larger down payment, possibly buy the whole thing in cash? I expect the former would take 2-3 years and the latter 5-8 years depending on what is on the market. I believe our mortgage would be about the same or cheaper than renting an adequate apartment.

I'm trying to get a sense as to how this relates to me, and this subreddit doesn't seem to get a lot of action, so help me out here.

I don't want to go through a detailed budget, but here is the basics for me:

30/m/married - 1 kid (1mo old, yay!)
29 years left on a 30 yr mortgage
No consumer debt
No car loans
In about 3 months, no student loans
No other loans of any sort

We contribute to our 401k's up to their respective match, fully fund IRA's, etc.  Any extra money we have is going toward paying off the mortgage early, adding to the 401k, or buffering our taxable accounts (or any combo of those 3).

I would say that roughly, our expenses (with mortgage) are $5k/mo.  If our mortgage disappeared (I can forsee this in 10yrs or less), We would be very comfortable on 2-3k/mo. 

**Is it safe to say, that the whole idea of FI/ER is to have enough passive income, or be able to withdrawal from 401k/IRA at a rate to sustain your expenses?**  For our case, if we pay off our mortgage, have an investment balance of $600k by then, and hope to conservatively make 5-6%, we could feasibly both retire or go very-part-time, right? This isn't even considering the idea of downsizing our housing after paying it off, and pocketing the profits.

April showers bring May flowers, and hopefully great progress on your quest toward financial independence! It's time to reflect on the month that was:

* Reflect. What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (If you have a recipe we might like like, a picture of the homebrew you made this month, or a picture of your RV interior, go ahead and post it!)

I recently graduated and I have a job as a software developer. I currently live in a rental flat with my SO, but the lease is about to end (August) and we cannot renew the lease. I am unsure if I should purchase a house or rent another apartment. Note, I am located in Denmark, Europe.

The problem with apartments (rental scenario) are the associated noise and lack of options for changing or improving things.

The problem with housing (purchase scenario) is that I am tied down and practically all of my income is tied into the house - this is almost regardless of what kind of a dump I purchase, because either it is expensive and I don't have to fix a lot of things, or it is a little less expensive and there's a ton of things I have to fix. 

I work 45 kilometers away (that is about 28 miles for you imperials out there), and the public transport will take 3 hours a day to to back and forth so I opted for a car (with all the associated costs of it) which will take about 55-60 minutes a day of transport.

My SO studies where we currently live, so either we both have to travel half-way or one of us has to travel the full distance - we are more interested in the latter approach. 

I get a decent wage 420.000 DKK (ca 72.000 USD) a year, after taxes and pension that amounts to about 240.000 DKK (ca 41.000 USD) to be used on savings, living expenses, food etc. My SO gets about 62000 DKK (11.000 USD) a year in stipends and has no debt, nor will she have any debt when she finishes this summer. (We expect her to be able to find a job which will provide approximately the same amount of wage as me, so ~ 72.000 a year. I have wiped out my savings on the car. Still have an emergency fund for dental bills etc. 

I've begun reading the links in the side-bar but at this pace, I'll be in my retirement age of 67 by the time I am done reading, what are the essentials to find out what to do and how to do it?

We don't spend a lot on food, I do spend a fair bit of money on tech-equipment to be up-to-date in my job and my hobbies are also centered around tech equipment (computers, electronics and the likes).

I have about 100.000 DKK (ca 17.000 USD) in student debts, that I am starting to make payments on, apart from that I have no other debts

Children are not a part of the plan as of this moment but that could change. 

I have no investments, I don't have any money to invest at the moment however I would like to get into this once I get a decent amount saved again.

So to sum it all up:

* What are the essentials to read, on what to do and how?

* How do I make a plan on what to do, how to do it and generally find my way around?

* Rent or purchase? Rental(apartment) or purchase (dump (incl. cost to fix it up) vs a generally good house (which thus does not have so many things to fix, but is a lot more expensive))

* Concerning investments, I have none but also don't know where to begin with this.

Hm, that ended up being a massive wall of text, I apologise about that, but I could really need some help.

I am a semi-new reddit reader, and this is my first account/post, inspired by this subreddit. I did a brief search, but if my question is directly answered in previous threads, my appolgies just let me know. But here is my situation:

**I EDITED this post following lots of advice, mostly regarding my skewed perspective on what I will make, and what I need to live on**

I am about halfway through medical school, and engaged to a nurse. By the end of med school I will be 26, starting 4 years of Residency (being paid ~$50k/yr for those four years), and married to a nurse (I have never asked but I am guessing also ~$50k/yr), but will have kids during Residency, which will both increase cost of living, and decrease my future wife's salary, as she is already planning on transitioning to part time once that happens. I will also graduate with ~$500k in med school debt. 


Once Residency is over I can start making low six figures, and work up to mid six figures eventually.


I would like to be financially independent and able to live a decent lifestyle (maybe around ~~$200k/yr~~ **$100k/yr** level) by my ~~late 40s~~ **mid 50's**. I have no investments now, and no income other than ~$20k/yr off my student loans for living expenses, school costs etc. 


What (if anything) can I do now or in the near future to start my financial indepence journey off right? I had a doc recommend I start a small EFT now, even though loan interest might be about the same if not higher than that yeild, because you have to have some sort of investment vehical or you won't contribute to anything, and starting in your 20's makes a big difference compared to starting in your 30's. But reading this reddit makes me consider a Roth IRA. What is your advice? 


Note that I am quite new to all this, so if my understanding is somewhat nieve or lacking, my appologies.

Thanks!

**Following the advice, I adjusted my goals a bit, and most advice seems to suggest that I focus on paying off loans FIRST before starting investing. This is still a lingering question for me though, is there some benefit to having SOME sort of investment started, just so psychologically I am building a lifelong habit of smart investing?

He is earning swagbucks, earning credit card bonuses, freelancing, cutting costs, as he attempts to pay off his mortgage before he turns 30. 

I think one of my biggest failures with this notion of financial independence is that it's really too big to take on as a goal in and of itself. As a result, I end up pushing a rope. I'm going forward, but it feels rather aimless. 

I've been working at making our lives more frugal, more simple, and working toward financial independence. I've added 40K to our net worth over the last 2 years, but this number is all over the place depending on the market. I've really only added 32K of real money.

However, MFby30 is going to have a house paid off and that's much more concrete. His mortgage will always be paid off and will be one less expense to pay for as long as he owns the house.

The more I think about this, the more I think I should really attack to mortgage. I don't want to be stupid about it and miss free money on my 401k like the dude with the college loan. However, I think with our 17K of free cashflow and 10K Roth contributions, various CDs, Ibonds etc.  for a one time payment of 70K. That'd be a couple of years ... 3 tops to pay off our mortgage. 

Once complete this would be like getting a 10K per year raise after only a few years worth of sacrifice. I know much of the conventional wisdom states that this 4.7% interest loan is pretty cheap and I'd have better luck investing. However, I can't think of a single investment that would result in a 10K per year dividend. Am I missing something fundamental here?

I deleted it because this subreddit is not a place to promote our--sorry--random crap that's unrelated to financial independence. Please don't make my life harder by posting it. [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/vgP1x.png)

2. Someone [posted a link to a website that sells tiny houses](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nm2og/how_much_is_enough/c3a6cpb). I've allowed this kind of stuff in the past, but on reflection, I don't think I will in the future.

Here's why: 

* I don't want this to be a place for people to promote their business.
* This kind of stuff just isn't necessary for attaining financial independence. 
* If even one person goes to a $299 workshop as a result of visiting this subreddit, we have failed as a community.

So as a future guideline, I've added this rule: 

*Do not link to sites that are primarily trying to sell us something.*

This means that if we can get the relevant information out of a site without buying anything, it's allowed. If we can't, it isn't. Book recommendations are an exception, since people can get them at their local library or through interlibrary loan. Blogs are allowed, but please think twice about whether it's worth people's time to read them.

Anyway, if you see anyone breaking this rule or the other rules, you have the option to downvote, and I'd also ask you to 'report' the post so a mod sees it.

I have a question that probably isn't too common on this sub. I'm only 18 (well 19 in less than 3 weeks) and in my first year at college right now. The catch is that I'm going on a full scholarship, where I actually receive money for attending this university. It's supposed to be ~$600/quarter (so about $2K/year), but because my middle class parents are willing to cover expenses like books and other misc. fares that some of the money is supposed to go to, I'm getting closer to $2K/quarter (or $6K/year). I'm not necessarily frugal, but I don't like spending money needlessly, so most of it just goes in my bank account. I had about $2000 before this year, but my first check put me at about $4300. I'm majoring in computer science by the way, in case that's relevant.

So my question is, what should I be doing with this money? My dad wants me to start my Roth IRA or something, which I know is a (safe?) retirement fund. Is that the only thing I should look into? How much should I be investing? I've talked to some of the scholarship's ""society"" and they basically expect that we get internships (paid preferably), so in 2013, I should be making more than the $6000 from my scholarship. (Obviously I don't know what quality internship so I can't put a figure.)

Any guidance would be great.",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_15xyag,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/15xyag/investing_money_i_make_from_going_to_college/,

In my microeconomics class, our teacher brought in a guess speaker for a one hour personal finance crash course. He began talking to us about budgeting, and he asked how we felt about it. The general consensus was that a budget was “lame,” “restrictive,” or “pointless.” He then told us to imagine that we were 21, and we needed to make a budget. The class came to a general consensus that this would be a “frugal” starter budget:

Rent	                                $700

Partying		                $400

Food			                $300

Car Loan		                $200

Incidental		                $200

Utilities	                   	$175

Car insurance	                $150

Gas			                $120

Cell Phone		                $50

Internet		                $40

Cable			                $35


Total			               $2370

Yes, people really thought that spending $400 on bar hopping was frugal. The speaker made a few comments on the budget, and said that unless we wanted to live in a trailer park, we would have to spend $800 on rent. He also insisted that a car, cell phone, and cable were basic human needs in the 21st century. Apparently cable is a human need, while health insurance is not.  Many people in my class commented that this budget seemed really small, and he assured them that once they made more money, they could get a better car and a mortgage, they just needed to make a few “sacrifices” in the beginning. 

Then he talked to us about 401k and IRA. He said that if we just put 10% of our net pay in a 401k or IRA at 5% interest, we would have $1,000,000 by the time we want to retire at 60! Everyone in the class made wooing sounds, and the kid behind me said that compound interest is the most powerful thing in the world. 

I said that his model ignores inflation, taxes, and banking fees. He looked at me, laughed, and went on talking about the services that the bank he works for offers. He urged us all to open a saving account with .01% interest and several monthly fees.

I felt a bit angry that my economics teacher allowed for all this misinformation to propagate, and the fact that the lesson was just a sales pitch to open up a bank account. 

Is this how the FI community remembers their personal finance education?

I already have a solid emergency fund, no debt, and am maxing out my 401(k) contributions (above the line).  Unfortunately, my employer's current 401(k) plan doesn't allow after-tax contributions to the non-Roth 401(k), so I'm capped at 17.5k on that.  This leaves me with a good chunk of change that I want to invest but am not sure the best way to do so.

I've had some suggestions to go for the backdoor Roth IRA, but as I understand it that is capped at $5,500 to a traditional IRA which I then roll into a Roth, is that correct?  What's the best way to handle a backdoor IRA if I'm over the traditional and Roth IRA income limits?

At this point is my best bet simply a taxable brokerage account?  I have no immediate plans to buy a house as I wish to remain geographically mobile, but I could see myself buying in 3-6 years if I settle down somewhere, so I'd like to be able to use at least some of my investments for that (I'm planning on being able to withdraw my previous contributions to my Roth IRA to help with this, for example).  Other than that my goals are a solid retirement fund and hopefully early retirement.

Edit: My employer also doesn't offer an HSA.  And I'm not referring to contributing to a Roth 401(k), I'm talking about after-tax contributions to a standard 401(k) so I can get up to the 51k limit, but unfortunately my employer doesn't offer the ability to contribute after-tax to my 401(k) so I'm limited to 17.5k.

Looking to see if anyone has created a spreadsheet on making the decision, looking at inflation, mortgage costs, expected housing value change vs return from investing. Sourced inputs for well established average values for those modifiers would be useful as well.
Background, I am 25, put away 15% for retirement (10% + 5% match), plus 5,000 for Roth. Live conservatively, but in highish cost area. I have about $800 left over after budgeting per month and currently pay $600 flat for rent (no utilities, crazy good deal for the area) of a room in a house. 

I have a sizable investment fund that I could buy a house with outright in a cheaper area, but I don't want to pull everything out of the market and expose myself to that much real estate risk. That said I could put $30,000-~50,000 down comfortably.I think I would be able to afford a $200,000 to (at the very high end) $300,000 house. 

What I cannot decide is whether that money, plus the monthly payments and mortgage costs, are better off long term in a house or in the market. I would probably also rent out a room or two in the house for cheap ~$600 to good tenants. 

Originally I had decided no, but a older coworker pointed out that with all signs pointing to inflation in the future buying a house now on a fixed mortgage could be a good move. Which is an argument that kind of makes sense to me.

Sorry for the long post! Thanks for any advice!

edit: added detail

OK here is the spreadsheet I created. Though admittedly the results don't make things that much more clear. It clearly shows that in purchasing a house you end up heavily affected by any downturn in housing prices. Though if there is even a little bit of appreciation the upside seems better than I would have though, depending on how all the variables are set.

 If anyone is interested, please review and let me know if you find any errors, things I did not account for etc. I changed the values for house price, investment size, etc, but my assumptions for the %'s used for calculations are left the same, obviously the are area specific but let me know if they seem ridiculous.

I apologize for being lax and not making these community thread posts for a few months now! For our new members, these monthly community threads are a place to reflect on our progress towards financial independence and share tips and inspiration. For example:

* Reflect. What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (If you have a recipe we might like like, a picture of the homebrew you made this month, or a picture of your RV interior, go ahead and post it!)

* Newbies (and there are many of you!), introduce yourselves. What brought you to r/fi? What are your life goals? How do your financial goals fit in with them? We love to hear from our new readers, don't be shy!

I've been doing the whole planning for retirement bit, but I'm wondering what I should switch it up to make my goal more achievable/realistic.

Personal details:

* Married, no kids (though likely in the future).
* Ages 26 and 28.

Income:

* Both employed with a combined income of $150,000/year.

Investments:

* Roth 401k with my company. It currently has about $50,000. I put 10% of my salary in (~10k/year) and they match 3%.
* Roth IRA with Vanguard. I started it two years ago and have been maxing it out each year. It has about $13,000 in it.
* Traditional 401k with ~3,000 in it (from my husband's previous job)
* Soon we'll have another Traditional 401k, as the benefits from my husband's new job are about to kick in.

Savings:

* We have a high-interest checking account that returns 2% APY up to $25,000. We currently have $33,000 in there.

Debt:

* We have a house valued at $210,000 on which we currently owe $120,000. It is a 15 year mortgage that we just refinanced at 2.75%.


Currently, we spend about 50% of our income on the mortgage, utilities, insurance, gas, groceries, shopping, etc. We keep our checking account at a base of $30,000 (though I'm trying to convince my husband that we should lower that to at least $25,000) as an emergency fund.

At the end of the month, whatever is in our checking account that is over $30,000 goes to the mortgage.

Questions:

* Should I be saving more in my 401k?
* Should I open an investment account that isn't tied to retirement, or should I just keep using that money to pay off the mortgage?
* Is there anything else I should be doing?

The purpose of this post is to get a sense of what steps I need to take to prepare myself for college graduation in a year. I have had the good fortune to go have both gone to a school with a great financial aid program and a family who has been able to afford any school costs. However, as it should be, my family will only be able to provide for me until graduation. Currently my finances are very much intertwined with those of my parents. I have a shared bank account with my father in a federal credit union. With unpaid internships and a low paying job on campus during the school year I haven't had time to accumulate much money after spending on living expenses at school (the least I can do to help out my family). I do have some money invested (it is all in one stock and fluctuates between 3-4k) that I inherited from my great grandmother when I turned 18. As a rule of thumb I have not touched it in the 2/3 years since it came to be mine. I do not have a credit card and as such no credit score. 

If all goes according to plan I will graduate with no student loans. However, I still do not feel I have the appropriate foundation for financial independence. I do not need or want my parents to be linked to my financial life through shared bank accounts and the like (I recently got a letter from my bank that when I turn 21 I have the option to sever this tie - which prompted this post). 

Before going back to school I have made it a priority to get a credit card for the year with the purpose of building some credit. I would simply make any purchases I would normally make on my debit card on my credit card. I also am trying to put in place a process by which the bank would take out 50 dollars a month from my paycheck and put it into my investment fund.

Other than that, what other things can I do to be in a position to be financially independent upon graduation. Should I open a different bank account with a different bank or simply retain the one I have with the credit union my parents use? What credit card company should I use?  Retirement, investments - what do I do? This is all working under the assumption that I will find a job within 3 months of graduation. I know this all seems very general but I am sure many of you here have gone through the same thing and have advice on what to do or not to do and how to best prepare myself.

I am looking for a bit of advice on what actions I should take regarding my company 401k program. I am eligible to start on July 1st and the company matches 50% of contributions up to $1000, and you can choose to put it towards a ROTH IRA or traditional.

We use as many ERE guidelines as possible since we discovered it last year and while we don't need to, it's great living more frugally and actually be saving something! I have a 350K house and owe about 50K on it, this is on offset mortgage (i.e. the principal is calculated as loan - balance of all other accounts on a daily basis). We'll probably put the money in the account to remove the debt on this house in the next few months, assuming that's the right move. We are in Australia so our mortgage rates are much higher than in the rest of the world, and we don't have any other debts.

My rationale for putting the money into the offset mortgage account was simply that it gives us the freedom to take the money if we need it, but also means that we are paying nearly pure principal on our mortgage. Plus, there is almost no risk of losing anything and a few friends of mine have lost everything (500K+) due to bad financial advice &amp; investments over the last 3-5 years so it makes me a little scared.

The original plan was to pay off the mortgage, then borrow against it and do the same thing for an investment property, then multiple properties once we are familiar with the process. We conservatively calculated we could pay off a 200K house every 2-4 years, perhaps faster as our income accelerates. Then in about 5-10 years we will cash out and retire. 

However, I'm starting to wonder whether there are better options for our money, and wanted to get some opinions from the people here.

* Gross Salary $60000 (will most likely jump up next year) 
* Actual take home is $1650 Bi-weekly
* Emergency fund of $7000 in a PC savings account 

I currently live with family so my set costs are fairly low:  

* $500 Room/Board 
* $135 car insurance
* $90 monthly transit (April will be the last pass I buy)  
* $21 Cell Phone 

I was raised quite spartan so my variable costs are very low:

* $4-$30 Social Dinning 
* $0-$35 Gas (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Toys (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Clothing  (Usually $0)  

Alright, Lets talk Goals.

Short Term Goals (&lt;5 months):  

* Set up (or plan out) TFSA, RRSP, and investment accounts.   
* Buy good bike, bike to work (&lt;$600)
* Move out, rent own place (&lt;$850/month)
* Buy free weights, get semi-jacked  

Medium term (&lt;5 years):  

* Form partnership with kick-ass female
* Buy home, Renovate into 2 units, live in cheaper unit (&lt;$450K)
* Kid...maybe..honestly not sure

Long term (&lt;25 years): 

* Retire, Money Mustache style. Mustache optional. 
* House paid off, maybe own more real estate 
* Kids...maybe..honestly not sure
  
Longer term (&lt;500 Years):

* Die happy and fulfilled.  

  

Wow, that really turned into a wall of text, thank you for reading it. While I am looking for advice specific to the Canadian financial world I will welcome general advice and thoughts from everyone.   

I have some  questions to get things started:  

* What are the best providers of low cost index funds in Canada 
* How nerfed is Vanguard Canada compared to its american brother? 
* Can I only have one TFSA? Can I contribute $5000 for every year the program has been open or just every year after I open the account?
* Are there any key differences tax-deduction wise between the US and Canada? (Like not being able to deduct mortgage interest) 
* Differences between TFSA and IRA ( Roth?), RRSP vs 401k? ",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_1bb6zl,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1bb6zl/ca_starting_a_financial_plan_xpost_from/,

Like most of you, I have been bitten by the ER / FI bug.  Oftentimes I frame life decisions in terms of whether they will move me closer to the goal.  However, since 2009 I have been toying with the idea of getting a Masters in Real Estate.  My Bachelors is in Finance / minor in RE.  The program is $29,500 all-inclusive, payable in installments as the semesters progress.  I have the free cash flow to pay cash.

No one locally has spoken ill of the program; it seems to be highly-regarded, though not strictly necessary to enter the profession.

I currently earn approximately $35,400 as a county tax assessor, and we are severely underpaid relative to other counties (fourth largest in the state), and in general (for the metropolitan area we are below the median).

Please let me know your thoughts with regard to whether it would be a good idea (e.g., enable me to ER / FI earlier as opposed to later).

1359554734.0,17,self.financialindependence,17k76j,Renting a property in an expensive city to live in a cheaper abroad?,PL8180RD,24,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/17k76j/renting_a_property_in_an_expensive_city_to_live/,"**Background**

I'm 29/M/UK married. I have 100k GBP in accounts (60k in a 5% interest savings account, 10k in tax-free savings account (current maximum allowance), 20k in premium bonds and the remainder in an emergency fund. 


**Plan** 

I've got a plan to early retire in 2018 - by that time with my current rate of saving and investments matching inflation, I'm expecting around 250-275k.  I think I can live off of this indefinitely, and my plan to make this work is:

* Buy a property abroad with some land, and live (more) simply - 60k
* Thumb-to-the-wind living expenses - 8k/yr including maintenance, a few big purchases (car, etc.) every 5 years or so
* A 4% withdrawal rate on the cash leftover is 8.5k/yr

**Problem**

The above situation would work perfectly assuming that I wanted to live in that house until my dying days but the country I'd like to live in has horrible social welfare, and a homestead lifestyle would be perfect up until old age, at the age where physical activity becomes an issue I wouldn't want to be marooned there and I'd have a static 200k to fall back on. (unfortunately based on historic trends, this 200k would be worth the equilvalent of 70k now - not even enough to buy a studio apartment)

**Alternate Solution**

With that in mind, I'm considering splitting my cash and buying a property to rent here in the UK - the outlay would be around 110k and I could expect around 7k a year net in rent. While I'm here I could deal with the renting, and when I move abroad I wouldn't have a problem letting a management company take a slice (normally around 20%).

This would give me the following figures by 2018 I'd have:

* 165k in savings and/or investments
* Property worth 110k (rent has gone into the above figure)

At the point of cutover to living abroad I would have:

* 7k in rent (I'd have a lower tax bracket since it'd be my only earnings but that's offset by management costs)
* I'd only need a 1% withdrawal rate to match my first-scenario income
* I'd have a property worth 110k+ 
* My remaining savings would match inflation as long as I kept my means within 8k/yr so I could comfortably sell any assets and relocate back to the UK at any point into a property.

**Questions**

* It seems that the road is paved with gold when it comes to buying a property - house prices have gone up 8% in the last year in London for example, and long-term depreciation is unlikely based on my research on average house prices. Is this likely?
* While a savings account/investment account will give me constant income with no real effort on my part, I'm not entirely clear on the amount of work required as a landlord - both locally and remotely via a management company. I'm relatively handy as it goes, and my father has a property he rents - but I only really have limited anecdotal evidence.
* Is there an alternate opportunity that's likely to give me similar returns? I'd really like some general advice!

I'm trying to pay down some bills, start a family, and become FI as soon as possible.

My situation is as follows:
After a string of short-term contract jobs during and right after college, I came on board at my current company at the beginning of 2011 on a probationary contract period, making essentially the same I had been in years prior. I was hired on full-time at that same company near the end of last year at (you guessed it) that same rate.  It was either a take-it or leave it situation, at which I vocally made it known that I was settling for a low-ball figure for the sake of coming on board with a great company and a great team with the prospect of a great future, including significant salary re-negotiations. I've now been here a year and can begin the process of asking for a raise.

A few pertinent further details are as follows:

1) According to various online source, other with my same title make $5,000-$20,000 more than I do with equivalent experience. Others that have the same duties as I do, which includes utilizing a unique skill-set to manage a in-demand niche market, make upwards of $20,000 to $40,000 more than I do with equivalent experience.

2) I have been asked to bring in and be reasonable for a significant portion of revenue for next year's books (think 100k+).

3) I've never had a complaint from a co-worker or client and have, in turn, received significant praise on both my work and timeliness. 

4) I have earned the firm approximately 160k in revenue in my first ""official"" year here.

In closing: In my mind, I have been at essentially been at the same base salary rate for nearly 4+ years. I plan on asking for a ~30%.  I get to that partly because it makes my salary competitive in the field but also because it's the number I arrive at after taking that base salary I've been earning and computing a 10% raise when I came on board with the firm, a 10% raise when coming on board full-time and then a 10% for the upcoming year.

My question to you, /r/financialindependence, is whether this sounds reasonable and/or any suggestions you have on requesting/negotiating a raise. Feel free to ask me any further questions and I'll do my best to answer.

Thanks in advance.

The short-term investment amount is large because I'm saving for a down payment on a house.

If a gym membership runs $50 a year (substitute your own value--I only know that's what some people are paying):

* According to the rule of 33, it will take about $1650 invested to support your gym habit during retirement.
* You will save about $50 less per year.

I've tried to make this point before, and a lot of people responded that they get some use out of the gym that they can't get (or haven't gotten) elsewhere: motivation and getting into the right mindset, social aspects of gym membership, access to certain exercises, coaching. All valid points.

But for most people, I think it's possible to get most of the benefits of gym membership without being a member:

* **Motivation and mindset:** Keep an exercise log (use google docs?) and set goals for yourself. Get a playlist for working out. Work out at the same times every week. Don't break your routine unless you need recovery time. Stay positive and never get mad at yourself. Push yourself.
* **Social aspects:** Do team sports. Go running with a friend or co-worker. Join related forums and subreddits. Find a friend with a similar outlook and informally coach one another (I'm on a similar routine as a friend of mine, and we are always e-mailing questions back and forth; we also share our exercise logs on google docs)
* **Access to certain exercises**: You can't do lifts without something to lift, you can't bench press without a bench, etc. Still, for most people, stuff like bodyweight exercises and running will be adequate. (When you can do high reps of one-arm push-ups, do you still need to be stronger?) Incorporating more movement into your daily life will help too.
* **Coaching**: go with a structured program like Convict Conditioning, talk to other people that are on the same program, and be willing to do a lot of reading. 

There's some things you're unlikely to be able to do for free: swimming, for instance, even though it's such a great workout. I would just encourage everyone to think about whether your way of working out makes financial sense. Since people have different goals and personalities, their 'ideal solutions' will be different as well.

I'm a genY who's early into his career (i.e., not making a lot) but saving at least $10000/year, but it's just sitting in a checking account being whittled away by inflation. I know this is terrible, but I'm pretty nervous about what to do with my savings. 

My parents are encouraging me to put it in an RRSP. However, I'm aiming to be semi-retired in around 15 years, meaning I want to withdraw money regularly from my nest egg while working a bit. My goal is to be able to take out $25000/year adjusted for inflation. I figure I need about $830000 to do this (3% withdrawal rate); of course I am aiming to increase my income and savings rate to meet this goal. 

Unfortunately, this seems pretty crazy to my parents who want me to take the standard retire at 65 route. Despite their financial savvy, they don't seem to be able to help much.

Is an RRSP a good or bad idea for me right now? Should I me maxing out my contribution? Where else should I put my money? I don't want to be penalized for withdrawing money before I'm old.

I'm interested in a balanced portfolio including bonds, dividend-paying stocks such as REITs, ETFs, and maybe a few picks.
I have no big purchases (i.e., car, condo) on the horizon as I like to be mobile.

First: My situation


Tuition and rent is roughly $6000 this semester.

I do not plan on making any income this semester (I could get some freelance work if I really needed it, but this semester is going to be very heavy with capstone work and id rather not).

I have about $2500 saved up in the bank. (This is for living expenses like food and entertainment and day to day life. This is also the source that I will eventually pay my loan from. my bills/insurance ect is covered from another source)

I'm totally new to the loan world, but I know the basics about student loans but any pointers would be appreciated. 


The Loans:


USAA (through Wells Fargo) student loan:

These are rough numbers that I pulled from their website but ""as low as a 3.2% APR."" but the big appeal is no payments for 6 months after graduation. Since I have no idea what my job situation will look like then and I will have to manage a lot more liabilities like insurances/bills ect. this holds appeal. It also holds appeal because I will most likely have no income over the next 4 or 5 months. 

Subsidized Stafford Loan:

No interest until 6 months after graduation. But I suppose you have to make monthly payments before that. I don't know how wise this is to do when I have zero income. I believe this is the government student loan and APRs vary a bit. I'm expecting (ill call both places tomorrow to get accurate numbers) around a 6%ish APR. 



So is there anything I'm not considering or really should know? I'm fairly financially savvy and lurk in FI a bit but loans I've never dealt with before.

I am eligible for and currently receive a housing allowance that is based on my rank and typical rent levels for this zip code. It can be substantial based on your area, for my rank it's currently about ~$1000-1200/month.

I see the following three options for housing:

1) Live on base, pay no rent or utilities but forfeit the additional income of the allowance. From a FI standpoint this would be awesome because it would put me a *little* closer to work and the gyms, but the houses are often of low quality and the list to get in is long. This seems like the easiest, relatively no-hassle way to have a house with my wife.

2) Live off base and rent an apartment. This is what I currently do, and since I picked a small apartment close to base with cheap rent, I pocket several hundred dollars a month after rent and utilities are paid. Definitely not a bad gig for FI living, but there are a lot of things that both of us value that apartment living cannot offer. 

3) Live off base but buy a house. I would receive the housing allowance but instead of using it to pay a landlord I could build some equity and perhaps generate additional income. 

I want to make this clear: My intention is NOT to get a mortgage, but rather to save and purchase a home outright with my savings. The houses in my area are incredibly cheap, around 75K for what I'm looking for. In this way, with the house paid for, I could use the housing allowance to pay for utilities, maintenance, taxes and insurance - and pocket the rest. As long as those expenses and any improvements I wanted to make do not exceed the $10-15K or so per year in allowance, I would be in the green. If I made efforts to keep them low, I could be making quite a bit of additional income without losing a penny to rent.

The easy pros:

* A house for my wife and (future) family

* Creative control over our living space

* A backyard, which means a garden and probably chickens

* A garage, for building and maintaining ALL the things

Addressing some easy cons:

* As far as maintenance, I am one handy SOB. I can pretty much do everything. 

* As far as breaking the “5 year rule,” it’s true. I’ll only be living there 3-4 years before moving. But this is common around bases – the market is always fairly strong because military families are always coming and going. I have even entertained the idea of keeping the property and renting it.

It's time to reflect on the month that was:

* Reflect. What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (If you have a recipe we might like like, a picture of the homebrew you made this month, or a picture of your RV interior, go ahead and post it!)

* Newbies (and there are many of you!), introduce yourselves. What brought you to r/fi? What are your life goals? How do your financial goals fit in with them? We love to hear from our new readers, don't be shy!

I feel extremely fortunate and grateful for this!!!

To date, I've been saving and investing under the assumption I would work until age 67.  However, crunching a few numbers, I'm starting to think I won't *need* to work that long -- and I sure as heck don't want to if I don't have to!  (I'm 33 now.)  So I'm pondering when I would rather retire, if not at 67, and what changes I need to make to my current investments to get there.

Here's a financial snapshot:

- Gross Annual Income: $96K

- Monthly Savings &amp; Investments: ~$3.5K (this varies...the ugly truth is, I don't stick to any sort of budget at all, so what I save is simply what I don't end up spending)

- Cash/Emergency Fund: $10K

- [Fidelity FFFFX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315792101) Rollover IRA: $208K

- 401(k): $31K

- [Vanguard VTIVX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0306&amp;FundIntExt=INT) Individual Account: $124K

- [Vanguard VTIVX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0306&amp;FundIntExt=INT) Roth IRA: $71K

- [Vanguard VWESX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0028&amp;FundIntExt=INT) Individual Account: $32K

**Total Savings &amp; Investments: $476K**

I think I'd want roughly $3K per month to live off of.  I wouldn't want to touch my principal, of course, and would like it and the monthly payout to grow with inflation.  Therefore, [Vanguard's Managed Payout
Growth and Distribution Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/vanguard/ManagedPayoutList) is attractive to me.  But, as a [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1hicqq/managed_payout_funds/) pointed out, these managed payout deals are fairly new, untested, and carry risk.  Plus, a lot of my money is tied up in a rollover IRA, a Roth IRA, and a 401(k), and I don't know how I'd liberate it to move into one of those funds, or into any other fund for that matter.  

So, do you wise Redditors have any advice to achieve my goal of at least $3K of monthly income, given the above figures and constraints?

I just sold my car which had an outstanding car loan on because I didn't really need it and it freed up a lot of monthly cash. I have been biking 8 miles round trip to work every day. I would like to move out of my parents house asap, but I am enjoying the huge monthly savings as of now.

As of now, I am dumping every last penny of monthly savings at my car loan.
Minimum payment is currently $255, and as of this month, will be paying $2155 towards my student loan every month.

I will be attending grad school come next August, so a small portion of my money will be going towards that, but I was able to get into grad school and only owe only a negligible amount per year for grad school.

I don't know what to do between now, and when my student loan is paid off. I feel like there is a way to make more money, or to invest to have this go as quickly as possible.

Any ideas? Ideally, I will have my entire student loan paid off by April of 2014 if I don't end up moving out. However, I would like to move out and wouldn't mind paying off the loan a little bit slower. 20 years down to 1 1/2 years isn't half bad if you ask me.

So my plan would be basically get a job and start making some money, going to start applying to places around my town tomorrow. Then save my money but even with a job its going to be hard to move out just from saving.

I am on student loans, I get about 4-5k a year if i live at home, about 11k a year if I live away from home. I am in Ontario so i go to OSAP. This is hardly enough money to cover my tutiton because my school is so expensive and won't cover living costs. 

My goal is to move out, but live in downtown toronto where the average rental is about 500-600 a month, which is a lot for me. My school is there and my friends / lifestyle i want is there so thats why i want to move there.

For example, compared to Westerners, it is my observation that people of Chinese descent (i.e., China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; inb4 Sinosphere debate) appear to simultaneously save way more and avoid debt. There seems to be a lot of literature on why this is. E.g.: [1](http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4568) [2](http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/6028) [3](http://www.futurity.org/top-stories/family-savings-higher-in-china-vs-us/). 

Furthermore, my more limited experience with Indian culture seems to be similar; for example, one of my favorite money bloggers who happens to be of Indian descent, [Ramit Sethi](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/why-do-immigrants-save-so-much-more-money-than-you-do/), weighs in on this as well. 

On a personal level, I feel my own Jewish background, albeit non-religious and largely disconnected from the Jewish community, has instilled me a better understanding of money than most of my goyim friends (oh vey!); my friends joke that I'm the stereotypical good-with-money but stingy Jew (good with money? Yes. Stingy? If you want to call not blowing my money on crap I don't really want stingy, then go ahead). Personally, I thank my parents for teaching me about money as they were pretty darn responsible when I was a kid and never had debt other than mortgage. 

However, it's always more eye opening and interesting to ask people themselves why they think they act as they do.

It's amazing what living simply can do for your independence.,dsteele713,17,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/og2g6/used_the_ultimate_retirement_calculator_and/,"I was able to predict with a fair degree of accuracy how my pay is going to increase over the course of my career because I'm in the military. All of my pay is listed on a chart, and I used some reasonable assumptions for when I would promote to each rank.

I could technically retire at 35 or 36 and live off of my nest egg by itself, but I want security, and the military allows you to retire after 20 years of service with 50% of your base pay and extremely inexpensive healthcare. 50% of the base pay of the rank I expect to be when I retire equates to about $25k/year, in today's dollars. In addition, I would have a nest egg worth around $700k in today's dollars. Using the 4% rule, that is a total of $53k in today's dollars per year pre-tax with very low cost healthcare. Compared to how I'm living now (currently spending under $20k/year with a salary around $40k per year), that is quite the lifestyle.

There are other areas I could make cuts to increase this amount even further. Most of my expenses are very low, but I spend way too much on food. I eat out almost every meal. The places I go are usually cheap, but I'm still spending $450/month on food for a single person. I could drop that to $150 if I started cooking at home.

There are a couple problems with my calculations. One is that I have inflation pegged at 3.4%, which isn't that conservative. I should probably bump that up to 3.8%, or maybe even 4%.

Another is the assumption that I'm not going to increase my standard of living much. I do have my expenses growing at 1-2% above inflation, but that really isn't much. If I get married, my expenses are probably going to go up significantly, which may put a damper on things.

Finally, I have my non-IRA investments(yes, I am well aware that I won't be able to touch my IRA until age 59.5. The $700k does not include the IRA, which won't have nearly as much in it at that time) growing at 10% per year. My non-IRA investments are P2P loans. At this point, that return is realistic.

* **Reflect on the past month.** What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks? 

* **Do you have questions for the community?** Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* **Share links, observations, inspirations**. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (If you have a recipe we might like like, a picture of the canning you did this year, or a picture of your RV interior, go ahead and post it!)

* **Newbies, introduce yourselves**. What brought you to [r/fi](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/)? What are your life goals? How do your financial goals fit in with them?

I'll make one of these threads every month to kickstart the discussion. Reddit isn't a traditional forum--it's easy for a small subreddit like this to get forgotten if it never reaches anyone's front page. I think something these thread will be a good way to make up for that. If nothing else, I hope this will break the ice a little bit and make us all see we're not alone out there:)

My situation:  
I'm currently very securely employed as a software engineer, in an area where there is a lot of demand.   I'm also in a situation where I'm ~6 week back-paid - so every week I get a paycheck for work I did 6 weeks ago.   This causes me to have about 12K pre-tax dollars essentially held by my employer.    

Currently I have:  
* ~35k in a ROTH IRA (from a rollover of my previous company's 401K)  
* ~25k in my 401K (which is set to max every year)  
* ~30k in a taxable fidelity account.  
* ~2k in a checking account for bill payments etc  
* ~1k in a reg savings account (no real reason for this)  
* ~15k in a money-market savings account (this is the emergency fund)

No debt at this point.

My current goals are to save up for getting engaged/married in the next year and a downpayment on a house in about the same timeframe.
 
So, all that being said - in this same situation, am I right to think that keeping 15k in an emergency fund is wrong?  Should I move that (or at least most of it) to my fidelity account?  I keep thinking I should, but then hesitating because everyone always insists on 6 months in liquid cash.

It's time again for our monthly reflection thread. For those of you who are new to r/fi, the reflection thread is where we open discussion to FI related items that have come up in your life in the past month:

* Reflect. What did you learn this month, in terms of frugality, DIY skills, or attitudes? What brought you closer to financial independence? Were there any setbacks?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.

* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted? (For example, a recipe we might like like, a nice photo of your awesome commuter bike, or a link to a great DIY guide, go ahead and post it!)

* Newbies (and there are many of you!), introduce yourselves. What brought you to r/fi? What are your life goals? How do your financial goals fit in with them? We love to hear from our new readers, don't be shy!

I currently own a '04 Hyundai Accent that I picked up in late '06. I've put 48k miles on it with a total ownership cost of 23k. However a few days ago the transmission died on me (expecting a 1600 bill). I've never financed a car but I was thinking about it today.

I was thinking of getting something a little larger since I know kids will be here in a few years. Also safety is becoming a concern of mine and I'm sure I wouldn't of survived any real impact in my Accent and starting to look at either a Ford Fusion or Hyundai Sonata, both provide a little luxury (power options &amp; cruise control). 

So I got to thinking, maybe instead of financing a slightly used 2010-2011 car under 18k I could instead pay it out of cash on hand. Then take a secured loan out with the car as collateral from a local credit union for say 12k. The idea being with a high credit score and clean record I could do better than the 6-9% for used car loans. I could then take the loan amount and put it into my current mid-term investment plans that are holding at 11% return essentially offsetting the low interest loan while making me a little extra cash and I pay off the loan in over 3-4years.

To give you some background I have 37,000 in government loans (fortunately I didn't qualify for private ones) from school split about 50/50 between subsidized and unsubsized. I can't find the interest rates as of now but they have already acrued about 1600 in interest.

Before repayment I think I can put away at least 600 a month.

Does anyone have any idea what my monthly payment may be and if that has any flexibility? When repayment starts should I be trying to put some money in savings as well or just dump it all into loans (now or after my 6 month grace period)? If I am saving is there a better place to put that money than a standard savings account?

My investments are in a tax-sheltered account (TFSA) that has no penalty for withdrawal or earnings so I get to keep whatever they make.

I set up an investment account that I reasonably expect to grow by approximately 5-10% of the original balance of my mortgage each year.  This growth will be a combination of dividends, purchasing more shares and increases in value of existing ones.  My mortgage has 18 years left if I let it run its course naturally.  My net return on the investments is currently about 7% and my mortgage rate is about 3% so I'm obviously pretty happy with that 4% differential.

My problem/question comes down to the end game of this strategy.  I expect it will take 8-12 years for the value of my investments and mortgage to overlap.  Once that happens, I can't figure out what would be the better course of action.  Should I pull the investments and kill what's left of the mortgage?  Should I just put the dividends towards the mortgage and shave a few years off that way?  Or should I just continue to invest because my investments are outpacing the mortgage's interest rate?

I am 24 years old and have a stable job. This is my current financial breakdown:

58k Annual Income
12% contribution to Sep IRA (I don't pay a penny of this, my employer pays all of it)
30k invested in growth income fund (started in 2011)
50k in savings

Currently I am paying roughly 1.5k a month towards rent, utilities, insurance, and general spending (food, etc).

I am looking at purchasing a home right at 100k with 20% down and at 3.5% 15 year note. I have been working with my realtor for months now trying to find a home, so I am not just jumping into this nilly willy. Homes I am looking at are move in ready(ish) in desirable neighborhoods. I've done the math and this should knock off about 350 dollars from the 1.5k that I was paying.

Edit: Seems I am getting alot advice about not pursing purchasing a home. A little bit of more information. Average rent costs in my area is about 850 per month w/ application fees and deposits that equate to almost a month's worth of rent. I am looking at a 15 year mortgage at right around 500 per month. I am also looking at homes that are below market price mainly because I am looking at foreclose/short sale/motivated seller. And yes I plan to get a home inspector to inspect every inch of the place. And yes I don't bother pursing a home if it needs a considerable amount of work done on it. And yes I know sometimes you can't see what is wrong with the home, like mold and such. In which I would just walk away if the home inspector finds anything huge. Goal is to sell the home after 2 years for a profit of at least 10k. So unforeseen maintenance costs would not necessary be an issue because I am not staying long enough for it to become one. 

Now lets say worst case I sell the home at price, I still save over 8000 dollars worth from 2 years of rent alone. Yes there are property taxes, insurance, and closing costs to consider. But still from the amount I would receive back after the sell, it would outweigh the costs of paying rent every month.

So my main question is, assuming I get the home with the interest rate that currently stands today with a 15 year note, and based on my current savings, what should be my next course of action? 

Should I: 

Start a roth IRA on top of the SEP IRA my employer provides?
Contribute more to my growth and income fund?
Start a new mutual fund all together?
Hoard money and look to purchase a new property while renting out the 100k home i plan to purchase soon?

Wife and I talk a lot about finances and are frugal and smart, but could use some advice and second opinions as we set some plans for the future. We're frequent MMM/frugal/FI readers. Background (all figures combined):

* age: both 23
* income: ~$50k yr disposable after all spending, rent, taxes, etc. 
* savings: $20k at &lt;1%
* 401k: $15k + ~$20k/yr.
* roth ira: $10k in vanguard
* debt: only to society!

Our short-term goal (next 1-3 years) is to save for a down payment to purchase a house to live in. Our home purchase price is looking to be a minimum ~$400k given we have to live in a certain upscale area (familial/work constraints) and we plan on having enough space to raise a family in. Expect to have kids before we're 27. 

Couple questions

* Does it make sense to look for investment vehicles other than a savings acct while we save for our down payment? I hope to use Vanguard and get some index funds eventually, but it doesn't seem like a safe bet if we want that down payment in the near future. I'm just sad seeing money sit in an account getting less than 1%.
* Should we get a cheap starter home before kids are in the picture? I'm not sure if a straight calculation of the equity we gain for a year or two of ownership vs the costs of closing on a home is that simple. Mortgage rates are low which is enticing. I could probably get some extra funds to secure a DP on a starter if I needed, but not sure if this is frugal considering we wouldn't have much of an emergency fund to back that up.
* I feel like we should actually lower our contribution to 401k's in a few years. (Right now we're a bit over the match) since if we get to about say $125k by the time we're 30, we're pretty much set for typical retirement age (60+) and the extra funds in our pocket would do us better for early retirement (some time in our 30s). Does this sound like a good idea?

I recently acquired my certified residential appraisal license so I am finally at a point where I can start working and amassing wealth.

Grew up well-off, parents were irresponsible with money, never taught me anything about finance, now they are struggling with debt and I am sick of not knowing what I'm doing now that I'm in the real world

So I found this place, did some reading around, already feel like learning from you guys is going to change my life. Financial Independence is exactly what I am aiming for, but I have a couple questions that are (embarrassingly) even more basic than many of the helpful tips floating around.

Currently I am 24 years old.  I live abroad and I do not pay for housing or a car or my gym membership.  In fact, my only monthly bill is for my phone which is 49 dirhams/month (about $13), and my $8/month netflix.  I pull in $920 every two weeks and I get a $420 monthly food stipend.  (though I am often able to eat at work)  As you can see, I am in a very good position to start making my money work for me.  The past year at this job has been so hectic that I never forced myself to sit down and figure out what to do with what I have.  At the moment I am sitting on about $20k 

Then there's the other side of the coin, which is going to have you guys smacking your heads at me.  I know that my parents took out a substantial amount of student loans, but they kept no records and I am not sure what debt is out there in my name.  Is there a way to look this up?  I think it's in the neighborhood of 30k-40k, but probably split between like 9 different loans.  

Before I left the USA, I was told about a loan forgiveness program of ~17.5k for highly qualified teachers of special needs students from low income families who have worked for 5 consecutive years.  I will qualify for this program in two years.  Does anyone know what program this is and how I can go about utilizing it?

Finally, does any especially generous-feeling want to throw together a sample budget for me to get started with?  Ever since I started living in the middle east I've felt cut off from my resources and I've had to learn to swallow my pride and start asking for help.

We're also in the process of buying a house at a rate of just over 3%.  The mortgage is an FHA loan, which means we need to pay MIP of around $180/mo for at least 5 years, until the loan reaches 80% of the initial loan OR 80% of the value of the home (whichever is less -- that's how they get'cha).

Options I've been pondering:

* A - Pay the minimums on the house and the smaller student loan, and throw all extra money at the larger student loan until it's paid off.  Then, throw the payments I'd been making on the larger student loan onto the smaller student loan until *that* loan is paid off.  Then throw those combined payments at the house.

* B - Pay the minimums on both student loans, and throw all extra money at the house until I have enough equity to cover the larger student loan, then take out a home equity loan and pay that loan off immediately.  Then follow suit with a home equity loan for the smaller student loan.

An added bonus of option B is that I'd (presumably) hit the 80% mark on the home/loan value more quickly, which means I could feasibly stop paying the MIP ASAP (right at the 5 year mark).  The *risk* of option B is that I can't guarantee home equity loans will have a lower rate than the 8.5% and 6.8% of the student loans.

So, I'm leaning toward option A there, but I'd love to hear everyone's insight.

**Issue #2** -- I'm currently saving well above the suggested 15% for retirement (I save about 18% into real retirement funds -- IRA and 401k -- and then probably another 5% or so into precious metals and unofficial retirement savings -- a standard brokerage account).  I know the common suggestion is 15%, but I **really** enjoy the amount I'm stashing away right now...  Would you guys recommend:

* C - Stopping all retirement savings until the student loans are paid off (as Dave Ramsey would suggest)

* D - Cut back to the suggested 15% until the loans are paid off

* E - Continue as I am right now.

This is my first post here.  I just wanted to say thanks for the inspiration!  A few years ago I was not at all thinking about my financial outlook and was really careless with my money.  

At the beginning of this year I got a promotion which carried a raise of a little over 60% of my previous salary.  Since January I've paid off the remaining balance of our car loan(3.6K), my student loans(6.8K) and should have my wife's student loans (10.6K) paid off by February.  

We are in the process of refinancing our home loan.  We are going from a 30 year loan at 4.75% to a 15 year loan at 3%.  We've eliminated PMI so our monthly payment only goes up $100!  I'm 25 and the prospect of eliminating our house payment by age 40 absolutely gives me goosebumps.  

I apologize if this is a FI 101 question but should I continue to make extra payments(Probably roughly $300-500/month) on to the home loan to knock that off quicker?  Should I use that money to buy in to some mutual funds?  After employer contributions my 403B account is getting 10%.  

Also my wife and I have a son who is 20 months old.  We will be trying to get pregnant again in the next year.  My wife has a somewhat modest income and honestly does not like her job(Who does?).  Day care in our area is easily 500-600$/child monthly...We've decided that my wife will be staying home and doing day care for our kids and a few others.  Do any of you have experience doing this?

She loves going to stores to look at stuff, and then she finds things she desires and then she wants to have it.  She doesn't (usually) buy it and she certainly doesn't have any trouble sticking to a budget.

From my perspective, just having stuff in your house imposes a small cost.  Even if the stuff was free, it needs to be cleaned occasionally, it takes up space and causes clutter in our house.  So I'm a little anti-stuff by default. Every item we have in our house needs to save us time or make our lives better in some way.  If it doesn't make our lives better or really save time, let's throw it out and be done with it!  I'm not opposed to having stuff, we just need to do a cost/benefit analysis so we don't end up with a lot of junk, while we don't have the items we really want.  If we haven't bought it yet, then the happiness we get from it better be more than what I'd get from buying something else or spending less time at work.  That being said, I think that wandering around a store like some sort of consumer whore looking at shiny objects is a *horrible* exercise.  If we didn't feel a want for it while we were at home, why would we suddenly want it when we were in the store?

From her perspective, more stuff is better.  Her family always believed in the ""more is better"" philosophy and it seems pretty ingrained in her.  While I think she can see my point about stuff, I think it's really too abstract and theoretical for her.  If I ask her a question like ""Do you think this item will make you happier"" she tends to see that as me saying ""That's not going to make you happier, put it back.""  In reality I'm saying no such thing.  I just want her to do a cost/benefit analysis on buying stuff.  Bubble bath that costs a dollar and makes you more relaxed?  Go right ahead and buy it.

In any event it leads to some mild conflict.  She loves to spend time wandering around Costco admiring all the wonderful consumer goods.  I can't find any enjoyment in it, I long ago realized that for the most part, buying stuff doesn't make you any happier.  In fact watching everyone buzz around Costco, stuck in their own traps of spending, debt and unease is a bit frustrating to me.  The short term solution to that is easy... she can go to Costco by herself and have an enjoyable time.  The long term solution is tougher.

I'm ready to get rid of a lot of things.  I'd rather not spend all day working, and her addiction to stuff is delaying that goal while not making either of us any happier.  I want us both on the same page when it comes to stuff or have some sort of compromise.

How do I help her to overcome her desire for stuff?  She's plenty good at not buying stuff, but really it's just carefully controlled materialism.  I'd rather her not want the stuff in the first place, but it's tough to convey because we both come to conclusions differently.  While I might reason on the matter to determine I don't want something, I don't think it's working for her.

After seeing a Canadian request advice, I thought I'd give it a go as well.


Personal Info:

* 23 years old.  Live a fairly frugal lifestyle.  
* Currently live with parents in BC (important point for housing costs)
* Working FT and going to school.  Monthly take home pay after deductions and taxes is $2,200.  Education and employment finished at the end of this year.
* No debt.
* Upon completing school, looking to move into my field of study.  Expecting 3-8 months to get hired/start (field typically hires once per year and new entrants start in Sept unless high demand for staff).  Average salary for first year is approximately $40,000 pre-tax.  Fairly large increase once ""designated"" in 2-3 years.
* Monthly expenses are minimal.  Typically, $250-400 per month, including ""luxury"" items.

Assets:

* $15 K between high interest savings account and GICs.


Goal:

* Buy an apt/condo as soon as possible.  In metro Vancouver, that's starting at ~300 K.  Very likely to receive assistance on DP from parents.
* Avoid/minimize car usage/owership.
* Build safety net, retirement funds, and smart investments.


I have never had any indexed funds or investments with some risk.  I'm a little unsure of how to get my feet wet without any significant setbacks.  I have heard that it's easier to take on more risk at a young age.  Does ""more risk"" mean as much as I am comfortable with?  


I want to get a good start on life in an expensive city instead of pissing everything away on extravagant lifestyles like most people my age do.  Looking for pointers.

I've been following the subreddit but noticed that much of the advice is very US-specific. As a Canadian I was hoping for some northern-tailored advice for achieving my goals.

About me:

* 23

* Employed, currently making $29,304 after taxes. *But this only lasts until May '14 at the latest.* No post-secondary education.

* Zero Debt.

Hard Financials:

* $5K in liquid savings. (Growing at $900/month)

* $5.5K being put in High Interest TFSA (1.10% APY)

* $15K left in other savings that I need to ""deal with"".

""Soft"" Financials:

* Further $25-45K on horizon due to further sale of vested options in start-up, but this is not guaranteed.

* $8K in potential savings if I stick to savings goals between now and April.

* $2K is earmarked for 4 months of travel before seeking higher education next fall, currently considering certification for network administration &amp; IT.

Essentially, I have no clue how to maximize my current savings as well as my potential short-term gains. What investments should I be putting them in to maximize returns? How can I safely grow this egg? Any advice would be most appreciated.

I currently have 24K net income which *just* pays our bills and puts away a small amount of savings each week. He doesn't work just yet. We're both hoping to begin teaching this fall (still searching for jobs), in which case we'll have 69K net combined income. 

We plan on living on 30K and dividing the rest of the money between paying off the student loans quickly and building savings. 

I'm thinking that we can save money and pay our debts faster by getting a 60K construction to mortgage loan to build a small kit house (this is about 2x the quoted price of the house, so we'd have 27K for land and Ikea finishing materials). My reasoning, which may be faulty, is that if we're paying $800 for our crappy apartment, it would actually save us money to get a mortgage loan since the payments would likely be lower than our rent. Once we pay off the loans (in about 2 years), we could easily pay off the house in another 2 years. And we would have a small property that eventually be a source of income by renting it if/when we decide to move. 

Is this a good tactic? Is there a glaring hole in my plan?  Should I avoid having more debt until we pay off what we've got already?

Edit: Thanks for all the info! I've definitely got some things to consider now. I'll definitely ask around to see if with taxes and other costs we'd still come out ahead.

First off, here is my current situation:

* Car loan | $360/month minimum, with about $9,000 still owed
* Student Loan 1 | $50/month minimum, with $500 still owed
* Student Loan 2 | $100/month minimum, with $8,000+ still owed
* Credit card debt | $19/month minimum, with $1,800 owed

Here's how I got here - I've been paying on **Student Loan 1** for a long time, and then just got my $1,000 tax return and put $500 from that down on this loan. This took the loan from $1,000 owed to $500. My plan was to use all of this money to pay off the loan, but then my car brakes went out, and I had to put $1,800 down on a credit card to pay for the repairs. Now I'm trying to determine what the best course of action long-term would be for what to do with this other $500. Should I...

1. Put it down on the credit card to take it from $1,800 to $1,300
2. Put it towards the rest of **Student Loan 1**, paying it off completely.
3. Put it towards my car
4. Open a new savings account (I don't have one right now) and start it off with $500 cash. 

I am leaning towards opening a savings account, because I'm sick of having to use credit cards every time there's a car repair or other emergency. If I had a savings account, I'd have emergency money to draw from instead of having to use credit. Then again, I could go ahead and pay off the rest of **Student Loan 1** and be done with it, never having to make another payment again, thus opening up available money to me.

Any advice?

Thanks!

(sorry Jacob for stealing your blog/book/life title but you've got to admit it's catchy!) 

I'm sure I'm not alone in some aspects of my situation though, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, criticism and perhaps a voice of support or two!

* My job is something I've wanted to do my whole life, but I don't want it to BE my whole life. Let's say it's a lifelong dream to do this, but I don't want to be working my entire life - I want to retire early.

* I'm lucky enough married to someone who is very supportive of my goals.

* My salary isn't high enough right now that we can live on 10% or 20%, but we are shooting for living on 25-50% or less. I will have predictable salary increases, but we will maintain our standard of living so our percentage saved will dramatically increase.

* **Instead of 5 years to retirement, I'm looking at a goal around 10 years from now.** (It helps to be contracted into my job for that amount of time.) I'm young enough that this could still be considered ""extremely early."" 

* I plan on having at least one child. Once pregnant, my wife will switch into child-rearing/homemaker mode and will be able to focus further on maintaining an extremely frugal household. I consider this a full-time job, as her efforts will reduce our household expenses and offset the loss of income. We would rather do that than attempt a dual-income/daycare family. The math may even be on our side.

* My brothers and I agree, growing up on a farm was the best thing a kid could ask for. I'd like to do that for my family. 10 years of pay gives me time - it gives me the opportunity to save enough to outright buy land where I want and build my dream house. I want to be the first in my family to not have a mortgage on his property.

* I grew up farming; I'd love to go back to that. I'm obsessed with self-sufficiency and limiting my dependence on others. The key in all of this is that by the time I get there I'm already retired - there's no pressure to generate substantial income any longer, so my time can be spent with my family and enjoying the land. To some degree it would be ""Hobby Farming,"" or at the very least subsistence farming - but I’ve always wanted to explore ways to make small farms more profitable. 

So, anyone else out there (who is not anywhere close to 'typical retirement') looking at 10 years or more until you want to retire, but still following the path to financial independence?",,False,,t5_2t34z,True,,,True,t3_mbwoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mbwoa/early_retirement_extreme_lite/,

I'm 18 years old and about to start my second year at a top-tier private university. My tuition is covered because my Mom is an employee at the University (to which I applied Early Decision and busted my ass to get in). My room is covered because I was one of the few people in my class year to be accepted as a Residential Adviser.

I have just applied for a credit card to start working on my credit score. With this I was planning on just buying food,etc. with it and then just automating my checking account to pay off the tab at the end of the month (I obviously will track this and not live beyond my means). Should I pay off the full balance or is that not the best way if I'm using a credit card to establish credit (obviously know not to just pay the minimum)?

I want to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard but I do not currently have the 3k to open an account. I've decided that I'm going to start putting half of the money I make into a savings account until I have enough to open the account. I want to open the account as soon as possible, my goal is for it to be open by this time next year. I know that savings accounts are returning &lt;inflation right now so what's the best move for this? Any suggestions for a bank account for this purpose so I can compare it to my credit union?

I've read a few books to help me on my quest for FI so far, including: I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi and Your Money Or Your Life by  Robin and Dominguez. Do you have any other suggestions, something that covers different material that made you think ""Damn, I wish I knew that when I was 18!""?

My husband has owned a few. I need to decide whether to lease a car, buy a shitty used one, or go into ""debt"" to buy a less shitty used car.


We are finishing up building a house which we paid for in $3,000 cash, so that's all our savings gone. We move in there at the end of January, so we will have a rent-free place to live. The house is 11 miles from downtown (built on my parent's land), where we both work (it takes us 20 minutes to drive to work). I work 3-4 shifts per week, my husband works 3-4 shifts per week, and we trade off childcare duties in between (we have one son, 16 months). 


Until now, we have been borrowing my paren't spare car for free. My dad has a car he drives to work every day, my mom has a car she drives to work at random 1-2 days per week (part time on call at the hospital), and then there's the spare car we've been using- but my brother gets his license in April and will then be driving himself to school every day.


 I don't know how the three of us, myself my husband and my brother, can all use the same car without major logistical issues... not to mention I've been leaching off my parents for two years.... hence us wanting to have our own car. I can't imagine biking an hour back from work after being on my feet all day (waiting tables), or my husband biking home at midnight in a dangerous area (crime wise and super fast cars). I can't imagine using a moped on the highway at 60+ MPH with a toddler in a sidecar! But I do know people at work who use and love them. 


I figure my options are to either buy a clunker at $1-2,000 (which I could have saved up again by April, I hope).... or borrow money from my parents and buy one that's $5-6,000 and pay them back in monthly installments. We might be moving across the country next August or sometimes after that, so a short-term lease of a newer car is possible (boy it would be nice not to worry about expensive repairs, and safety). I have a friend nearby who leases a brand new Honda Civic for like $250/month. 


I just don't know which is better long term, leasing a nice new safe car (my friends says the dealer pays for all major repairs) or buying a used car and risking a lot of expensive repairs/upkeep (I also have zero idea how much insurance costs when you own a car, we have been buying ""drivers insurance"" through Geico for $172/6 months). 


A conservative estimate of how much money we make is $1700/month.

* [This guy made almost $3,000](http://www.mortgagefreeby30.com/make-money-2710-in-credit-card-rewards-for-2011/) in a year by rotating out credit cards.

* One of the commentors in the mustachian thread noted long term *increase* in credit scores when doing this kind of strategy.


* The e-book cited an example for airline cards, which seem to have fairly high payouts, though in points:

&gt;""You can get 30,000 AAdvantage miles for every Citi card
you sign up for, including Visa, Mastercard, and AmEx
options. The annual fee is waived for the first year, and you
can cycle (or “churn” as some mileage junkies call it) card
applications every 60-90 days.""


The book proceeds to chart out an example of a household in which two people sign up for one card each, every 60 days, collecting 360k miles a year not counting the points from spending.  Generally, the miles are worth about a cent, so we're talking $3.6k in flights.





Currently, the only thing I do is put everything I spend on a Southwest card I pay off every month, and I fly for free every month or two as a result.  I'm losing loyalty to Southwest as they are reducing locations they fly to from my airport, however.  I'm thinking of signing up for the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/sapphire/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card/) card and making that my primary, and then starting to rotate other cards for bonuses.


A mustachian commentor also mentioned signing up for bank accounts to get signup bonuses.  They often required minimum deposit amounts and minimum hold times, but in the example they listed the ROI was &gt;20% on six months.

What do you guys think?  Any notable negatives you can see?  Anyone have experience?

* Do you have questions for the community? Is there anything you've wanted to know about personal finance or simple living (or investing or gardening, etc.) that you've been afraid to ask? If you want to know more about something, you can bet that you're not the only one.
* Share links, observations, inspirations. What's the most awesome FI-related thing you read this month? What advice do you have for the community? Is there anything you want to share that you didn't think was worth its own thread, or you thought would get downvoted?

Is financial independence just a dream?  

Gross: 76K
Expenses: 38K for family of 3

So let's say that I drop the expenses to 20K with payoff of the mortgage in 9-10 years.  That would assume modest inflation, a loss of one vehicle, and then picking up private insurance.  Probably 22K is more reasonable.

Applying Jacob's 3% rule, I would need 733K in the bank.  However, our current net worth after 20 years of savings is only 400k.  

Our current free cashflow is around 25K.  Assuming 5% returns and continued investment at this level, that's 8+ years at present levels...which aren't promised especially since I feel totally burned out on programming.  It doesn't help that I'll need at least 2 more years to pay off my mortgage.  What if there's a recession and I don't get those 5% returns?  Am I really looking at needing to collect social security in order to retire?  

I make above median income of 69K.  With prepaid cellphones, no cable, paid for cars, coupons for groceries, etc., there just don't seem to be many more silver nuggets of savings left.  

Even those silver nuggets, though they add up, when you plug them into your calculations, they don't do that much to the bottom line.  Housing is 51% of our expenses.  It's the white elephant in the room, but rarely talking about on the finance boards.  My wife has been awesome with nearly every frugal sacrifice...and let's face it, there are sacrifices.  Giving up cable saved $60 per month, but that's no where near the 1.2K we pay each month for our house.  It's our biggest expense.  Throwing nearly every free cent at our mortgage would still take 5 years to pay it off.  However, we could pay off less expensive property in a little over 2 years.  

That would be huge, and shorten I-day to half what it is now.

We've been looking at refinancing our mortgage and we have currently two options to us.

A Traditional Mortgage or the Streamline FHA

We paid $500 for an appraisal for the traditional, however it came in short of the mark and we have to bring an additional $4000 to the table.

    If we got this it would give us a monthly savings of $278
    If we went with the streamline it would only give us a $180

Now I have approx $7000 in stocks that have under-performed.

Would you sell the stocks to pay the extra $4000?

If I went with an FHA would I have to refinance again to get rid of the Mortgage Insurance?

Other factors are that I've gotten a raise of about $100 - $200 basically would mean I'd have an extra $400 or more coming in a month if I did the traditional mortgage vs $300 with the streamline FHA Another factor is we have to spend approximately $300 to place flooring in two of our back rooms to get either mortgage.

Parents often believe that it benefits the child to give limited financial resources to who is in need of most financial help. Parents will often increase cash gifts to the child who has more debt or is not as financially well off as the other children.

It is my belief that kids should be treated equally. There are some exceptions to this if a child has a mental or physical challenge that they require additional help. Other than that, they should be treated equally.

In my experience, my sister has often had greater financial help with college and greater cash gifts than me from our dad when she was in a tough financial situation that she had dug herself into. My dad made it clear that he was allocating more to her because she needed his financial help. These were times where she made more money than me and had lower tuition and cost of living than me. At the end, I learned that I had to be financially responsible for myself and have seen much more success relative to her. My sister on the other hand still has a negative net worth despite for the fact she has worked 5 years more than me, has spent less on tuition and has consistently made 30% more salary than me. In our situation, it did not help my sibling to get greater financial resources than me. In other families, I have never seen a child benefiting from receiving greater resources.

* I'm 23, living in China until August, then living in Germany for 10 months. Both of these things are completely paid for, and funded (internship and research grant respectively), and I am being paid well enough to live my ideal lifestyle at this point.

* When I get back to the US in Fall 2013 I will attend a graduate program to earn my PhD in Chemistry. The program is fully funded with generous stipend and scholarship for 5 years (at least). The program is easily top 5 for my field, and I should have decent if not better job prospects coming out of school (but you can't really predict stuff like that).

* About 4 years ago I won a legal settlement that entitled me to just about $100k. About $55k is liquid in a high-yield savings account right now, and the rest is in an investment for another 4 years. I had the 55k in a CD, but I couldn't make any moves with it after term before I left for China this year.

* I have about 3k in what I consider my usable savings, which I dip into if I really need to one month. This money comes from the return on the investment of about 45k. I don't save much if any of my income now, nor do I plan to when I'm in Germany for that year.

* My goals are financial independence and a secure lifestyle. I have a great start do to some circumstances and some hard work on my part. After some time working, I would like to be able to work for fun, instead of doing it for money. 

So I guess what I am looking for is some advice about what to do with my 55k, and later with the other 45k. The money I'll be earning from my grant and grad school isnt really enough to establish a savings, but my settlement makes me think I'll be secure until I can get a much better paying position.

Also, I would love any suggestions about things that I just seem to be missing altogether. I'm new here, so I'm not entirely familiar with how things go, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible.

(throwaway account, sorry :(  ) 

So, I'm a bit of an overachiever.  Most people would consider me in excellent financial shape; I feel like I'm nowhere near where I want to be.  The prospect of retiring at 60 with four weeks of vacation a year seems so bleak.  I love travelling, learning.  I'm a dual citizen in a european country and trilingual, though I've lived in the U.S. the majority of my life.  I can think of so many things I would fill my time with if I could.  Time is everything, and I dislike how much of it work sucks up.

Right now, I live in a low-cost-of-living region making **~50k** annually from employment in the IT field.  I purchased a foreclosure and fixed it up, and have a roommate in covering about half of my base home living expenses (mortgage/insurance/electric/utilities).  If figure I ever decide to move, I'll rent the house out.  To be honest, I strongly dislike the entire region I live in, but it's cheap.

I have a Bachelor's, but no student loans.

I get my travel fix via an airline credit card.  I put all of my expenses on it and pay it off every month.  I get free tickets and fly where I feel when I can line up a place to stay (relatives or fans...was a notable name in a competitive gaming scene in the past so people've put me up when travelling).

I decided to correct my spending about three months ago.  I've been getting about 33% in savings a month since then with only minimal life changes.  I'm going to try to push it to 50% next year if I can.  This is after taxes/401k contributions/benefits, none of which I skimp on.

(33% == **~$1,000 a month surplus**.)

I'm not really capable of going full Jason-style ERE, unfortunately.  I really do enjoy my social life and am not willing to give that up- especially as I grew up as something of a geek and I'm kind of flourishing for the first time.  But I am significantly cutting down my spending...not eating when I go out or having very little, for example, and no fast food ever.

I put my employer match in to my 401k.  I see people saying to max the 401k, but...I can't touch this until I'm 60, right? I'm not going to leave money on the table, but I don't see why I should put extra in to the 401k when I can probably invest it elsewhere better.

Thing is, I don't know what to do with the next year's savings.  I'm wary of the stock market; I don't trust that we're going to go back to the normal ~11% a year gains on average anytime soon.  I could pay off my mortgage, but the interest is low enough that I could probably get better returns elsewhere.

Right now I have: 

* $5k emergency fund.

* $2k in a Forex account, and have been position trading under turtle trading-like rules, never risking more than 1% of my account value on a single trade (stop loss triggers at 1% loss).  I've had 8 losing trades out of 10, but the 2 winning trades made me break even on the 8 losing. I don't know if this will work long term or not.

* $3k in a stock account, spread over a few stocks I like.

* My 401k, ~6k, put in a Fidelity 2055 target retirement mutual fund.


**I owe &lt;30k on my house** at 5.25% interest.  If I maintain the last three month's saving rate (without raising it to 50% like I hope), and pool my funds (not counting the 401k), I could pay off the house by the end of next year.


So...I don't know where to go from here.  If I make consistent returns on trading, maybe I'll dump more money in to trading forex/options, but at the moment I'm dead even. I'll see how that goes.  I'm working with a realtor and investigating real estate right now- I'm also thinking of buying an investment property to rent out, with a loan.  I hate taking on more debt, but the math works out.

What do you guys think?  Kill off the house debt? Or invest, and if so, where?  I don't find stocks appealing for the next few years, but taking on debt for real estate makes me nervous.

EDIT: Where do most of you generate passive income?  Stock/ETF/bond portfolios or real estate, right? I'd like to imagine I could retire in this next decade, but that's probably not realistic as I would travel a lot in retirement...*sigh*",,False,,t5_2t34z,True,,,True,t3_nwox0,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nwox0/im_23_and_trying_to_solidify_a_fi_plan_anyone_so/,

Here are some random guidelines for submissions:

* Links and self posts of all kinds are generally allowed.
* No pictures.
* Links to resources, even large and unwieldy ones, are awesome.
* Questions, ideas, anecdotes--all that kind of stuff is allowed.
* Links to forum posts, including dusty ones, are encouraged. I think this will be helpful even for people who are occasional readers of the forums in question. If the corresponding thread isn't super-old, it'd be nice to keep discussion in the linked thread, though.
* Bonus points for something that challenges us to think outside the box, and makes us go ""What?"" ... before we understand how brilliant it really is.
* You can link to original content, but only if it's good :P

I've seen subreddits larger than this one get forgotten by subscribers because of a lack of new content--even when all of them, presumably, are still interested. I know there's a reason that 300+ of you subscribed--so let's make this subreddit a healthy one.

Also, I guess this should be said early on:

* This shouldn't become just redirect hub for a small group of personal finance bloggers, as awesome as some of them are. In general, it's cool to submit a more obscure ERE post, for instance, but no single voice should dominate the front page of the subreddit. Certain stuff is at the top of the sidebar for a very good reason--but this is our opportunity to go beyond it, and do it in a way that harnesses Reddit's strengths.",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_mbgqt,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mbgqt/want_to_become_an_rfinancialindependence_mod_stir/,

Now, Australia. If you work in Australia you can make good good money, especially if you're planning to save it all up and move back to South Africa. Depending on where, and how long I work, I could earn between A$6000 and A$10,000 p/m. If I were working on the mines I would probably have subsidised accommodation and food, too. The only catch is that I'd probably need about 3 years experience working in South Africa beforehand. I could use this time, however, to study for a technician level qualification.

If I were to work in Australia my options would then be thus:


- save up my money and then return to South Africa and invest it in a home, business, stock, etc.


- return to South Africa having bought and rented out property in Australia. $2000 coming from property in Australia every month would go a long way in South Africa.

I know what part of my budget could be tightened, I know I don't make much money etc. so I am not looking for a ""Well if you spent less/made more..."" answer.

Anyway, my question: I have decided based on the lifestyle I want right now, that I can only put like $1300-1400/month into savings/investing/non-spending places. So basically, I can max out my 401k (already contributing &amp; getting matched, btw) OR I can put some money intbo my 401k and save some. Right now I put $300 into the 401k and save/invest $1000. I am thinking of changing it to $1300 straight into the 401k, but I'm worried that it will prevent me from buying a house or saving for things like going on trips, getting a cat, etc. As of this very moment, I'm thinking maybe like $1000 into the 401k and $300 invested. I would love some perspective on the matter!

I'm a single 25 year old male and I'd live in the garage apartment and rent out the house for roughly the mortgage, acting as the landlord. Already a few friends (responsible ones even) have expressed interest in renting the house at first, so I wouldn't have a very expensive first few months trying to find tenants, and could rent to them less formally if there are any hang-ups with being able to rent the place otherwise at first (I need to look into laws/permits  about renting). With most of the mortgage covered, I'd pay whatever else I can per a month towards the principal. I'd move into the house when I could afford it by itself, and still have the option of renting the garage apartment out. I've got roughly $45,000 in CDs that I've recently inherited recently and was planning on using a good chunk of that on a down payment. The houses I'm looking at are in the $225k-$300k range. My credit isn't great, and the mortgage would be about 2/3rds of my monthly income, so getting a loan isn't going to be the easiest, although I have family willing to cosign knowing what I have in mind.

I'm tired of throwing away money paying rent and to me this seems like a good idea, even if I don't get the best interest rates I'd be at least paying towards something (rent for an average one bedroom is about $800 here). Unfortunately I have little knowledge on how to go forth from here, or if there is something better I could be doing with the money and my situation.

1324662360.0,7,self.financialindependence,no42e,Fighting the good fight: Thinking differently about your expenses,johnsmithindustries,9,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/no42e/fighting_the_good_fight_thinking_differently/,"On an almost daily basis, I look at our expenses to see if anything could use a tune-up. I like to classify them into two main categories:

1) **""Fixed"" Recurring Expenses** - These are expenses that are relatively fixed in cost, and predictable in period. Examples include rent, cell phone bill, insurance premium (even if you pay every 6 months, divide by 6 to get your $/month), etc.

2) **Discretionary Expenses** - Everything else. Food, fuel, recreation, entertainment, utilities, etc. 

This either-or concept may raise a few eyebrows, but hear me out.

**Discretionary:**

Entertainment and recreation are typically thought of as discretionary, because these are ""above and beyond"" simply survival. An expensive concert is very easily distinguished from a board game in terms of cost and those expenses are choices everyone gets to make.

However, many do not have the same choice-based attitude when it comes to other living expenses, and a fixed dollar amount budget is encouraged. I find this to be detrimental in the long run and a simple shift in attitude may really help out.

For example, while food is a *necessity,* a predictable daily expenditure for every human being, the cost is highly relative and entirely based on the choices you make. You can choose to eat at nice restaurants every day, or you can choose to cook at home. You can choose to use expensive or inexpensive ingredients. You can choose to grow your own vegetables rather than buy them. For this reason, I believe food should be treated as a flexible budget item, not $X00/month. If you budget $200/month for food - it's likely you'll find a way to spend $200/month. But if you treat it as an expense that is dependent upon the choices you make, you'll find yourself making better ones. Your mental food budget should start at $0 per month, and each decision you make while on an empty stomach adds to that amount.

For utilities, while most of the time it's true that there is an absolute minimum you will pay every month, your bill is relative to your habits. You can choose what you wear, to lower/raise the thermostat, to zone heat, or not. Perhaps you run your hot tub 24/7. Again, since your expenses are relative to your behavior this should be a *discretionary* expense. Your mental utility budget should start at $0 every month and only go up.

I've found that this shift in my thinking towards our expenses has produced some pretty awesome results. Our electric bill (1000 sq ft apt, North TX) for last month was $11 and has yet to be over $30, even during the crazy-hot summer. Food is a tough one, but thankfully we derive a lot of joy from cooking and it actually forms part of our recreation as well (she loves to cook, I love to eat.) - we are about to get below $200/month, and in the future I hope to achieve $100-150 or less.

**Recurring Expenses:**

Even given that success, recurring expenses remain my favorite enemy. Reducing and/or eliminating even minor recurring expenses has a fantastic ratio of effort to reward that will keep you coming back. Spending half an hour to eliminate a $10/month expense may seem like a minor event - (only $120/year?), but over the course of a few years your payback hourly rate continues to grow to a fantastic number - we're talking thousands per hour - and keep in mind this does not consider any investment returns on that money.

Debt can be considered a fixed, recurring expense for two reasons: The loan payments are a fixed monthly expense, but the *interest* also constitutes a recurring expense if you leave the debt alone. A $25,000 car loan at 5% interest may have $500/month payments, but it will also generate ~$100/month in interest if left alone. Accelerated debt repayment is a double-whammy to me - get closer to freedom, reduce your expenses simultaneously.

So far this year:

* Eliminated cable - You've heard this one a thousand times by now, but saving $50-100 or more *every month* is nothing to ignore. In our case, $70/month

* Raised insurance premiums, cut coverage where possible - Again, common advice, but represents ~$30/month saved.

* Eliminated renter's insurance - Nice emergency fund means we can self-insure now. $14/month

* Paid off a car, a student loan, and personal loan - Representing about $500/month in payments and nearly $100/month in interest, this was a fun one!

A significant life change in the near future may be bringing some interesting changes with it. Next up on the proverbial chopping block? Possibly a vehicle, a rent payment, and those pesky smartphone bills.

TL;DR - Think of most expenses as discretionary and it will shift your attitude towards them in a financially positive way. Attack your recurring expenses with a vengeance, knowing that your efforts will have fantastic returns in the long run.

* Quick summary: 108k
* 30k in premium bonds
* 60k in foreign account (earning 4%)
* 10k in Cash ISA (tax protected saving) earning 2-3% (soon to be 1%)
- 8k sitting in &lt;1% interest savings account

The best interest rates for an ISA (which is a tax free savings account in the UK) is 2%. Savings accounts give sub 1% interest. I have maxed out my contribution to Premium Bonds.

Right now, I'm looking at trying to use some of my tax-protected allowance in a stocks and shares ISA, and I've got 5,760 waiting to add to a Vanguard UK FTSE 100 tracker in a trading account.

I have done some research and this seems to be the best risk/reward tracker Vanguard offer, and Vanguard themselves seem to be one of the best people to deal with. For all intents and purposes my wife and I are looking to retire from full-time work in 5-6 years (yes it's not much money, it's a quite specific scenario).

The question I have before I pull the trigger, is it a bad time to invest in the market? It seems in the last 2 years the FTSE has gone up from an average of 6k-6.5k, the fund itself has returned 16% in three years (22% if you include this year).

I like to think that I have at least some semblance of financial responsiblity. I have a monthly budget that I try to strictly adhere to.  I make sure to wait out any major purchases and make sure that I need them, I have zero debt currently and started my career at the begin of December. (Programming)

My current starting salary is $50,000 and my company will match match 25% 401k contributions up to $1000 dollars after 6 months of working there. (This increases yearly but I am not sure the details, I think it's 25% --&gt; 50% ---&gt; %75 ---- %100, I will get full details once I am eligible to start)

I guess my question for the folks here is what are some ways that I can start working towards Financial Independence now? I am currently 21 years old turning 22 very soon, so I am still young but I want to get a head start. I have heard all the stories about people who did not save for retirement until their 40's and how that cost them greatly and I do not want to end up like that. Honestly, I would like to be able to retire as early as possible.

I currently have about $6500 in savings, and with my current budget I am able to save around $850 a month. I have attached a picture of my excel spread sheet monthly budget so you can see where I have my money allocated.

Some things that I have been thinking of doing are the following:

1. Making sure once I am eligible to pay towards my 401k to take advantage of the matching funds. This means at 25% matching up to $1000 I would have to put in $4000 to get the full advantage which is doable with my current savings per month.

2. Paying off my car (about $6k owed on it) I plan on keeping this until I run it into the ground. I am not the type of person who really cares what kind of car I drive.

3. Opening up a traditional IRA (good idea?) I know you can put in $17,500 per year which even if all my savings went to that currently I could not max out.

4. Opening up a roth IRA, which I could put in $5500 per year which would be doable with my current monthly savings.

5. I've heard about something called Vanguard? I haven't looked into it much but it seems to be the GO TO over at /r/personalfinance.

I am wondering which of these I should prioritize that will give me the most benefit. 

Also, I am working on getting my expenses down more so that I can save more per month. Currently I have a pretty high rent cost. Reason being is when I took this job I only had 2 weeks to find a place and move, and I only went to the area once and kind of just took one of the first apartment complexes that I visited. It was dumb but I learned my lesson and am paying for it now. Will never do that again. In december my lease will be up and I will be trying to find a place that is around $500 per month instead of $915.

Also, if my car is paid off I will get rid of my car payment saving $230 per month. Factored into monthly Food costs I have ""entertainment"" such as eating out, and my gas is a bit high due to the fact that my girlfriend who is graduating with her BSN at the end of april goes to school 2 hours from me and I go to see her on the weekends. That will drop off once she moves closer to where I am after graduating. 

Factoring all that in I am thinking that sometime next year I should be able to gain an extra $600-$700 per month which would greatly help towards putting money into IRA's/investments. 

Anyways any advice or help would be GREATLY appreciated. I think I at least have some idea of what I want to do but then again, I am young and inexperienced in the ways of working towards financial independence. Thank you for any advice!!

I'd like to know your thoughts regarding some investment options. I'm from Australia. Here we don't have IRAs or 401k accounts. We have a setup called ""Superannuation"". It's an account that your employer must by law put 9% of your salary in, this can then be invested through your super fund and you can't get the money until you are at least 60 years old. A lot of Australians ignore their super or pay little attention to it, many acquire a bunch of different funds over the years as each employer signs you up to a default fund if you don't nominate one.
 
I have recently (at the age of 30), started to pay attention to my super and have been consolidating all my funds into one account, I've acquired about $45,000 in investment savings, I really should have saved more. I've also left my investments in the default option, if I had managed these into shares more, I would have $69,000 by now. But anyway, better late then never.
 
I'm lucky in that the company I now work for, as a benefit pays Super 5% above the 9%, so I get 14%, I plan to divert another 6% of my salary to this fund so I will get 20% going in each year, starting from this year.
 
Anyway, I have recently read several books, such as bogleheads: guide to investing, etc. And what I'd really like to do with my super money is invest it in vanguard index funds, Australian, World &amp; US market funds.
 
The problem is, my current super fund, which is run by a bank I used to work for (and is only available to bank or ex bank employees), does not allow me to invest the funds in Vanguard. They only provide 6 investment options, for special funds created for members of the funds. They aren't index's, they are actively managed funds. (I would prefer passive investment.)
 
On the plus, they have very low fee's, the fee's for my money are 0.39% to be a part of this fund.
 
I have located other funds that will allow me to have more choice over where my funds go, some allow purchase of Vanguard ETFs and other allow direct investment into vanguard wholesale funds.
 
The thing is, many of these funds charge their own fee just for the pleasure of having my money with them. The cheapest fund I found, charges me a 0.75% PA fee of my balance + a $69 annual flat fee and then whatever vanguard charges me is passed on to me. This can push the fee's quite high, EG to invest in the Vanguard Australian Index fund it would be a total of 0.93% + $69 or 0.96% + $69 if I want to invest in the World Ex Australia Vanguard index.
 
So this situation changes the game slightly with regards to the indexing vs mutual funds argument.
 
Am I better off pushing towards an index fund anyway with these higher fee's, or should I stick with the banks low fee staff account?
 
Or if there are any Aussies around here, anyone got there Super with vanguard through a low cost option?
 
Cheers!

Here's what I am getting at.

A numberof recent studies have shown that retirement planning really isn't effective in the sense that after all the commissions etc your funds are less or equal to the money you actually put away.

I only know successful retirement people in ads who seem to all want to buy vineyards with the great plans their investment advisors want to make commission off of.

I would like real world examples of people who did these types of things and to know whether you did better than simply the money you socked away in total.

It has to be after all is said and done - including all unanticipated bankruptcties of pensions, stock market falls, rules changes etc etc. becuase time has shown all those things happen over a typical retirement planning period so they arne't unique/unusual/excludable at all so you can't say ""I was dioing great until ""my old employer nbankrupted the pension "" or "" unitl the real estate market crashed"" or "" until they cheated with my investments like Madoff of MF Global"" etc etc.

In other words has anyone added up all their non social security contributions over their lifetime and then calulated how much of that they have access to at retirement?

If so I love to know yourt actual rate of retrun or whatever other measure of return you have made that you would like to use.

Remember it has to exclude social security.

The most effective thing you did it with would be nice to know as well.

I remember writing a list for Santa (actually, the Christ-child, in our case) being a big thing when I was little. Turning catalog pages, arguing with my brother. Then, the anticipation for gifts (RC trucks, video games, books) with an inevitably short life span: RC truck now in the attic, ever-new games for our consoles. Books shelved away somewhere, some to this day, although my parents did give some away to younger relatives.

Other than that I basically live paycheck to paycheck or have on average about $500-$1,000 of extra money (after all bills are paid) per month at any given time.  I am generally good with my money, always pay credit cards off completely at the end of the month, never put more on the card than I can pay off.  All bills get paid. I do, however, have about $50,000 in student loan debt.  I don't think it would be wise to put all the 14k towards the loans though.  While these loans will be with me for the next 25 years, they are incredibly manageable payments.  About $187 per month.  I make about $40,000.00 per year.  I get a company car and a company cell phone so those are bills I do not have to worry about.  I pay rent, food, girlfriend, and student loans.  Rent is $450 a month. I just want to know what is the smartest thing to do with this amount of money.  Thank you!

EDIT: I believe the interest rate on my student loan is roughly 6%, by the end of the repayment process (which is either 25 or 30 years) I will have about doubled the money from $50,000 to $100,000 (I think).  I am on the income based program so this does not bother me so much.  Paying only a small percentage of what I make is something I have accepted and I am willing to do (wasnt really left with any choices).

""Student loans are not commercial loans. The government subsidises the actual cost of interest on the loans, so they do not attract the same rates of interest as a loan from a bank or building society.

Interest on the amount you owe will be linked to inflation - in line with the retail price index (RPI) - so the value of the amount you pay back will be about the same in real terms as the value of the amount you borrowed.

* 36$ on my cell.

I'm glad there's been so much interest in this still very young subreddit. I'm especially happy to see that the discussion is active, and that you have all been super friendly and helpful to each other.

I've read [your comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mmfu6/what_brought_you_to_rfi_are_you_financially/) on what you want this subreddit to be. People are coming from a lot of different places and aren't all looking for the same things--but I think that's great because it means there are many opportunities for us to learn from one another.

Anyway, after reflecting on what you guys wrote, here are some things *I* hope this subreddit will be:

1. A healthy space for people to discuss all non-consumerist approaches to personal finance and frugality. This includes everything from radical ideas to small practical changes, to posts about attitudes on money and life.
2. A place where no one will say, ""That's great, but how about I *don't* do that and *don't* save $xx a year?""
3. A place where people can ask any financial-lifestyle question that's utterly outside of the mainstream and get a set of awesome, helpful responses.
4. A subreddit that will challenge our assumptions about personal finance.

So far, I think we're doing pretty well!

I've been trying to figure out how we can make this subreddit stay good, even if it grows to 10,000 or 50,000 members. One thing I've done is think about the rules, which are, as of this post:

* Be nice.
* Keep an open mind.
* Don't be a [complainypants](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/). It's fine to criticize a bad idea, but if you don't want to explain why someone else is wrong, stay out of the conversation.
* Constructive criticism is always allowed and encouraged.
* No memes. No sarcasm.

I've explained some of my reasoning in the sections below, and would like your feedback.

----

**Reddiquette**

Reddit's voting mechanism works against this subreddit, because it rewards easily digestible posts that are well within the mainstream of the subreddit--instead of challenging people's assumptions, which I see as a goal of this subreddit.

There's nothing I can do about this, except to ask you to keep an open mind and upvote any post you think could be helpful to someone else, or could generate good discussion.

It's basic Reddiquette: for the good of the subreddit, only downvote truly terrible posts, not ones that disagree with your point of view, or ideas that ""wouldn't work for you.""

I know some people won't like this--but **I am considering disabling downvote arrows for submissions in this subreddit**.

----

**""Don't be a complainypants?""**

In order to keep the conversation positive, I've decided to forbid posts that don't add to the conversation. Here are some comments that won't be allowed:

* ""I am perfectly happy to *not* do this and *not* save me a few euros per year, perhaps.""
* ""He lost me when he got to the lentils.""
* ""Goddamit, tl;dr please""
* ""he's hardly living a typical 'middle-class' lifestyle""
* ""Whoever wrote this article comes off as merely cynical and narrow minded. He reminds me of the old Australian guy who bitches about everything and blogs about it all.""

If that's your response, you're neither contributing to the discussion, nor are you keeping an open mind. Instead, ask yourself ""How can I learn from this?"" 

Consider this: [r/frugal](/r/frugal) is generally healthy, but frankly it isn't the best place to be if you have any ideas other people might consider crazy. This is why the [r/fi](/r/financialindependence) mod team will try to nip the problem in the bud, so everyone will be able to see what comments aren't welcome. Hopefully we'll still be able to talk about van living at 10,000 subscribers. (If we get there!)

Because the subreddit is a very manageable size, **I will refrain from deleting posts** for now, and will instead reiterate the rules if someone breaks them. I'm hopeful that an interesting perspective or a useful calculation is hiding behind every ""Can I not?""

----

**Other rules?**

If you have comments on the other rules, or suggestions for new ones, this thread is your chance to bring them up!

Rules I am already considering:

* If you want to call out an idea for not being frugal, that's fine--but you have to include a calculation.
* No politics.

The first rule could help keep the discussion constructive.

The ""no politics"" rule was suggested to me by a subscriber, but I haven't added it because politics hasn't derailed the subreddit. I also think doing personal finance differently from the mainstream can easily bring up political issues, and I don't want to stifle those discussions unless I have to. If it becomes a problem, I'm ready to change the rules.

**So, [r/fi](/r/financialindependence), what do you think about the rules?**

Just to be clear: constructive criticism of every submission will always be allowed and encouraged.",,False,,t5_2t34z,True,,,True,t3_mr3lj,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mr3lj/dont_be_a_complainypants_rfi_what_do_you_think/,moderator

My savings is sitting around 10k, and I am 25 years old. I have a reasonably high salary as a PhD engineer and am managing to save as follows:

&gt;Appx 10% 401k contribution. Company does not match but provides their contribution based on profits, and their % is set by the CEO rather than a match to what I contribute.

&gt;After taxes, Social Security and Medicare, 401k witholdings, and health insurance premium, I am saving about 35% of the rest.

I could be saving more, but I like living in the city which is expensive, and I needed a new car, which i could afford, and I am happy more or less with these rates: if I wasn't contributing to my 401k my saving rate would be about 40% in cash.

I have several personal goals in the near future: engagement ring, and a house downpayment being the big two. However I have questions regarding how much cash I should be saving for a downpayment, and also how much house I can really afford. I know how much mortgage I can ""afford"", but how much is actually smart?

Moreover, I wonder if my 401k contribution is the ""correct"" amount, i.e. at this point, while I need more cash to buy a house soon(ish) should I be putting more into cash savings and less into 401k, or vice versa?

Finally, while the 401k contributions sit in mutual funds, and an emergency fund sits in a savings account, where should money being saved for a house downpayment be put?

Thanks everyone.

From what I figure we can both save up too $15,000 each in 1 year from today.

I was thinking early today what is holding us back from actually purchasing a house together, picking up a roommate, and paying a significantly lower amount on a mortgage rather than renting some place.



Maybe I'm missing something, but if i can continue living at home i don't see why this couldn't be a possibility.

I'm looking for any information or suggestions you guys could give me. What should I be starting now to get this moving as soon as possible?

Hello all,

I'm planning on getting the ""Your Money or Your Life"" required reading for my birthday in February, which will turn me the dreaded quarter century.

I've been considering my prospects for the future and I want to retire early, primarily because I enjoy writing and just because I hate the established path we're all stuck taking. I'd like some help in determining how to make it realistic while still enjoying a 'life' with my girl.

Here's the stuff I'm sure I would need to put out there to start making plans.

Income - /*[Redacted, unless you all think it's necessary]*/

Savings:

* $15,000 savings (Savings account, 1% IR)
* $12,000 saved in 401k (Subject to derp market, current -11% ROI)


Debts:

* $10,000 student loan debt (2 loans @ 2.3%, 2 @ 5.8%)
* $8,000 motorcycle debt (1 loan, 8%)


I was considering my options and here's my current thoughts:

* $10k from savings and invest in dividend-paying stable funds such as duke energy.
* Increase payments to principal against the 5.8% student loans. Currently overpay $40 / month towards one of the two.
* If the market threatens another shakedown, I'll try to borrow against my 401k through my job to pay off the motorcycle loan so at least the extra cost is going back to my pocket and I've locked in before another loss spiral.
* $5,000 liquidity buffer 
* Switch to credit union for interest.

We don't have any investments of any kind. We just have a checking and a savings account from a local credit union. Also we filed for bankruptcy two years ago now. 

I want to be okay with money if something breaks down in our only car  and we have to spend $500 (an example) we won't sweat it and take out cash for that kind of money.

1323893829.0,4,self.financialindependence,ncs8l,Want to be an r/financial-independence mod? Reply here! Don't be shy!,triestoohard,5,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ncs8l/want_to_be_an_rfinancialindependence_mod_reply/,"Hi [r/fi](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence),
Now that the subreddit has been around for about a month, and will soon have 1000 subscribers, it's getting a bit too big to for me to manage alone. I can't keep an eye on the spam filter at all times. Nor do I want to keep up my current pace of link submission :)

So I think it's time to put together a mod team. And the good news is, I've decided to ask YOU, our 944 subscribers! Read on...

**Why you should want to be a mod**

I know, I know. You're probably asking yourself ""why would anyone ever take on a pain-in-the-butt job like being a reddit moderator?"" Because it's actually really fun, that's why! Here's what I get out of it:

* Interesting conversations that I wouldn't have had if I hadn't taken on the 'discussion moderator' role
* A place to share FI-related links that I'd be reading anyway
* A way to keep myself thinking about FI/ER, and lifestyle choices in general
* A sense that I'm helping people make financial decisions by maintaining this space on reddit (spreading the gospel, as it were)
* Being part of something awesome!

I hope this sounds appealing to some of you as well.

**Moderator duties**

In some subreddits, moderators are basically janitors whose function is to keep out spam and nastiness. Here, there are some additional duties:

* Monitor the spam and reports queues
* Enforce reddiquette and the rules 
* Help revise the FAQ, once the first draft is done
* Help plan community threads and organize AMA's

Until the subreddit becomes essentially self-sustaining, mods will also be expected to:

* Submit 3 links or self post per week, until the subreddit becomes active enough to be self-sustaining
* Be active, helpful commenters
* Promote the subreddit

**So what do I do if I want to become a mod?**

Just reply to this thread! Answer these questions:

1. Why would you make a good mod?
2. What's your financial lifestyle like? How close are you to FI? (I want to get some diversity among the mods in this sense)
3. Have you moderated a forum, subreddit, or blog before? (not required!)

Once a good amount of responses is in, I'll pick a few of you on a trial basis. If you're interested but are worried you don't know enough about FI/ER, reply anyway! The mods aren't here to be a panel of experts, they're here to create healthy discussion.

Cheers,

The mod

A 15 oz can of kidney beans had 8.6 oz of washed kidney beans in it. The rest was goo.

A 1 lb package of dried kidney beans yielded 32.3 oz of soaked, cooked kidney beans.

Solving for the ratio of **advertised canned weight** to **dried bean weight**, I got 3.525. So if I didn't mess this up, you can now compare price per pound figures in-store, assuming your store does price per pound listings.

Sample calculation:

If ""15 oz"" can of kidney beans costs $0.89, the price per pound is listed as $0.95/lb. A non-bulk pound of dried beans might go for $1.69. Multiplying by our trusty ratio: $0.95 * 3.5 = ~$3.33. This means the can is almost exactly twice as expensive (per pound of the cooked product) as the dried beans.

I'm hoping to get a second opinion just to see if this response will be any different from r/personalfinance. 

I'd love some objective feedback on my situation.

**The situation**

* I graduated college in May. I'm in the grace period for $25,000 of student loans.
* I have a decent job and I've budgeted everything out so that I have a few hundred dollars left over after all my expenses including student loan payments each month.
* I have a retirement account and another account each weighing around $9k.


**My dilemma:**

I hear it's smart to have an emergency fund of a few months to live off of at least. So currently I have that and a retirement account. So currently I'm in good shape and can just continue to chip away at my loans. But part of me wants to use one account to seriously pay off loans and reduce my monthly payment and then if shit hits the fan I can empty the IRA. Is this a dumb decision? Also in the back of my mind I keep thinking that if anything were to ever happen, I could always move back in with my parents or something, but that's not a guarantee. Also, with more money saved each month because of a lower monthly payment, I could put more in my retirement account each month.

**TL;DR:** Do I spend $9k on reducing $25k of student loans or leave it for emergency funds?",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_1jl3zi,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jl3zi/id_love_some_feedback_on_a_financial_decision/,

Has anyone here negotiated a better 401K match or known a group in their company that did so? Even if you haven't, how would you go about it?

My plan is to bring it up at the quarterly all-employee meeting.

(x-post r/frugal; r/personalfinance),throwaway_financial,5,2,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nti1o/can_i_get_some_people_to_critique_my_5year/,"Alright, so here goes. I've always been one to save my money and use it wisely (I think). By the end of all of this, my goal is to have a house. I feel as though that's the last huge step in terms of buying things in life (IMHO). So here's what I've got. Please, please feel free to tear this apart; that's why I'm posting it. I want to make this better than it is.

**Background**

* I am 22. 
* I have no debt (school or otherwise) and will not have any come graduation (May 2012). 
* I have ~30k in savings at the moment.
* I live in the midwest.
* Health insurance is a non-issue. It is covered by my employer.

**The Plan** (*warning: MATH AHEAD*)

Effective January 2012.

I first calculate [my annual expenses](http://i.imgur.com/oqIin.png). Each year, it comes out to ~$15,232 ($1,160/mo).

I then consider my annual income. Gross income is 50k. Less taxes (@27%) makes net income $36,500/yr and $3,047/mo. 

So, (net income - expenses) = ($36,500 - $15,232) = $21,268/yr.

Assuming I stay within that expense budget, I will have $21,268/yr to put into savings. This brings us to the house situation...

I live in the midwest. A nice home will come at ~$275,000 (assuming the market stays the same). Given that, I've calculated how long it would take to make a 20% down payment on a mortgage and still be able to live comfortably with savings in the bank:

If I want to buy a $275k home, I would put down a $55k (20%) mortgage down payment. Assuming I follow the expense budget strictly and put my leftover income in savings, I should have about $94,029 in three years. (30k savings + 3*$21,268 saved income = $94,029). I make the 20% down payment of $55k, which leaves me with ~40k still in savings.

I follow this up with a 5 year mortgage and pay it off, minimizing fees.

I know that there's a ton of assuming in this, so feel free to poke holes in this plan. If I'm missing anything (other expenses, etc), please let me know. I'd be more than happy to hear about how I can make this plan better than it is. There is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully this can help others build a plan, as well. It's never too early to think about these things. ",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_nti1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nti1o/can_i_get_some_people_to_critique_my_5year/,

First time post here in r/fi, or reddit in general.  I'm a 30 year old that is living in Japan and seeking financial independence before or around 35.

This might be a no brainer after I explain the situation but I'm very interested in others opinions and view.  I have a really good job that pays me much more than I would be getting back in the states (where I am from).  Part of this is due to the very strong yen right now, and I am looking to ride that wave until a salary in the states becomes comparable (plus Japan is an awesome place and I'm not ready to leave).

In about a years time I would certainly have enough saved up for the down payment on a home here in Japan.  As it stands right now we (my girlfriend and I) are paying rent which means a 0% return.  Not surprising as rent isn't an investment.  We have tinkered with the idea of buying a house or a condo but as I have started to talk with other home owners they have informed me that property in Japan usually depreciates instead of appreciating like in other countries.  The mentality is that an older house is worth less than a newer house, and therefore most people when they buy a house they knock it down and build a brand new one on the land.  It might sound crazy but I have seen this happen many times.  One day there is a house next to you, then the next day a vacant lot, and three months later another house.

My other option is to send my savings back to the USA everything month.  Right now 100 yen is about $1.30.  That is pretty amazing!  If the US economy ever recovers and the Yen weakens this might be a missed opportunity.  But If I am sending money back to the USA I won't have savings here for a down payment, which means paying Yen100,000 (almost $1300 US) a month in rent.

What I would like hear from other people is do you think this would be a good idea.  I'm going to find out more talking to more home owners as far as what is the amount of depreciation, what are the normal payment like, what is the interest rates, etc.  But even if the house depreciates 50% when I sell it I'm at least getting back 50% (minus of course any upkeep, etc.).  Compared to rent, 0% return, this has got to be the better decision right?

If I invest it would be something primarily hands off.

Income:$43,801 from my primary job plus $550 a month from renting out the upstairs apartment in my home.

Debts:
$6,500 in credit cards (The monthly payments come to about $130)
All of this is at 0% interest, most was accumulated over the past 2 1/2 years when I bought my house, the upstairs apartment needed new carpet, paint, furnace/hotwater heater, plus other odds and ends for redoing the house. I have 3 credit cards that pretty much always have  0% interest on balance transfers for 12-24 months and only charge between 1-3% transfer fee, so I think it makes more since to just bounce the money around then pay it off right now.

$3000 left on a car loan (This is $195 a month). It will be paid of Dec. 2014, again 0% interest

$41,443 in student loans (about $362 a month). All are below 6.45% with the lowest being 5.2% I believe.

$45,816 on my mortgage (30 year $316 Bi-weekly). 3.5% interest.

3% of my income from my primary job goes straight to a pension fund, can't rely on this however because I need 10 years to become vested, but I'm up for tenure in 7 (I'm part of the teachers union but really work IT, our department is notorious for not granting tenure).

I also have a 403b that has about $10,000 in it (I was putting $250 biweekly in but with all the house repairs have dropped back to $50 for the past 6 months, hoping to up it again soon). I also have a betterment account I put $50 in bi-weekly automatically (the minimum to reduce fees) plus I contribute extra when I can, right now it's at $3,000 I know a lot of people don't like betterment but starting out with very little to set aside it has helped me, I've already told myself to find something more 'adult' when it hits $5000.

So given all that what would you guys suggest? Get the cards/loans paid off, or save more, and if you suggest savings where should I put the bulk of any extra money I have, into my 403b, start a IRA, or into betterment (or whatever type of hands off investment account you suggest).",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_1kf2ko,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kf2ko/saving_or_paying_down_debt/,

I have done some background reading, and many of the links are not relevant to me or my situation; I am not interested in minimizing my lifestyle, living an austere life. I want to continue on with what I have now, but without the bother of working.

**The Situation**

We have jobs, but they are entirely ""meh!"". Good money, but we want out. Sick of the 50-60 hour weeks, no time with the kid, blah blah blah.

What we want is $120K CDN per year, after tax. 

What we have is this:

* $600K cash
* $129K in a tied up defined pension plan
* $700K equity in a house that we do not want to sell
* $170K of an unused HELOC

What we owe is this:

* $300K mortgage
* nothing else

**Questions**

1. How much do we need to have invested in order to make us our $120K per year, after taxes?

2. How can we turn $600K (or $770K) into that amount?

I guess the question really is this: if you have a bit of seed money, say three quarter of a mil, how can make it grow. Preferably, hysterically.

We're in Canada, prairies. Love to talk opportunities.

**EDITED** I guess it's not that I don't want to work, full stop. It's more that I want to work when I want to, definitely at something other than what I'm doing now. Or choose not to.

I'm 30 and have only been working full-time for 2.5 years due to screwing around when I was younger (took me 8 years to graduate university).

As a result of this (and my own stupidity) I'm only now starting a retirement fund.  I make approx 60k after bonuses annually and right now I have an initial chunk of 5k to invest, and plan on adding $400 to that every month.  Doing a quick calculation with an interest rate of 5% it seems in 35 I will only be left with 488k.

This is obviously way less than what I need to retire on.  What am I missing here?  Is the 5% compound interest not the right calculation to do?  Should I somehow calculate how my monthly input will increase as I make a higher salary?

Monthly income after tax (not including bonuses): 3169
Monthly minimum cost of living: 1833

So I guess in theory I could be putting a lot more than $400 into my investments.

The deadline is march 1st and i am in a business program in cegep which i dont really like. I know im very interested in financial independence and simple living because i want to learn and have fun outside instead of being locked in that rat race consumer lifestyle. I read the 4-hour work week and am halfway through ERE. These books greatly inspired me and im Thinking of moving out west to live frugally and ski everyday in a few years. 



&gt;First things first, i cant ""realistically"" retire at 18 years old so i have to find a career/job path for now. It must be something i love because i wont suffer taking classes that seem useless to me (what im doing now). I really wantto learn useful skills that can help me save money such as construction, gardening, fixing bikes and cars and even electrician work. I dont feel like going to trade school for 2 years in each of these fields because i want to learn them for personal use and not make a career out of only one of them. I want to one day have enough time to start producing music, making movies, writing, blogging, painting, woodworking, glass blowing, hiking, cooking, mountaineering and sooo much more. But the thing is i dont want to focus on any for long term education.

I will also have about 10-12K to put into an RRSP by the end of the year. Well, actually, only about half of that will go into an RRSP until next year when I can open up my TFSA.

Anyways, there is a little bit of a background on myself. I have read all of MMM posts and I think that I have a budget planned out for when I move in August. I am planning on taking one term off (at least) from working so that I can adjust to university life, although I may pick up a part time job to help cover expenses and hopefully break close to even every month as long as it doesn't bring down my quality of life.

I was wondering if there is anything else that I can do to prepare myself financially for the 'real' world. Are there any tips that you would have liked to have known during your younger years?

We just spent $5,000 building a tiny home on my parent's land, so we can stop paying rent. We earn about $1700 or more per month. All of our savings were spent on this house. 

Right now we have an extension cord running from my parent's house to our little cabin. This is not a long term solution for many reasons (one being that the distance is 350 feet or more). The power company wants to charge $31/month just to set up a new transformer closer to the house... this seems stupid to me, as that's the same as my entire electric bill in my old apartment. 

Solar panels and batteries would cost about $3,000. We will inherit this land from my parents, so plan on staying and raising our son here. We also anticipate rising energy costs in the future and would love to be off grid.

We have $4,000 in a college fund for our kid (he's 1.5 years old). Do we use it to buy the solar set up, and then replace that money with savings each month (we did not save this money initially, it was gifted to him when he was born)? Do we take a loan from my grandma or parents, and pay them back each month (my parents have already offered to buy us a used car and we can pay them back, don't want to take advantage of their kindness)? Do we suck it up and pay the power company their fees and commit to a rising monthly bill?

I'm in my mid 30s with roughly $240,000 in my IRA accounts (one Roth, one Roll), $115,000 in an additional brokerage account and $13,000 in cash savings.  I have about $50,000 in equity in a rental condo that basically breaks even each year, including the annual equity increase, but showed a bit of a return for the first time last year. I'm from the US and live there now in a midwestern town.  I have no reason to believe I'll die particularly young.  I spend some of my time in foreign countries with low costs of living ($13,000/year is entirely feasible) and plan to move there more permanently withing 5 or 6 years.  I'm currently unemployed and have been for the last 3 years.  My earning potential is (was?) high, in the $50,0000-80,000 range.

How comfortable should I be with just living off of what I have?  How should I structure my investments (in a broad sense, I'm somewhat savvy but always looking for broad input)?  Ditch the condo (I've been unable to refinance out of my 5.9% 30 year mortgage due to my unemployment)?

I'm happy living a simple, frugal lifestyle but I don't want to spend the last 5 years of my life eating catfood and forgoing medical care.  I tend to be obsessive about these things (numbers, money) and need to get a general outsiders reading on my situation.

Namely, average rates of return on investments.  Many FI'ers look at *average rates of return* on investments when trying to determine at what point they can retire. A conservative assumption like 4% a year is often used in these calculations. But upon closer examination, a problem arises.

Tell me what the average rate of return is for the following investments:

    Year 9: +10%		        Year 9: +4%  
    Year 10: +10%	        Year 10: +4%  

If you did your math correctly, the average yearly return for both investments is 4% *however* look what happens if you put $10,000 in each investment. In case you don't feel like pulling up Excel and running the calculation, I did the math for you.

Investment One 10-year Return: $11,789.74
Investment Two 10-year Return: $14,802.44

This is despite having the same *average rate of return* on both investments. I'll give you a more extreme example to illustrate my point. Again, we will use the same average rate of return of 4%.

    INVESTMENT THREE
    Year 0: Invest $10,000
    Year 1: +20%
    Year 2: +20%
    Year 3: +20%
    Year 4: +20%
    Year 5: -75%
    Year 6: +20%
    Year 7: +20%
    Year 8: +20%
    Year 9: -50%
    Year 10: +20%

Investment Three 10-year Return: $5,374.77

Wait, we lost money? How is that possible with an average return of 4% a year? I thought we were being conservative with our assumptions?

Well, we were, but the problem is that an *average rate of return* does not account for fluctuations between different years. This is part of the reason why the baby boomers are struggling to retire despite high *average rates of return* from the stock market. The 2008 crash set them back quite a ways. Now, I know the stock market has returned to its highs in recent years, but it does not make up for the fact that every dollar you invested in 2007 needed to wait 5 years before seeing a positive return. 

This point regarding FI assumptions has always made me skeptical about retiring early. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I think it’s much harder than many people on this sub make it out to be. 

Now before you respond, let me explain that I also wish to achieve FI and have been saving 40-70% of my salary for years. I plan on retiring early someday as well and think many more people should aim to do the same. That being said, it is important for us FI’ers to really challenge our assumptions to ensure that 10 years from now, we don’t look back and see we need to work for another 10 because of poor planning.

If anyone has a rebuttal to my point, I’m all ears. I’d love to hear how my logic is completely off-base so that we can all achieve FI faster.

Why?

I propose that the vast majority of us will ""make"" 18-20% returns for the remaining lifetime of our mortgage if we pay it off when we reach FI. More if you take on a side business.

Say you need 60k a year to live on if you're paying your mortgage. If you have a 15k/year mortgage and you pay it off, you will only need 45k/year to live on. 

Assuming you live off of cap gains in the us, each additional dollar past 45k up to 60k that you need to live on (to pay your mortgage in this case) would cost you 15 cents. Add to that the interest rate of hopefully 3-5% (or lower!) that you're paying, and it suddenly becomes a good investment to pay off your mortgage. You save 2250 a year in taxes by paying early.


Why not do this before FI? Because you're probably not going to change the amount you earn from earned income based on the amount you need. So you will earn 100k and get taxed 20k (ish) whether or not you actually need it to live off of, and there's no benefit other than interest to paying off your house early.

Thoughts?

*edit - this may be less since you're only saving 15% on the principle. Maybe closer to 8-10% overall, but still beating out a lot of other investments. Or maybe it's more if you base it on just the principle? This was much simpler an hour ago.

My wife and I work for the same company.  The new company matches 4%, and we are picking our plans.  I've narrowed down the three options that have the least amount of fees (my wife picked VBK).  
  
[1. Growth Index Fund \(Large Cap Growth\) - VUG at .97% fees](http://etfdb.com/etf/VUG/holdings/)

I'm posting from a throwaway since my real username can be mapped back to my identity. Anyways, I'll do my best to break down my situation. I've been very fortunate with my career and education, and I'm in a very good spot right now financially. I want to take full advantage of it while I'm young, so please give me some ideas about what I can do better!

**Me:**
25 years old, single without kids, making around 100k a year as my base salary. I can expect a cash bonus of either 13 or 18%, based on my review score in the fall. My job is secure and should see continued future growth in salary as I advance.


**Assets:**
Car (worth roughly 15k, no debt here). I take good care of it and will use it until it dies.

Pre-Tax 401(k): about 30k, all of it is in a targeted retirement fund that has low costs. I aim for 17k a year in contributions, with a 3% employer match on top of that. So 20k all in all. I have the choice of roth, pre-tax, or traditional contributions here. I use pre-tax since I'm already in the 28% tax bracket, and it saves me some money on taxes.

IRA: 5k (just started last year. stupid me.) Will contribute 5k annually and backdoor it into a Roth IRA.

Taxable Brokerage account: 40k right now. I don't keep careful track of the cost basis, but I've contributed 8k since the year started, which puts me on pace to put in roughly 25k this year.

Cash/CD's/Money Market: Basically none. I keep 3k-4k around in checking + savings accounts for bills and whatnot, but anything on top of that gets invested. I figure my job is steady enough I can withstand an emergency on credit. Worst case, I'll sell some stocks to cover costs and wait three days for the money to settle.

I own no stocks directly, just low cost (&lt; .2% expense ratio) ETF's. My target allocation right now is 35% small cap, 30% large cap, 30% international, 5% bonds. I figure I can withstand some volatility at this stage. I plan to make the allocation more conservative as I get older.


**Liabilities:**
My only debt is that I owe about 400k on my house, which I bought last year. I got an FHA loan at 3.8% interest, which means I pay about $300 a month in mortgage insurance until I have 22% equity in the house, or 5 years have passed, whichever comes later. When I get to the 5 year mark, if I want to stay in the house, I'll make a balloon payment of around 40k to get rid of the PMI. My property taxes also work out to being about $500 a month.",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_snxxx,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/snxxx/what_can_i_do_better/,

1357346399.0,0,self.financialindependence,15zby7,Is it really so hard to read the sidebar?,dsteele713,2,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/15zby7/is_it_really_so_hard_to_read_the_sidebar/,"It seems like half of the posts in here are titled ""I'm X years old with $Y in the bank. How do I reach FI?"" They can reach financial independence the same way everyone else can reach financial independence: by cutting spending, paying off your debts, and investing what's left. As you save more and pay off your obligations, you become less dependent on your job for security, until the point where you've saved about 30 times your annual spending, because at that point you can probably quit your job and never work again without having to change a thing. If you can cut your spending down to 40% of what you're earning, you can reach complete financial independence from nothing in 15 years assuming 6.25% post-inflation growth, or 20 years assuming growth equal to inflation.

The method doesn't change, regardless of your age or income: Cut your spending so that you save more and need to save less. It doesn't matter whether you're 20 with $200k or 40 with nothing. Cut your spending, pay off your debts, and then start investing. 

The sidebar has a wealth of information explaining what Financial Independence is, how you can reach it, and a ton of resources to help you cut your spending and tell you where you can invest your money. Your case isn't special, and the top answer to anyone asking this question should always be: ""Read the fucking sidebar.""",,False,,t5_2t34z,False,,,True,t3_15zby7,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/15zby7/is_it_really_so_hard_to_read_the_sidebar/,
