- I can use it as a regular laptop just fine. It's more powerful than my 1-year old 15"" laptop (which was more expensive as well!).

- Touch integrates very well with general usage. Touch adds better manipulation.

- Battery has not run out during any of my trips. I've already been on a few flights and long commutes, battery lasts around 5 hours. (Obviously I'm not using 100% brightness)

- Surface fits everywhere (keyboard included)! Fits small airplane economy class tables just fine. Fits train seat tables fine as well.

- Even if heavier than the iPad... it's not heavy! It's comfortable enough to hold when walking around and sitting. I've used it multiple times to show other people features, flight information, something i found on Reddit, some notes I've taken, ... it can get a little tiring if you are holding it with one hand for a long period of time, but it's the same with my iPad. I brought my Surface in the kitchen earlier and ordered my shopping online with it as I checked what I have left.

- OneNote is amazing. I find myself writing notes during my commutes and brain storm. I'm pretty impressed and I'm not sure what I'm going to do without it now.

- It's pretty easy to use the pen and write/draw while sitting on a couch or at a table, or standing up, having it folded as a tablet.

- Has reduced my flight hand luggage weight by at least a couple kg... some airlines just allow you 10kg on board. So that is pretty sweat.

- The full desktop applications I can use on the go is just amazing! Flip, Windows button, Desktop, ...

Endless possibilities... I think I'm not the only one here.

______

The only negative points I see are:

- Really hoping for WinTab drivers though... using Photoshop with the pen would really boost productivity of this device.

- When using it on my lap the inclination makes it hard to use it as a typing device when out and about. I wouldn't generally use it as a typing device in these situations anyway... I would just use it as  a tablet and use the onscreen keyboard (which is good enough).

- Additional battery would be beneficial... not absolutely necessary. Who doesn't want a 12+ hour powerful laptop on the go.

No work today? Sweet I'll just browse the net on my Pro in my bed.
Gotta take a dump? Taking the Pro with me upstairs.
Cooking food? Take it with me to the kitchen.
At work and downtime? SURFACE TIME.
Want to watch TV? fuck it im too lazy, ill just watch Netflix in bed.

I have been using this thing so much that I have been neglecting my beautiful gaming desktop that I have always treated like my child.
My Galaxy Nexus has 70% charge at the end of the day, because I rarely use it now, only for texting, phone calls and GPS.

I have considered returning it because I just neglect all my other expensive technologies because of it. I have never bought a product and thought of wanting to return it because I use it too much. But come Fall, I'm going back to school and I can't believe that I will probably be using the surface pro even more than right now.

**These are my personal impressions. Your mileage may vary.**

The Bad:

* The only impression I've drawn thus far is that the display has quite the glare problem (I can hardly see what's on screen right now thanks to the sun behind me in spite of the brightness on max). 

* It is also quite heavy-feeling. Feels a lot heavier than the RT. The weight distribution also makes it feel quite a lot heavier than any other tablet I've held, and about the same as the just-under-three-pounds Sony Vaio Duo 11. It's a light laptop but a heavy tablet; I can't see prolonged tablet use with this. 

* The pen feels really, really, cheap. Especially when compared to the metal construction of the Sony pen. This one feels cheap and the plastic button was misaligned after the magnet from the side dock pulled it slightly out of place.

* The new angle seems a bit weird. It isn't working for me on my desk unless I put it far enough away.

* The Touch Cover still delays when you switch from scrolling to moving the cursor. I was hoping they somehow fixed it.

* The power cord is ridiculously short. So much for charging it in a regular class without an extension cord.

* Speakers are still quiet but not horrible.

* It is starting to get a bit hot while charging. 

The Good:

* 89.4GB of storage space available. 

* The display resolution is great. Noticeably better than the 11.6"" 1080p panels.

* It's virtually silent. If you move close you hear a buzzing from the fans but in realistic use it is silent.

* It still has a superlative kickstand.

* It's not bad on your lap on the couch (though far from ideal the angle ends up totally wrong).

* Very quick and smooth. 

* All round great device. It is generally much more good than bad. The minor issues are easy fixes for another generation but this competes well with current Ultrabooks. I would easily recommend it over my old Sony Vaio Duo 11. 

* Much better scaling at 125% than the standard 150%.

As a college student, I think the Surface RT has been one of the best purchases I've ever made. 

Pros: 
1. Battery life. I can get literally 10-12 hours doing homework and listening to music on it.

2. Office 2013. Need I explain more?

3. SkyDrive integration. I have a desktop running Windows 8 and a Windows Phone 8 device as well. SkyDrive is flat out awesome. Type a paper on my desktop, open it on my Surface and edit on my phone. I also have my SkyDrive folder synced to my desktop on my Surface. This way I don't have to use the app.

4. Type Cover. I had the Touch and hated it. Got the Type and love it. I can type wayyy faster with much fewer errors.

5. Snapping. Running two apps side by side is also awesome. I can watch a video for homework and type notes on it at the same time.

Some cons I personally face:
1. Driver support. Some printers don't work. Fortunately the printer I had at home worked. 

2. No desktop apps. There are sometimes I wish I could just open the Command Prompt and use some of my own console apps. I also wish I could program on the Surface.

3. Lack of apps. However, I don't use a lot of apps so its not too big of an issue.

4. I can't really think of a 4th. I'll update if I do.

I have friends with iPads and other Android tablets and they all say good things about the Surface. But all over the internet, there's only hate for the Surface. I never really see any legitimate reasons why the Surface with RT *sucks*. Anybody have any ideas?

1356636425.0,54,self.Surface,15j5p8,Got a Surface for Christmas - I really love this thing!,dngrCharlie,62,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/15j5p8/got_a_surface_for_christmas_i_really_love_this/,"I told my wife that a Surface was a ""low priority"" on the Christmas wish list because, while it looked cool, I didn't think I would have much use for it.  I have a pretty powerful desktop in my office and an original Kindle Fire.  I use the Kindle fire for web-surfing when watching the TV and that's pretty much it but it does that job well.

So, when Christmas came, I was surprised to see this Surface as one of my presents.  It took about a day of getting used to doing things the ""Surface way"" but now I am just in love with it.  I'm afraid my Kindle Fire will now be relegated to vacation travel use since I won't be too terribly upset if it gets lost or stolen.

Things I really like:

* The Touch Keyboard.  It is just so handy to use this thing in tablet mode to read Reddit and then flip the keyboard out when you want to reply to a post or add to a thread.  It is amazingly easy to do and it doesn't feel ""in the way"" when folded back like the Type cover does (at least to me!).  

I am also very comfortable typing on the Touch keyboard.  It does take getting used to but it is really easy when you do.  It is light-years better than typing on a virtual keyboard.  For example, I would never have even tried to write this on the Kindle's virtual keyboard (or any virtual keyboard).

*  I had to work things out but now I'm happy with the way the METRO IE organizes favorites. I was on the fence with regard to the fact that IE syncs with your other Windows 8 PCs because my desktop IE has a shit-load of favorites (imported from Chrome).  However, I don't really use IE on my desktop (preferring Chrome) so now I have just deleted all of those shortcuts and just added the one that I mainly use with the tablet.

In other words, on my desktop I'm likely to create a ton of shortcuts but on my tablets I prefer a convenient few.  Synching  IE between the desktop and Surface does not allow for this very well since the IE Metro app just lists all your favorites in one long row.  Syncing in this fashion is probably great for the IE Desktop app but, so far, I really don't go to the Surface desktop (and really don't want to under normal circumstances).  

For frequently used websites (like Reddit) I have learned to just pin IE shortcuts to the Start page (at the very end of it) to get them conveniently placed in the browser shortcut section.

For things like HBOGo and YouTube that don't have dedicated apps yet, I just create normal IE shortcuts pinned to my Start page and it is almost like you have an app.  Both websites seem to work just fine in the Metro IE app.

*  I love that you can us a gesture to go forward and back in IE.

*  I love how easy it is to go back to recently used programs and how east it is to close applications (unlike Android which is a pain in the butt to close apps).

*  The mail client is simple and is easy to use.  It is NOT full featured but good enough.

*  The Remote Desktop app is nice, supports Remote Desktop Gateway, and allows me to get into my work PC from home very easily.  This feature may allow me to travel with JUST the surface.  We'll see...

*  I find the split keyboard the most comfortable to use when using the Surface on the couch.  I almost never use the Surface in portrait mode.  

*  The Charm Bar, once you get used to it, is very convenient and intuitive to use.

Some things that I hope are coming:

1.  I wish IE would wrap text when you zoom into a page.  As you get older, your eyes start to go and reading small text is hard.  With, say, Opera mobile, you can pinch out to make a page bigger and the text automatically wraps so you see it all on one screen.  I really miss this.  I know you can adjust the zoom but it is not convenient to get to (compared to pinching) and the text still goes off the screen making that not very useful.

2.  I wish there was a MOG and an Amazon Cloud Player app.  I know MS is pushing Xbox music so I hope they don't prevent other streaming services in their store.  

So, having used this device for a while, I really, really like it.  I don't think I am going to want the Pro version as the RT seems to have really done a good job of balancing a normal tablet's functionality with just enough extra stuff (Remote Desktop, keyboard, Office apps) to let you get by very comfortably when you need just a bit more than a tablet normally offers.  Plus it's light and has good battery life!",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1356636780.0,,,True,t3_15j5p8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/15j5p8/got_a_surface_for_christmas_i_really_love_this/,

•Touch cover is taking some getting used to, I can actually type faster on the on screen keyboard. I'm used to typing on the iPad and the on screen keyboard here seems better. I type quite fast on screen, probably at 90% my normal typing speed, so no issues there. Will have to practice with the touch cover.


•One awesome thing I noticed was that keyboard shortcuts like copy and paste work on the on screen keyboard as it has a control key right next to the space bar. VERY handy. I love this so much. The keyboard sound is the same dynamic tapping sounds from Windows Phone, which I love and find much easier on the ears compared to the static iPad keyboard sound. Small detail, but really nice, nonetheless.


•I played around with the built in options for the keyboard, too: full screen like iPad, thumb keyboard, where its split, and then one that converts ink into text. The ink input works flawlessly, considering how abysmal my handwriting is, it just would not screw it up. I could see myself using that a lot actually, even with a capacitive stylus with how responsive the screen is (I use a jot pro). Very excited to test it out on the Surface Pro.


•Surprised at the lack of an official Facebook app, but as a Windows Phone user, the People and Messaging hubs are more than adequate for my needs, and quite beautiful, too.


•I opted for the 32GB model, with the touch cover as I ordered a 64GB microsd card last week. We will see how nicely that plays with the device. I'm left with about 25GB of usable space out of the 32GB, which I imagine is due to the way the data is measured, as well as swap and windows/office installed. After installing some apps, etc, I'm down to about 16GB of storage, so that sd card can't come soon enough.


•Being able to plug in USB devices is really freaking cool. My laser printer worked no problem. Same with a wireless mouse. I'm a student in IT, so I always carry around a lot of gadgets in my bag, one of them being an external hard drive, so my data space needs are quelled by that handy little port.


•SkyDrive integration throughout the OS is a godsend. I'm a fairly heavy SkyDrive and Office user, as well, so having 2013 included is a really sweet deal. Make sure you update from the preview version that ships with the device to the final version, though, as it improves performance and touch elements considerably.


•Side note: I accidentally pressed the back button in the browser and thought I lost all this, but it saved it within the text input field. Nice one.

All in all I'm quite pleased with the device. The hardware, like most of the reviews say, is definitely at least on par with iPad, if not better - or different as they say. I've owned the first three generation iPads, and this device just seems so much better in all the little places, which is quite nice, indeed. Obviously the software selection is a little low right now, but that will most definitely increase over time. This is Windows after all. That said, there are already more useful tablet apps for my day to day use than on my Nexus 7. Android is already trailing this new platform in that regard, in my opinion, and its only been out for two days.

 Very pleased with this device. Still on the fence about selling this in January to put towards the Surface pro, as all my x86 needs are dealt with via RDP. We will see.


 •Metro, or Modern, is beautiful. I've been a Windows Phone user for almost 2 years now, and damn does this interface work well on a tablet. The gestures take a little getting used to, but once you get the idea of it, it makes the traditional iOS/Android interfaces seem downright dated. I've been using Windows 8 RTM via MSDNAA since early September on my desktop, so I'm already fairly familiar with a lot about the OS, which I suppose helps (and makes RDP kick ass).


•I'm excited to see how this will play with Windows Phone in the future. I own a 7.5 device, so as of right now I can only charge the device, as the Zune desktop client doesn't run on RT. I have heard that Microsoft will be releasing a WP8 app in the near future, though, perhaps we will find out on Monday during their press conference.


•IE 10 is really awesome, and really fast (even with flash!) though I wish other browsers were allowed in the Store. I like tab syncing from Chrome.


•One thing I love about IE is the flip ahead feature, where, on a multi page site like neogaf or reddit, it allows you to ""drag"" the page to the left in order to advance to the next page rather than having to tap the small next link that is often at the bottom. Same goes for going back to the last page, just swipe it to the right. Very slick.


•As far as I can tell, tabs also load in the background, which I don't remember my iPad doing.


•I like that pressing the capacitive home button makes the Surface vibrate. I also like that it wakes the device, too. So many devices with capacitive buttons require use of the power button exclusively to wake the screen.


•I forgot to mention the battery. It seems as good as my iPad, maybe a bit less. I got around 9 and half hours of fairly heavy usage from 100%. It then took 1 hour, 48 minutes to charge from dead to 100. That's a lot faster than my iPad, which took over 4 and half hours to fully charge.


•Multiple users is nice, however as far as I can tell, your apps are tied to one account, so you'll have to buy them again for each account. Hopefully that is changed in the future, especially with the higher price of RT apps compared to their iOS counterparts.


•As far as the screen is concerned, it looks considerably better than other screens of this resolution, but not as sharp as the iPads. I will say, though, the colours and contrast seem better on this screen than on the iPad

I bought this thing as my true replacement for my laptop. I'm fairly tech savvy for not being in IT and decided to jump into the surface cold turkey. I am an executive for a small business in the financial industry and I thought I would let you guys know my experience of using this thing as my main computer. To start, I'll give you my setup: Surface Pro 128GB, Office 2013, Second Screen (needed but not plugged in), and I'm using this in a corporate office environment. So far, email works seamlessly with our exchange server in New York. Excel is fine and so is the included Adobe reader app. I installed Adobe Reader touch, but didn't find any benefit over the included one. Today I plan on installing following: CSS5.5 design premium (Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Acrobat Professional, and InDesign only) and Morningstar Office (this is an investment adviser software suite). 

As I go through the day and need to complete my normal tasks, I will let you guys know what works, what needs more help, etc. from real world scenarios. Also, if you have any questions, I will be glad to answer them. If interested, I will also post a picture or two of my work environment to give you an idea.

Edit: Day #2. I'll keep commenting if you're still interested. I installed Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Dreamweaver (all CS5.5). I went to get the VGA adapter at Best Buy (I wish I had a Microsoft Store around here). The guy talked up how much he liked the Pro, etc. but neglected to tell me that the VGA adapter they sell only works with the RT....not happy. Those guys are notorious for lack of product knowledge.

1357956205.0,45,self.Surface,16eyqq,Oh fuck it. I spent too much time reading and waiting for it already. Am just going to purchase the Surface Pro.,keindo,56,11,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/16eyqq/oh_fuck_it_i_spent_too_much_time_reading_and/,"A few points of consideration:

- 30-day return policy allows me to test the battery life under normal use. Whatever testing shows it to be (surfing the internet continuously, looping movies) does not really show how good it is at the rate I use it. If I find myself constantly running low on battery and being interrupted to recharge the device, then there's still time to return it.

- Haswell processor. So close, yet so far. There's no way (in my opinion) that Microsoft will release the device before July, which is when I've read the earliest Haswell devices will start showing. To do so would alienate a lot of early adopters. My guess is late October at the earliest, and that is a whole 10 months from now.

- 899/999 + 120 is not that expensive. Don't get me wrong, I'm not rich and that's a fucking good chunk of money, but laptops used to be like 1500-2000. I am ok with spending 1500 every 3 years on laptops, which means that the Surface Pro will be cost-effective to upgrade in 2 years, which will be just in time for the Surface Pro 3 (?). Maybe I'll still be here, refreshing the page madly to see if the new Broadwell chips are in.

- There's no guarantee that Microsoft will even make a Surface Pro 2. Don't get me wrong; I think they should, and it's a whole lot of research money invested if they just have one line of devices made, but in the end Microsoft's declared purpose for making the Surface is to push other hardware manufacturers to step up their game and show off Windows 8.

- Lastly, but not least importantly, I've spent way too much time reading and writing about the Surface Pro already. If I didn't get one it'd be a huge waste. And like Congress, I like throwing good money after bad.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_16eyqq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/16eyqq/oh_fuck_it_i_spent_too_much_time_reading_and/,

The driver for the Intel HD 4000 that come with the Surface Pro is slightly outdated, possibly because Microsoft has not tested the newer driver yet. [Here is the latest](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;ProdId=3498&amp;DwnldID=22375&amp;ProductFamily=Graphics&amp;ProductLine=Laptop+graphics+drivers&amp;ProductProduct=3rd+Generation+Intel%C2%AE+Core%E2%84%A2+Processors+with+Intel%C2%AE+HD+Graphics+4000%2f2500&amp;lang=eng) Intel graphics driver for Windows 8 64-bit. This also gives you access to more graphics settings.

If you notice your screen acting weird (auto-dimming) after installing these drivers while you're on battery, right click your desktop -&gt; graphics properties -&gt; advanced settings -&gt; power tab on the left -&gt; choose ""on battery"" in the drop down -&gt; uncheck Display Power Saving Technology. The power saving technology is one advantage of these Intel drivers, though, so if it doesn't bother you, you might want to see how much it improves your battery life.

On many other platforms, there is a noticeable improvement in random and/or sequential reads and writes to SSDs when using Intel's AHCI drivers (iastor) over Microsoft's AHCI drivers (msahci), which come with the Surface by default. Here are [Intel's storage drivers](http://downloadmirror.intel.com/21730/eng/iata_enu.exe).

Note that both of these drivers come with tray icons of their own, but it's easy to disable them in the settings for both of the drivers. You can also disable both tray icons in the startup apps tab in task manager without any ill effects.

I've been using these drivers for a day or two now and I haven't noticed any compatibility issues whatsoever. ",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1361855608.0,,,True,t3_197dfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/197dfx/another_surface_pro_tip_newer_intel_graphics/,

But then, I started using Windows 8 at work...didn't really affect me much at first, but then it grew on me...started using it on my desktop, and then started using it on my Lenovo X220T, and it REALLY grew on me.


After i dumped my iPad and X220T combo when I got my Surface Pro, the transition was, needless to say, VERY seamless. It just so happens that I had 2x hardware-related failures with my iPhone 5 over the span of a month, having to get it replaced each time...so I thought, why not try out Windows Phone 8, especially since it integrates so well with my Microsoft account (SkyDrive, etc.), and I can tie it with my Surface in the same ecosystem?     


I played around with a Lumia 920 at an ATT store and was just blown away - I immediately made the switch right then and there, and part of it was the great transition + integration with my Windows 8 environment, but in particular, with my Surface Pro. It may sound like it was Windows 8 that drew me to WP8, but in reality, the desire to have BOTH of my ""mobile"" devices tied into the same ecosystem was the deciding factor in the long run (it's still weird to refer to a Surface Pro as a mobile device, since it's tablet/laptop hybrid, obviously).


I am now enjoying the Windows ecosystem with my desktops, Surface Pro and Lumia 920 all synced up, and the experience for me as a longtime iOS customer (from a mobile perspective) has been far more enjoyable than the Apple ecosystem -but I definitely would NOT have made the switch to Windows Phone 8 if I did not switch from an iPad + laptop combo to my Surface Pro.

However it turned out that wasn't the problem with mine, so they gave me a new one! On top of that they let me swap my touch cover with a Type cover and simply pay the difference of about $30.

1363111889.0,36,self.Surface,1a5rwt,Microsoft rolls out Surface (Pro and RT) Firmware Update for March,Apotheosls,42,6,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1a5rwt/microsoft_rolls_out_surface_pro_and_rt_firmware/,"http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/performance-and-maintenance/pro-update-history

http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/performance-and-maintenance/rt-update-history

I was prompted to install the firmware update, dated 3/12/2013, just a few minutes ago (along with 21 other updates....).

According to the link, it has these documented fixes, though nothing yet on any other ""unofficial"" changes:

**Surface Pro update notes:**

March update

The March cumulative update includes improved Surface Wi-Fi reliability, connectivity in various scenarios, and performance improvements including:

- Fixes to Wi-Fi reliability allowing for better roaming and improvements to ""Limited"" connectivity scenarios.

- Windows To Go feature is enabled.

- Improved onscreen keyboard detection synchronization when going in and out of sleep.

**Surface RT update notes:**

March update

The March cumulative update includes improved Surface Wi-Fi reliability, connectivity in various scenarios, and performance improvements including:

- Fixes to Wi-Fi reliability allowing for better roaming and improvements to ""Limited"" connectivity scenarios.

- Resolves issues with integrated volume button.

- Improved Type and Touch cover typing experience on soft surfaces and when devices and keyboard are lying flat.

- Resolves issue with random muting.

- Trackpad performance improvements.

No mention of a fix for the ""brightness"" issue that some Surface owners are experiencing (haven't run into this myself fwiw).

**EDIT:** Not sure if it was just my Surface (Pro, 128GB), but **my system is STILL updating, and it's been over ~30 minutes.**

It has been sitting at this screen for the bulk of that time:

http://i.imgur.com/xo6CRu0.jpg

So, **if you're using your Surface Pro for anything productive, wait to apply this update** until you have the time to just let it sit there. Also, i noticed that the white LED on the power adapter is not lit up right now.

I'll edit this again once it's finished updating....

**EDIT 2:** I am now at the 1 hour mark, and my system is still stuck on the ""Surface"" logo and ""Please wait while we install a system update"" screen.

Pressing the power button does nothing. Holding down the power button does nothing. The Windows button gives a tactile feedback and does nothing. No combination of button presses/holds do anything....it seems like it's stuck and may just sit there until it's finished, or until the battery gives out. 

No blinking LEDs, but fans are still spinning like crazy. This update may have GG'd my Surface Pro...and it was pretty bare to begin aside from Office 2013, as most things were on my 64GB microSDXC card... 

**EDIT 3:** I finally got it to hard reset holding the volume up + power buttons. It restarted just fine, loaded just fine...immediately checked Windows Updates and there were 2 optional Windows 8 x64 updates on there. Installed them and restarted and it seems to be fine. 

I guess if anyone gets stuck at the update screen for any longer than 10-15 minutes, just do a hard reset....

**EDIT 4:** To double check if your firmware was updated, you can type in ""Performance Information and Tools"" in the search charm, select it, &gt; kicks you to desktop &gt; choose Advanced Tools &gt; View advanced system details in System Information

The **""Embedded Controller Version"" should be at 5.01 if your firmware updated properly** (this is straight from Surface Support).",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1363117107.0,,,True,t3_1a5rwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1a5rwt/microsoft_rolls_out_surface_pro_and_rt_firmware/,

Update: 
Some more details on what I saw.  The screen was very bright and had good color contrast. I would say it was on par with the Acer S7 just a few tables down.  The pen interaction was quite good.

I purchased a surface RT a few months back.  Since I live in Hawaii, I had no real way to experience the surface type and touch - I decided I would go for the touch, just because I felt it would be more robust and because I had read/heard a few negative reviews about the type keyboard being ""laggy"" on Microsoft word.  

Well, about a month after I purchased my surface RT + touch cover, I got an email detailing plans for a Windows Store, opening up in a mall in Honolulu (ala-moana shopping center).  I don't normally go to the mall anymore but on a whim, I went a week ago.  I walked into the store (they're a bit too apple-copy for my preference) and started playing with their type keyboards.... I instantly fell in love with it.  The dreaded ""lag"" had definitely been fixed in one of the earlier updates and the tactile feel was fucking AMAZING. 

Anyway, long(er) story short, I got the type keyboard.  Their CS people were really friendly, kind of newbie (new store) but real nice.  I got to talking with some of them and they seem to agree as we (the actual users!) that windows RT is fucking GREAT, and that the negative reviews seem to be from people who have never TRIED to use it. 


Microsoft - if you're reading this please take note - I am NOT a brand whore.  I have a apple iphone (best apps, lots of money invested in it already), I've cross shopped android, I plan on getting a PS4, and I've looked at buying a (gasp) MacBook Air instead of my Windows RT.  This is a NON FANBOY telling you, the windows RT platform is AWESOME.  You just need to push for more apps/games and this will be a game changer. 

I know you guys claimed some losses recently...but good lord, the windows RT with the type cover is just perfect.  Fucking perfect.  I don't say this often about any gadget (hell, I spent $400+ looking for a pen that i'd carry, $800+ for a wallet I like, and waaay more money that I should've on watches, knives, lights...  

I am an extremely picky person with no brand loyalty telling you - The Surface RT is perfect.  

If it was a girl, I'd take it home to my parents, and buy it a wedding ring. 


Sorry for the rambling - I am just so elated with this new setup.

I figured out how to do it just now and I figured I'd post it here.

Note: unlike SkyDrive for other Windows PCs, your files still won't be stored locally with this method. You will still be able to modify and download them as necessary. Navigating in between folders has a second or two of delay, but that's to be expected.

Prerequisite: You'll need a SkyDrive account, and it's probably necessary to have accessed it from the Modern UI app at least once.

1) Open up any Office app and go to the Open dialogue. Select SkyDrive, then click Browse. Allow it to load.

2) In the address bar of the window that opens, you'll see the following:

""Web Sites &gt; https://d.docs.live.net &gt; [hexadecimal address]""

Right click the hexadecimal address and click ""Copy address as text"".

3) Go to Computer in Windows Explorer. In the ribbon, click to expand ""Map network drive"" and select it again.

4) In the dialogue box that opens, click ""Connect to a Web site that you can use to store your documents and pictures.""

5) In the new dialogue box, click Next, and then select ""Choose a custom network location"" (this was the only choice for me, so I just clicked Next again).

6) When it prompts you, paste in the address you copied in Step 2.

7) You'll soon be prompted for your login credentials. Enter them, select to remember them, and continue.

8) Enter a name for the folder. I fittingly chose ""SkyDrive"".

9) Place a checkmark on “Open this network location when I click finish”.

10) Click Finish, and you'll see the folder in your Network area. From there, you can pin it to the taskbar, add it to your Favorites, etc.

This is handy if you want to manually add several files at once into your SkyDrive, or just generally do some more nuanced file management. Let me know if this works for you, or if you even found it helpful! Maybe I'm the only person who was looking for this, but I'm glad I found a solution.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_12p9cv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/12p9cv/tutorial_add_your_skydrive_folder_to_windows/,

Maybe someone can add it to the FAQ.

**First: Disable HiDPI Scaling. It Doesn't Work Right**

1. Right-Click on the chrome icon
2. Go to properties
3. Check ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings""
4. Hit Ok.

**Next: Set the default zoom to scale text up (while keeping it crisp)**

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **chrome://settings**
2. At the bottom, click ""show advanced settings...""
3. Scroll down to the ""Web Content"" section, and change the zoom to match your current scaling settings (150% by default. 125% if you're a screen real estate queen).

**Finally: Enable Touch Mode**

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **chrome://flags**
2. Scroll down to find ""Touch Optimized UI"" and change it to enabled.
3. Relaunch Chrome

And you're set! Eventually we won't have to do this, but with these settings I find it very usable. Interestingly enough, IE10 seems to actually scroll much more smoothly than Chrome, so I tend to stick with it in the Metro interface, using chrome on the desktop when I need my add-ons.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_18rmqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/18rmqf/how_to_fix_chrome_on_the_surface_pro/,

--

I've always been a supporter of Windows 8 and Microsoft's new vision of computing. Even though I had never used a touchscreen before, or owned any tablets or cellphones, when Microsoft demonstrated their new operating system last year I was convinced they were onto something. Why?

It is hard to speak of groundbreaking ideas and shifts in this field, since computers evolve so fast (not to mention exponentially) - but regardless, I think we are currently experiencing a major change in how we interact with computers. Where ten years ago touch input was not seriously considered in any consumer oriented field (with a few possible exceptions), and more recently it has been regarded as only suitable for leisure and less productive tasks, I think that now we are beginning to tap into the vast potential of using touch interfaces in productive environments.

Microsoft's entry into this field is far from perfect, I can say that easily - Windows 8 is in many ways a product that feels unfinished and divided - but it is an important, bold step in the right direction. For a long time people have been saying one need a keyboard and mouse to do ""actual work"" - but the incapabilities of touch have simply been a matter of lacking the right interface to make use of it productively. There are two main areas that can be evolved to improve this - gestures and contextuality.

Today we see a very linear approach to touch interfaces, all things considered - this makes for a straightforward user experience suitable for media consumption and other consumer-oriented tasks. However, this is also what has prevented touch interfaces so far to provide the means to do more advanced things. This is how Microsoft is changing the industry right now - with a interface centered around these points:

**Gestures** which provides access to advanced actions without requiring precision or screen space

**Contextuality** which provides access to data depending on what you need to see, making it possible to make the rest of the interface more touch-centric

And importantly, also a combination of the two. See Microsoft's OneNote MX app for a fantastic example of this. Tapping any area you want to edit presents a radial, contextual menu which lets you select from a range of advanced features, all without losing any productive potential of the program. The fact that touch interfaces haven't been suitable for productivity isn't because they're touch-based - it's because there hasn't been a good touch UI made yet.

And this is why Windows 8 is such an important entry in personal computing. Microsoft has created the foundation of the next level of touch. Their Metro UI (formerly Metro) design language promotes a removal of chrome and focus on the actual content - while preserving all functionality through contextuality. This is where I believe the future lies - even extremely feature-heavy programs like Photoshop can be adapted to touch computing through these guidelines, it is just a matter of offering contextual menus and commands. 

Of course one might ask - even if programs can work as good using touch interfaces as they can with a keyboard and mouse, why change when the latter works perfectly fine as it is? Because touch screens offer a huge amount of benefits by themselves. It's a more direct way of communication, and makes many usage scenarios way more effective and fluid. Scrolling, zooming, navigating menus - without a middle man (the mouse), navigating becomes far more direct. Importantly, it also lays the foundation to make entirely new devices - just look at the flood of new Windows 8 hybrids that have hit the market since its release. These are just a few reasons - the downsides of touch interfaces so far have been lack of productivity, but as I have addressed above, this is changing.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_19gg5z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/19gg5z/why_microsoft_is_onto_something/,

It has an Intel Core i5-3317U processor clocked at 1.70GHz. Updates forthcoming.

**Updates**:

* The speakers were about as weak as Surface RT. I would not be surprised if they were the same. Music I played on the Surface was barely audible above the relatively loud background noise in the store; the speaker on my Surface RT is perfect in quiet rooms if I'm not doing anything, so I expect the same of these speakers

*  The device feels significantly thicker than Surface RT, but I think it's a healthy heft. The overall weight was obviously heavier than Surface RT, but maintains the same balanced feel.

After my indestructible Nokia phones that I had for about 4-5 years, I only had iPhones after that. Additionally, my household is filled with Apple products, ranging from the iMac to a MacBook Pro, a number of iPods, and 2 Apple TVs. My parents also own their own iPad. 

However, I kept seeing advertisements for the Microsoft Surface everywhere, and I couldn't help but not satisfy my curiosity. After checking it out at the Microsoft Store at my local mall and doing a heck of a lot of research online, I decided to go with the RT. Here's my review: 

1. From someone who is used to using OSX, Microsoft 8 has a pretty damn big learning curve. It was very frustrating trying to figure out how to do basic things such as delete apps, move tiles around, the whole side-swipe bar, control panel, etc. Quite frankly, it's not intuitively designed for someone to just ""get,"" unlike many Apple products.

2. Once I did learn how to use all the commands, delete tiles, find apps properly, etc., I think the functional design is better than any Apple portable OS. The screen seems less ""cluttered"" due to the search and setting functions having to be swiped in, and I absolutely love the method of switching apps. 
3. One small negative; deleting apps is too cumbersome, and moving them around on the start screen is annoying. I find myself constantly having to re-drag, or move a tile to a desired position because it's simply not responsive in the correct way. 
4. Little things that I like: YouTube still plays when another app is opened. Although there are less apps, there are lots of superior free apps than some paid apps in the Apple Store. I can add a 64GB microSD card. Comes with Office. 
5. Little things I don't like: Lots of garbage apps that just aren't functional. It doesn't work with my printer. Two setting panels; why is there a control panel, and a personalization panel? A little bit confusing. 
6. Netflix works great; I actually like it more than the Apple version as it's less cluttered. 
7. Sometimes, the device is unresponsive, and out of the box it took a LONG time just to update. Apps will randomly close, but I feel as though that is a problem with the app, not the device. 

All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. My initial frustrations have died down, and I foresee myself using this thing nonstop. ",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1e3xyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1e3xyo/my_review_of_the_microsoft_surface_rt_coming_from/,

1368813570.0,22,self.Surface,1ej3xh,Mini review of the Bamboo Stylus Feel with the Surface Pro,Dacvak,25,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1ej3xh/mini_review_of_the_bamboo_stylus_feel_with_the/,"So I ordered a [Bamboo Stylus feel](http://www.wacom.com/en/products/stylus/bamboo-stylus-feel) for my Surface Pro a little while ago, and I just spent some solid time with it. It's $40 for the normal black stylus, and it is compatible with the Surface Pro right out of the box - nothing to install at all.

Right off the bat, it's pretty light, but it's got a great exterior feel. Without the cap, it's about the same weight as the Surface Pro stylus (""SPS"" for short), and with the cap adds a little extra. It's not only a matte finish (as opposed to the SPS, which is a glossy plastic), but it's a little rough like a fine-grain sandpaper, which feels amazing and comfortable.

The primary difference between the two styli is that the tip on the SPS is very smooth and rigid, while the tip of the Bamboo feel is softer and has resistance. So writing with the feel feels more like writing on an actual Wacom tablet, or even a piece of paper. This is, without question, a dramatic improvement from the SPS, and really makes drawing more of a pleasure.

The second largest difference is the pressure-sensitivity of the pen, which is way, *way* better than the SPS, in my opinion. It takes probably double the amount of pressure to get from 0% to 100%, and since the tip is more flexible, that feels amazing. You end up being met with far more resistance when pressing on the screen with full weight, and it really helps with accuracy. Not to mention, it's now *much* easier to have consistent light presses (in the 0%-30% range) with the feel, as opposed to the SPS, where I have to consciously make an effort to not press too hard, which sometimes makes me sacrifice accuracy. This is a huge plus over the SPS, and arguably the primary reason to own one.

Another difference is the right-click button on the feel is flush with the pen, and it's glossy. So no matter how you're holding it, it never gets in the way. But when you need to use it, it's easy to find and easy to press. This is also an improvement, though I can't fault the SPS's right-click button since it doubles as a docking magnet, which I love. But when actually drawing, I greatly prefer the button on the feel.

There's zero noticeable difference in accuracy between the two styluses, so if you're having trouble in that category, this is not a solution. The feel is just as accurate as the SPS, but just like the SPS tends to skew a bit when dramatically tilted one way or another, especially when pointing in the corner of the Surface Pro. This is a bit disappointing, but it's to be expected.

A huge drawback to the Bamboo Stylus feel is the fact that it **does not** have an eraser like the SPS has. If you flip the pen around and hold it to your Surface Pro, nothing happens at all. There's no back sensor, so if you're the type of person who's constantly erasing your work, this will definitely bug you.

However, the feel does have a pen cap that securely snaps into place, in the front or the back. I love this, because now I can just toss the stylus in my bag and not worry about damaging the tip, unlike the SPS. I don't know if the trade-off (no eraser/plus cap) is worth it for everyone, but I think if I had to have the choice, I'd keep the cap. The cap also has a very sturdy clip to attach to whatever. 

Overall, $40 is a fucking lot of money for a stylus. I don't agree with the price... It feels more reasonable at $20. But if you're a serious graphic artist who needs to use your Surface Pro on the go, I would certainly recommend it. If you just dabble in art - like I do - it's merely a luxury to have. There's no question that it's a nicer product to use if you're big into Photoshop or Sketchbook or something. But I certainly don't think the average consumer will see that much of a difference between the two styli.

Hope this is helpful to anyone on the fence.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1ej3xh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1ej3xh/mini_review_of_the_bamboo_stylus_feel_with_the/,

I got the Surface RT, and I replaced my Dell XPS 15 with it and a new desktop. The Surface is very light, but you should hold it with an open hand from the back, as it is just too wide to hold from one side. It is pretty fast and sure as hell beats using a regular tablet. It really is better to use the Surface, it feels less limited, because it's still Windows 8.

I have used remote desktop to my desktop and it's actually really freaking easy. Just type in the IP address and connect. Might be harder once they're not on the same connection.

The Surface also comes with a USB port. Wayyy more handy than I thought it'd be. After I built my desktop, I had the Windows 8 ISO on an external drive. I copied it to my Surface via FireWire and then actually managed to put Windows 8 on a USB to install on my desktop. That was pretty sweet.

With the Touch cover, it is interesting. I have a Windows Phone and the Surface uses the same superior auto correct technique to fix your typing. It honestly just feels like I'm typing on a touch screen when I use the touch cover. I haven't had any problems with it, though at times, the trackpad button(where you can click by tapping under the trackpad) seems a little ambiguous in terms of tapping it without looking down. Maybe just takes more getting used to.

The default apps are a little stale feature wise, but as with any platform, the third party apps are good solutions. Being a developer myself, I use the Surface to develop using Visual Studio remote debugging tools  for my new Google Talk app, and it works fairly well.

I have experienced some problems, firstly the port where the Touch cover snaps on was already tearing out from day one(link to what I'm talking about: http://www.wpcentral.com/microsoft-surface-rt-touch-cover-issues)

Second issue is here http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/154ccy/90_available_plugged_in_not_charging/. At first I thought it was a feature, now seen to 86%. I don't know why this happened, but I've tried everything to get it fixed. 

Microsoft easily exchanged both of these, but I seriously recommend using the Advanced Exchange, where they send you a new device or keyboard and you put your broken one and send it back while they hold you on credit. It's just easier for you, and you have 14 days, why you not send it back?

Overall, I love it. Those 2 issues weren't really related to the actual device itself, just manufacturing issues.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_15m386,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/15m386/my_surface_experience_so_far/,

The Great:

* VaporMG: I've never seen a device feel as solid or as sturdy as the Surface. I think this is likely because of VaporMG

* The Screen: Beautiful, crisp. I absolutely love this display.

* TypeCover: Best keyboard I have ever owned. This may be because I've never spent more than 30 dollars on a keyboard, but TypeCover feels extremely nice. Worth the extra 10 dollars over the TypeCover.

* Microsoft Support: The most professional and caring support team I have worked with in the last five years. I've had to work with Asus and Lenovo, and their outsourced support teams have either been rude or unhelpful. Everyone at Surface has resolved my issues with very few headaches and were very helpful. I even got the same support agent twice in the last week, and he was extremely friendly when he recognized me. Plus they have sent follow up surveys after most Support calls, which I've not had before with any tech support.

The Good:

* The Pen: Pressure sensitive ink is great. I've used it on the Samsung Series 7 Slate and it is just as good on the Surface Pro. Great for note taking. Can't do without it now.

* Recover/Reinstall times: Insanely fast. Last night I was able to completely reinstall Windows from the recovery partition in 10 minutes while on the phone with support. Blazing fast. 

The Not So Good:

* The Pen: It feels cheap. Not a deal breaker, but the drivers certainly aren't great yet. I'm happy to hear that Microsoft is working with Wacom to get WinTab support in as soon as possible, but for a device that was being billed for all sorts of professionals, creative too, they should have expected backlash from Artists. Not a deal breaker for me, but still reflects poorly.

* The Battery Life: I know this will likely get a lot of people to freak out, but the Battery Life is a little disappointing. I know it's a balance between Form Factor/Performance. It's a trade off, but it still sucks. 3.5 hours is what I got on my two year old laptop, and I'm getting an hour to an hour and a half better on the Surface. Still a step up, but I would have wished for more.

* TypeCover trackpad: You get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting a great Trackpad, and I didn't get one. It makes working in Desktop Mode on 100% scale a little painful, because I have to choose between a not so great trackpad or a pen. I'll likely have to invest in a Bluetooth mouse. 

* Windows + HighDPI: This one really isn't the Surface's fault, but it is most prominent on the Surface. I love the display, but it's a little hard to find a scale that works properly for my work flow. My eyes aren't the greatest, so 100% is a little straining to work with. However, 150% scale makes me feel like I'm using a 720p panel again. Plus some applications (Chrome) are completely borked. That's not the fault of Windows or the Surface, but it is still not ideal.

The Bad:

* Launch Day: This was not great. I don't know if it was supply chain issues or artificial scarcity, but it was not good. I was lucky enough to get a device, but a lot of people were very frustrated. 

The Weird:

* Rotation Lock: Randomly the ability to turn Rotation Lock On/Off from the Settings Charm just disables itself. I haven't quite figured out why.

* Weird keyboard/TypeCover bug: My night last night was very weird. My TypeCover stopped working completely last night, after working all afternoon. I figured it was some wonkiness with the accelerometer, so I detached it and tried to use the Surface as a tablet. No On Screen Keyboard. I called support, and they worked me through some troubleshooting steps, and nothing worked. Even after a complete Restore and even a Reinstall of Windows, the issue persisted. Support figured there was something wrong with the Surface, and an RMA was created. I went to bed, fully ready to send the Surface off for a replacement today, and tried again after waking up. Everything was back to normal. I had tried full power cycles, complete reinstalls, and letting it just sit overnight fixed the issue. Still have no clue what happened. Very weird.

In the end the Surface is hands down the best Windows Device I have ever used. I've owned a couple of Asus laptops, a Lenovo IdeaPad, and a Series 7 Slate over the last four years, and the Surface is best hands down. There are a few things that need to be tightened up, but that will come with software updates and future generations of devices. Sorry for rambling a bit.

1. Log on to: https://account.live.com    

2. Under Overview &gt; Account Summary &gt; Edit Name &gt; Enter your first and last name. Save.    

3. On your Surface Pro (don't have an RT so i'm not sure if it works the same as Win8Pro) open up your Settings charm with a swipe from right to left &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Users &gt; Switch to a local account. You can use any name for this local account. Go ahead and get logged in.    

4. Log out of that local account and via the same way you switched it to a local account, switch back to your Microsoft account. Login.    

5. Your first and last name should now display on your Start screen!    

Found this out the hard way after realizing that my primary GMail addy was being displayed for all the world to see when i'm on the Start screen of my Surface....not that it matters that much, but i know there are people out there who DON'T want their email displayed like that.    

Cheers!

*While this registry tweak isn't an invasive change, there's always a chance that something could go horribly wrong if something is transposed incorrectly.  It's always a good idea to backup your registry if you're going to make any changes.*  Redditor **YetAnotherDeveloper** has posted a link in the comments with the step to backup your registry.  (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/back-up-the-registry). *Thanks, YetAnotherDeveloper.*

***********************************************************************

If you're like me, your Surface RT's start screen gets a little cramped when you have a lot of tiles when you start categorizing your tiles.  Thankfully, there is a little tweak that allows you to scale the screen to allow a fourth row.  It does involve a registry tweak, which is easy to do, but YMMV if you never dabble in the Registry Editor.

Surface RT Start Screen with 4th row: http://imgur.com/i45xK6m

* Run notepad
* Copy and paste the following three lines of text:

&gt; Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00                     

&gt; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Scaling]

&gt; ""MonitorSize""=""12.1""

* Save file with .reg extension. (4thRowTweak.reg)
* Double-click the file to and approve the import of data.
* Restart the Surface.  

Apologies if this has been posted recently, but it's made using the Surface RT a little more enjoyable now that I the Start Screen view isn't so claustrophobic.  

**UPDATE:** The scaling will affect more than just the start screen's tile resizing, and seems to scale any running Windows 8 apps.  The size of the on-screen keyboard will be affected.

**UPDATE 2: STEPS TO REMOVE SCALING IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CHANGES** If you find that you don't like the scaling, you can always remove the MonitorSize key from your registry manually or you can notepad, and copy the following lines to the body, save the file with a .reg extension like you did above in the steps above.  You're essentially substituting the ""12.1"" value for a - (hyphen without quotes).  This will remove the key when you run the registry import.  

&gt; Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00                     

&gt; [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Scaling]

&gt; ""MonitorSize""= -

Restart and you should be back to your original settings.

1360158866.0,20,self.Surface,17zy54,Is the Pro battery life really that limiting? A few scenarios.,keindo,25,5,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/17zy54/is_the_pro_battery_life_really_that_limiting_a/,"1) Cross-country flight = 5 hours.  I figure I'll watch a movie, maybe do some reading on a Kindle app (with the black background, the battery should last even longer).  During this time wireless and bluetooth will probably be disabled--because we're on a flight.  And considering that you can't use the device on takeoff or landing, it seems like the battery would last pretty much the entire flight.

2) Work. I'm in the medical field, so it'll be great for taking notes when I'm seeing patients. I need it to last for a couple hours (in case things get backed up and I don't get back to my office in between pts), and then charge quickly in 10-15 min segments / during lunch for when I can get back and am doing some paperwork--on the desktop. Seems like the Surface Pro can handle that fine.

3) Meetings. Some presentations, note taking, maybe from 1-4 hours. Sometimes outlets aren't that accessible. Should be fine, as most of the reviews indicating low battery life were from looping video, and unfortunately I'm not lucky enough to be looping 1080p movies during the ENTIRE meeting.  Maybe part of it :-)

4) Lectures.  Hey, I went to school too guys.  A metric fuckton of school, in fact.  Again, I'm really curious as to what the battery life is with using the pen and powerpoint, etc..  Since you aren't watching a movie, you don't need all 400 nits of the screen at 100% brightness. So lets say it lasts 4.5 hours--definitely good enough for 2x 2h classes or 4x 1h  classes. 

4b) Yeah, if you have classes in the morning and afternoon, and you're on campus during lunch, it might not last the entire day. IF your major use for the device is note taking (all fucking day), and you just want to jot down some notes on slides, and type some stuff up in Word, I think you should consider an RT / atom processor device anyways.

5) Studying at a cafe or such. Maybe you're even streaming lectures.  Well I think most lectures can work at &lt;1080p--maybe I'm getting old, but I never found watching lectures at more than 480 to be useful.  So that should extend the battery life to 5 hours or so. Also, if you're doing some reading and some note taking it should last 5 hours or so. Maybe it's just me, but I don't have the ability to study more than 5 hours continuously, and at that time the cafe owner would start getting pissed that you're really taking advantage of their space while drinking a measly $1.50 coffee :-).

6) Use outdoors, at a park, etc. Maybe a lot of people do this, I don't know, but I've never gone to a park to watch 2 movies at full brightness in 1080p while browsing the internet simultaneously.

7) Long roadtrips. Yeah I remember that one time when I was a kid and we had a 10 hour drive and I was able to replace the batteries in my gameboy and play tetris the entire way and I got fucking good at that. But by the time I get married and have a kid and they're old enough to play video games on long road trips--well, Haswell should be out.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_17zy54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/17zy54/is_the_pro_battery_life_really_that_limiting_a/,

Bought my Surface and while I am devastated by the loss of bloons tower defense 4, it has been positive experiance.

I am a college student and a computer technician. Surface has helped me lose my 8 pound laptop for something I feel safe carrying around in my hand because it is comfortable and since it's not an Apple product, thieves don't immediately identify with it.

Work/ getting stuff done, surface with my skydrive has made organizing my college assignments easy. I have many devices and the new office always snaps to saving to skydrive by default. Only downside is when I'm somewhere with no network; RT skydrive does not save locally.
Adding printers has been a cake; Surface recognized my bluetooth printer where my laptop had to have drivers downloaded to it.

For pleasure, I have never had a better reader; I still have a kindle fire for textbooks that are not on amazon yet (coursesmart.com). While a bit hefty, the surface survived through an entire book / trip across the Atlantic and I can balance it in one hand without it slipping.
Been playing cut the rope.

Mostly its the fact i can slam it shut like a book and get up and go. It just wasnt the same with my iPad. I also managed to charge my cell phone off my Surface while I was running around Paris.

I was following a guide on how to perminantely move users and program data to another drive using audit mode and sysprep on Windows 8 and totally messed up my installation. Idiot me forgot to make a recovery USB. However I have another copy of Windows 8 that I downloaded through school. This is a short tutorial on how to unbrick your Surface if you have another copy of Windows 8 while salvaging your installation. Once complete you can make your recovery drive and not have to deal with this hassle again.    

What you need:    
Windows 8 ISO    
HP Bootable USB Tool:http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=197    
Flash Drive 8GB    

Simple instructions:    
1. Install the HP software, use the tool to format the drive using the FAT32 file structure (the surface won't boot from ntfs).    
2. Extract the Windows 8 ISO to a folder.    
3. Copy the contents of the folder to the root directory of the flash drive.    
4. Turn off the Surface and make sure flash drive is connected.    
5. Hold the Volume Down Key and Power button and turn the device on.    
6. Windows 8 will boot from flash drive    
7. Don't Click Install at the bottom right, instead click Advanced    
8. Let it find your OS and Select the option to Refresh the OS    
9. Takes about 10 minutes, all your file data will be saved but all your     applications will be removed. You will be left with a Windows.OLD   folder.    
10. To delete the Windows.OLD folder load Disk Clean Up and then select System Clean Up and delete the Windows.OLD partition.    

This guide is from memory but I would be happy to coach anyone through this if they need additional help.

I loved the concept of a Win8 tablet.  I had a Surface RT for 2 weeks, but in the end.. I decided WindowsRT wasn't for me. I wanted the Surface Pro. But then... all the info started leaking out. 2lbs, 4 hours of battery life.. Fans... and so on. And I was turned off. 

So I turned to the Atom tablets.  I liked that it was still light and had great battery life. I had my eyes on the 11.6 inch Samsung Ativ. which I later purchased.  My friend picking up the Acer. I gotta admit, I was jealous. He payed $100 less than me, got a sleek tablet that felt like an iPad, with a dock that added more battery! Meanwhile, the Ativ just proved too large and bulky.. and I never used it in the week I owned it.

When I went in on Saturday morning, I was not in the best of moods either. I wanted something other than the Ativ, but NOT a Surface Pro. And I was told that they would be getting in something other than Surface. I was told wrong. I felt as if I had been victim of a Bait and Switch. While I was there, I met an aquantance I hadn't seen for a while, who had come in to pick up the Surface... and as we talked, I decided... I'll give the device a chance. So I got in line, to pick up the... remaining, 64 GM tablet.

I walked out of the store, pessimistic on the concept.. But I said I'd give it a chance. I knew I would be returning it Monday..  And this percepton wasn't helped when I tried running Leaue of Legonds, and somehow overheated the tablet. But before I knew it, I realized that this tablet had more use in the 3 days I owned it, than the entire week I had the Ativ. I decided that.. I did have a place for it in my life. Not to supplement my laptop, but to replace it. I started to view the Surface Pro, as a Reverse Convertible. An Ultrabook, that had the form factor of a tablet. 

I still haven't stopped using it. I didn't get a type cover, I picked up a stand alone BT keyboard and BT Mouse. I may still pick up a Type cover.. I haven't decided.

Either way, I am really enjoying this device.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_18dzki,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/18dzki/the_surface_pro_is_winning_me_over/,

I hadn't really premeditated this review, so I may be missing some points, but hopefully 

**SUMMARY:** It has mostly been pretty fun, a decently built twin-stick shooter with adequate touch controls. Core gameplay is actually pretty good. Lots of really bad implementation with weapons and theme, though.

**THE BAD:** The Halo story, sadly, is tacked on. It's presented as a game for Spartans to play in training to hone their skills and history knowledge. For a guy like me who thrives on the story in games, that was a huge disappointment. The little bit of text before every mission essentially boils down to ""Spartan destroys stuff."" Exposition is just there to pretend like your mission has meaning, but since it's a history lesson, it really doesn't. No character development or suspense or anything at all in the story to keep you engaged. Kind of like... it's a poorly designed educational game for Spartans. Instantly took a lot out of my desire to play the game before I even had a chance to start playing it. Even still, ignoring the chance to expand on the Halo universe bugs me as the biggest missed opportunity for the game. 

Worse is the pre-mission weapon select screen. The idea here is fine, even unlocking some weapons with XP is a cool idea. The problem is that after you bought the game for $7, you now have to spend extra money to unlock the weapons like the Spartan Laser. I haven't seen these weapons available at any point in the game. If you want to use one at all, you have to buy it EVERY LEVEL with more real money. This is even more insulting when you remember that you're supposed to be a Spartan in training. The system would have been fine if it was free and you could buy many different weapons, but every time I checked (I stopped after a while) your only options are all the same. Every mission. It would have been fine if you could unlock them all with in-game XP or with real money, but this turns the game's feeling into a dirty cash grab. Keep in mind, these are all still first impressions from buying the game to *the menus*. At this point, *you haven't even played the game*.

Extended from this, there doesn't feel like enough variety in the guns. A few of them work well, but several of them either don't feel like they have the same oomf (ie, the shotgun) or don't work very uniquely or aren't even there.

**THE GOOD:** I know I've complained a lot, after I got done grumbling about the sleazy attempts to extort more money out of me and terrible premise, I was able to find some good, solid fun. Sounds are familiar, graphics are pretty good, and running around killing grunts and elites is satisfying. Some weapons and the armor abilities work very well in this new type of Halo game. The vehicle control is also surprisingly good. I look forward to missions where I get to pilot something, which I hadn't really expected. They do feel different from just running around. The levels are also short, but well built. Despite every mission boiling down to ""go here, kill that,"" there's usually some small difference that helps every level feel a little unique.

There are also decent incentives to replaying the levels. High scores are good, and the skulls from the XBox Halo games return in some pretty clever ways. You may find yourself replaying levels with new strategies to fit the skulls you selected for boosting your score, and they are brief enough that you won't feel bad about spending the time running through the same missions. Each one takes maybe five minutes to complete. Speed runners will complete some in under 100 seconds. 

**WORTH THE MONEY?** Sure, if you want an okay little portable game. It's got 25 missions, each replayable and fun enough. There are definitely better twin-stick shooters, and I think $5 would have been better (or free with optional microtransactions). There's just nothing here to make it special at all, though there is some decent, generic fun to be had.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1j79fh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1j79fh/halo_spartan_assault_worth_your_money/,

This code works when purchasing the discounted student versions of the tablets as well so you can get two 10% discounts together, E.g for the RT it's £279 discounted to £251.1 discounted to £225.9 which is a nice saving in total = 19.03% ",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1376693188.0,,,True,t3_1kiadm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1kiadm/multiple_student_discounts_work_together_when/,

I now have both a Surface RT and a Surface Pro. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the Pro and how it stacks up to the RT.

You don't need me to tell you that the Pro is heavier, 50% in fact. It's definitely at the upper limit of what can be considered comfortable to hold for long periods of time with the touch cover attached.

The weight is distributed slightly towards the left-hand side, meaning that you'll want the left to be at the bottom when holding it portrait.

It is noticeably hotter under load understandably, but even during gaming it's within tolerable-to-touch temperatures.

On the subject of gaming, you definitely need to install the newer intel drivers. Not only is the performance better, but without them you get no scaling at lower resolutions, constraining you to a box in the middle of the screen.

Most current-generation games that I've tried play on it to an acceptable standard. Borderlands 2 works great at 720/768p at medium-ish detail. You can drop it to low detail to run at 1080p for that crisp feeling, but at normal viewing distances it doesn't make that much odds. Portal 2 is fine pretty much maxed out. Being such a high resolution display there's no need for AA. Generally speaking I've been impressed at the HD 4000 and it does somewhat redeem Intel's history after the GMA 950 that overstayed its welcome.

A Bluetooth game controller with x360ce to emulate a 360 controller for games is a very nice combination. No dongles here! The only drawback however is that the Pro and RTs WiFi performance suffers massively when using bluetooth.

I was marginally annoyed MS didn't stick to the same display standard for both the RT and the Pro, one using Micro HDMI and the other one using Mini Display Port. It would really have been nice in both cases to have seen a HDMI adapter in the box. It'd also have been nice to have seen a USB 3 -&gt; Ethernet adapter in the box too for something being pushed for professional use.

The basic layout of the RT and the Pro do have some differences. On the RT the USB is on the right near the top, the Pro has it on the left near the bottom. The RTs micro SD slot is behind the kickstand, and the Pros is on the right hand side at the top.

Being free of the walled garden of apps except those I chose is very freeing. The RT feels very restricted in comparison and is now pretty much only used for content consumption or cases where longevity is important.

You can as it turns out use the smaller RT charger with the Pro tablet and vice-versa. The drawback in the former case being that charging takes much longer. But the Pro charger does have the nice bonus of letting you charge another USB device.

Overall I really like the Surface Pro. The price tag for the 128GB was a little steep however and I'd have really liked a bit more internal storage given that MicroSD limits you to 64GB extra.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1kcbxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1kcbxk/got_a_surface_pro_yesterday_here_are_my_thoughts/,

Whether you like Windows 8 or not, it does everything.

The problem is that Windows 8 - at least desktop mode - absolutely sucks when you're trying to control it with just the screen. That's surely no doubt why the Surface Pro's standard cover is a keyboard and mouse.

But it doesn't have to be a pain in the ass to use the desktop. The nice thing about Windows is that, believe it or not, it can be used almost entirely with a keyboard, alone. There are great commands to close tabs/programs, switch applications, highlight and manipulate text, and do other tasks that would otherwise require the precision of a mouse.

Now, if there were some program that could read gestures and assign them to those keyboard commands, that would make the tablet experience of the Surface Pro so much nicer. Right now, it's an extreme pain in the ass to close tabs in Chrome using just the screen. It usually takes me four or five different pokes before I finally get it.

Now imagine a program that could assign different gestures to those sort of actions. So, a three-finger inward pinch could equal Ctrl-F4, which closes tabs. Maybe a three finger swipe left is ""back"" in browsers. Four/five-finger pinches could close the whole program.

I wonder how difficult it would be to program something like this. But it'd really increase the usability of the Surface Pro by a huge amount, especially when in tablet-only mode.

I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but I typically end up using my Pro as a tiny laptop. Which is great, obviously, but it'd be nice if I could lay down and use it as a tablet just as easily. If they could make the desktop more usable, I'm sure this would have way more mass appeal.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1is5mi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1is5mi/what_the_surface_pro_truly_needs_multitouch/,

There is a Microsoft engineer posting on that thread, who is working on a fix but he needs more data. Please post in that thread with details of this issue as experienced by you.



************
After the massive patch in March I have noticed that there is noticeable lag in the system wake on pressing the power button. There are two scenario's - 

1) The tablet was recently used (less than the sleep timer in power settings) then the response to pressing power button is instant, with no lag or delay in the tablet waking up.

2) The tablet has not be used recently and is in sleep mode. In this case there is a noticeable lag before the system wakes up. You need to hold down the power button for couple of seconds to wake the tablet. 

Before the March patch, the system responded with instant wake on power button press regardless of how long the tablet had been sleeping. This is a stealth ninja change that Microsoft have done. I never saw anything about this in the patch notes. 

This kind of heavy handed behavior on Microsoft's part is really pissing me off. Why not announce this change? Why is this not user configurable? Initially I thought my power button was dodgy and needed to be repaired until I spoke to some other Surface RT owners who also had the same puzzling behavior. Everyone of them also thought they needed to send the tablet in for repairs. Secondly I would rather have instant tablet wake than have a few minutes extra battery life during the day.

Last week I posted that I'd found a UK site which sells the Surface Pro:

http://www.mobicity.co.uk/microsoft-surface-pro-128gb.html

I ordered a 128GB one on Thursday, and am happy to say that it arrived today, on the third working day after ordering!

Important things to note:

It is a US Surface Pro which has been imported, this means that it'll come with a US power supply. This is not a problem, as it comes supplied with a US-&gt;UK adapter plug. If that's too unsightly for you, then the plug-&gt;brick part of the cable is a standard figure-eight lead and can be replaced with any generic one you have lying around.

They stated to me that it doesn't come with the pen - it does.

It comes regionalised for the US, so you'll need to change region settings accordingly - no biggie.

Other than that, it's great! Happy to have my Surface Pro now, and I highly recommend the site I got it from - even if it does cost a little more than they're likely to start at when officially released.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_19s21u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/19s21u/surface_pro_in_uk_success/,

1360775922.0,16,self.Surface,18gcvu,Review of Surface Pro [student/note taking perspective],meta_adaptation,22,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/18gcvu/review_of_surface_pro_studentnote_taking/,"I'm sure there are other undergraduate or even high school students out there that are looking for a good tab/PC for class, so i thought i'd give my 2 cents for any potential buyers since i know i would probably want to read the same. 

I'm an undergraduate engineering student and i've been looking for a tablet with dedicated stylus support, good palm block software, and a big enough resolution to write math equations everywhere, so when i first saw the Surface keynote speech a while back i figured it could be a contender to do what i need done.

**Stylus** 

Works amazingly simply put. Now i haven't used *too* many styluses in my life, but it definitely is one of the smoothest and responsive i've had a chance to use and very fluid even when frantically trying to copy down notes from fast-writing profs. Only gripe is along the edges of the screen the accuracy decreases significantly and you can visibly see the cursor moving away from the stylus. MS said they are working on an update to better the pen calibration, i hope it comes soon, but be prepared to be annoyed considering all buttons on taskbars in programs are along the edges of the screen, so it gets frustrating fast.

You WILL lose the stylus if you keep it anywhere other than an external pocket or something. It is not secure in the magnetic charger slot. At all.

**Onenote 2013**

I've never used Onenote before, so maybe the novelty of it all is what is making me love using it but i am beyond satisfied with this note-taking tool with the stylus. I can just print my PDF notes to Onenote, and it can put each page onto a new page in Onenote, and i can annotate and draw in any equations or notes i have from the lecture directly onto the slide. Or pop open the touch cover and type away anywhere on the screen if i cant write fast enough. Bam done. 

Heck, you can even record audio and put it INTO the file, i havent used it yet, but i thought that was pretty neat.

**MS Office / PDFs / MATLAB**

Nothing to really say about Office, its exactly the same as on a laptop, no difference. It can run programming stuff just fine. I'd still rather use my laptop because i can type faster and it has a bigger screen, but yeah programming software is not a problem. Haven't tried any CAD software, but it should be capable of running CAD stuff as well.

**Battery**

On Airplane mode, power saver setting (with the CPU set to 80% max), and the screen dimmed to the lowest setting and just running OneNote and taking notes with the stylus, i deplete about 30-40% in 2 hours of constant note taking. I haven't drained it any further than that since i usually have outlets available to me, but extrapolating on those values (although it probably isn't linear) i would hazard a guess you could maybe squeeze out about 5-6 hours of note-taking with those power settings. If you want WIFI on (but other power settings still on) , maybe reduce that estimate to 4-5ish hours 

It doesn't get too hot on use, even when running intensive programs, but it WILL heat up like a motherfucker if you're charging it. Which really sucks, since you're always gonna be charging it...

**Typing (TouchCover, dont have the TypeCover)**

Uhhh, what can i say, probably the weakest link of the Surface. Maybe it takes getting use to, but typing on the touch cover is a whole different ball game. It's not like typing on a virtual touch keyboard on a screen, and its not like typing on a physical keyboard... it's a hybrid which take getting use to. You better make friends with your backspace key because its hard as fuck to see what you're typing. On a type keyboard you can feel the buttons, on a virtual touch keyboard, you can SEE the buttons, but with this you lose both. It's not on the screen, so you can't see it, and its flat, so you can't feel it. So good luck. 
Theres no screen dim function button! Seriously?! MS puts a fucking 'Share' button on it, but no screen dim?

edit: how could i forget this part - theres no light for the caps lock button! Theres no notificiation on the OS either, and since its all touch based, its really easy to hit the caps lock button when you're trying to hit the 'a' key.

**What if you don't have a desk?**

I hear a lot of people complaining about the weird centre of mass when is in your lap which makes it annoying. Let me tell you an easy $2 fix. A clipboard. 

Step 1: Buy clipboard

Step 2: Put clipboard on lap

Step 3: Put Surface Pro on clipboard

Done. It's not going anywhere. Plus the clipboard will be a lot cleaner than your pants or a desk, and if you have a touch cover (especially the white one like i do...) you're gonna wonna try your best to keep it clean...


If anyone has any specific questions, i'd be more than willing to answer.

Cheers

EDIT: I'll post a video later tonight of how the stylus preforms when writing text and equations, as well as the digitizer. It's probably going to be shitty cell phone camera quality though since i dont have fraps or anything on it, so i apologize in advance.

It works great. All of my notes are automatically backed up to sky drive so I can view them anywhere, and the capability of inserting images and linking to power points as the professor is talking is awesome.  Plus you can record audio/video while taking notes as well. 

The battery worked fine. I used about a quarter of it for two one hour classes. I don't think it will be a problem for me at all.

Why? Where are the mainstream apps? I feel horribly crippled not having Spotify, or being able to play a simple thing like Draw Something on my tablet (I have an iPhone 4, but I'm no Apple fanatic). 

I know that it's up to the developers, but it's alarming... I feel like the store is never going to recover at this rate. I can only take so many Indian apps!

5. Now restart both the desktop and Metro IE10 browsers, and ads will be blocked in both Metro and Desktop browsers.

6. If you want to disable adblocking for a particular site, visit that site, and select ""Turn off tracking protection for this site"" from the address bar.

Sue me. ,,26,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/188p2m/i_had_a_really_good_launch_experience_sue_me/,"Let's see, I knew I wanted a tablet with pen input about a year or more ago. The RT looked nice but knowing the Pro was 3 months later, I was eagerly awaiting the Pro.

I went into a Microsoft store Tuesday night to try to get a reservation ticket. They were out. Hence I realized demand might be higher than I expected. I then decided to visit Staples instead of the Microsoft store in hopes of obtaining a 128GB Surface Pro on lunch morning (Saturday). 

I get to Staples a few minutes prior to opening at 9 AM Saturday. There are several other cars in the parking lot, but nothing that might make you question your chances of getting the tablet, assuming they have at least 5-10 in stock. The store opens but we're all disappointed when they state they received no Surfaces. The guy in front of me suggest the Microsoft kiosk in the mall nearby. Which I purposely tried to avoid due to the reservation ticket let-down. But I ultimately decide to head there and end up behind him in line. 

We proceed to wait about 30 minutes befor the Microsoft Kiosk opens. A few more people get in after me so there seems to be around 20-25 people in line at 9:30AM. The cashier starts taking in reservation cards and jotting down others who don't have the cards. I end up with #13 in line.

10AM rolls by and the sales start. End up waiting in line waiting for the first #13 people to finish their purchases. Watching people ask so many questions, ask about their options, etc makes me realize not everyone does their homework at home and just goes out to buy the device.

I buy the tablet around 11 AM, drive home, take a shower. I bust it out about an hour later and apply a screen protector then realize there is a defect in the LCD screen; there is a small crack on the glass portion.

It somewhat annoyed me and I thought, ""Shit I'm going to go back to the store and they'll be out of Surfaces. I'll end up having to return everything and wait 3 weeks"".

Get back to the kiosk around noon. There's still a few more people in line. I end up being forwarded to the next available kiosk cashier. He takes my complaint and says, ""we keep a few in the back just in case."" and tells me to wait. 10 minutes later I get my exchange. He agrees the screen has a defect. Bring my exchanged Surface out to the car just to check the screen before driving home. Enjoy copious amounts of sugar from a Cinnabon as well. I had to get one. 

My experience so far has been very pleasant. Perhaps it's the internet complaint filter again where complaints get the most coverage. But I had a very good experience. It sounds like I'm the minority though. This was the first time I've gotten hardware on release date. Usually I go with pre-orders or post-orders. 

Tl:dr; Had awesome time getting a Surface Tablet. Went to two spots, got a 128GB with a scratched screen, returned, and still got a replacement. Not that many people in line and the experience was worth getting the tablet today.

Although Surface Pro's CPU hasn't been released, I bet it's under 2 ghz. Both devices have Intel HD 4000. 

I've seen some videos on Youtube demo-ing Photoshop on Samsung Atv 700t but it is quite laggy and the 1024 pressure sensitivity is not as good as a Laptop/Tablet convertible. We are talking about Wacom here.

Surface Pro doesn't have Wacom. It only has 256(?) pressures only, but you can't really tell the difference between 1024 and 256. I think the fact that Surface Pro is not Wacom could be problematic because Wacom has good software support. I'm not sure how the company of the Surface Pro's pen technology will be in terms of software support. 

Both devices use low power CPUs and Photoshop could get too laggy for drawing. We could use Painttool SAI but Photoshop has some super nice brush mechanics.

For me, the difference in cost is not the primary consideration, so I am having a hard time deciding whether to get the Pro or the Helix.

As far as I can tell, advantages for the Pro include: $400 cheaper, better-looking design, parallax is minimal with capacitative and pen input (although the Helix does also have pen input).

But the Helix also has some significant advantages too, including: possible 10hr (!) battery life with keyboard, slightly larger screen (11.6"") with slightly less weight (800g instead of 900g), and i7 with 8GB RAM.

I was really set on getting a Surface Pro (if only MSFT hadn't been stubborn and released it in October), but now am a little bit ambivalent. Any thoughts or comments on which one you think is better?

First of all, the Surface is the best tablet i have ever laid my eyes and hands on. After i got it, i absolutely detest using my mum's ipad. It is so damn beautifully built. And its simply amazing. I couldn't be happier, and my money is more than well spent.

Every day that I use it, I discover new things that I never thought possible on this type of device. From the small things like Win+T for new tabs in IE, or even just simply plugging in my printer and having it work. Its the little things that really make you step back and think ""wow, thats an amazing device.

The build quality. Is superb. Its absolutely brilliant! From the clever placement of the micro sd slot, to how the ports on the device barely even look like they're there cause they blend in so well. I'm just blown away. Its extremely well built. I have absolutely no complaints.

The OS. Its colourful. Its vibrant. Its smooth. Its fluid. Its responsive. Its beautiful. Of course its not perfect, but for a first release, it has more than met my expectations. I got used to the interface so quickly, now everything seems to natural and intuitive. If i pick up my mums ipad and attempt to use it, i find it extremely slow, cumbersome and difficult to navigate.

Touch Cover. I expected that it would be difficult to use. When i first got it, i was hesitant. But the only thing that was hindering my typing was exactly that; my hesitance. The lack of tactile feedback takes some getting used to, but once i began to trust my fingers, i was nearly as quick as on a standard keyboard. And it is so much better than a touch screen keyboard.

All in all, it is a fantastic device. I recommend it to everyone out there who is currently still debating on whether to get it. GET IT. I guarantee you will not regret it one bit. 

As with any technological product there are bound to be some flaws, but im my encounters, they were largely insignificant, and the rest can easily be fixed by software updates. 

On a second note, whenever i put my surface down, i tend to put it down with the touch cover touching the table. That's because i didnt want to risk scratching the beautiful finish on the surface. I know that its pretty tough and magnesium and all, but i didn't want to risk it. On the other hand, i also dont want to wear out the felt on the touch cover by continually placing it on the table. Even if i were to find a case, i dont want to add to the thickness of the surface and spoil its beautiful looks, so i did the next best thing. I went and bought a large sheet of carbon fibre design skin and manually cut it to fit the back of the surface. It turned out really clean, and it looks absolutely amazing (in my opinion)! So i thought i'd share it with you guys and see what you think!

Well, here I am now, 24 hours into Surface Pro ownership. Picked up the 128GB pro last night, backed up the Recovery partition to a usb drive and nuked the demo version of Office 2013.

All told, before I installed anything, I was at 98.8 GB free out of 110 GB on the drive which I take as being not too shabby. My 64 gig sd card only had 58.something gigs free which comes out to be about the same ratio.

On the terms of what I wish I had known... the type keyboard is more flexible than I thought it would be. I had typed on it in the store, but not on an uneven surface at home. I could feel every bump and curve in the table. The keyboard benefits from having a completely flat plane to sit on.

Other than that... no complaints. It's already crashed less in 1 day than my iPad 1 did in 20 or 30 minutes. (0 compared to lots).

My design is a hub that would fit between the camera and the kickstand on the back of the device and would offer the following functionality:

* 4 USB 2.0
* 2 3.5mm audio 
* Full size SD card slot (without messing with the microsd)
* Full size HDMI

* (maybe) more flash memory built in
* (maybe) larger speakers
* (maybe) Ethernet 10/100 

Right now I am in the middle of 3d printing the design I've been working and reworking for a couple months. I should be able to get some basic pictures up sometime later today. The reason I haven't looked into this sooner is because of the unfortunately low interest in the RT which would reflect on any type of sales I would do if any.

So what do you think?

**EDIT**: Here are some pics of an early concept done in sketchup. These are not the latest design but will give you a taste of my idea. The idea is that the 3 main ports (usb, hdmi, and 3,5) will be used to lock the hub on to the back.

* Are there any good facebook/twitter apps in the store. The only two I've tried are Facebook Lite  and Facebook Friends, and while they have a nice UI, there are some lacks when it comes to friends, groups, messages and notifications! Or should I stick with the web version?

* Leads me to my next question. Are there any 3rd party browsers that can be downloaded from the market that are better than the IE version you have from start?

* When I'm at the desktop, I find that the only way to bring up the touch keyboard is by the button on the taskbar. To me it just seems counterintuitive instead of having a gesture for swiping in the keyboard.

* When I'm in the charms bar&gt;settings on my laptop, there is a battery indicator. Is there any way I can enable that on my tablet to easier check my battery level?

* Is the ""Jailbreak"" worth it? How much do those of you who have used it on your tablets feel that it impacts your use of the tablet?

My question is, do you think the surface RT would be a good laptop for me? I basically just need something with good battery life that I can type word documents on. It costs $578 with the touch cover here in Australia, but that's comparable to other products in the market, so is the Surface the best value for money given what I want to use it for?

Surface was initially created because Microsoft didn't think that their OEMs were doing a good enough job in coming up with good hardware to go with Windows 8. It's entirely possible that they didn't really want to get into hardware, but felt that their hand was forced.

The thinking seems to be that if we (Microsoft) threaten to release our Surface Pro, but stop short of actually releasing it as far as we can, it will make our OEMs raise their game and get their own products out there, and we won't have stolen sales from them. In fact, I bet the OEMs are to some degree behind the slow rollout to the different geographies. That, and the fact that tablet hardware is a new stream for Microsoft.

Anyway, just my tuppenceworth.

When I run into the issue where my type cover is no longer recognized, this is what I figured out to do and it works every time I've tried it -- which, sadly, is more than I would have liked.

Once the type cover is no longer recognized by button pushing or mouse movement, disconnect the type cover itself from the surface pro. Then, push the button on top of the surface pro to rest your device. Push it again to turn it back on. Reconnect your type cover. Swipe the right side of the screen to get the charms options. Select the settings options. From there, select Keyboard. Within that option, select the touch keyboard. Once the touch keyboard comes onto screen. Press the x in the top right corner of the touch keyboard...

AND VOILA! Move your mouse around using your type cover's trackpad. You should be good to go until the next time it happens. It is a pain, but, I managed to figure this way out so that people don't have to keep sending their devices in as broken or leaving their device alone for a day so the issue fixes itself (like I've seen in certain posts on here).

Fortunately, a few days ago Mozilla released a new version of Firefox that scales for high-dpi screens much better. It also has better touch support than Chrome (e.g. pinch-zoom and smoother scrolliing), but not quite as good as IE10. The biggest issue was that touch did not work on some websites.   

Well, if you install the Grab and Drag addon from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grab-and-drag/), then touch support is universal, and configurable for scrolling.

So I bought and shipped in a Surface Pro from the US to the UK pretty much around the time of release. But last night, was browsing the good ol' net, it shut down. I figured it was just out of battery and left it on charge over night. 

I wake up. THE HORROR. It's stuck on a UEFI loop.

I called up the UK Microsoft help and they were very helpful, and have set up for it to be returned and replaced in the next 5 business days.

So for those of you who purchased a Pro from another country, don't worry if you're having issues! Microsoft will still help you out.

Now, I know some of you may suggest I just tether it to my cell phone. Well, personally, I'd rather drop my cell phone all together because of the absurd pricing in the current market.

To be quite honest, I am almost never in a place that does not have WiFi. However, for the times that I am, I would like to be able to send/receive calls especially in times of an emergency (I know cell phones will only support 911 calls).

As the title suggests, I just got my Surface RT this morning. 

Details: Ordered it as soon as the pre-orders were made available and was told it would be here by the 6th Nov when I rang to see where it was. Finally arrived this morning

Quick Review/Notes:

* For some reason the trackpad on the touch cover seems very erratic at times (Guessing it was during high CPU activity). I honestly thought after a few minutes of use that I'd have to return the cover. It is difficult to know what the machine is running in the background at times when you can't see it or hear any crunching away of a HDD

* Upon booting, I logged into my Microsoft account which promptly grabbed my wallpaper from my desktop and other minor settings which is nice. Did the Microsoft Store updates + Windows Updates. Upon completing the windows updates (including the Office 2013 update), the taskbar icons reverted to the generic blank logo for the office products, as they no longer were the 'preview' versions of office.. This was resolved by right clicking and selecting unpin, then repinning the items again

* Google Search (which can be found on the Win8 store) is nowhere to be seen on the RT store, alike Chrome *cries*

* By default when clicking into a text area/field the keyboard doesn't show up automatically when in desktop mode. Rather, you have to click the keyboard from the systray to bring it up. Also, the keyboard is overlayed over the screen which in some instances (eg: facebook via IE) you can't see the submit button. There is a little switching tool on the keyboard pane/panel which will put the keyboard 'under' the screen instead of overlay it directly ontop of the content.

* Wireless signal seems good. Will need to test/compare with other devices (iPad, Nexus, Galaxy S3, iPhone) when some form of wireless tool becomes available in the store

* Weight feels relatively the same as the iPad, though the surface feels much sturdier in it's construction (You feel like it could take a hit/drop)

* The magnetic grip of the keyboard to the device is strong! Think iPad's smart cover grip x2. I couldn't (easily) get the keyboard to fall off by shaking it

* Wallpapers...Unfortunately depending on your wallpaper settings (eg: mine is currently on stretch), the wallpaper will 'stretch' in horizontal mode (great), but also in vertical mode (not so great)

* Keyboard is as many of the reviews describe. Good, but a little rough to get used to. As a developer, I use a keyboard a fair bit, and found the onscreen keyboard was extremely easy/quicker for typing at first as the keys are large enough to allow for quick typing. The keyboard itself doesn't feel weird to type on, though you occasionally have to double check the position of your fingers (alike any new keyboard where some keys are shifted/moved around). Only downside is there is no F1-F12 keys on the keyboard. They've been replaced by media style keys (think of the old microsoft internet based keyboards with home, volume &amp; media controls, etc). Little painful when I'm used to using the F-Keys in development mode, but I'll survive.

* USB devices work! Tried external hard drives, USB mice (Microsoft Touch Mouse) and all seem to work nicely as expected

* Printing works nicely too! Network printer automatically detected by Win8, and was in the printers list :)

I'll be sure to post/edit some more notes on the surface if there is interest :)

I have had mine since launch, and have faithfully installed every update or patch. Despite this, I noticed that people that bought theirs much later had WAY faster machines. For example, it would literally take 30 seconds or more just to open the email app.  Everything was a chore and it took minutes to get basic tasks done.  I was a totally believer in the complete uselessness of RT, so eventually I tried to refresh it, but that was a complete nightmare. It literally spent DAYS configuring updates, and some where along the way it would give up and load a unstable mess that couldn't do anything. 

Eventually I gave up and did a complete reset which only took like 30 minutes, and OMG this thing is fast and fluid. It even finally multitask without bogging down.

It is relatively normal for computer technology companies to release updated versions of their devices after around 6 months on the market and certainly by the year mark.

So I guess my question is: is it worth buying the pro on UK release or should I wait another few months for a hardware update? I have been really really looking forward to this release but Microsoft have clearly ballsed it up.

EDIT: It seams the new Haswell processor which will be unveiled by Intel on the 3rd of June (like 3 days after release of the Surface) is going to be a significant performance boost. I think Haswell based computers will be on the market within a few months, possibly by late July. In order to remain competitive Microsoft will have to release Haswell based Surfaces relatively soon, either way, there is no point in buying a Surface over a Haswell based alternative.

My apologies up front for what's bound to be a longish post.

I'm thinking of upgrading to the Surface Pro.

I've currently got a [Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ATIV-Smart-PC-500T/dp/B0098O9TB0) with the keyboard dock and I've had it for a few months.  It's been pretty good, *fantastic* battery life, with the obvious trade-off in performance.  Not really an issue for Office, web, email, etc.  Watching video is fine, though it can struggle with 1080p (I know the 500t *isn't* 1080p, but I have a number of 1080p videos that I don't feel like converting to a lower res.)

Then there are things that make it whimper:

* SQL Server Management Studio connected to a large database (Intellisense struggles quite a bit) - this is a priority for me.
* OneNote - handwriting with the stylus sometimes has some very noticeable lag, upwards of several seconds where it has to catch up to me.  It works fine in Windows Journal, but Journal doesn't have enough features for my needs.  This is a high priority for me.
* Metro apps in general (I still call them Metro apps...) are generally sluggish no matter how basic they are.  It frustrates me to be looking at something that is clearly a pretty simple app, but it just lags a little bit all over the place.
* Games - obviously I didn't get an Atom processor-based tablet to be a gaming PC ;)  Even so I thought it would handle basic games MUCH better than it does.  Again, Metro style games are really noticeable.  Skulls of the Shogun and Microsoft Mahjong are a couple of examples that seem like they should be smooth, but are definitely not.

Honestly I think I've discovered that I'd rather have something more along the lines of an ultrabook which I mostly consider the Surface Pro to be.  I've played around with one in a Best Buy and laughed at how much more responsive the entire experience was compared to my 500t.  I love the hardware design and the Type keyboard.  Good stuff!

I'm thinking of selling my Samsung and buying a Surface Pro.  What I need to decide is what *exactly* I need to buy.

Essentials:
* Surface Pro 128GB - $999
* Type Keyboard - $129
* Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter - $10 (off-brand through Amazon)

That's about $1140 before any tax/shipping.  Ouch... help me justify it ;)

Anything else I ""need""?  What are your thoughts on Microsoft's extra warranty?  ""Microsoft Complete"" - $149 doesn't seem bad, though it makes the overall price that much harder to swallow.  

If you read this whole thing I applaud your perseverance lol.  Thanks!

**tl;dr** - Dissatisfied with my current Atom-processor Windows 8 tablet.  Thinking about upgrading to the Surface Pro.  What are all the extra costs I should consider?  Help me justify that hefty price tag!

As of finding this, I started monitoring my apps for CPU usage and have tried to find alternatives that don't use as much CPU. Example findings, albeit unscientific, are:

* OneNote RT: 1.2%-4.5% while idle, 22% during heavy inking. This easily shortened my battery life during classes by ~1 hour. By contrast, OneNote Desktop takes 0% while idle and only 15% during heavy inking. 
* IM+: A whopping 5% while idle! By contrast, Talk.to takes 0% while idle.
* /r/etro: 1.4% while idle. Snoo: 0% while idle.
* News Bento: 3% while idle. Discourse: 0% while idle.
* Internet Explorer: Wonderfully, 0% while idle and viewing basic sites! Firefox always hovered above 1% when I used it.
* MediaMonkey (and most background media apps): 1.4% while playing in background. foobar2000: 0% while playing in background (!)

You can check Metro CPU usage using Task Manager, which has an option for displaying above Metro apps. 

* To bring Task Manager up quickly: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc.
* To enable the display option: in Task Manager, click Options &gt; Always on top.

I feel as if a good percent of Metro apps would be better supplanted in regards to CPU usage by just using Internet Explorer.

I've been mulling a decision on exactly what I should replace my aging laptop with. My laptop is a early 2008 MacBook Pro, and while it's been a trooper for the 5 years it's been in service, it's beginning to *really* show its age. The battery has died, and the left I/O board is on the way out. I love it to death, but the time has come for it to be replaced.

Now, I *was* considering replacing it with another MacBook Pro, or even a MacBook Air. I'm going back to college, so I want to travel light and leave the heavy stuff to my PC back home. However, someone I follow on YouTube has gotten a Surface RT with the Type Cover and it seems to be a VERY solid productivity machine, and while I was initially skeptical of the Surface, it is growing on me.

So, why I'm here: I'm not sure if anyone on this subreddit has actually replaced their traditional laptop with a Surface RT (I know a Pro would be a more suitable replacement, but the thermal output coupled with the severely diminished battery life make the Pro a nonstarter for me), and if so, how its going for them. The only thing I'd really miss is the ability to do Android command line shenanigans with my laptop, but at this rate, I am beginning to not really care about it.

Is there anything that you guys think I'd be missing? Or would I be happy as a clam in Surface-land? Because right now, the RT is looking very compelling to me, and a good order of magnitude cheaper than what I was planning to get.

**Q: So many questions...but I guess my biggest one is why (now that its almost out) was there a 3 month gap between the surface RT and surface pro? Since it looks like you guys didn't get any super early access to haswell chips (or any other tech), I'm not sure what the reason was behind the delay.**

**A:** This is simple.  We started the Pro 3 months after we started Surface RT :-) That is exactly when we staffed the team to go and bring this product to life!

---

**Q: Why no docking station?? You're so close to full desktop replacement here!**


**A:** Hey, this is Andrew Hill, I lead the Mechanical team. The docking connection is a great question; I have been using my pre-production unit as my main machine for a while now. When I am at my desk I plug in a Mini Displayport and a USB cable and go to work. Others among us take advantage of docking station solutions that are available to drive displays over USB3. 

---

**Q: For the Surface Pro....is the boot loader unlocked? Can I do what I want with my (potential) property? Or am I locked in to Windows 8?**

**A:** Like other Windows 8 machines, you can access BIOS settings and turn off secure boot, enabling you to load other OSes.

---

**Q: Why did you allocate the storage space in the way you did? Surely you could have anticipated the bad press you're currently getting for shipping with relatively low free storage space?**

**A:** Hello from the surface team
We designed Surface Pro (and the allocation of disk space on our systems) to have the power of full Windows 8, the ability to have a simplified and fast upgrade to full Office and the confidence of a recovery image already available on your device.   Beyond the flexibility and confidence this provides, we also include an ability to extend your storage via microSDXC, USB 3.0 and SkyDrive (including 7GB of free storage).  Windows does provide tools that allow you to free space by easily removing applications you are not using as well as move the recovery image to a USB thumbdrive.   
EDIT UPDATE: We decided to ship a Pro 64GB sku as it provides full windows 8 and enough storage for a number of large application installs such as games, productivity apps etc.  which usually run in the multiple GBs.  It also provides you flexibility to extend storage should you need.  If you plan to carry more personal items with you locally, our 128GB may be the better option for you.

**Q: As many reviews have pointed out, the Surface Pro has a very high resolution for a 10.6"" screen, which has made it so that it is scaled to 150% to be usable on the desktop.  Windows 8 doesn't allow you to run independent scaling between the Surface Pro and an external monitor when using an extended display option.  I want to keep scaling at 150% on the Surface Pro, and have scaling on my external display at 100%.  Are there plans to fix this in Windows 8?**

**A:** The Windows team is aggressively working on this feature to fix this for all high resolution Windows devices. We don’t have a date yet to share, so sorry. But in the meantime here are some things I do to maximize my external monitor experience..

1. I personally use 125% scaling.. and like that better for what I use Surface Pro for… see more things on the screen.. and the size of the text suits me just fine. 
2. Next I make sure my Second Screen is set to Extended mode.
3. Then I adjust my Office apps using the built in zoom control (lower right of office apps) to set the desired text size.  In Windows 8 the Desktop can be thrown on your second monitor and operate all your office apps... nice.  
4. For Outlook if I have on my second monitor I switch Outlook into mouse mode. 
5. Also in Outlook you can change your Zoom Setting in new message (compose window under zoom).. and it will also persist (which is nice). 
6. In IE desktop.. same thing.. the zoom persists on the desktop.. And I use IE 10 desktop in desktop mode.. and the touch version of IE10 on my Surface modern screen. 
7. You can also change the width of the cursor under Ease of Access. 
8. Also… not a must but, if you use a high resolution external monitor it also help a lot.

**Q: Why did Microsoft not work at improving the battery life of the Pro? Reviews put it between 4 to 5 hours of battery life, which is much lower than competitors. Surely something could have been done? Side question: Can we ever expect a 3G/4G Surface RT and/or Surface Pro?**

**A:** Awesome question.  The product was designed to take full advantage of Windows 8 coupled with the Ivy Bridge core processor from Intel.  We created a product that did not compromise speed, performance in any way.  With that, we wanted to be the best notebook/laptop product in its class, but still deliver you the tablet form factor.  This product is optimized in every way to take advantage of the full third generation core i5 it runs, yet give the best battery life.  If you compare it to say a MacBook Air, you will quickly see that pound for pound in battery size vs battery life, you will find optimizations that puts Surface best in its class.  

That said we picked a smaller battery to be sure we were able to give you the same performance and to keep it thin.  This kept the weight under 2lbs, and still kept it thin enough to take advantage of our great Windows work for inking and give you a great inking experience (like pressure sensitive inking, ability to do kanji, great sketching).  While these tradeoffs are challenges as much as they are opportunities, we think given the performance and experience you will be getting, it is an exciting product.

**Q: Is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4) technology included in the Pro?  If not, why not?**

**A:** Hey, this is StevieB, I manage the Applied Sciences Group that did this research. In some ways some of this technology did make its way into Surface and Windows 8, and in other ways the industry has a ways to go. The demo you are seeing is a research prototype we developed to understand touch and graphics latency. It is meant to ask questions such as what level of latency is perceivable to the user. The research demo does not contain a full engineering solution which is productizable yet.. for example we used a projector that can project at 30Khz.. not really something you can carry around…. However, two things that got tech-transferred into this generation of products.. The first is that we understand the impact of latency on the user experience … the lower the latency of the system, the faster you get your work done.. even 10ms makes a difference. So, one of the things we focused on in Windows 8, was touch latency.. The whole system is tuned to deliver one of the fastest touch to graphical responses… we reduced the latency of all Windows 8 touch controllers to be below 12ms, and Windows 8 optimized the input thread to be the highest priority. The result.. buttery smooth touch input that makes the graphics almost stick to your finger… (just compare Surface side by side to other tablets/phones).. I am super happy on where we have gotten with latency.. Industry leading.. and the beauty is because of research we know how much we should keep going .. Finally the second part which got tech transferred was digitizer tech used in the research demo in that video.. the superfast pressure sensitive digitizer made its way into touchcover, the superfast keys (1khz) on touchcover is how we can do key/tap detection and allow users to home keys without accidentally typing.  It is an exciting technology platform here... 

---

**Q: Have you performance tested for graphical and engineering type applications? If so is the hardware acceptable for software like SketchUp, AutoCAD, Photoshop, etc?**

**A:** Hey; Andrew here. First chance we had we installed our cad software on prototypes. It was meta-cool to have the 3D models of the device up on the screen of the device. I am excited to start using the device as I travel to have models to review with vendors without having to pack my monster laptop. Also; using the pen to redline drawings is cool.

---

**Q: I have a Windows 7 PC at home. I play games and watch media just like most people. Why do I need a Surface?**

**A:** If you're looking for an all-day battery and an entertainment-first experience with the ability to still get some work done – Surface RT is for you. If you want a powerful PC that gets work done with the flexibility of a tablet, then Surface Pro is your device.

---

**Q: Does Microsoft have any plans for an external battery or for a thicker keyboard cover that has an extra battery?  ~~Or, if I want an external battery brick, is there a third party one I can buy that can be used with the surface.~~**

**A:** That would require extending the design of the accessory spine to include some way to transfer higher current between the peripheral and the main battery.  Which we did...

---

**Q: Can I bundle a type cover instead of a touch? I like black, but I'm sure people want more colors, are those coming? What will pricing be like in the UK and any word on a release date?**

**A:** We will sell Surface Pro without a cover to allow customers to select the color or style cover of their choice.  We are releasing a set of Limited Edition touch covers starting in February and will continue to evolve Limited Editions to give customers more choices and options for colors across our colors in the future. 

Pricing and release information for Surface Pro in the UK will be coming soon. 

---

**Q: What additional pressure can MS put on partners like Twitter, Flixster, and others to create more robust Win 8 apps?  I would love to see more partners take the approach of Major League Soccer, who have built a very functional app that is also a thing of beauty to use on the Surface and on desktops. Also how soon can we expect fixes for some of the wifi issues with the RT version, as well as continued issues with xbox music?**

**A:** At Windows 8 launch we talked about the Store as a ""grand opening"" because even though we felt great about the day 1 app selection we knew we were just getting started.  In the last 2 months we have seen over 100M app downloads and since GA we have seen the selection grow by 4 times over.  I think we added 10K apps in the last month.  Those are all big numbers but don't exactly address your question about what we are doing with the top ecosystem partners to make high quality, in depth apps.  Our relationships with each of these partners is unique and in some cases we are supplying test hardware, engineering support or other kinds of support to help.

---

**Q: What are the new connectors on the bottom of the Surface Pro for?**

**A:** Wow - I'm pumped you caught that - we haven't announced what they are for but they aren't an accident!  At launch we talked about the ""accessory spine"" and hinted at future peripherals that can click in and do more.  Those connectors look like can carry more current than the pogo pins, don't they?

---

**Q: Can you explain the branding choice to use ""RT"" and ""Pro"". I am a Web Designer, and none of the people I work with understood that there was another version of Surface coming when RT first came out. Most people are not going to understand from the marketing campaign that there are 2 models with such vastly different capabilities.**

**A:** Thanks for asking this - Windows 8 introduced a lot of change from the UX to the app model to the store.  Of course that all started with an expansion of the platforms we run on to include ARM.  When we designed the new Windows runtime (WinRT) we designed it to be cross platform so new Windows 8 apps could run on both X86 and ARM platforms.  Windows RT is what we called the version of Windows that runs on ARM because it is compatible with WinRT apps.  You're asking a more general question and we haven't faced having to explain a range of platforms since the introduction of Windows NT and will keep investing in driving clarity.

---

**Q: why the decision to go with the displayport output instead of full hdmi? How will you continue to convince developers to create Windows Store applications of their existing x86 software while still selling this product? what is the incentive, for example, of spotify to design a Windows Store application when their existing software will technically work on this hardware? Their x86 application works well for traditional types of computing (mouse/keyboard), how do you get them to embrace new forms of input (this is basically saying: I don't want to use mouse/keyboard applications on tablets, how do you incentivize them to use a tablet optimized UI)?**

**A:** Hi, this is Ed from the hardware development team. Displayport on Pro can drive an external monitor with resolutions up to 2560x1600p. We wanted to give the most flexibility with monitors available today, and generally speaking most HDMI monitors are limited to 1080p.

---

**Q: What's the coolest thing you've seen the Surface used for? What is the coolest thing you can imagine the Surface being used for in the near future?**

**A:** Hey this is StevieB.. Surface Pro is a unique tablet.. in that it offers 4 modes of input in a compact form factor. It has touch, because of Touch/Typecover you have a mouse and keyboard which is built in to your screen cover, and now you have a digital Pen. So the combination is unique in that you have something the size of a tablet but the power and productivity of a laptop. I see people around here use Surface Pro as their main machine.. switching from reading an ebook in their hands, running Outlook, and flipping it to the desk and running a full version of PhotoShop. I just loaded photoshop the other day.. and boy it loaded fast.. faster than my desktop. I was like ya baby .. so Surface Pro has the power when you need, but throttles down heavily when you don’t need it so that you can carry it around.. pound for pound it is the fastest most portable device out there.. 

---

**Q: I'm seriously considering buying a Surface Pro to use as a more portable laptop, but the high price puts me off. Can you justify the price relative to all of your competitors' tablets (Asus, Apple, Samsung, etc)?**

**A:** Surface Pro is perfect for the person that wants a MacBook Air and an iPad, but doesn’t want the weight or hassle of both devices. We didn’t skimp on the performance you need to run a business but gave it to you in a very portable package.

A few days in, realizing that even the most mainstream apps are unavailable is pretty discouraging [facebook, twitter, most banking apps, google search, google chrome, songza, etc].  I still have a week to take this back, and am seriously thinking about it.

I'm hardpressed to believe that a year from now, developers will be building apps for: iOS, Android, Win8, AND Win8 RT.

I bought it for sketching while on my commute to work daily and its really not too bad.

Anyone will tell you, however that using the type cover while on a train or bus or anywhere except on a desk can be... difficult. This is where I run into a few issues as well, using photoshop or Sketchbook is pretty hard to do without a keyboard or alternative.

So I started looking into things and found this pretty cool little thing called ArtDock.

http://konartist3d.deviantart.com/art/ArtDock-283342420

Basically its a touch overly for your tablet that lets you control various art style programs but there's a bit of an issue with it on the surface pro.

The buttons, for some reason, don't align to my touches properly, like the detection for them is smaller than the actual images. I realize that ArtDock was designed for older tablets with smaller resolutions and I figured that this was the problem until I came across a version of it claiming it was optimized for surface pro. 

http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/microsoft/55516-new-artdock-surface-pro.html

I get the same problem with this one.

So, has anyone had any success using ArtDock that might be able to shed some light on why it may not be working correctly or has anyone found a viable alternative to this at all?",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1hhlgn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1hhlgn/artdock_for_windows_surface_pro/,

On April 26, I placed an order for a Surface Pro, Complete, Touch Cover and extra Power Adapter. I go to pay via PayPal and the website says it's unable to complete the transaction. I try my credit card instead, same message. I decide to call the store and place the order over the phone.

Customer service rep goes to place the order, but orders an RT by accident. Tries again but forgets the Touch Cover and Power Adapter. No problem, he tells me, I'll cancel the orders. He finally places the right order. 

I then start receiving shipping confirmation emails so I call Microsoft to confirm that the first two orders have indeed been cancelled. I'm told that the orders have indeed been cancelled and that the system automatically generates those emails but that *nothing* has shipped.

Lo and behold a box from Microsoft arrives at my door containing a Surface RT. Next day, the Surface Pro. I call Microsoft and they start to process the return for the RT and Pro. I receive the label for the Pro the next day but not for the RT. It takes three more phone calls and an escalation before I get a UPS shipping label (2 weeks later).

Fast forward to May 15. I order another three Pros for work. The website again says there are technical difficulties so again I call. The agent tells me that the store is undergoing maintenance and that he can't process my order. He takes my information down anyway and tells me that he'll call me when he is able to place the order. He never calls back.

I call back the next day. The person I speak with tells me that the order was never placed and that he can help me place the order. He also tells me that he'll be placing three separate orders (because each Surface has a Complete warranty and thus needs to have its own order number).  He takes all of my information down and puts me on hold. A few minutes later he comes back and he tells me that the first order has been placed. He then tells me that he has to put me on hold so that he can process the next order.

**I wait on hold for 45 minutes.**

I finally give up and call back. I get another agent this time and explain the situation. She gets my information and checks my order history. She confirms that nothing has been ordered. I call my credit card company to double check. They tell me that there's an approval from the Microsoft Store but won't know if anything has been charged until it posts (about 5 days), at which time I can initiate a chargeback.

So I go to Best Buy and purchase all my Surface hardware today. When I get home, what's waiting for me but a parcel from Microsoft. Yes, they shipped the order. Yes, it arrived today. Yes, I have to initiate another return.

This has been the most frustrating and infuriating experience I've ever had trying to order anything. I'm so angry right now I had to rant.

Google still supports [oAuth for access to their API](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/oauth/de5tlzkwx5E). That includes both calendar and contacts.

oAuth is how Android apps and Chrome add-ons access Google Accounts. For an example, Checker Plus, the calendar add-on for Chrome, uses oAuth.

If Microsoft can update the People app to use oAuth and AtomPub instead of EAS, Google users can sync their contacts and calendar.

Windows 8 already supports oAuth:

http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Web-Authentication-d0485122

[oAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is an open standard which can be used by Microsoft for free.

Here's an example of how to use it:

oAuth is used by both Google and Yahoo. Here is [a demonstration](http://www.w3lessons.com/2011/10/introduction-to-website-login-with.html).

Let me explain. 

If I store all my stuff on the external hd, then what is the point of having a desktop? Besides having the ability to download from the pro directly. If my main reason for getting the pro was for being able to have movies and such for the desktop, wouldn't the Rt work just as well if I downloaded things onto my external from another device, then ran it through an app, instead of the desktop?

Maybe I'm completely off, because I really don't want to spend a grand, then more money for an external hd, and other accessories.

I ask this after having a bad experience with the Asus Transformer Prime, which also had a slot on the side for a Micro SD card. Unfortunately for me, the 32gb card I had in there ejected accidentally when brushed as I moved it, and it flew into the air and into the abyss. I was in a sea of people at Pax Prime last year, and logistically speaking, there was almost no way I would have found it.

For those of you that have the machine already: Does that card sit in safe? Is there a chance that it will eject accidentally, or is it beneath the bezel enough to avoid being pressed?

Usually in most reviews, when they start picking on the Surface they usually point to two things: apps and screen resolution.  But here's the thing, the Surface has 148 pixels per square inch, which yes is less than the iPad Retina (but not necessary for a positive viewing experience), but the iPad mini is 163 - pretty much visually identical.

Here's my beef. Read iPad mini reviews and Surface reviews side-by-side.  People sing praises for the iPad mini (even though competing mini tablets have better resolution), but won't get off the Surface for having the same resolution.  That's when I start feeling frustrated.  If ~150 ppi is too low for a Surface, it's too low for a mini, and I feel Surface gets unfairly reviewed.  What do you guys think?

However, being the control freak that I am, I like to know when an app has been updated - currently there is no simple way to do this other than visiting each app's Store page to see the last ""install date.""

I found a suitable work around, and until Microsoft builds a reporting/notification digest of App Store updates, this works well for me, and I wanted to share it with you.

* To begin, the process involves creating a Custom View in the Windows Event Log Viewer.

* You can access the Event Viewer by going into search and start typing ""event."" The Event Viewer should be your first option.

* In the right-column select Create Custom View.

(The following link shows a screen capture of my custom view: http://i.imgur.com/VbnqQl8.jpg)

* Under Logged: I changed the default from ""Any Time"" to the ""Last 30 Days."" (Changing to a shorter range pulls back results faster.)
Leave the Event Level checkboxes unchecked.

* Choose the By Log radio button.

* Under the Event Logs: drop-down scroll down and select System.

* Leave Event sources: blank.

* In the input for including or excluding Event IDs: enter 17,19.

* *Event ID 17 will tell you when an update has been download, and is ready for installing, but hasn't been installed.*

* *Event ID 19 will tell you when an app has been installed. I liked knowing both events. If you only care about when an app has been installed simply type in 19.*

* The rest of the drop-downs and prompts can be left at their defaults.

* Assign a name to the view and save it.

That's it! From now on if you want to find out what new updates have been installed (and often times, at least for the Surface RT, it's for Windows Defender), you can launch the Event Viewer and select your custom view!

I was just concerned whether the number of apps in the Windows Store are enough for daily use? Have you ever missed a desktop-program?

Aside from a few hiccups here and there I'm very pleased with it - until of course, I upgraded to the 8.1 preview about 2 weeks ago. Generally the UI changes are very nice, however since I upgraded my surface is having serious problems with limited connectivity on my home network.

I've tried a multiple things to address this, including:

* Upgrading the network adapter drivers
* Rolling back the network adapter drivers
* Messing with the resetlog.txt in admin powershell
* Toggling metered connections on/off

Pretty much all of these work as temporary fixes to the problem - after trying any of the above I'll usually get somewhere between 5-20 minutes before my internet craps out on me again. This is incredibly frustrating.

Now, I'm fairly certain that it's some sort of problem between my network adapter and my wireless router (Band: 2.4GHz, security mode: WPA-PSK), because I haven't run into this issue when tethering or using it at coffee shops etc. Seems to just be my home network that is the issue.

Some other annoying info to throw out:

* When the internet isn't working in the browser(s), streaming apps such as Spotify still continue to work as though everything is fine and dandy. The wifi icon also never indicates that there is limited connectivity
* The 8.1 preview seems to have removed the date-stamp on the Marvell Avastar drivers when I'm in the network adapter settings, so I can no longer tell which ones are old or new
* Unrelated to my network woes - but the freaking button on my wacom pen pops out!

I've always ignored any commercials for ""tablets"" and subsequently ignored Surface commercials. Although they are somewhat entertaining. But after reading [Gabe @ Penny Arcade's review](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/02/22/the-ms-surface-pro) of the Surface Pro, and especially it being geared towards artists, I've become consumed with researching it.

I am, however, running into many conflicting reports. Gabe loved it as a portable artist's tool, but it was basically his first impressions. I'm concerned about the longevity. I understand you can get a solid 4 hours, and that works fine for me... I'm seldom away from an outlet for over 4 hours at a time. However, can I count on the battery life staying at 4 hours? In my experience with laptops, batteries go bad after some time. My Acer laptop I keep plugged in constantly and now barely holds any charge, maybe about 20 minutes. But we can't replace the battery on the Surface. Is my 4 hours going to dwindle down into nothingness like a laptop? Excuse me if this is a dumb question, but I don't have much experience with tablets, and this Surface Pro seems to be more like a laptop than a tablet, anyways.

There are no Wacom drivers for Photoshop yet, and I'm optimistic that this will be fixed within a few months, but is that an unwarranted hope? Now I am reading about overheating downclocking, and although I am not a gamer, I do plan on doing intense graphic work, and there can be absolutely no lagging while drawing. The lines get jaggedy; I've experienced this before. I have this really old [Fujitsu Stylistic Tablet](http://www.cnet.com/laptops/fujitsu-stylistic-st5000-series/4505-3121_7-30674694.html) that is nearly a decade old, and while it did support photoshop, WITH pressure sensitivity, it was ultimately too slow. I'm sure they would have fixed this within the past 9 years, but then again, Photoshop's pressure sensitivity isn't even supported on Surface Pro right now. What's up with that, anyways? Doesn't make sense that I can do it on this XP tablet from 2004, but if I buy a brand new SP I'm out of luck.

Speaking of buying something brand-new... I am NOT the type to do that. I never get first-generation anything. I mean, look at iPods now, nobody wants those old bulky 1stgens, they're worthless. 1stgens are untested, people discover all these bugs, and then what? The company takes this information into consideration and makes a better product next year. Rinse, lather, repeat. I can't drop ~ a $thou to upgrade every couple years, this thing needs to last me for at least 5-8 years. I'm the type of girl to buy that hot new game after it's several months old, everyone's over it, and it's on sale because the third version just came out.

But I am nearly consumed with want for this Surface Pro. I illustrated a children's book a while ago, and am about to start on my new one. I work as a website/graphic designer at work 9 hours a day at the computer, and when I get home, trying to be creative on the computer again is the LAST thing I want to do, or am even capable of doing. When I illustrated my first book, doing this nearly killed me. I want to learn from that, and I need to get out and about and be creative on the go. I feel like with the Wacom technology in the Surface Pro, I can do that. No other tablet or convertible laptop has that Wacom tech I need. 

But I'm still on the fence. Mostly I think I'm afraid of dropping ~$1k on this thing that is so new. I guess I just want to know that it's worth it, that I shouldn't wait, maybe there's another artist out there who's using it like I want to... any insight would help for this apprehensive penny pincher.

**tl;dr:** *(sorry the post became much longer than I expected)* ... will the already-limited battery life stay at 4ish hours through the coming years? Are there any artists here who can give their insight into using the tablet for illustration? Will Photoshop driver support come soon? What's up with the overheating underclocking? Should this penny-pincher wait until this new product is more well-tested? I've never paid more than $800 on an electronic device, is it worth the money?

Thank you!

I have an HP TM2, and I've grown used to doing a bit of gaming on it during my lengthy commutes / traveling, but far more on using it for AutoCAD and Revit.

My AutoCAD and Revit usage has dropped substantially for several reasons, but I really like the idea of some gaming still.  For that reason, I was looking to the Razer Edge Pro.

However, my HP TM-2 is going downhill, and I'm a bit put off with the shipping times on the Razer and the lack of a stylus (though I don't like the shared magnet with power on the Surface, but thats neither here nor there).

So I want to think a bit differently.  More casual gaming on the go, between the Surface, my Nexus 4, and my 3DS.  That said, the business apps are important to me....

What I guess I'm wondering is, what is the biggest and most power hungry application you've run, and how did your Surface handle it? Any TrueView users out there loading up complex drawings for markups?

I would prefer it if I didn't have to write my own drivers to intercept this stuff, so hopefully it's available from the API.

I don't know if palm rejection is implemented at the hardware level (I sure hope not), but if it is just a software thing, then I think I could make this happen. The set up I intend to implement has palm rejection on the right 2/3rds of the screen and have the left third used for multitouch overlay buttons/modifiers (like shift,ctrl,alt depending on number of fingers in contact with the screen). 
This would ultimately allow me to use 3D modeling applications without a keyboard: something I would consider holy grail-ish. Coupled with pressure sensitivity (whenever that's figured out, well, I could probably use the low level data to emulate a wintab device, though that's assuming microsoft/wacom never develop wintab drivers... I'm not holding my breath), this would allow me to replace 3 devices with one (ipad, pc, wacom tablet).

I stumbled across a workaround that I haven't really seen posted, so I thought I would share. Apologies if this is a repost, I didn't find it in a quick search.

For a specific 32-bit program (in this case, Chrome) - you can go to the .exe file, right click &gt; Properties, and choose ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings."" Click OK, restart Chrome, and it should be running as it would normally look (i.e. without all the fuzzy text). You can then enable scaling inside the application itself. Here's an example of before/after, with steps: http://imgur.com/a/QDTFG

This works for any 32-bit application. For 64-bit apps, the process is more complicated (involves editing registry) and can be found here: http://www.kynosarges.org/WindowsDpi.html. The relevant bit is at the bottom:

&gt;&gt;64-bit Applications — For no apparent reason other than to annoy 64-bit users, Microsoft disabled the above check box for 64-bit applications, even though the option itself is perfectly functional when set directly in the registry! So you’ll have to start up Registry Editor and navigate to this key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers
Now add a string value (REG_SZ) whose name is the full path to the application executable and whose value is HIGHDPIAWARE. I recommend that you first modify a few 32-bit applications as described above, so you can see some example values in this registry key.

I hope this helps people. I was really frustrated with the scaling myself when I first got the Pro, but I find that this mitigates a lot of the irritation! ",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_18v2uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/18v2uq/howto_resolving_desktop_scaling_issues/,

December 17, 2012 Surface - Site Checks in Union County NJ – Staples and Best Buy

I wanted to see the Microsoft Surface in Staples and Best Buy. The following are my notes:

Staples Watchung NJ:

I was looking at several tablets but could not locate the Surface. I asked a sales person if they could direct me to the Microsoft Tablet. The sales person asked me which one I wanted to see. I said, “I would like to see the Tablet made by Microsoft.” The sales person responded, “Oh, there are quite a few,” as the salesperson showed me the Galaxy, and several others. I asked, “What about the tablet manufactured by Microsoft?” The salesperson responded, “Oh, we don’t have any of those.” I asked, “are you sure, would you mind checking with someone?” The sales person checked with a manager, and the manager said, “Sure, we have the Surface, it is in the back of the store at an end cap.” We journeyed past all the Desktops, laptops, cell phones, and other tablets, till we got to the back of the store and saw the Surface. Here are some pictures I took to show you the display, as well as how poorly the display (in my opinion) was put together.

In the picture above, notice how the Surface appears to be floating. There is also only a Touch Cover displayed. I asked for the Type Cover and the sales person said this is the only cover they sell. I looked at an empty box below that had written, “Type Cover $129.” The salesperson responded, “We don’t have those.” My guess is they actually do have them, and that the salesperson just did not know.

In the picture above, notice how the security device blocked the folding hinge from closing.

In the picture above, you will notice that Staples in Watchung NJ decided to put legs on the Touch Cover. These legs made using the Touch Cover impossible. The Touch Cover is light weight, and having it on 4 legs made it feel flimsy, and really was not a pleasurable user experience. As I touched one of the legs, the store alarms started to ring loudly. 

Above are two more pictures of the touch cover displayed unattached to the device.

I asked to speak with the store manager. The store manager and another manager spoke with me about the Surface. I asked, “When is the next Surface coming out?” “There hasn’t been one announced yet. Would you like to buy this product?” I responded, “I was going to wait for the Surface Pro.” Both responded, “What is that?” I mentioned it was another tablet which would have full Windows 8.” Both responded that they don’t think such a machine has been announced. I explained it has been announced, and perhaps they should read up on it.

I showed the store manager how the security device on the tablet itself was not giving the user the ability to fold the hinge, and experience the tablet as it is meant to be with the hinge closed. At this point the store manager seemed agitated, and really didn’t want to talk further about this.

I told the manager I was surprised the display was tucked in the back of the store, and that the salesperson I first encountered did not even know the product was in the store or that it existed. The salesperson was knowledgeable of the other tablets. I didn’t mention to the store manager that the device wasn’t able to connect to the internet.

I showed the store manager how the user experience was awful. The store manager mentioned, “We have to make sure there is security devices on these.” I mentioned I understood, but couldn’t they be put in a different part of the tablet, whereas the user experience wasn’t painful. The response was, “No sir, this is the way Staples is displaying the product in all of their stores.” I mentioned, “This is like a butcher selling fine prime steaks, and the ones in display were old, smelly, discolored with worms crawling around the meat.” 

I mentioned to the manager that I would be shocked if the other Staples stores displayed this all the same way. The store manager mentioned that is the case. I asked, “Would you perhaps say something to upper management. To me, it seems as though Microsoft has an image problem, and this type of display would possibly enforce this negative thinking.” The salesperson responded, “Sir, a lot of thought and decisions go into store placement and security devices. There is no reason to mention this display to anyone else. I’m sorry you don’t like it.”

With that I left the store and traveled East ward to my next Staples Store.


Staples Springfield NJ

I walked into the Springfield NJ store. As soon as you walk in, there is a prominently displayed Surface with both the Touch Cover and Type Cover available for testing. The security devices were present on all equipment, but the placement of the device was much better, and gave the user the ability to take the keyboard off of the tablet, close the hinge, and use the machine.

The picture above was from the Staples Springfield NJ store. Clean display, well positioned for all customers entering the store to see, as well as the ability to give the potential Surface owner the full Surface experience.

I spoke with a salesperson. The salesperson mentioned that the user experience is very impressive, and that the tablet is real nice. The salesperson offered, “I think when the Surface Pro is released, these will go flying off the shelves.” I spoke with several Staples workers at the Springfield store, all seemed knowledgeable of the Surface and the forthcoming Surface Pro.

Obviously all Staples stores are not displaying the Surface in the same end cap at the back of the store as is Watchung NJ Staples, nor does the other store put on legs to prevent shoplifters as well as any possibility of a positive user experience.

Best Buy Union NJ

As soon as you walk in the doors, walk towards Mobile, and you will see a large Surface display. The person I spoke with was quite knowledgeable on the Surface, and this person also mentioned, “I am getting a Surface Pro when it comes out next month.” 

The one issue at Best Buy Union was that the Touch Cover had a security device on the bottom of the pad.

The user experience wasn’t awful, but certainly having the security device on the bottom left would make the experience much better. I asked to see the store manager. The store manager came over and we talked. The manager mentioned, “We need to change this display. You are correct, the experience is hindered by the security device placement. Also, I agree with you, and we should also display the Type Cover. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, and honestly, this was quite helpful.”

I will post more, when and if, I have Surface experiences to share. ",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_151z1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/151z1s/surface_site_visit_union_county_nj/,

Screen protectors: Im completely lost here. I'm looking for something that wont be too much of a burden to interact with(IE, make the screen too dim, affect stylus performance, bubbles)
Any other accessories besides keyboard and pen that other users have found useful

Considering the possible wait time for surface pro 2 and the design limitations of surface (no keyboard hinge support etc.) I was wondering if anyone knows of a similar device?

-Basically the things I like/want from the pro are: the touch screen digitizer, the tablet form factor for digitizer use, and fast processor.
-Whereas the things that tempt me to another more traditional laptop device are: keyboard hinge structure+base centre of gravity and a nice big trackpad like the MacBook ones.

I was thinking maybe one of those laptops where the screen flips and you can fold it down to create a tablet form factor (transformer laptop?)

The sales guys in stores know so incredibly little about it it's just embarrassing to talk about it.
What I need is:

* A new drawing tablet for my PC

* Device to watch stuff on a boring commute.

* A device to hook up to the exchange server at my new job.


I realize that my needs might be very specific, that is why I am asking here, where the pros are at, where i can probably get some good answers.

For my drawing tablet, I would like to buy a [cintiq](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Qz8f-3HQN4U#t=194s), but all of them are very expensive, will probably get one anyway when I'm old and rich, but now I'm straight out of school and on to my first job. The thing about the cintiq though is that its basically a screen and a tablet. It is connected to a computer that runs all the software, hence, there are no blocks in between software and cintiq.

What I am wondering about the MS surface, is; Is it possible to connect it to a PC and use it in this, have windows 7 accept the ms surface as purely a tablet input device and screen?

This would be the absolutely most smashing solution of them all, and considering that the cintiq exists and the ms surface exists it would most certainly be possible. The question is more likely: is there any software that allows this? Or maybe, is it possible to just hook it up and use it?

[This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSLO95BrStw) shows almost what I want, but his video is very uninformative and he does not seem to answer the most important question in the comment section. But what I want is basically his setup, but I want to control it from the surface, and I need it to keep pressure sensitivity and be responsive as shit.

I am asking about the RT because it's cheaper and I really want it to work. I have tried it, and the pro out in a store and the responsiveness and pressure sensitivity just blows my mind, it is so good i can actually see myself getting paintings and textures from start to finish on it, which says a lot, until now it is only wacom tablets that have felt this good, and I have tried an array of tablets and tablet computers.

So, is there anyone with an RT that knows their way around this and can check for me? Your knowledge and help would be very appreciated and im sure you would help a lot of artists around the world.

I mean, the other two points on my checklist are no-brainers that can be done on an RT, right? I would think so.

Sorry for being long, and thank you for your time. Have a good one.

Also, tiny last question: Is sketchbook pro available for the RT with pressure sensitivity yet?


**EDIT:** I have been informed that the RT does not have pressure sensitivity, therefore, I am now wondering about the pro instead. Is it possible to use it as a tablet for a PC?

**EDIT 2:**Realizing that this does not exist, at least in a good way.

There might be workaround or hacks but from my experience that rrarely works out well.

If you support my cause you can vote for [my question](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-tms/remote-desktop-pressure-sensitivity/60c2a334-e672-43ef-9994-933a6528c5b8) in the microsoft support forum.

There is very little information about this particular B revision except for demo board schematics but the RTL8152 with no suffix is a 10/100 USB2 device.

So I'm curious to hear what other's experiences have been, and what I should grab for those long commutes!

I don't have a touch/type cover, and don't want to carry a keyboard/mouse.

**Tested thus far:**

Banner Saga - works, playable. Hurray!

Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes - ~~doesn't register right click from the pen~~ registers right click when you right click and drag, takes multiple taps to register left click. &gt;.&lt; (does anyone else have this problem?) but there's no menu button in the UI, and the touch keyboard has no ESC key, so you can't use important menu items.

FTL - unable to pause (because it's just space bar), but otherwise playable.

Planescape: Torment - unable to save, because it doesn't run windowed and the save screen requires text input.

**Things I have installed, but haven't tried yet:**

Frozen Synapse

Fallout 2

**TL;DR**

Tell us about the games you like to play on your Surface Pro, using only touch or the stylus - because I'm having trouble finding some, and maybe this will be useful for others too.

The Helix has a larger screen (11.6"") and the potential for more battery life with its 'real' laptop keyboard, however it's more expensive ($1500+tax for similar configuration to the 128gb Pro).

I understand many people would like to have the ability to run desktop apps.

But why Surface Pro? Sure, it has the same great design and finish as Surface RT. But it is heavier, thicker, has a worse battery life and will get hotter as it runs a Core i5 processor. I don't see how it can be compared with tablets like Surface RT, iPad, Google Nexus 10 etc. It's basically a netbook with a touchscreen. The added weight, thickness and heat will make it almost unusable in the tablet mode.

On the other hand, Windows 8 x86 hybrids with Intel Clover trail processors will be as light and thin as the iPad and Surface RT, will have similar battery life, and won't produce noise and heat. They seem to make much more sense as a tablet/laptop hybrid device.

Cisco Anyconnect VPN software appears to have serious issues with Surface Pro - to the tune of not being able to boot up after installation.

Steps to recreate:
1.Install Cisco AnyConnect
2.Reboot

Upon restart, you get the Surface ""Diagnosing your PC"" screen.

Followed by the dreaded ""Automatic Repair"" screen.Using a known good version for Windows 8.

I get a dump after reboot and Windows 8 Pro on Surface Pro has to perform a system recovery. 

I downloaded the Windows 8 SDK and did a dumpchk.exe:


BugCheck 7E, {ffffffffc0000005, fffff88003648a23, fffff880031fb1a8, fffff880031fa9e0}

This is an unhandled system thread exception. Dumpchk says the reason is the Cisco filter driver:

Probably caused by : acnamfd.sys ( acnamfd+8a23 )
ACNAMFD.SYS is the following:
Product: Cisco AnyConnect Network Access Manager

Working with Microsoft Support, and providing this info on my own, after an hour or so I was told that this is due to a limitation of Surface Pro hardware! Installed all of the latest firmware and drivers. Doesn't work.

And it works really well and everything (I mean, the Pro is seriously powerful), but I still have some complaints and wanted to know what other users thought about it.

So, first off, if you haven't gotten the new Wacom drivers, do so. They're amazing.

My biggest complaint so far is simply the fact that Photoshop just isn't designed to be used on a tablet. It relies on either very small buttons, or keyboard shortcuts. And that's fine - I wouldn't expect anything different - but it would be extremely nice to be able to control things with gestures from the pen/touch. Has anyone had any sort of solution to this?

Secondly, I often get some strange graphical glitches/leftover artifacts when using Photoshop for an extended period of time. Not sure what it's about, but it doesn't affect things too badly.

Finally, and this is probably something that can't be helped, the Surface Pro stylus just isn't perfectly accurate. It does an incredible job when I'm in the middle of the screen, drawing naturally, but if I try to poke at little buttons (especially in the corner of the device), it quickly loses accuracy. I've tried calibrating my stylus with 200 points, which certainly helped, but it's still not as perfect as I'd like for it to be.

Overall, it's amazing having Photoshop on the go. There are just a few hurdles to cross before it's my preferred method.",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,False,,,True,t3_1e3hix,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1e3hix/photoshop_surface_pro_users_whats_your_experience/,

Workstation usage:

* Aptana/Eclipse (Web programming)
* MySQL GUI Tools

I figure a  i5 or i7 Workstation (small form factor) will run me about $650 (self built), and an Android tablet would run $400-$600.

Would the Surface PRO be able to handle what I throw at it using a USB 3.0 docking station to support 2-3 external monitors and do my workstation work?  I realize 3D and Video Editing might be a little slow, but those are low priority.

I stored some files on it and was using it to backup my data. 


Card worked for a few weeks and then died and I lost all the files I put on it. Now a computer won't detect the card and if I put it in a card reader the card appears as only 31 MBs with a RAW filesystem. 


From looking online (and even reddit) this is not an isolated incident (search google for ""sd card appears as 31 MBs"" &amp; the sandisk forums (http://forums.sandisk.com/t5/Mobile-memory-professional-cards/bd-p/all-cards-readers) are full of threads with other people that have had this problem with their cards and there is nothing you can do but send the card in for replacement).


So just a reminder so you don't make my mistake: BACKUP EVERYTHING! SD Card / External Drives / SSD",,False,self,t5_2u5h1,1362660242.0,,,True,t3_19ual9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/19ual9/tip_backup_your_sandisk_microsd_cards/,
