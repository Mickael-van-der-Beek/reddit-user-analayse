First off let me take a second to thank everyone who is making this subreddit a success. To those who research, price, or post, we hope you are enjoying participating as much as we enjoy having you. Everyone give yourselves a pat on the back... I'll wait.

Patting done? Alright, now to get down to business. I would like to solicit to those in the crowd who may possess a specific expertise in areas pertinent to our goal of appraising reddit. This may include, but is not limited to, Historians, Handwriting or Signature Experts, Sports Memorabilia Fanatics, Anthropologists, and of course, pawn shop owners.

In return for your sustained contribution and wealth of information, you will be given what we all crave, recognition baby. That's right, your very own user flair stating your given expertise. With that, your comments carry a certain clout that tells other users that your opinion on price/value is just as good (if not better) than a link to ebay or other similar sites. This will come in particularly handy when there isn't a direct source for price available. It also states that your comments carry their own weight, and should not require a source unless directly challenged, or otherwise necessary.

So, if this might be something that interests you then send a message to the mods stating your expertise. We will ask you a couple verifying questions to weed out any trolls, and then apply whatever title you wish to carry. To give you an idea what that looks like, take a glance at my user name.

Again, thank you all for this subreddit's resounding success, and happy hunting!",,False,,t5_2sslp,True,,,True,t3_k0nrq,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/k0nrq/attention_wtw_a_message_from_the_mods/,moderator

It is silver with a gold band.

So a little backstory that i know of for it:

My great-grandparents were missionaries that went to China in the early 1900s, i don't know the exact time frame. During this time they befriended a woman who would later become Chaing Kai Shek's wife. They attended the wedding( we still have the invitation as well). My great-grandparents became good friends with Shek after that. Neat little tidbit is that my grandfather( born 1921) when born played in the palace nursery.

Now after being friends with Shek for a few years and leaving( lat 1920s early 1930s) they were given a ring in parting and friendship.


That is the story, and only information i know for the ring. If anyone can give me info on what it means, if the face is a symbol, who made it, if what i have been told is completely wrong and it is something else all together.

I'm just looking for some more information on it, it would be nice to know the worth but I have no intention of selling it.

As an antique collector and thrift shop connoisseur I really love having the knowledge the members here have available to me. So I would first like to give a BIG thanks to all of the great members.

My issue is that I have started to notice A LOT of lazy posting... I am starting to see 10-20 items posted by the same users, at the same time, for items that this subreddit is not needed for.

90% of the items posted recently are things that the value could be obtained from using any of the sidebar resources, in a matter of minutes.

It seems some users aren't even attempting to search on the item themselves, they are just posting here immediately. 

I don't want to single someone out, and I won't post usernames or anything, but [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/1i1jkh/statehood_quarters_collection_2_vol_us_pd_mint/) is an example... and there are plenty more like that.

Is there anyway we could add something when submitting a link that asks people to at least attempt to locate the value themselves using sidebar resources.

I really like this subreddit, but I was under the impression it was for items that are hard to check the value of yourself due to rarity, obscurity, etc.

I value the communities opinion over my own, so if the majority here don't agree I understand completely... I just feel we are getting bombarded with lazy posts of entire collections, without the user doing ANY research themselves. It is diluting the sub-reddit in my opinion.

My mother worked for the Salk Institute for over 25 years, and was friends with Jonas Salk. This was a gift to her from Jonas. I've always been curious about its worth, and found this sub. :D

Because I assume this affects its value: I could easily prove to a hypothetical buyer that my mother worked there, knew Jonas well, etc., but I can't prove that it was a gift from him.

Dying to know if this is actually worth anything (I've got a shit ton of student loan debt!) or if I should hold on to it as a family heirloom.

Shout out to my wife for taking the photos!

Edit: Thanks everyone for the comments and info. Sounds like I'll be holding on to this one for the story since it doesn't seem like it has much value.

 American living in Japan here. My son was helping a friend clean out a house. The owners did what in Japan is called ""Night Fleeing"" which is disappearing in the night often fleeing from debt or family problems. The house was being cleaned out by the owner of the land. 

 They came across this wakizashi (a short sword longer than 30cm and shorter than 60cm) that looks like it has been used before. The blade shows signs of use and is very sharp. There has been damage to the hilt which looks to have been poorly glued back together. The hilt looks to be leather gilded with ???.

 I don't want to take off the hilt to see if the blade has any stamps because the pin looks to be hand made. There are no stamps visible on blade or hilt.

 Because everyone was scared of keeping it my son brought it home. The sword is made of iron so we may have to turn it into the police for ""torokucho"" police authorization.

 What's it worth??

**UPDATE 1:** So I contacted a guy who works with antiques and he explained that having a sword without papers in Japan is very serious. I have to take it to the police right away. 

 The police will issue a temp permit and set up an appointment to get the real permit. That guy will take the sword apart and decide if it is historical enough not to destroy. If deemed worthy I get a permit for about $60.00. If not, they break it in two. (@.@) 

 The antiques guy says he will buy even the pieces so I am hopeful. Will keep everyone updated.

**UPDATE 2:** Sorry this took so long, but the update is a cliffhanger and I was waiting for some real news before updating.. The mover that employed my son heard that we were planning on taking it to the police to get checked and offered my son 6000 yen (70 dollars) for the sword. Since he is the father of my son's friend and possible future income my son didn't put up much of a fight. 

  We don't know if he took it to the police or not. Speculation between my wife and I think that he was covering his own butt for allowing a minor to take home an illeagal weapon.

To say he was my grandfather is a lie, he wasnt actually related to me in any way. He was the widower who lived next door but if you forget the technical side he was my grandfather in every way besides. I knew him better than my real grandparents. He passed away back in January and were just now looking through everything.

He was an extremely organized man and alot of his stuff is in pristine condition. These are only a few things. Other than this he has a coin collection of over 10,000 coins and an armory of about 40 ancient guns, some being from as far back as WW1.

TLDR: is any of this worth anything? I'll probably post more pictures later. Thanks ahead of time for any help you can give me.

Edit:Thank you very much for your support! I will try to post more pictures in the morning of the guns and the coins.

The blade itself isn't very sharp, but the hilt is firm and very solid. The sheath is made of wood, with markings carved all over it, capped in what I think is brass. 

*Edit- if anyone would like any more specific pictures, let me know.

I'll be direct, I've owned this Japanese tea set for over ten years. When it was given to me, I was told it was to commemorate some big event going on with Sony Japan back in I think the 50's. I want to sell it and hopefully have any funds from it be my nest egg for the future.

Now to sell it to a collector or someone who really wants it I need to know more. All I know is that the boy on it is the old mascot, Sony Boy.  He was used to create a better connection with buyers in the west and that he ended up being popular (had toys, appeared in nearly all manuals and so forth.)

So maybe someone can fill me in with relevant information?   Seriously any history or relevant facts would be greatly appreciated.

Use this guide to save yourself some time.

## Toys / Games / Video Games:

Is it still in the original packaging and in good condition? Check eBay, it'll probably sell relatively well (like $50-$70, depending). You should also check http://videogames.pricecharting.com/ (thanks Agarest!)

Otherwise, it's not worth much at all. There were tons of video games/star wars toys/your favorite toy produced and everyone has one.

## Collectible Cards, Baseball Cards, Magic Cards, etc.:

Do you have something that's particularly old, rare, and in good condition? If so, check an online price guide, but don't expect more than $10-$30: http://prices.sportslizard.com http://www.beckett.com

Otherwise, it's not worth much at all. Collectible cards were mass produced and designed to be collected, many people have them

## Coins:

If you have an exceptionally old coin, in very good condition, I recommend checking an online price guide like: http://www.pcgs.com/prices/ or just search Google for the name of your coin ""US Silver Dollar 1899""

If you coin is made out of a pure metal (gold, silver): Then it's probably worth it's weight in that material, and not much more.

Otherwise, you probably just have a random coin that's not worth much at all (probably pretty close to its face value).

## Autographs / Signed object:

To start, is the person famous? (As in, a random person walking down the street would recognize them.) If so then it's likely that the autograph will sell well - assuming that it's not automatically generated (by using an Autopen, or similar). You might be able to check eBay but there may not be enough signatures to say one way or another. Perhaps a couple hundred dollars, depending upon the person.

If that famous person isn't dead yet, wait - and the signature will be worth that much more.

Now, there are tons of autographs that *could* be worth money, but only to the right buyer (for example: a real astronaut autograph, a sports star, a sci-fi actor, a pro video game player, video game developers, etc.). It would require a lot of legwork to determine if this is actually worth something - and, really, in the end it probably won't be worth that much (say, $30-$50, and only in optimal conditions).

## Everything else:

Search eBay for **completed** auctions of your object. This will allow you to see exactly what people are willing to pay for something. If nothing comes up then you most likely have something interesting on your hands and you should post it to /r/whatsthisworth!

Remember: Just because someone is selling an object for a price doesn't mean it's actually worth that price. Auctions are the best way to determine the true value of an object.",,False,,t5_2sslp,True,,,True,t3_kc3w0,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/kc3w0/whats_this_worth_quick_guide/,

My research has brought back very little solid information. 

Here's an Imgur album with a few pics. As you can see, it's *not* in mint condition. http://imgur.com/a/0yDLx

This eBay listing had a starting bid of $99 and no bids
http://r.ebay.com/1mQZfD

But I also found a short post quoting a Violin ID and price guide stating this:
&gt;Roy Ehrhardt in volume 1 of his Violin Identification and Price Guide lists 6 different models of violins by Josef Metzner that were sold in 1925 for $75.00 to $250.00 - a rather high price for a commercial violin at that time, indicating that they were at least partially hand-made and considered artist quality. In 1978, Ehrhardt estimated their value to be from **$1,200 to $2,500**. Today, 20 years later, in very good condition, their value should be at least twice that ammount.   

Lastly, I found another eBay listing for a **1907** Josef Metzner looking for $1,393.93, but it is in better condition than mine and a bit older. http://r.ebay.com/nD6M7O

This has a great future!

Now a little back story - I was born in Ukraine and now live in London and study in Norwich. I go back every summer and each time my grandparents find something new; be it medals, rusted rifles, ammo, shells. My house was used by first the Germans and then the Russians during WW2 and possibly WW1 because we have a huge underground cellar and what was then the most opulent house in the area next to a river. My granddad still tells stories of when he was given chocolate bars by the German soldiers and when the Russians killed them and stayed, how he got his hands on one of their rifles while they were all sleeping and scared the crap out of everyone and broke a floorboard by firing it by accident. So in short, tons of history - I stumble across something new every year. 

This year I decided to research a chaff cutter that, according to grandparents, has been in the family for as long as they can remember. I was intrigued because it had the name ""Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth"" cast on it. I did a bit of googling and to my surprise found that it used to be an English steam engine company based in Lincolnshire. [Short history here](http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Clayton_and_Shuttleworth) - Formed in 1842 at the peak of the industrial revolution! 
My grandparents were going to scrap it, but must be worth more than its weight in iron. How the heck did it get all the way to Ukraine? I'm guessing it must've been before the World Wars, before the trade restrictions.  It has to be worth something to a museum or a collector?

If anyone could provide more information I would be grateful. The markings on it are:

http://imgur.com/p7wAr

I've been able to discern (with the help of Google translate) that this is a bond for $5 Polish dollars, or ""44,57"" somethings of gold. I know gold is measured in grams or ounces or troy ounces, but I don't have a clue what they would have used.

This was in a box filled with all kinds of documents, most of them sentimental (and a few of historical significance). But we found some that seem to be of some value, which likely belonged to her father, including this bond, a life insurance policy that nobody knew about, and shares in a bank which still exists.

If this bond isn't worth anything (or much at all) we'll just keep it for sentimental reasons. But if it has any significant value it would be nice for my grandmother to get some of her father's money. I think she'd like that - a belated gift from him. It wouldn't surprise me if this wouldn't be honored today given the time passed, but it'd be interesting if nothing else to know what it's value might have been in present terms.

2oz.  Inscribed on it is the following:
3x world champion Jonny Tapia  46-0
Mi vida Loca.  Three world Titles.  25 K-Os.
WBO  IBF  WBA

on the inside it says 10k Robert Gutierrez. 
I guess Gutierrez is who made the ring.

The gold boxing gloves are on an 18"" gold chain.  

 I'm not into boxing at all so I have no idea if these items have any special value because they supposedly belonged to Jonny Tapia.  Any thoughts?

She's been lusting after it for weeks and the other day she asked me to call the consignment shop to ask if it was sold yet. It wasn't so I bought it over the phone. I told her someone bought it and I'm going to surprise her on VDay. Anyway. It appears to be porcelain top with wood legs and a silverware drawer. Also it came with 4 chairs. 

My plan is to sand down the base and repaint the legs and stain the chairs , but before I do that I want to know if this is some priceless artifact that my shoddy craftsmanship will ruin. I'm pretty sure it has been painted in the past but I think it would look great with a fresh coat.

This is not that. About a year ago there was a wind storm and a tree knocked down a power line, and when the cord struck the ground it still had current, and created a fulgurite network. My mom by chance found out what had happened and decided to excavate a whole bunch of it, i think basically the entire network of fulgurite.

**tl;dr:**  A live power line hit the ground and now we have boxes and boxes full of fulgurite

So, it is neither created by lighting, nor in any fancy soil, just the generic asphalt/gravel/dirt that you find on the edge of a road.

Alot of it is really neat and beautiful, but there is just too much of it, and i have no clue if it is worth anything, our local geologist thought it was awesome but couldn't advise on worth or where to sell.

Do any of you guys have ideas on what this might be worth, or where i could find out about its worth and where to sell?

I've already tried Google and websites specializing in books (such as abebooks.com) but am having a hard time placing a value on these books.  

Here is what I have been able to find so far:

North American Arithmetic, Part Third
by Frederick Emerson
1854
New Edition, Enlarged

[Book 2](http://imgur.com/DOExc) Murphy's Lucian, printed in Dublin, 1831. Loose front cover.

[Book 3](http://imgur.com/GdX1E) Gradus ad Parnassum: Novus, Synonymorum, Epithetorum, Versuum ad Phrasium Poeticarum, Thesaurus (roughly Synonyms, Epitets and Poetic Verses of Virgil's poetic treasure Parnassus of the Muses according to Google Translate), 1816.  Missing front cover.

[Book 4](http://imgur.com/MnNhJ) Taciti Historarium Libri Quinque: Cum Libro De Germania, Et Vita Agricole (roughly History of the Five Books, A Book from Germany and the Life Agricola according to Google Translate), possibly from Albania if that is what ""Albaniae"" is.  1823.

[back inside cover writing](http://imgur.com/tOKNI)

Bound in calfskin, complete with hair. It says it was printed in 1810 by P. Wogan in the Lower Ormond Quay of Dublin.  Had a neat advertisement tucked inside for Geary's Book, Stationary, Map, Chart, French Perfume, and Patent Medicine Warehouse, King's-Arms Exchange, Cork.

Dedication page in front that says it was given to Trinity College in Dublin and R College of St Patrick in Maynooth.  Preface page has a written paragraph and someone's signature that I can't make out, I'm guessing something James.  

Another page has a full written page with the date 4th of July and is signed at the bottom, can't really make out what it says.

The back inside cover may have been used as a ledger, I can't make out most of the writing, but what I can make out says ""20 pounds for 5 months [...] together 22 pounds [...] I had 42 pounds for his flock and grain. ""

The front inside cover has a piece of blue paper attached to it from Cork, printed on South-Main Street by John Daly and talking about pamphlets and different Christian writings and Thomas of Aquin (Thomas Aquinas?)

1376007301.0,12,self.whatsthisworth,1jzrvs,Pearl necklace acquired in a trade...,Skalmatic,21,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/1jzrvs/pearl_necklace_acquired_in_a_trade/,"So I had an old Chinese scooter I wanted to get rid of (worth of about $400 since it had a workable engine in it). Put it on Craigslist. Got a couple of trade offers and one or two cash, but one guy stood out. He wanted to trade me pearls.

Sure, why not. So he comes over, is satisfied with the scooter, pulls out a mini photo album and a jewelry folding case thingy. Tells me a wonderful story of how he and his wife (who was also there at the deal) went to the Philippines last year. Shows me his plane ticket stubs. Shows me pictures of him and his wife travelling in various parts of the Philippines. There's a few pictures of him and the wife standing next to an old Filipino man and two younger men in front of a shack. In front of the shack are also barrels and barrels of clams.

Man says that he bought some of the pearls that this old man found and had strung into necklaces and brought them back. I do some authenticity tests in the parking lot we were meeting at and they felt real. I felt that this was a very elaborate scam that he was pulling if he was pulling one, figured that I just wanted the scooter gone as fast as possible, and said yes, got a necklace, handed over the scoot.

Took them home and did some more tests on them, and I am 99% sure that they're real. They grit against each other and your teeth, they look scaly under a 30x, all that. I don't want to break one open.

My problem is that there are essentially two options: First, that I got scammed and that these are Chinese freshwater pearls, worth less than $100. Or second, that I got a too-good-to-be-true deal and they're really South Sea saltwater pearls and are very valuable. If I take it to a jeweler and have it properly appraised, and they're Chinese, the value of the pearls just covered the cost of the appraisal and I lose.

TL;DR, traded a scooter for a pearl necklace, feels real, not sure if they're good real pearls or bad real pearls.

I've taken it to several pawn shops, all of whom tell me how nice of a piece it is, but that they can't take it because it's not solid gold. One of them told me it was a designer piece.

The inscription on the back is A. C., and the logo seems to be a weird looking fleur-de-lis. I live in south Louisiana, so there's a lot of fleur-de-lis jewelry around here, and that might be why I can't narrow down who actually made this piece.

1315217574.0,13,self.whatsthisworth,k57yx,Gauguin Artwork and French Music Box,castigatio,14,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/k57yx/gauguin_artwork_and_french_music_box/,"Gauguin Menus:

My parents bought three pieces of artwork from what they say was a reputable New York art dealer around 28 years ago. The pieces purport to be menus drawn by Paul Gauguin in exchange for free meals during his time living in Tahiti. The link below shows two of the pieces - the third is at my dad's house (they got split up during a divorce - though obviously should rather be all together)

http://goober99.imgur.com/gauguin_menus

The paper on which the images are presented is raggedly cut and looks like something that I would expect to be original. That said, my parents were not very wealthy 28 years ago so the chances that a reputable art dealer sold them original Gauguin's for a reasonable price seems improbable. I'd love to hear any thoughts on what these are and what they might be worth. 


French Music Box:

My parents bought this piece at an antiques fair in Paris some 40 years ago. It plays a number of different ""songs"" depending on the positioning of various mechanical levers. The box was professionally restored a few years ago - which consisted mainly of replacing various ""teeth"" on the cylinder that had rusted or broken off. The box now plays really nicely. 

http://goober99.imgur.com/french_music_box

The restorer said that the box was quite valuable - mentioning a figure in the region of $12,000. I am skeptical of that valuation however given that a local auction house affiliated with Southeby's gave a thumb suck estimate of around $1500

I'd love to know more about it if anybody is an expert. These pieces have been in my family since I was very young and have sentimental value. 

Thank you!

EDIT: I have gotten closer to identifying the Gauguin Menus - they are titled:

ONZE MENUS: MANOU NEHENEHE (PRETTY BIRD)
ONZE MENUS: RUPE FARANI RUPE TAHITI (BEAUTIFUL FRANCE, BEAUTIFUL TAHITI)
ONZE MENUS: LE COMMISSAIRE DE POLICE

http://browse.sothebys.com/?cat=1&amp;event_id=21902&amp;g=1&amp;hp=&amp;hpc=&amp;i=1&amp;is_past=1&amp;page=2&amp;q=&amp;sale_id=N07721&amp;slabrowsesort=lot_sort_number

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Drawings_by_Paul_Gauguin

In the Southeby's auction one is valued at around $55,000 and another at between $100,000 and $150,000

My guess would be that these are originals of which the ones my parents own are prints - though who knows. I've contacted Southebys and Gauguin appraisers to try and get a better idea. I'm really curious now!

Edit 2: I have found a wikipedia page the seems to describe some context to the menus

http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onze_men%C3%BAs

I think I have it now

""The collection of menus was first exhibited in 1949 at the Orangerie Museum in Paris to mark the centenary of Gauguin exhibition. In 1950 there was a limited edition and numbered lithographs with a presentation by Robert King [5]""

So the Southebys auction pieces are likely originals and my parents bought some of the limited edition lithographs. Damn I love the internet.

**Some facts that I know about the TV:**

* From the brand: Loewe Opta (Today it's just ""Loewe"") - I also believe that it wasn't put on the market outside of Germany, Austria &amp; Swiss.

* Model: Type 33140.

* A PDF of the original manuals is dated (1962/1963), so it may be one of the first useful TVs ever produced.

* It's a console type one as you can see in the picture and therefore is connected with built-in speakers and a wooden case that protected the device for around 40 years.

* Hasn't been plugged in since 1976 until yesterday.

* The Speakers make that sound you get when turning up your volume   really high, but with the cable not completly put into the jack.

* The screen seems to work either but needs to be adjusted (only shows the black &amp; white flimmering).

* The case made out of wood is in a good condition and has fully functioning gates.

* The power plug is the same one as the ones used today (230 V in Germany).

* The retail price was 1488 DM (1DM = ~0.5€ = 0,66$), which was quite a lot after the war (very decent, new cars sold for around 5000 DM) - Do such things raise the value of my object, since nearly nobody was able to afford one back then?

I looked it up, but the only one I could find for sale was on ebay for 2500 dollars.

I'm not sure of the year it was manufactured, or how to find the model number on this deal, but I do know how it works and it's basically as so.

It is used to identify the temperature of an object, such as molten metal, bricks, etc. The temperature range is 1400-2200 (top) and 1800-3400 (bottom). in celsius, I believe.

You basically look down the tiny little hole on the eyepiece, aim it at whatever you're going to measure, and set your distance from the object in feet. You then adjust the temperature knob until the light in the bulb on the Pyrometer is equal in shade to that of what you're looking at.

This particular one was used in a company in St. Louis Missouri, And I can barely make out the sticker, but I believe it says ""Edward W. Mooney Company, St. Louis, Missouri, followed by a phone number.

I attempted to contact the manufacturer of this device, but had no luck, as it appeared their offices were closed. I was trying to verify the year of manufacturing based on the Serial number.

The case it is in has it's original leather straps, however they have been broken and new ones have been put on next to them. 

All the knobs and levers are in-tact, and the bulb still works inside. It is battery powered, and has a charging port in the side, although no charger was included with the device.

It also has these 2 metal rods in the case, one with a red end and one with a black, probably for some kind of electrical process as it probably indicates positive and negative leads.

This object is pretty obscure to my knowledge, as old analog ones have been discontinued due to digital ones having more accurate readings.

The only way I can narrow this one down is by going to the Pyro website, under optical pyrometers, and there's a few with the same temperature range. I cannot for the life of my find the model number.

If you could estimate a price range or at least help date this thing, that would be awesome. Cheers, reddit!",,False,,t5_2sslp,1364087831.0,,,True,t3_1avzpq,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisworth/comments/1avzpq/an_old_pyro_pyrometer_how_much_is_this_worth/,

Here's everything that came in the case. ([Hi-rez](http://i.imgur.com/2zOrAfh.jpg)) The camera is a [Nikon F2](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Nikon_F2) By the serial number, the camera body seems to have been made in the first batch of F2s in '71. The lens that is on the body is a Nikon Nikkor-S Auto 50mm f/1.4 and according to http://www.photosynthesis.co.nz/nikon/lenses.html it seems to be from between March of '72 and 1973.

There are 2 lenses not attached. ([hi-rez](http://i.imgur.com/UR5v77B.jpg)) One is a Super Albinon MC 28mm 1:2.8 Lens. To be honest I can't find much about this one. The other seems to be a P&amp;B Vivitar Auto 2x Tele Converter Model 2A-3, Nikon mount. 

It seems the unattached lenses might not be great, from my research, the one on the camera seems to be pretty good.

It also came with a [Canon Speedlite 155A flash](http://www.ebay.com/ctg/Canon-Speedlite-155A-Shoe-Mount-Flash-/103015457) and what seems to be a run of the mill Canon autowinder.

I have not really tested any of the equipment and to be honest, don't really know how. I seem to be able to take a picture with the camera and hit the lever to advance the film, but of course there is no film in it. The flash takes AA batteries but I have not tried it yet.

I bought a chess set and board from Turkey that I'm looking to sell but don't have a clue as to the value.

I bought it in Turkey while on holiday in 2003. I don't remember much of the transaction and there are no markings on either the board or the pieces. 

The pieces are gold and silver in colour. The metal of the silver ones (not pictured) is probably pewter, given their look and weight, and I'll assume the gold ones are too, but I'm guessing.
The only luck I've had finding it online is a cached image on google images from a now defunct site.

The board is handmade from wood with mother of pearl inlays. I found a [close resemblance on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=380181769805) so I'm thinking its probably walnut too. I wouldn't have a clue if that's a good guide price from that listing though.

[Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/UE7T9): I was having lighting trouble so I played with the contrast to take away some of the shine from the pieces. The originals are left in there as well.

It's a small coat (small girls in our family). About knee length. 3/4 sleeves. I THINK it's lined with silk, not positive. I would give the quality a 9/10. There is a 3-4 light small spots/stains on the inner lining. I think it just needs to be cleaned (it's been in a closet for 15+ years).
The coat is absolutely gorgeous, and I've included some quick photos I took with my phone:

I promise I'm not asking with the intent to sell. No matter what they're worth I plan on keeping them in my family due to the sentimental value. I've just been curious about them for a while. Any insight you could give about the worth or proper storage/ care for the items would be greatly appreciated! Here's a link to the album:

My mother's parents were very active in the Dutch underground resistance against the Nazis in WWII. Thankfully they both survived, and after the end of the war they left Holland in fear that the Russians were going to invade, and came to Australia. They had three small children at that stage and couldn't handle another war.

At some point before leaving, they purchased this plate. As far as the family knows this is legitimate Royal Delft, but I'd love some insight into it. We haven't been able to get any information on how many of these were made, or any more back story other than what I've said so far. 

This came into my mother's possession (she was born in Australia) after the death of my aunt (who was born in Holland). I imagine my aunt knew more about it, and could translate the text on the edges, the best my mother could do is that it's something like ""Honour the fatherland until death"" and/or possibly ""honour the dead"". If anyone speaks Dutch I'd greatly appreciate input on that too.

There is some small damage to the back, as it was hanging on a wall for some length of time. The wire is original. It could also use a really good clean, but it was an effort to get it from my mother long enough to photograph it.

Not much is known about the sword but the story is it was given to our grandfather as a gift and he believed it was from the American Civil War. Our aunt had the sword appraised and they said it was from the Prussian War and was worth $300. After some quick internet research I am skeptical. I believe it is a WWI German Officers sword.

There's also a large, highly detailed map on the other side. The only thing about this one is the quality of the pictures, which look like they've been overlayed with the same image in a slightly different position, making it look like it should be viewed in 3D. I don't know if this is just a printing error, which would be odd as there's the same effect on all the images and not the text, or whether it really is a 3D gimmick they tried out (I don't have any of the retro glasses to find out!).

This is part 4 of a 4 part series.  I've had SO MUCH FUN the last few weeks putting my experience and skills to the test, I thought I'd share with you 4 items from my personal collection which will stretch the limits of even seasoned antique-hounds' research skills.

Everyone knows that ivory comes from elephants.  Yes, I know ivory can come from other critters, but Elephant ivory is the most sought after.  It was such a popular medium in which to work that the trade in elephant ivory nearly wiped out the species.  Nowadays, trade in Elephant ivory is highly regulated.  Pre-ban ivory is allowed to be sold, but only under certain restrictions.  It is very difficult to prove the age of elephant ivory unless a strict chain of custody is maintained.  Due to its rarity, finding prices for the genuine article is not easy.  Here is a snuff bottle with the original spoon still intact.

I've had SO MUCH FUN the last few weeks putting my experience and skills to the test, I thought I'd share with you 4 items from my personal collection which will stretch the limits of even seasoned antique-hounds' research skills.

During the BMX craze everybody who was anybody had a bike with their favorite character on it.  This bike from the 80's is in exquisite condition.  The tires even still have their whiskers.  When you try to find information on it, though...  I have spoken with the largest private Mickey Mouse collector in the world (not the official ""world record holder"" - she's an amateur compared to my guy) and he has never seen anything like it.

What's it worth?

I found this item 10-12 years ago at a yard sale and fell in love. I know nothing about it. I am guessing it is an antique printer's cabinet. It is solid wood, of apparently different types. I have 12 trays, with a 7x7 grid. They unit is in rough shape, for the most part (but maybe not for its age?). Two of the drawers have adhered type on them. One has letters on the back of individual slots and the side of the drawer has a degraded label which you can make out ""...ARTERLY RE-UNION"". The other drawer has a degraded label that you can make out ""...E. STATE ST., MEDIA, PA"".

I would love to know anything about this piece that may be puzzled together from these clues, including its age/value.

I bought a Barcelona Chair off a vintage dealer in Boston called [Abodeon](http://www.abodeon.com/) about two years ago and I wanted to just figure out its authenticity before I sent it to repair for some recent damage. It's a from very reputable store, winning a couple best of Boston awards through the years (at the time he was also selling a rosewood Eames for 4.5k). '

I saw the chair for 900 dollars and pretty much fell in love with it. The lowered price was because it had some repaired damage to it, namely a rip on one of the straps; its twin without the damage went for 1.5k. It doesn't have the Knoll stamp on it, the owner told me that it was manufactured before Knoll obtained the rights, and said that you could tell it wasn't a cheap imitation because of how heavy it was. And it is heavy, it's a struggle to lift it up between my friend and I, and near impossible for a single person to pick up (of average stature). So, reddit, what do you all think? Pictures below.

Shrink-wrap is a little scuffed (can't imagine that makes a difference) but the box inside it is free of tears, marrings or dents of any sort. The thing is bizarrely pristine.

Any ideas what a collector would pay for such a thing? I'm in no hurry to sell it, but have always kinda wondered.

**edit:** There's a 5 hour drive between me and that box, and my car needs some serious work before that can happen, so I guess I'll open an update post w/ pics around November or December when I next get to visit my parents.

Sorry, it's not for sale - *Especially* not until I can somehow verify that the box wasn't opened and it's contents stolen. It's certainly possible it was shrink-wrapped to make it appear unopened - I'd never really thought about it until now.

I brought it home and no one knew what is was, I packaged it up for years until I moved to the US when I found it again and have been trying to find out about it. I joined Reddit a few months ago and was recommended here by /r/findareddit.

Is this worth anything? I'm not looking to sell it, just curious since I've had it forever. 


Size: 2'' 1/2 inches Tall, 5'' 1/2 in length and 3'' inches depth. just a little bigger than a medium coffee/tea cup.
Weight: It weighs about 1lb
Material: Metal, it looks like it used to be brass?? I’ve tried to polish it.
Location: Easton, Lincolnshire, England. Middle of the woods sitting in a tree with no other metal pieces. Just all alone.
Features:
The top spout is weathered tight.
The top lid is threaded and still works well.
The inside is a metal strainer and isn't removable.
The Bottom is solid.
The Badge has a Coat of arms with a Lion and a Unicorn and the words ""Captn Jekyll's Patent Vapour Bath"" and ""Dieu et mon droit"" and another Latin saying buts it too weathered for me to decipher.
It looks to be number but it has been rubbed off.
Overall: Besides the top coming off, this is a very solid piece of metal, no other openings.

[Close up of hallmark](http://i.imgur.com/asqWc.jpg)

The watch-glass it cracked at the bottom, so that black band you can see is some tape which was already on it when I found it. The hour hand is broken off, but as you can see from the second picture, it's still there, just loose. I've done research on the hallmarks and found it was made in Cheshire (England) c. 1891. The maker's initials read ""I.J.T.N"", cereal number ""116310"". The engraving to the right of the hallmarks rotated on its side reads ""J(or I?) Haddock"".

Any guess at value or further info would be massively appreciated!

Edit: forgot to mention that I've tried winding it and it doesn't work. Not sure if it's able to be repaired in that sense, I haven't been able to open it up to its mechanics, but I don't want to in case I damage it further

I received these black velvet paintings several years ago all wrapped in old construction paper from an elderly former Marine (83 years old) who once used to be married to a woman who grew up in Tahiti (either she was Tahitian or was the daughter of missionaries); he spent a few decades in Tokyo after the Korean War before relocating back to the US. I do know he was down in Tahiti when he was married to his former wife - sometime in the late 50's, I think. 

The paintings have been down in my trunk room - and until now, I thought there was only one until I unwrapped them and discovered a total of three (3) wrinkled black velvet paintings of semi-nude women (semi-NSFW). Nothing I'd really want hanging on my wall but I am wondering whether there would be an objective way to ascertain a value (if any). 

Also, I am based in Tokyo but if necessary I imagine I could easily send them to a good friend in LA who'd take them to a dealer etc. 

The photos I took with my mobile phone - I laid the paintings over a glass coffee table - aren't the best quality. Of the three paintings, only one of them has a signature in the corner; it's [painting #2 which has ""CHENG"" in the bottom right hand corner.]( http://i.imgur.com/PWroL.jpg)
