Please read this before posting, it has been prepared to help beginners with common questions.  Because of the influx of new users and the repetitive nature of some questions it has become necessary to head them off before the front page of the sub is consumed by them.  Some things may not be covered here and this post will be updated periodically.


If you post a troubleshooting thread, please have the courtesy to reply within the thread about the solution if someone's suggestion fixes it.  We've seen several threads where people asked for help and never even replied to the people trying to help them.  **It is not nice to ask for help and not even say thank you.**  It also helps us, because if it's a problem we don't know about (like some new driver version that sucks or say problems concerning Thunderbolt, which is a new interface) then we can add it to our bag of tricks here.  We don't know everything there is to know, and if it's a unique problem, we may include it here in the troubleshooting section.

A sub is only as good as the level of participation its users engage in, it's the nature of user-generated and user-curated content.   Let's all chip in and help make this place even better!

###This post is not meant to turn away or otherwise discourage beginners, it meant to HELP YOU.  This way you can easily find an answer to common questions without having to make a post and wait for the same answers everyone always gets.  This ultimately leads to a cleaner sub and hopefully a more productive one.

**How do I record my microphone/guitar/preamp with my computer?**

If you're here you most likely want to record yourself or others onto some storage medium.  Computers provide a convienent, flexible, low-cost medium (compared to tape, et al) for recording audio.  For analog audio signals to be converted into digital signals that can stored and manipulated on a computer it must undergo the process of analog-to-digital conversion and for you to be able to listen it again, it must be converted back to the analog domain through a digital-to-analog converter.  Any computer soundcard contains these converters (known as ADCs and DACs), though for recording purposes a profesional device is typically used.  The professional converters we are interested in here are called 'audio interfaces', which is what we call converters that have some method of interfacing with a computer.  They can come in two forms: internal cards (PCI, PCIe) or external interfaces (USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt).

These interfaces vary wildly in their features and cost, typically in number of channels, how many of those channels have microphone preamps, if any have hi-z inputs for direct recording of guitar/bass, additional digital inputs, and internal hardware routing and effects.  Some will even operate independently of a computer in a 'standalone mode.'  External interfaces are increasingly common, with them being included in many low-cost mixers as well (though frequently only a 2-channel stereo interface on cheaper models), and performance of reasonable quality can be had rather cheaply.

**What kind of computer do I need for recording?**

This is not a computer-focused sub, posts regarding building a pc will be removed.  Post questions about building computers in [/r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc).  That said, a recording PC is not very different from a gaming PC, minus the need for a fast graphics card.  A quality motherboard, power supply, and fast CPU are pretty much essential.  4GB-8GB of RAM is a good idea, more if you're going to be running large multisampled software instruments like orchestra packs.  Two hard drives, one for your OS/applications and one for recording/sample libraries is also a good idea (required for PT) to avoid underruns due to hard disk paging.  The internal graphics in the newer Intel and AMD CPUs are fine, a graphics card isn't going to make your DAW run better.  In fact, high performance graphics cards can be a source of interference and noise.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that PWM fans may be a source of interference as well, but I don't use them myself so I can't test that theory.

**How do I soundproof my dorm/bedroom/apartment?**

The first thing you should know is that sound proofing is not acoustic treatment.  Soundproofing is a method of reducing sound transmission between the studio and outside the studio.  Acoustic treatment aims to treat the studio so that the acoustics are better for recording.

Unfortunately it is very difficult and expensive to effectively soundproof an existing structure. Another factor to consider is that if you are renting or otherwise do not own the property it may be against the terms of your lease to modify the space in any meaningful way. As well, soundproofing is effective only in certain frequency ranges, with cost and difficulty inversely correlated with frequency; that is, it is more difficult and costly to soundproof against low frequencies versus high frequencies. The following links describe soundproofing and acoustic treatment in the context of small spaces in more detail.

**What DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, ie recording software) should I use?**

*This is not an exhaustive list of DAWs or their capabilities.*

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your situation. You don't 'need' Pro Tools to do professional-sounding work; in fact many pros use DAWs such as [MOTU Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/) or [Steinberg Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html).  Pro Tools has become something of a de-facto standard in commercial studios due to a variety of historical factors (not the least of which is [vendor lock-in] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) and familiarity for outside engineers, however many have moved away from Pro Tools for some of those same reasons.  Other popular DAWs are [Cockos Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)(very affordable, lots of functionality), [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com)(focused on live performance of electronic music), [Apple Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logicpro/)(popular in audio post circles).  [Cakewalk Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/sonar/), [Presonus StudioOne](http://studioone.presonus.com/), [Image-Line FL Studio](http://flstudio.com), [Steinberg Nuendo](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/nuendo.html), and [Propellerheads Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) all have their devotees as well.  Nearly all of these products have free trials available, so feel free to try them out and see what works for you.

###Some advice to follow before posting a thread about noise or other problems

*******

**Basic Troubleshooting**


Before posting questions about problems, please follow these steps for basic troubleshooting.

Many of these may seem illogical, but many implementations of technology are more involved than they may seem.  Basic troubleshooting typically involves replacing components with 'known good' equivalents and seeing if it makes a difference.  For example, noise in a vocal recording:  replace the microphone cable.  If that fixes it, the microphone cable is bad.  If it doesn't fix it, try another mic, different preamp, etc.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index#wiki_basic_troubleshooting




**I'm getting noise in my recordings, help?**


Before posting about a noise problem, please make a recording of the noise. It is impossible to properly diagnose the source of the noise through colorful language. Words like ""static"", ""buzzing"", ""clicking"" can all mean different things to different people. Buffer underrun sounds different from cellphone interference, however both could be described as clicking, buzzing, or stuttering.  Also provide a complete description of the signal chain from beginning to end, type/model of computer if there's a computer involved, and pictures of everything (including where cables are going) if possible. What may seem unrelated or insignificant to you may in fact be the source of the problem. Help us help you.  [It's also worth noting you may be experiencing *mechanical noise* rather than *electrical noise*.](http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/18/fixing-microphone-hum/)

It is also FAR more preferable to re-record the source than trying to remove noise after the fact.  Audio never comes out the other end unscathed. 

*****
Some examples of common noises:

[Cellphone/GSM noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mlponX_jw)

[Buffer Underruns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Ysh7Y9_bI)

[Ground Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSA2F1AwboU)

There isn't much you can do about Cellphone/GSM noise other than banning cellphones from the studio.  In my experience the noise doesn't travel all that far, though, so if you get them several feet away, you may be OK.  YMMV.  Even if your entire signal chain is balanced, the voice coils and/or internal wiring of your monitors can still pick it up.  If anyone has a better solution, let me know.

Buffer underruns can be fixed by increasing the size of the hardware buffer on your interface.  How to do this varies with different software and hardware, check your manual on how to do this.  Note: Increasing your buffer size will increase the latency in the audio path, not generally a problem during mixdown but it can cause major issues for artists/talent during recording.  In general, it is best to keep latency low during tracking and try to minimize the use of plugins during tracking to reduce load on the system.

Ground loops can be some of the most difficult problems to fix in the studio.  The recommended method of fixing a ground loop is through an isolation transformer or using a 'ground lift' IN THE AUDIO PATH.  FOR YOU OWN SAFETY, DO NOT LIFT THE POWER GROUND.  IF AN INTERNAL FAULT OCCURS WHILE THE POWER GROUND IS LIFTED THE CHASSIS MAY BECOME LIVE AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL VOLTAGES CAN BECOME PRESENT ON THE CHASSIS OF THE GEAR.

Essentially, iLok is a dongle that YOU BUY to protect the companies IP. You have to have it plugged into your computer with the current licenses installed, if you want your software to work. I'm a bit of a good guy greg when it comes to software and IP generally and buy legitimate versions. So I but the software Antares Autotune in this instance. It's been working fine for the last six months or so. Set up project studio for recording album in remote location. One track in particular relies on Autotune. Dongle doesn't work, session blown out of water. Spend half a day trying to make it work using iLoks useless customer support. Eventually discover iLok is broken. A range of options are offered, but essentially it involves me waiting for them to send me a new iLok after I send them the old one or spending more money protecting the companies IP. Instead I've decided to give up on any software that requires iLok to run and I would advise you to do the same. It's a long list. But be warned. If you don't believe me, google ""I hate iLok"" and read the stories. It's a broken system that's been designed to make money not protect software.

1365058407.0,122,self.audioengineering,1bnba7,How to record and mix bass - tips from a bass player,big_star,137,15,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1bnba7/how_to_record_and_mix_bass_tips_from_a_bass_player/,"This is in response to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1bi61o/good_vsts_for_di_bass_recording/)

There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about recording bass, so I thought I would share some of my own experience. I've been a pro bassist, studio musician, engineer, and producer for a long time. In fact, one of the reasons I got behind the board was that I got sick of the crappy bass tones I was typically given on sessions, and I wanted to figure out how to make it better.

So here are some of my tips - YMMV of course

*Recording bass*

First and foremost, bass is NOT a ""low guitar"" . It's job is to provide a foundation for the song, bridging the gap between drums and harmony.

To do this, you need a strong, clear, noise free signal. plug the bass into a DI or board interface, or use a high quality, low noise preamp if needed. I'm a big fan of anything API myself, so I'll usually ask for an API pre channel when I go into a session. (Not only does it sound great, but it lets the engineer know that you have a clue.)

I'd strongly recommend against using FX/plugins on the way in, including amp modeling. not only does this commit you to one particular sound, but it makes it really hard to mix the bass in mixdown. Often, bass “fits in” around other instruments, and recording a highly specific tone makes this very hard.

The ONLY exception to this rule is if you have an established band where bass FX/radical EQare part of the bass players' sound, and you KNOW for sure how the bass sits in the band and the mix (eg Tool, Korn) . Even then I would do as many FX/EQ as possible AFTER recording. You can always insert FX into the monitor mix and record the bass dry.

Get as hot a signal as you can without distortion to tape, to overcome any noise problems. Noise will stick out like a sore thumb later, particularly if you use compression.

*Mic vs DI*

 DI is great all by itself; and it's the principal way I record commercial sessions. You don't need a super fancy boutique DI to get the job done (although some of them are pretty great) , but you should have a quality DI that can deal with noise and ground loops. I like Radial a lot, but you can get good results with a cheap Whirlwind or Rolls.

I'm a fan of using both DI and cab micing if you have the space and the mics, and a rig that sounds good. You can also add in a room mic to fatten things up even more. Just make sure you check for phase issues, and time align at mixdown.

Make sure you thoroughly check for noise/artifacts on any bass amp head you use as a preamp/DI. These heads are made for live performance more than recording, and may not have noise specs comparable to recording specific gear, as well as artifacts like fan noise. Just because it has a “recording out” doesn't mean it's ideal for recording...

*To compress or not to compress*

Bass is unique in that it contains a lot of transients – sudden volume spikes. You’ll need to record at a level that keeps the peaks from pushing into distortion, while at the same time getting a strong signal out of the majority of the bass track.

Compression is great at reducing the dynamic range, taming transients and bringing up quiet passages. The problem is that it also sucks the life out of a bass line.

Basically, if you have a player who has good technique and an even, flat tone, you can avoid compressing on the way in. Personally, I hate using compression during the recording phase.

Having said that, it is a good idea to either put a limiter on the bass track at around -.1 or manually ride the gain as the take is happening. Bass players often get more “exuberant” as the take goes on, and play way louder than the soundcheck would indicate. It always sucks to have to trash a great take because of one peakout that you can't punch in.


*FX* 

I'm a big fan of parallel FX – duplicate your track (or send multiple tracks to a bus). Put your FX on the duplicate track ONLY, and roll off some of it's low end. This way, you keep the clarity and punch of the bass without the FX tonesuck.

Avoid over compressing bass. The most common bass mistake I hear is compressing it into indistinguishable mush.  Ideally, bass should “pump” along with the bass and snare drum. Only compress to tame transients or bring up soft passages that get buried in the mix.
Remember that many FX processors and amp modelers have compression built in as part of their  sound.

Compression is great for tightening up the low end in a mix, but wait until mixdown to do it.

*EQ*

The main thing to remember about bass is that it fills in the space BETWEEN other instruments. Unless you are crafting a solo bass opus, try to avoid mixing a “killer” bass tone in isolation. I can't tell you how many times I've soloed a great sounding bass track, only to have the solo part sound like nails on chalkboard, because it's emphasizing the frequencies the other instruments are NOT. Also, try to avoid the cliche “smiley face” EQ; there’s much more to mixing bass than that. Work from “flat”.

You're going to have to make several choices about where you want the bass to sit in the mix, and how it blends or competes with other instruments. For example, &gt;100Hz is the bass drum, 200-400hz is electric guitar and low piano. 

What you want to avoid at all costs is using compression instead of EQ. If you want the guitar to occupy the 200hz space, cut the bass at that point. If you want more bass, cut the guitar at 200hz. DO NOT compress the crap out of both and try to get them to fit in the same space.

Take the time to do some critical listening to the style you are mixing. Nothing annoys me more than hearing the standard Rock Bass 101 sound slapped onto a jazz upright or blues track, because that's all the engineer knows how to do. What works in your heavy metal session will NOT work in your country session.

Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.

EDIT: My first front page! Thanks guys and gals!

EDIT 2: Regarding recording levels -  This is a reply to another post, but I'm top posting because people keep asking the same question:

I should have been more clear on the recording level thing - you don't need to push it to the red these days like we did with tape, but you still want a hot signal. -12 is usually the reference I use as well.

My point was, I see a lot of guys record the bass at very low levels by default, simply because they are afraid of getting an ""over"" from a transient spike. Often they are close to the instrument's noise floor, which creates problems if you want to compress the bass later.",,False,,t5_2qkby,1365112442.0,,,True,t3_1bnba7,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1bnba7/how_to_record_and_mix_bass_tips_from_a_bass_player/,

So essentially what would happen (and I'm open to changes to this plan to make it work better) is one week there would be a thread with everyone's songs, and the top song(s) that got upvoted the most would then the next week be posted as the stems for those songs and everyone would do their own mixes/remixes etc so everyone can hear other approaches to the same songs and hear all the differences and compare and all of that.

What are your thoughts on this and/or is this even the right subreddit to do such a thing in?

**EDIT:** So everyone likes the idea. What should we call this new subreddit?

**EDIT 2** I'm also thinking if it's an entire subreddit, there would be multiple threads where anyone could do mixes, but there would be one master post once a week, one to gather up songs, the next to post the stems of the winning entries and you'd have a limited time to mix your entry for winning (karma).

He spent his last days at home in peace, other than worrying about everyone else.


This isn't meant to be an obituary, so ill keep it short. Michael is up for an Emmy for his work on An Original DUCKumentary. I ask that if any of you sound engineers are watching, you think of Michael. There are no words. His symphonies, his musical pieces written for siblings weddings survive him. Ill stop, before I go on for days.


Please remember Michael, your fellow engineer who was so talented that his new, established bosses told him ""you beat this, and no matter how long it takes, you have a job here.""

You all know the scene; You have just finished setting up a $30,000 sound system, perfectly timing all the delays and fine tuning the graphics for the room when DJ Wanker walked into the room with a scarf on and dark sunglasses, even tho it is a darkened room in the middle of summer. So you go introduce your self to him and he just walks past you like you are jack shit. Once he takes off his sun glasses to try to find his booth he starts freaking out about how the equipment her personally requested and approved in the rider is not the equipment he thought it was. After he is done calling you and idiot, he finally makes due with the exact set up he asked you for. So you go back to your job for a few moments only to realize this guy is now repositioning the speakers you set up. Awesome, now you have to talk physics with 'DJ Bright Spark to prove your point. Or you tell him to take his fucking hands off of any thing that is not in his booth. So as you re set up every thing you just fine tuned you see him setting up some shitty budget studio monitors up on his desk, facing the dance floor. So now you can either have another talk about physics or simply remove the connection to his DJ rig. All of this being great fun. So after all of that is taken care of you notice the pictures on the wall are shaking and the floor is now vibrating to a degree that no longer makes you trust the structural integrity, only to hear DJ Muppet shout out 'Hey man, why is there no bass in this system?' At which point you dramatically reduce the amp output to your subs, grab your pack of smokes and just walk the fuck away till it is near show time.

I've boiled it down to having to work Monday-Friday 10 hours a day, constantly listening to audio critically as the reason for this first world problem.

Along with engineering, I compose music so it's very hard to listen to anything without thinking about exactly what the musicians are playing and wondering what sort of gear/techniques are being used on the album. All in all, listening to music has become a very technical activity. Its lost its magic in a small sense of the word. I rarely get an emotional reaction from music, even when it comes to some of my favorite albums. My biggest problem with this dilemma is that its made me stop and think about whether or not I love music as much as I used to which leads to the question about why it is I'm in this industry.

Am I burning out? Is there something you guys do to circumvent this or is it something you just sort of get used to and accept?

Could this be caused by a failure in the power setup, maybe missed communications between the lighting and sound teams? There doesn't seem to be any rain water giving them trouble, so it seems slightly out-of-the-blue. 

The one aspect of live sound engineering that gives me the most trouble is the power aspect. Most rigs I've worked with have been permanent installs, so for you road dogs that are installing in the morning and tearing out at the end of the night, I salute you. 

I've always had difficulty with power control and the idea of this happening on stage to someone I'm mixing downright terrifies me, so I figured I'd give you fine folks a way to teach me an important lesson on power safety.

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index

After much work editing the FAQ, learning TRAC syntax, and dealing with general bugginess, Reddit's admins decided to get rid of the TRAC FAQs and bring back the old Wiki tab at the top.  Since we had until Jan 31 to switch over and the FAQ was still being worked on, I decided to just port it over now before much more work gets done.

That said, it's come a long way.  It's pretty extensive now and I feel it's getting there rapidly.  I wrote up some cheap gear recommendations (mic, interface, monitors, headphones) as a ""gear guide"" to attempt to head off those questions, which still seem to be pouring in.  I'm certain part of the reason for this is that the link in the sidebar doesn't show up in the portable reddit apps without hitting another button (never on the default page). Now that the wiki is in the tabs, we just have to hope the devs of the mobile apps will decide to add 'wiki' to their menus.

Anyway, the wiki is currently set so that it's publicly viewable, but only mods and approved posters can edit.  Users who were messaged about the FAQ previous to it's debut have edit access.

I am a owner-operator of a studio.

So basically, Client B wants to spend his break on the bed sessions for Client A's project recording some material for his project with me. I told him this was pretty unacceptable, working on someone else's project during another clients studio time, even on break. 

I told Client B that if he did want to do the recording for the other project on the same day, he can show up earlier or stay later once Client A has left the building, but to do it on break would only drag the attention away from Client A's project.

**My GF's detective called and let her know that the guys that robbed her were later caught, and have admitted to 25 armed robberies in the last week, Their in jail and probably will be for the rest of their life  :)**

**Last night we went out with some good friends and had some long overdue drinks. After getting home at 4am and reading parts of this thread again, I couldn't help but to just laugh at the whole situation and how ridiculous it was. Minus the splitting headache, I feel better than ever today and am soo glad I ended that tour when I did.**




I recently signed on to go on tour for 3 months, but had to quit after a week. I've been really depressed and dont know if I made the right decision. There was soo much wrong with this tour I dont even know where to start, but I'll try. Sorry if it doesn't all make sense, I'm still trying to make order of everything..

A few weeks ago I responded to a craigslist ad looking for an AV person to go on tour with a Hispanic dance group that would be doing a 60 city tour at schools and theaters for 3 months. I have a degree in show production from Full Sail and also have a good bit of practical experience from numerous jobs and gigs I have worked. 

This group wanted a person to do the sound, lights, video, and be the driver. I thought that was a bit much, but they reassured me they had one guy in the past that was able to do it all with ease. 

O ya- I was the only white guy in the group. Half of them spoke ok english, but not great, the other half didn't speak a word of english. 

It was 2 weeks before the tour started and they asked to hire me as a consultant to set up all the gear and buy whatever may be needed. I agreed and started setting things up. 

I had a few garbage bags full of broken and half working cables and a bunch of half working gear that had been very ghetto-rigged over the years. initially I thought it wouldn't be too much work, but it was. I worked nearly everyday for 2 weeks getting their stuff in order. Testing every cable, fixing what I could, and making some sense out of the mess I was given. 

I spent every day at this mansion the company owned (a 'non-profit organization') working on their gear, trying to make it into some kind of concert, that I still had no idea what it consists of. This mansion was huge, on the ocean (in Miami), and had boats and jet-ski's in back, and 2 brand new Mercedes Benz in the driveway. The address of this mansion is the official address of the organization. Meanwhile they had invested exactly $100 in a new 12 channel Behringer mixer from Guitar Center. It was absolute crap, but hey, it made sound come out, so it was good enough for them. 

From the very beginning I told them I would need a cue sheet of the performance, stage plots and input lists. Formal documents were a totally new concept to them and they still dont really understand why you may need some kind of documents for the show. 

I stayed up late making a 6 page inventory list of every single piece of gear the company owned, and making a list of things they needed to buy or replace. A replacement transmitter for a bad sennheiser unit was one of them, as well as a rack mounted cd player for the audio, to replace the mini-disc player they had been using for many years. I did buy a few cables and adapters and convinced my boss to buy me an outboard eq. I also bought 3 DI boxes for the 3 guitars. I learned that it was all wireless, so we wouldnt particularly need them, but they would be good to have if/when the guitar wireless transmitters are not working. I bought 1 from the company, leaving them two. I felt this was emergency insurance if a guitar transmitter goes bad and it would be good for us to keep them. (this is important later)  

I also asked, repeatedly, for all the MP3's that would be used during the show, as I wasn't comfortable using the 10 yr old portable minidisk player they had been using for years. It had an adapter plugged into it, running to an RCA cable, to two couplers to another RCA cable, going into the wrong input. But hey it made sound come out, so they never saw a need to upgrade it. 


I was told we would have rehearsals all week, the week prior to the tour, and that we would have the weekend off. We never had a single rehearsal. My first rehearsal was our first actual show in a neighbor city on the Friday before the tour started. 

I plugged into the house system, used their console, and got sound to work. I nearly had tears in my eyes. It may not have been the greatest mix, but everything worked, and all my hard work payed off, we had a good show, and the owners were happy. O ya, there was a problem with the projector and we couldnt get an image to it. The boss arrives literally 5 minutes before the show started, and fixed the issue. with seconds to spare. Maybe it's just me, but I feel the boss should have been there at 8am with the rest of the crew and cast, not show up 5 minutes before showtime holding a cup of starbucks. It is the first show after all..

Balanced/Unbalanced?",rharrison,58,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/vxfrt/can_someone_explain_the_difference_between_line/,"I have a basic understanding of this concept, but I need a few things clarified- here's what I know (please correct me where I'm wrong):

The difference between these signals is impedance. ""Line"" is the strongest signal, i.e. the signal with the lowest impedance. This is ""mixer"" level. A line level signal going into a mixer should have the input gain trim all the way down. Line is what comes out of your ipod or whatever to drive headphones. ""Instrument"" is the next highest impedance, and it's what comes out of an electric guitar or electric piano (like a rhodes) and it needs a preamp of some sort to get up to ""line"" level before being sent to a poweramp and speakers. ""Mic"" is next and needs even more pregain to be at unity on a mixer.

My main questions:

1. What is ""balanced"" and what is ""unbalanced""? i've heard that you need a ""balanced"" 1/4 in cable to run a balanced signal using this sort of connector.

2. What is Hi-Z and Low-Z? I know most 1/4 instrument cables are called ""Hi-Z"" and XLR cables are ""Lo-Z."" What about ""speaker"" 1/4 in cables and Neutrik/Speakon cables?

3. What exactly are the impedance levels in ohms for ""Mic"" ""Instrument"" and ""Line?"" Can I plug an Ipod straight into a poweramp and run speakers without a mixer?

I keep seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head on this subreddit and /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers. I am making this post in hopes that I and others in the community that have knowledge and experience in this important aspect of recording can impart some of it to those that don't have as much knowledge or experience. I am also hoping this can get added to the sidebar so we can stop seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head. Note, these are the very basics. I truly hope we can begin a more in depth discussion about the kinds of room modes and the cheapest ways to achieve great results! Let's begin.

So you want to make recordings? Maybe you already have made one. Maybe you have made a couple and some of them sound great, but others don't match up to the same quality and you want to problem solve your sonic issues. Regardless of the stage you are at in your new found addiction, if you haven't yet started, you should begin to think about how you monitor your sound. That is, how sound gets from your monitors/speakers to your ears. First, you will need a ""trustworthy"" set of monitors if you don't have any. I put trustworthy in quotes because it doesn't ""matter"" what you buy. I put matter in quotes because it only matters what you buy as your ears become attuned to certain subtle sonic characteristics in music. Buy monitors with the best qualities you like that you can afford. Personally, I use Yamaha HS80Ms and have for years. I picked the HS80s some 5 years ago for a few reasons. The first was that they look like NS10s (rad!). The second, to my lesser-trained ears 5 years ago, those monitors sounded pristine compared to other options. Did I mention I got a crazy discount on them at the time? Oh, and they have a really consistent low end without needing a sub-woofer. This was just my untrained opinion, though, so don't go bashing me if you go out and buy them only to hate how they sound. Pick what you like and run with it. 

You have monitors. You are most likely in an apartment, house, bedroom, or some combination of those three things. Maybe you are in a project studio in the G ""room"" that hardly passes for a drum booth. If you are the last option, I hate to say it, but you need a larger space. You can try to make small spaces work, but you really need at least a 10x10 room to dedicated completely to this. Room dimensions you say? Now is a good time to check out these ratios of ""ideal"" room ratios. Also, grab a tape measure and measure your room. Write it down, dummy.

**Height**:**Width**:**Length**

**1.00**:**1.14**:**1.39**

**1.00**:**1.28**:**1.54**

**1.00**:**1.60**:**2.33**



courtesy of Ethan Winer http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html

If you have a room that falls into this ratio, hooray great for you! If you don't, hooray great for you! My room didn't fall perfectly into any of these, but it comes closest to the second. The dimensions of my apartment bedroom studio are 8'x10'x13'. Why does this matter? Modes!

Room modes, or the frequency at which a room resonates, are the reason sound (especially low frequencies) is perceived louder or quieter in different locations in a room. In an ideal studio, as long as the listener places their ears anywhere in front of the monitors they will hear essentially every frequency at equal volumes. Your mileage may vary. In apartment bedroom studios it is close to impossible to get rid of all of your room modes. Why? Something something parallel walls, square dimensions, sheet rock. What we can do is tailor a specific area that sounds accurate and depending on how well you do this your area can grow quite large! So how exactly does a room mode get created? As you know, all things resonate at a fundamental frequency, even you. Rooms are no different and the size of your room is actually part of a wave form. If you have your audio unit converter handy, convert 16' into hertz. You should get close to 70hz. That means 70hz takes 16' to go from 0 to +1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0. That is, through it's whole cycle. My apartment bedroom studio is 8' tall which is half of 16' and 70hz is also a mode of my room. Let's break this down:

Waveforms have the most energy when they are changing polarity. That is, when the wave makes the switch from 1 to -1 through 0 or vice versa. The wave uses all of that energy to get to ±1 and when it reaches that point it is out of energy and falls back to 0. My ceiling and floor are essentially taking any sonic information traveling at 70hz and bouncing it between the two surfaces because the two surfaces are at distance from each other that intersects with 70hz's most energetic position. The two surfaces *resonate* at 70hz. You could see them vibrate if you were stoned enough. This is how two drum heads work. Only, instead of striking the batter side of a drum, speakers are striking the walls through convection of air.

You can calculate your room modes here. http://www.bobgolds.com/Mode/RoomModes.htm

If you calculated your room modes you will notice that all of the frequencies fall in a pattern. Halves and doubles, baby! Not only do I have to worry about 70hz, I have to worry about 140, 280, 560, and possibly even 1120. (You know I did, playboy.) Mind you, this is just for the height of my room! You might be thinking of quitting now, but don't, it get's *way* better if you learn the rest of your room modes and start forming a plan.

You know what your room modes are, but you don't know how to fix them. Hmmm? Who's to say those modes are even a problem? I've read literature that suggests vocalists have a harder time singing in dead rooms than rooms with a little bit of ""verb"". It has something to do with being able to monitor the sound of your own voice. Ohhhh, take note of how your ears are always the same distance from the floor. Some ""verb"" can be good. Let's stop saying verb. What I mean to say is, some reflections can be good. 

Reflections, there is a new word for your vocabulary. Reflections are when a wave hits a surface and bounces from it in the opposite direction. Reflectors reflect energy. The opposite of reflectors are absorbers. Absorbers absorb energy. Reflections are tricky, though, because the word itself says nothing of the direction of the reflected wave which is important if we're trying to direct excess frequencies away from our ears. There is a specific class of reflectors called diffusers that cause reflections to splay out in lots of random directions instead of one consistently unknown location. As far diffusers go, the beauty is in the curved surface that reflects in infinitely random directions. I have some reflectors in place to balance the color of my room. All rooms will need a balance of all materials. Some things in your room can be used as reflectors. Flat walls are reflectors. I use a combination of strategically placed absorbers and the existing walls to achieve my most accurate results.

Ok, so how do we go about determining where to put absorbers, reflectors, and/or diffusers? With mirrors. I used a handheld mirror with a hole in the handle just small enough for a push pin to pin the mirror to the wall. I pinned the mirror to the wall, sat in my chair, and looked to see if I could see any portion of my speaker in it. If I could see the woofer I made a mark of it on the wall. If I could see the tweeter, I made that mark, too. I went all the way around the room except for behind the monitors where I knew I would be placing a broadband absorber. I have also made a large effort to pull the monitors off of the wall. Walls have a nasty proximity effect, if your ears or your monitors sit too close to them you will notice. In the end I ended up putting one absorber behind each monitor hanging vertically, two hanging horizontally in the back of the room one stacked* on the other. This is where the room mode knowledge came in handy. 

I decided to setup up my room with the longest wall in front of me, this is actually backwards (something something shortest distance from ears to wall), but the short walls in question are a closet and a window and the closet side has a door next to it. Logistically, it would not work if I wanted to work in the room. Ok, modes, my ""front to back"" mode is 55hz. Yikes! The complimentary frequency spread includes lots of low frequencies. I went super hard on broadband absorbers and stuffed my acoustic panels with rock wool. Rock wool and acoustic fiberglass will absorb frequencies as low as 125hz. Fun fact, HS80Ms aren't behemoths when it comes to producing 85hz and under so I don't have to worry ""much"" about that. I have easily 4"" of rock wool in my front and back panels and it cleans up that room mode nicely. For those pesky short walls I ended up putting a bookshelf stocked with heavy books, vinyl, and cables on the window side and free standing broadband absorbers on the closet side. I also hung curtains (on the rare occasion I want a brighter sound in the room I draw the curtains to reveal shiny plastic sliding closet doors). The main idea here is I wanted to put as much mass as I could between the speakers where they reflect off the wall and the walls. I don't have any figures to back this up, but I'm pretty sure my stuffed bookshelf is a ""bass trap"" for anything below 100hz. I haven't mentioned yet that all four corners (save for the one with the door) are protected by thick broadband absorbers (more traps, low frequencies pools where planes meet). One corner is occupied by a gigantic square armchair (another bass trap, opposite the bookshelf) that isn't for sitting. The ceiling corners are all covered with broadband absorbers. Finally, the space right above my head in the ""zone"" is covered. It should be noted that all of these baffles are floating a distance from the surfaces they protect. I was able to get the ceiling panels really low hanging as well as the ones on the back wall. I aimed to float my panels from the wall at the problem frequency's quarter length where it has the least amount of energy. The result is a room that sounds a lot like it does in my car. I don't worry about how my own mixes sound on other systems anymore and I've grown to love some of my favorite albums even more! Classical on vinyl? You might stop leaving the home.

I want to double back to that thing I said about your ears distance from the floor. This fact is why studios with hardwood floors sound so nice. For my studio I went out and bought one of those hard plastic office mat rollers. It makes a world of difference.

**Don't let stacked hanging panels touch. The one on the bottom will fall.***

**TL;DR**

Ok, so how do we make a broadband absorber? It's so easy, dude. Just go to the following link.

I've wanted to edit and tinker with music for so long now, but if that's the case, then that's the case. My question though is, what should I go to school for if I still want to have music be the center of my life? And you might say, well, music can still be the center of your life while you go to school for something else and get a job with something else and get money doing something else, but the truth is, I really don't care about anything else. I mean I do, of course, but music just takes up so much space in my care bubble that nothing else really seems all that significant. I just want to know so much more about music as a whole, but I don't really want to focus on just mastering an instrument or going into business with it (like being an accountant for a record company or whatever the general idea of wearing a suit entails). 

tldr; I hear audio engineering isn't worth learning about, what should I learn about instead?

**Edit:**
Wow, thank you all so much for all this awesome information. I could not have imagined everyone taking the time to give me their input so thoroughly. These comments have made me seriously rethink what I'm going to do with my life, and to be honest, I am now completely lost. But I'd rather be lost on direction than $40,000, I'd say, so thank you, everyone, again.

What I think I'm going to do is just learn everything I can about music right now without spending a lot of money and just see where I am when I'm done with that. Perhaps I can find some way to incorporate music with another skill that interests me. Heck, maybe I'll just start making my own music, who knows. But again, thank you.

1374330218.0,47,self.audioengineering,1ip1i1,"Hey guys. I think I'm getting fucked over, mechanic style, by the guy Mixing/mastering my album, and I want your opinions.",SamAllmon,55,8,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1ip1i1/hey_guys_i_think_im_getting_fucked_over_mechanic/,"I spent 20 minutes searching for the right subreddit for this, I hope this is the right place. I see in the sidebar that there is /r/postaudio for requests, which this isn't, yet.

Anywhoo. To the meat of it. I raised money last year for my band [The Red Heroes](http://theRedHeroes.bandcamp.com) to record our album. We contacted this guy ( I won't name names. Though I want to.) who does all of the local bands recordings, which all sounded amazing, and He gave us the quote of 1200 bucks. His quote was for mixing, and he thought he would have extra balance left over, and he would pass it on to the Mastering guy, to get us started on that. Sounded like a plan. We hire us a studio drummer, and get some practice in, and go to the studio, and record. He doesn't want click tracks, because he would have to automate it or something, so we just record scratches to get the drums sounding great.

There is a little bit of studio drama, where the lead singer didn't like the guest drummer's beat for one song, but we got it done. At the end of our time there, we had used 24 hours, paid for 48, and he was going to start mixing.

I was shooting a film at the time, so asked him if when he masters it, if he could do another render with the vocals muted, so I can have underscore for the film. He says sure. He quotes about a week of turnaround.

Two weeks pass by, I ask him what's up. He said that he has gone over time, because he had to re-mix the tracks for the instrumentals. I said I didn't ask for that, he said that he wasn't going to charge me for that, but was letting me know he didn't have any money left over for the Mastering. He sends me the mix, and it's kind of shit. It's not mastered, which is a lot of it, but we just weren't happy with it. We made a page and a half of notes of what we wanted different, and he said that it would take too much work, and asked for 200 more dollars. And then said that the mastering guy wanted 25 a track, totalling 325, grand total: 525.

My lead singer's dad paid that for us, and he quoted another two weeks for the finished product.

Which brings us to last night. I ask him how it's going, he said that he was actually finishing up right then, I'd have it in an hour. He gave it to me, and for the most part, I love it. But there were exactly 5 things we wanted changed, that we were agreed shouldn't take that long (There were some problems that persisted from the fact that we didn't do click tracks, but we let them slide. No one would know but us that that part is faster.)

They were things like ""Less Mike Vocals on song X"" or ""Less reverb on the girl vocals"" etc. There was one, where there's a weird hum in the background of one song that could be hard, but it's for like 2 seconds, and in the right key, so it's not that big of a deal.

I send the notes to him, thanking him, and saying how much I really liked the whole album, and he says (Copied from my text messages):

&gt;Alright those things are something that gets fixed in the mix. I'm going to be out of town for about a week, so I can try to work on it when I get back, but it may take some time because I can't just bring up the vocal or whatever, it's the analog world so it's new mixes all around...

I feel he's trying to get extra money from me again, and the whole thing sounds fishy.

First off: We recorded digitally. We recorded onto a computer using Windows. I don't know the software, but I know the OS.

Second off: This whole starting over from scratch because you have to adjust one level seems completely made up. It could be that it's his workflow, and he doesn't save nightly, just keeps his board on, and renders it out at the end, and that's it. But that's dumb, and I shouldn't have to pay for his workflow inadequacies.

Third off: We wanted to have this album done, printed and released in April. It's still in Mastering here in Late July. And we haven't interacted directly since March.

Is this guy slacking off, and making me pay, just no good, and making me pay, or trying to swindle me?

I just kind of want to get out of there.

What should I do?

I could say ""Oh, if it will take a while, then never mind. But Alex was wanting to sample this album for an EDM project. Can I have the raws and the save files, etc. So we can fuck around with it"" but then take it to someone else to re-master it (or, if it turns out that he is fulla shit, and it is as easy as lowering the volume on the guitar, etc. Do it myself.)

Or, I could actually not know what I'm talking about, and he will need another two weeks to start over, and I should suck it up and pay.

That's why I came to you guys. You know the business and technology more, so you can tell me if I'm crazy or not.

One thing's for sure, I'm going to someone else for the next album.

TL;DR: Album producer says correcting notes requires starting over. Blames it on ""The Analog World"", we recorded digitally.

The app was published yesterday and during the next 24 hours you can get it for free.",flo_vonderuni,60,12,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1fgysm/hello_raudioengineering_with_your_help_i_have/,"You can [install it from this link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-noise/id652231260?ls=1&amp;mt=8). Below is a list of its features. Self-post so I get no karma. Please help me spread the word by upvoting, please tell your friends who have an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch about it. Thanks a lot!

--------

This app lets you generate ""smart"" noise, which means the noise adapts to the sounds around you. The intended usage is blocking distracting noises when you need to concentrate or want to relax or fall asleep. The app will generate the noise with about the same frequency distribution as the ambient sounds, and this will keep you from being distracted by them. In a second usage mode, the adaptation can be optionally switched off, and then the app just generates white noise that you can still filter using the bandpass filter.

These are the functions of the user interface elements: 

* Start/Stop: At the top there is a button to turn the noise generation on and off. As an alternative you can use the play/pause button of your headset with remote control. 

* Timeout: You may set a timeout of up to 24 hours after which the noise will be gradually faded out over 20 seconds, and eventually turned off completely. A simple tap restarts the timeout. 

* Enable adaptation: This lets you choose if you want the noise to remain constant (off) or if it should adapt to the sounds around you (on). The next three settings are only available when adaptation is enabled. 

* Setting for noise floor: You can add some additional white noise into the process. This signal is also subjected to the bandpass filter (see below). 

* Setting for Attack: On a per-frequency basis, this is the duration that determines the time until the intensity has reached 90% of the maximum if it was previously at 0, when the sounds from the environment remain constant. 

* Setting for Decay: On a per-frequency basis, this is the duration that determines the time from the stop of the environmental excitaton until the intensity has decreased to 10% of the output value before the stop. 

* Bandpass: This lets you filter the frequency range of the generated noise. Only the frequencies above the first setting and below the second setting will be let through. Make sure to have the first slider lower than the second one, otherwise everything will be filtered out and you won't hear anything. 

* Amplification: This setting determines the amplification of the generated noise before it is send to a compressor that limits the volume. When you want the app to react strongly to the environmental sounds, set the system volume to a low setting and and the amplification to a high one. If you want the highest-quality noise and the amplification is not so important, set the amplification to a low setting and the system volume to maximum, so the output is not compressed. 

* Frequency chart. The frequency chart shows the frequency distribution inside the range that you set in the bandpass filter. Here you can watch the effects of different attack and decay settings. 

Recommended usage scenarios: when you want to use the app for falling asleep it is recommended to use it with your device's built-in speaker if you want to use the non-adaptive mode. If you want to use the adaptive mode instead it's best to use headphones because a headset will pick up more noises from your movements and breath. In this case, place your device on your bedside table. On the other hand, if you want to have the noise generation running in the background while using some other app, it would be best to use it with a headset with remote and mic, so as not to pick up the noises from touching the device.

**EDIT: Thank you all for downloading and upvoting. The promotion has now ended. The app is now on sale for $0.99. Even if you still see the price as free, Apple might charge you for installing. If that happens, please don't leave a negative review, it's not my fault.**

I work primarily in the studio, but I'm also talented in live sound. A close friend of mine whom I've helped roadie for in the past called me and told me that he and a couple of other bands needed to get their own sound guy for the night or the show would not go on. I jumped at the chance to not only do what I love but help people I love. It was an unfamiliar space with unfamiliar gear and with no more payment than a couple of beers.

It was one of the best nights of live music I've ever been or may ever be involved in. 

These kids are extremely talented and disgustingly enthusiastic. I even plugged my portable board into the record send on the main board and used my laptop as a 2-track to record the set. The appreciation I got from the band members left me with a renewed sense of worth and purpose. Even the owner was pleased with how I ran things, giving me multiple ""not bad"" faces and thumbs up.

I really love being an engineer and getting to make people happy doing it. We are a rare breed of geek that get to be cool without being obtuse.

Any help would be amazing,frackincylon,57,9,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/ymcjq/usps_lost_all_my_rack_gear_and_shorted_me_over/,"On May 29th I shipped most of my recording gear from Utah to Indiana because I was moving. The equipment was sent in 5 different packages. On June 4th 4/5 of the boxes arrived (missing the most expensive) so I panicked. The Post Office said that parcel post is the slowest form of shipping and the package was rather large so I shouldn't be concerned.

After 14 grueling business days with many calls to the post office they finally say enough time has past for me to file a report. I talk to my rep, send in pictures of the rack gear... Nothing happens. I get a call 21 business days in. They say they have no idea where it is, and enough time has past to file an insurance claim. The equipment was worth over $6000 new and would cost around $4000 to replace with used gear, and I only insured it for $3000 so I was obviously reluctant to settle for the insurance. 7 days later no updates on the case and no package. So I file a claim.

About a month later (2 months after shipping it) I get a check in the mail for $1924.68 including $47.60 of refunded shipping. $1,122.92 short of even the insured amount. After a few hours of conversation with the USPS accounting department I learn that the post office pays out on the depreciated value of the equipment based on a 5 year life and if I have proof that the equipment is worth more I should file an appeal that would take into account true value (not market value, think kelly blue book for cars) of my equipment. 

I turned to the manufacturers of the equipment, and to my sales rep at Sweetwater, and to my local guitar center. Mostly I was ignored, but those who wanted to help were unable to provide me with what I needed. I did my best with what they could provide, but my first appeal was denied. 

I guess what I'm looking for is if some knows a method of valuating recording equipment, or if anyone here (or knows some one who) is in the business of buying and selling used gear enough their word would hold some weight in an appeal? At this point anything that would help with my second appeal would be greatly appreciated.  

Here is a list of the equipment that was lost and when it was purchased if it would help:

* Great River MP-2NV - $2,175    12/30/2009
* Mackie Onyx 800r - $850    3/4/08
* Joe Meek TwinQ - $638.77  3/4/08
* Digidesign 002r - $1200        6/19/06
* Black Lion Audio Signature Modification to Digidesign 002r - $1250 10/1/09
* SKB 6SP Rollx rack Case with casters - $135.41   6/3/07

**TL;DR** Sent Equipment via USPS, Equipment ($6000 new, $4000 to replace used) was lost, I insured the equipment for $3000, USPS paid out $1877.08, I am asking for help valuating lost equipment to win appeal against USPS

Assume for now that you already have the workspace: A control room space and a live room space. Neither room is acoustically treated and are essentially empty shells. The studio has to have the capability of tracking a band live (let's say Drums, Bass, 2 x Guitar, Vox) so you'll need the requisite amount of microphones/DI capabilities as well as foldback capabilities for all members.

My mentors were seasoned RnB engineers whose objectives were first and foremost depth, space, and balance. Whenever I brought up heavier sounds I usually got the response ""that's too compressed"" and the like.  While it would be true for an RnB record, it's not true for alternative rock, punk rock, metal, DnB, breaks, etc.

What are your tricks for getting great heavy mixes (assuming the underlying tracks are well-recorded?)

I'll go first with what I've learned recently:

* low-pass guitars before compressing them - often in the 7-10k range.   I've been liking an 8k low-pass lately.  compress with 1176 style compression and don't be afraid to smash them.  when smashing you may have some luck retaining depth by doing parallel compression alongside the uncompressed guitars, depending on the tones end effects involved.  

* don't be afraid to distort the bass.  this could be done by saturating an analog eq, compressor, an actual distortion pedal/effect, or by re-amping the signal with a nice amp.  compress the bass considerably and add a hair of EQ post-compression at 3-5k to get the distortion to open up again from the darkening effects of the eq.

* don't be afraid to get weird with the bass.  the bass is mostly there to lock the guitars to the drums.  I've actually been enjoying adding an 85ms stereo delay to the bass and easing that into the mix.  It gives the distorted bass that ""flying apart sound"" that can enhance the guitars.  Make sure to reference your mix in mono to make sure you aren't f'ing the whole bass phase up, though, and don't overdo it.

Basically for the first time I understand why the 1176 and its offspring are such rock icons.  They make things sound LOUD!

I'm still learning in this area.  Divulge your secrets!  In particular I want to know how to get the really spacious but heavy Andy Sneap metal drum sound. (like http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Ignite/4FbB4b?src=5)

The final result is going to be a binaural recording of my synthesiser. For those that don't know, it basically involves recording from two microphones placed in your ears. This captures the time difference from the sound source to each ear and the screening of high frequencies (Think putting your hand over a speaker to produced a muffled sound. Turns out your head does that too). If you listen to the recording through headphones, this time difference and screening produces a very three dimensional sound. Like, the first time I heard it my response was ""WHATTHEACTUALFUCKTHATSAMAZING"". Anyways, I've had to study the physicsy side of things (cause, ya know, that's my degree) and every physicist and acoustician I've spoke to about it has been obsessed with it but I was curious as to what audio engineering people thought of it.

Requested horror music: ""Slow-building, intense, frightening"" but decided, long after I'd written the music, that what they*really* wanted was action music that was ""fast-paced and more energetic"".  Of course they didn't want to pay for new compositions, so we set to task trying to pound a horror-peg into an action hole through a series of painful revisions with extremely vague direction. It's like they asked a painter to paint their wall taupe, which he then did perfectly, and then they decided they wanted seafoam.  But they don't want to pay the painter to repaint the wall.   

They've now decided to drop me, without pay, because they're still not happy, because in essence these are horror songs. Of course there's nothing I can do about it because there was **no contract**. 

I'm not terribly pissed. I knew I'd hit a bad apple eventually so really it's my fault. I have had several years of smooth contract-free work so have been putting off the lawyer stuff and doing business like a grown-up. However, I've just sent my first ever lawyer email and I hope this serves as a reminder to anyone who's currently in or thinking about entering the freelance game to do the same.

I've been in love with music since forever, and 2 years ago I moved to Seattle and found an audio program that I liked at a local community college.

A couple months ago I started recording and doing live sound 2 nights a week for free at a local jazz club, then doing coarse mixes of each live set (3 hours+ audio) on a 48 hour turnaround.  After one evening's set, one of the players gave me his business card and told me he owns a studio and might be looking for an intern.  I followed up, and a couple meetings later he agreed to take me on.  His studio's business is about 50/50 music/voiceover, and it was mentioned off-hand that once I'm no longer an intern the way my boss envisioned it was I would pull clients in and work with them at his studio independently of the work he does at his studio, and just pay him rent for his space/equipment on each session while I could charge whatever additional I want.

I was just hoping maybe someone could offer some guidance to me; lately I've been doing a lot of stuff for free, because I can afford it while I go to school, but that won't be the case for long.  I want to build a career out of audio, and more specifically musical audio.  What opportunities should I be keeping an eye out for, which should I be nurturing?

www.theultimatemiclocker.com

The App is a very large collection of currently produced microphones that you can search and filter by Price, Brand, Use, and Type.  Then you get frequency charts, polar charts, pricing, specifications, descriptions, etc on the Mics.  We have about 30 manufacturers and about 1,000 microphones in the App and we are continually adding more.  

I built this for all of us in the Audio Industry and your feedback is important to me.  I have a few download coupon codes left and if you would like one, send me a message and I'll get you one.

This week I was lucky to get a good deal on the Beatles in Mono collection, its been a great experience overall. A few notes on the albums:

* ""Please Please Me"" and ""With the Beatles"" - so sonically clear and *rocking*. There are lots of songs that stand out as being so much better than the mushy, spacey, fake-stereo versions you are used to hearing. You almost feel sorry for John during *Twist and Shout* because its so clear he is shredding his vocal chords. 

Its almost like hearing these albums for the first time. What really strikes me is how good these albums were as a debut and their follow-up. You get the feeling that these same two albums released today - would still be smash hits. 

""Beatles for Sale"" is also a big improvement with songs like ""Eight Days a Week"" sounding some much more punchy, clear with lots less phase canceling issues. Crisp handclaps instead of the 4sec smeared reverb sounding version in the fake-stereo one.

There are some real other gems on the album ""Ticket to Ride"" is so much fuller. Has a real punchiness to it - you can really hear the individual vocal lines so much clearer. 

However, having said all that, ""Sgt Pepper"" is worth buying the whole collection for. Its just stunning how much better it is....for those of you that have heard I'm sure you understand. Not just one or two songs, but all of them sound completely new. Even tracks that was previously not featured tracks like ""She's Leaving Home"". Wow. The strings/harp are so clear...sounds like they are 10ft away. Kinda pointless to describe the rest of the album, since every track is so much improved. So many clear things that you simply can't hear on the stereo version (the counting in the middle of ""A Day In The Life"" during the orchestra rise...and when Paul's diddy comes in....ahhh what a beautiful transition). 

Enough blabbering. Have others heard this masterpiece yet? And other favorite mono albums you like over their stereo counterparts?

I am a college student who has aspirations to be an audio engineer. I am currently a film major, so I have an opportunity to branch off into audio, but my school doesn't support it as much as video.

So I came to /r/audioengineering to get feedback from you guys. I create music in my dorm room so I can give myself material to mix and master, but I have no idea how good it is or how to improve.

Here's an example of my latest project:

https://soundcloud.com/pdizz/andrew-peterson-the-a-team

I'm somewhat satisfied with it because I know there is only so much that I can do while recording in a dorm room, but I feel that it doesn't sound anywhere as natural sounding as most music today.

It's almost borderline tone-deafness, but I've done a bit of researching to conclude that it's not quite that bad. 

We're working on having her record vocals for kids songs over basic instrumentation such as acoustic guitar and piano. Not fancy playing mind you, basic G C and D stuff here. The project also must feature her voice exclusively, therefor hiring outside vocalists isn't an option. She's already told me that she's had a vocal coach help her, and she's done this with a few other engineers before her.

Obviously I plan to pitch-correct the hell out of this when we're finished, but I just really want to get as close as we can while tracking before I start operating on the audio. Unfortunately, her voice range isn't very wide either. Most vocal lines range about two steps up or down. Also, if one of the songs starts on C, she can't hit it. So i've gone through and taken all of the instrumentation to start on G, which seems to be the note she can hit easiest.

The question is what tips and tricks have you found work best while recording poor vocalists like this? Any ideas to better the outcome of this particular situation?

EDIT: Went directly to said session after making this post. She happened to bring one of her children in. That, in combination with starting the melody line on the note that she hits most often (G) helped very very much. Thanks for all the replies.

I still believe this is true, yet i've also come to another realization.  

Studio production invests a lot of time on the front end of the music-listening experience.  Hours are spent dialing in tones to make them perfect.  The way a certain condenser mic interacts with a certain preamp.  The way a certain overdub fits in the mix just right.  The way a great mastering engineer emphasizes the power of a song while still keeping it dynamic and listenable.  

But the ultimate result of all this hard work is often reduced to a 128kbps mp3 that is played back on some shitty earbuds on a crowded subway car.  While lots of effort is put in on the front end of recording sessions, unless there is equal effort put in on the back end then the efforts go to waste.  

Live sound is about the replication.  The source material may be less than perfect; the performances are one take, the microphones may be chosen to an extent based on durability as opposed to sound quality, and the room acoustics and system integrity may be compromised by various other environmental factors.  But the average concert goer is not accustomed to hearing live music amplified through a high-fidelity full range sound sound system like the ones found at most good venues.  Live mixing prioritizes the the actual experience that the audience is having at the moment, and you are right there along side of them. 

Even though studio recording is arguably more artistic, meticulous, and creative, I'm still proud to be in control of the ultimate and immediate experience that people are having as they are consuming the product in real time.",,False,,t5_2qkby,False,,,True,t3_18d95r,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/18d95r/studio_recording_vs_live_sound_reinforcement/,

When the band is out of the live room, run in and check everything! If you don't see any problems, I like to check how their headphones are mixed, and memorize it. This way, if I work with them again, I will know that the vocalist likes only drums and himself in his cans or something.

1327295458.0,30,self.audioengineering,osh7s,Question from a civilian: just went to third show in a row where the sound sucked because the onstage guitar/bass amps were TOO !@#$ LOUD for the (small) venue. Are the local house sound guys just wimps or is there some sort of rule that says YOU can't touch their levels?,japaneseknotweed,39,9,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/osh7s/question_from_a_civilian_just_went_to_third_show/,"Honestly, guys, what gives? 
Sorry this is long, but it's been building a long time. 

I keep going to shows by well-reviewed indie groups known for edgy/rootsy instrumentals, tight vocals and creative lyrics where I end up working hard all night to catch the words and only get one out of ten.  
I go home pissed and tired from the sheer effort of trying to hear the music through the noise.

I live in a semi-rural but intellectual/artsy/funky area.  
The audiences are small but loyal, educated, and discriminating. 
The venues are also small -- converted churches, old mill buildings. Lots of pressed tin ceilings, tall windows, parallel walls, and never enough money to buy adequate pipe-and-drape. Bangy as hell and easily overloaded. The kind of places Old Crow Medicine Show or Grace Potter started out.

The house sound people are excellent, but also mostly low-key, humble guys with separate day jobs.

I'm a musician too so I know most of them; I've been asking ""what gives?"" after the bad shows and the answer is always the same: they point to the onstage amps, or the drummer's crash cymbal, and shrug.

These are guys who know their venues, and since they're usually the producers too, they know the audience. They're busting their butts with everything from press releases to bathroom cleaning, and it's their name on the lease.

So why don't they get to decide the onstage amp levels? Tell the band ""*this* is where you want to set them for this house, this crowd."" And maybe even suggest to the drummer that he switch to, I dunno, brushes instead of baseball-bat-gauge sticks? 

I play violin. In a symphony, the conductor is upfront, monitors the overall mix, and if he tells the horns to back off they damn well have to back off.

I also play oldtime fiddle, and when I'm soundchecking with my band at a big festival we always play a few tunes with just the house speakers up, give our ears/brains a chance to suss out the room, learn to hear each other through the background wash *before* we start playing escalation games with the monitors. The bass player sets his amp close and checks with all of us, sound guy included, to make sure it's not screwing up the balance.

Why isn't it this way in a cabaret/club venue? You're the ones whose reputations are on the line if the final mix sucks, why aren't you allowed to tell the band the truth/reality?

**tl;dr: the sound guys around here never tell the touring bands that their onstage amps are too loud for the venue. Are they too nice? Or is it a country/city thing? Or is there an unspoken industry-wide code, some sort of caste system, that says you can't do that?**",,False,,t5_2qkby,False,,,True,t3_osh7s,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/osh7s/question_from_a_civilian_just_went_to_third_show/,

Here's a few things that might help (and hopefully reduce the amount of repeat threads). All of this can also be used for those of you who are recording tutorial videos for other programs. For using screen capture software and recording the output of Pro Tools or LIVE or any other DAW that uses ASIO drivers, this can be a bit more complicated. I can explain further how to do it properly, if you need me to - just ask in the comments.

The following refers to PC. The same concepts will apply to mac users, but I can't offer specifics on any mac-specific programs since my mac is strictly a Reddit and SNES machine... But whenever I say ""Pro Tools"" you can safely assume that Logic Pro can do the same thing. Also, you mac users can probably do the majority of the back end of this stuff with iMovie.

_

**Q: What should I record the video with?**

**A:** FRAPS. Period. Buy it, it can record both audio and video from the game.

_

**Q: What about my commentary? I have X mic and Y interface.**

**A:** Whatever you have will probably do, just make sure your interface has its own drivers - otherwise this might conflict with recording game audio. This is one of the many areas in which USB microphones are not suitable. The best price-to-performance ratio right now is to buy a [Focusrite 2i2 interface ($109)](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/822508-REG/Focusrite_SCARLETT_2I2_USB_Scarlett_2i2_Portable.html) and a [SM58 microphone ($104)](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/68464-REG/Shure_SM58S_SM58S_Cardioid_Dynamic.html).

_

**Q: How do I record my voice over the video?**

**A:** There are a few ways. One way is to set FRAPS to record an external input. Go to the Movie tab and tick the ""record from external input"" box. Then select your interface from the menu. The other way is to record the daw into a DAW, either while the movie is recording, or later on as a voiceover.

_

**Q: Why is my commentary panned to the far left or right?**

**A:** Windows is probably interpreting your interface's microphone input as part of a stereo pair. What you can do to fix this:

* The easiest way is to set your audio to mono when you transcode (see the question about transcoding below).
* another easy way is to use a video editor or DAW to open the video, and delete the audio track that does not contain your voice (if your voice is only in the left, simply delete the right track and pan the left to center)
* Another way is to record your commentary later into a DAW. You'll have control over panning, instead of having Windows use default panning for your interface (see the question about voiceover below)
* The third option: if you would rather do live commentry, then you need to run an identical signal into the first two channels of your interface. This is easy with an external preamp, for example the [ART Tube MP](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/TubeMP/) is $39, and has two outputs. Both can be used simultaneously. Simply connect one output to your interface's first line input, the other preamp output to the interface's second line input. Now your vocals are centered.

_

**Q: You mentioned recording the commentary into a DAW, what did you mean? Can I do this live?**

**A:** You can actually record live into Audacity (free recording program) while you record your video, and then merge the audio and video later with a DAW or video editor. This saves you the hassle of having to deal with the problem of commentary only showing up on the left side. Once you bring the audio into your editor, simply line it up with the video. That's all you need to do. Since the program you are using controls pan (instead of Windows arbitrarily panning your channels) you have complete control of where you place your voice in the stereo field. Protip: always put the voiceover in the center.

**Q: What if I want to do voiceover, instead of live commentary. What now?**

**A:** Remember how we brought audio recorded with Audacity into our video editor? It's the same deal, only this time you can record directly into the editor while you watch the footage. It helps to make a script beforehand.

_

**Q: What are some good video editors that let me import audio to merge with the video?**

**A:** If you already have a DAW, you might already be able to do this. Pro Tools, Cubase, and Logic all can import and save video files. Most video editors can do this, such as Final Cut, Adobe Audition, Magix Movie Edit, Sony Music Studio, etc.


_

**Q: FRAPS splits my movies into pieces. What do I do?**

**A:** Combine them in your movie editor. They are timestamped, and they should import in order without any extra effort. If you don't have a video editor, just get VirtualDub (it's free) and import the first video. Use the ""Append AVI segment"" command to import each subsequent video segment. When you're done, you're ready to transcode the video and upload it.


_

**Q: Transcode? What's that?**

**A:** FRAPS records raw video. This takes up a huge amount of space - this is partly why it splits the files. Transcoding is the process of taking video and re-encoding it. In this case, we're going to compress it. To find out more about this stuff, look into the presets that FRAPS comes with. You'll want to probably go with H.264 compression, with the quality slider set fairly high. Same goes for any other video editor. For YouTube uploads, you want to use MP4 compressed with the H.264 codec, at anywhere from 25 to 30 frames per second (it's always good to either go with the same framerate you recorded with in FRAPS. However, if you recorded 60fps with FRAPS, transcode to 30 before uploading) and ALWAYS keep the audio at ""same quality"" or ""use original"".


_

**Q: Okay, so I get what transcoding is. Why do we do it?**

**A:** Transcoding with the H.264 codec can reduce your file size without much quality loss. It's a huge difference. Earlier today I converted 1.42GB of 1080p uncompressed FRAPS footage into a MP4 that only took 9.75 MB. My reduced file was still 1080p and still looked great. You absolutely need to transcode before uploading.

_




**Q: What do *you* use to do this stuff?**




**A:** I record footage of different things (Reason and Pro Tools usually, sometimes games) and my voice live, by using FRAPS ""record external input"" and my microphone. I have an external preamp with two outputs, going to my interface's channels 1 and 2 (we discussed this method above). If I ever need to change something or re-do some of my commentary, I import the video into Pro Tools, edit the audio and re-record voice as necessary, and then export the audio as a WAV file. Finally I use VirtualDub to join the segments with the ""append AVI segment"" command, use the ""replace audio"" command to select my newly recorded WAV file, and finally transcode with the settings I mentioned in this post. Then I upload to YouTube or Vimeo.


_

**Q: What if I want to record footage that isn't a video game?**

**A:** Usually FRAPS only records DirectX or OpenGL video. FRAPS has the option of ""Monitor Aero Desktop (DWM)"", which allows it to record things that are not DX rendered - for example, your desktop or DAW. Go to the General pane to enable this. Now FRAPS will record whatever video is showing on your monitor, regardless of whether it uses DirectX or OpenGL. Once this has been done, you're free to record as above - with one caveat.
* Chances are, you are using an ASIO driver with your DAW. FRAPS will not record ASIO streams, so you must use your interface outputs or an external mixer to run the stereo output of your DAW into the stereo line input of your computer's built-in line inputs. Since your motherboard's audio device is classified as a WDM device, FRAPS can capture it.
_


**Q: This all seems really complicated. How can I make it more streamlined?**




**A:** It's only complicated on paper. As long as you have some notes to refer to, you'll be alright. Some of you are hoping to be a popular YouTube gaming personality, some of you just want to have fun and learn a little bit about recording and editing. Just keep practicing, and keep in mind that the guys from major gaming channels on YouTube have a lot of experience and know-how, and they sometimes have a production team to handle this stuff for them. Just keep at it, follow tutorials, and stay on top of your audio knowledge.

_

**Q: I have a question that has not been answered, what's up?**

**A:** comment below. I'm not an expert on this stuff, but in the process of making my own DAW tutorial videos (which are pretty much the same as ""Let's Play"" videos) I have figured out some solutions to common problems.

How much do people charge?,Retoucherny,28,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1cgq9m/im_starting_to_get_approached_about_producing/,"I've been producing and engineering an increasingly popular podcast with a friend for almost 6 months, and while I have a relationship with his employer about costs, I've been approached by several other people about doing shows with them.  

I'm wondering how much individuals are charging for these kind of services.  I'm in NYC, and I do think to some extent that might affect pricing, but really, I'm trying to figure out what a fair rate or pay schedule would be.  My first podcast is a specialized ""cuz"" rate, and the second I have 25% ownership of, but if I was just ""charging"" someone for work, how much is fair?

I am a good producer, and adequate engineer. My skills lie in helping people figure out and format their shows, and then getting the shows edited and sounding good for a podcast.  

As for equipment, its decent grade amateur gear, a rMBP, a few decent mics, an MBOX2 Pro, a Duet, PT10 and enough plugins to make things sound as good as they need to.  My setup is pretty mobile.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!

EDIT: My gut is to charge by the show for at least the first customer or so, especially considering the first is a small business viewing this as a marketing opportunity.  Maybe $200-$300 for a 20-40 minute monthly show.  This would be with an hourly cap, so if he went crazy with changes I had some pushback leverage.

But I've hit a brick wall and nobody I talk to in person seems to speak the language of old tape recorders.  I'm a (US-born) historian of South Africa who works on the old kingdoms of the far north and I'm kind of stuck for how to proceed.

The situation is this: we have a clutch of invaluable tapes of oral history from South Africa, taken in the 1960s and 1970s on several hundred reels of 4-track tape (5-inch) using an Akai X-V crossfield 4-speed recorder.   We want to have the tapes transcribed or digitized before the knowledge on them is lost for good.  

I lucked into an Akai X-IV via ebay, which would be satisfactory, but its power supply is borked and I'm not even sure the unit really works.  We also don't know the speed that was used, and honestly I have no idea what the complications could be of trying to use a different brand of recorder or player beyond that.  My search for another X-IV or X-V has produced nothing else for over a year.

So my question is this: can anyone help my quest for recommendations of other brands or models of player/recorder that can handle 5"" reels, 4-track, in the same range of speeds?  They need not be 50 years old, provided they'll do the job.  The only catch is that it can't be a big console unit--I have to take this in luggage to SA from the US, and the portable ones are pretty universally global in voltage whereas the consoles are hit or miss on that point.  If needed I can provide more information based on the X-IV I have here (re: range of speeds, any physical indicators of recording method, etc).

In any case, thank you for considering this question, and if it bears fruit you'll have helped to preserve the royal history of one of South Africa's great houses.",,False,,t5_2qkby,False,,,True,t3_17c5lr,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/17c5lr/a_vital_record_of_oral_history_in_africa_needs/,

As far as field/nature/film stuff goes, I can see a need for left and right channels to be as close together as possible for accurate recordings.

As far as making musical recordings go, I don't get it. First of all, what microphone manufacturer can guarantee a close enough tolerance of all the microphones coming off their line? How much of a difference is their going to be between microphones of similar serial numbers? Have we been being fooled this entire time? 

Second of all, can we really hear these minuscule changes? Our ears are not 'matched pairs'... the rooms our recordings will be played by consumers in are not symmetrical (however much we want them to be).

Do we even want to record exactly in roper stereo? Is it possible? Let's take drum overheads as an example... On one side, we have the hihats, very high frequency, and on the other, low toms, and a very harmonic rich cymbal... It does not seem to matter much about how 'matched' our mics are, as we are clearly miking two very different instruments here. I started experimenting with using two different microphones, and then two different microphone types for my overheads... I find a ribbon on the HH side, and an LDC on the ride side work great together. Should have seen my school trained assistant freak out at that one haha. 

As for stereo room mics, do we really want them to be matched again? If everything were 100% matched here, our stereo effect would be gone, and we would just be working in mono again. Not that you will ever get a 100% symmetrical room to work with anyways.

When I was playing around with positioning with tom mics, I've found that when miking more towards the edge of the drum with the capsule perpendicular to the drum head, I get MORE attack and less tone from the drum. Everything that I've read or was told would suggest that this position would give more tone and less of the attack of the drum. Likewise, when I mic more aimed towards the center of the drum with the capsule at 70 degree angle to the drum head,  I got MORE tone and less attack - the complete opposite of everything I've been told.

When miking up my kick, I've noticed that the more that I put the mic into the soundhole and close to the beater, the less attack and more resonance I get out of the drum. Typical miking conventions suggest otherwise. I also found that when I kept the mic poking into the soundhole only by an inch or two that the attack was more pronounced and the boominess and resonant frequencies in the 60-80hz range were dramatically reduced. I feel like everything I've learned is a lie.

...**What's going on here?!** 

Am I the only one with these results? I've been a drummer for many years so I know the instrument like the back of my hand and even these results surprise me. It would make sense that the closer the mic is to where the stick/beater impacts the drum head, the more attack and less sustain you would get, but I've been getting the complete opposite results. And my drums sound damn good, so there is nothing out of the ordinary here. Signal path is clean and unobstructed. Mic straight into the interface, straight into Pro Tools. 

I know that in the end, it's all about just going with what sounds best and not necessarily using set rules and mic positioning dogma, but why has everything that I've done been the EXACT opposite of what I've been taught?

For those of you lucky enough to work on analog consoles on a regular basis, have you ever come across this feature? Does it exist anywhere in a DAW? Honestly, I think it would be a super useful feature to have, especially for those first starting to learn how to mix, to avoid the tendency to EQ everything while solo'd. 


&gt;As another horrifically tangential side note: When I work on analog mixing desks, one of my favorite modes to work in is ""Solo in Front"", a mode offered on a coupla of the bigger frame desks that allows you to solo a track(or tracks) AGAINST a user controlled backdrop of the total mix.


&gt;So, fer instance you can take an instrument in 'solo' and with the sweep of one dial, MOVE it's VOLUME positioning anywhere from ""All I hear is the soloed instrument"" to ""All I hear is the soloed instrument in it's normal volume relationship to the SUMMATED MIX""... It's pretty fucking handy and it saves a lotta time...

I have some questions.

* What's the run-through of your day? From chalking to tear-down?
* How much of a systems tech do you need to be to just rock FOH? Do I need to learn as much about every line array, amp and crossover as I think I do?
* What goes into line-array selection and positioning?
* I've never used SMAART. Should I learn it? Any courses recommended on taking?
* I always see the 'big boys' mixing with their gain structure. I've asked plenty of engineers why they do it but can't seem to get a straight answer. The best answer I've gotten was that it's a noise:signal ratio, but the rest just say its an OCD thing with the faders. They ""like the way it looks"". I'm having a hard time grasping the concept of not hitting the pre-amps at 1 or 2 yellows like they were designed to be hit, especially on analog consoles. I almost get scoffed at when my faders are all over the place. Is it a headroom thing?
- Is it absolutely imperative to tune a room with white/pink?
- When someone says the room is ""EQ'ed in the processing"", what does that mean? How does it work?

And anything else you think I'm missing. I'd like to think I can do FOH for a headliner that size, but I feel like I'm missing some steps. I know it's a little more than tossing your iPod through the PA and carving out the room with a 31-band.

&gt;Context first - the original question ... 

----------------------

As we can see, the original post - to this, the Low End Theory forum, asks ""do some preamps add a significant and noticeable improvement to the sound? Or are the differences ""too subtle...""?""

-----------------------

&gt;Now my post from October 2010 ....

&gt;My quick answer (with exposition to follow) - in the context Low End Theory engineers and musicians find themselves in, preamps do not add a significant and noticeable improvement. The differences are far too subtle when, in the words of SOS Magazine - ""...there are bigger hurdles to overcome than choosing between preamps. What might those bigger hurdles be? 

&gt;In my opinion, the biggest hurdle facing musicians and recordists is an Alchemical hurdle - the challenge of conveying and eliciting emotions through the use of electro-acoustical tools. Everything I'm about to say follows from this belief - the primary goal and challenge of the musician / engineer is to be an Alchemist of sound. 

&gt;An Alchemist of sound is one who can transmute seemingly inert tools and materials into metaphysically active conduits of Intention in order to deliver or elicit, via remote sound waves, emotions to or in a listener. 

&gt;Some tools, by their inherent nature are more easily imbued with Intention than others and thus are more effectively transmuted into tools that can carry or impart emotions. Microphones, by dint of their essential metaphysical nature as Energy Transformers are tools that are much more amenable to the application of Intention than are preamps. Lets look at both tools briefly...

&gt;...a microphone is an Energy Transformer - it responds to sound energy and transforms this into electrical energy. Energy transformation is by definition Alchemical. Note that we, as musicians and engineers, share with microphones an innate ability to transform energy from one form to another. For example, the energy expended by our muscles acts (kinetic energy) upon stretched strings (stored potential energy) to produce sound (acoustical wave particle energy) from a guitar. 

&gt;A preamplifier on the other hand is a an energy amplification device. It does not transmute energy from one form to another - it only makes stronger the particular energy form presented to its input. 

&gt;Because of the complexities and inefficiencies inherent in the energy transformation process (impedance matching one energy system to another and non-linear energy losses in the process are two examples) these energy conversion tools offer users both profound and subtle access paths to, and control over, the energy transformation process. They allow our Intention to be impressed upon the energy transformation process and thus convey or elicit emotions. To say this another way, a microphone is intimately responsive to users who approach it mindfully and with Intent. The microphone becomes a living partner in the selective transformation of energy under the direction of the musician / engineer. How is this partnership played out?

&gt;Because a recording microphone operates in three dimensional acoustic space, the transformation of sound energy into electrical energy is subject to a near-infinite number sound pressure variables that arise from frequency and location-dependent standing waves and HF losses as a function of distance or source / transducer angular orientation. The musician / engineer operating with Free Will can choose to position the microphone anywhere within the three dimensional sound field of the acoustical source and thus inscribe Intention upon the energy transformation process - modulate the conversion process with Emotional Intelligence in other words. 

&gt;A preamp on the other hand offers far more restricted user access to its fundamental operating parameters. One can operating the preamp in its distortion-free linear zone or choose to overdrive it. That's it. There is no way for the user of a preamp to affect the basic Alchemical properties of that preamp in a way to modulate its functioning and thus impress Intent. A preamplifier is largely unresponsive to user Intent. 

&gt;So given the context and budget restraints of Low End Theory practitioners - it seems much more prudent to allocate resources - time and money - to the tools that offer the greatest return on investment and which most affectively allow the musician / engineer to be more fully engaged in the magical processes of conveying and eliciting emotion. 

&gt;To my mind, a microphone, because it resonates with our own being (like us, it is an energy transformer), and because of the near-infinite possibilities inherent in its usage, is a far more important tool to the sound Alchemist than a preamp, which has far more restricted Alchemical possibilities when one is trying to make sound magic.
 
&gt;Thanks for reading!
 
&gt;best, Michael



If you don't know his microphones, go to his website and check them out, fantastic bang for your buck, and he and his wife give wonderful customer service.  There are tons of other boutique mic manufacturers/modders out there that offer an amazing quality product that give microphones 3-4x their price a run for their money - don't get sold on name and start adding the right tools to your toolbox.

Most of my typical strong peaks are hitting around -3db.  The loudest parts are typically getting less than 1db of reduction from the limiter.  Compression has been used sparingly on most instruments, with the exception of vocals and bass.  There is a lot of empty, blank space in the final waveform. You can easily point out the snare hits! :)

I love the sound i am getting with the expanded dynamics and have no intention of changing it despite any potential pitfalls that may exist. However, I feel like I need to warn my listeners that they are NOT about to get hit with a 40 foot wall of noise and that, yes, it is supposed to sound like that. If fact, most music should sound like that!

I sent a request to turnmeup.org to get their logo art for my album cover, but I think they aren't as active as they once were.

Most of my stuff is a lighter rock genre, btw.

Anyone here have experience releasing a ""quiet"" album in the modern era?  How did that turn out?

I'm looking for advice from other engineers/producers who've been around the block a couple of times, or indeed anyone who can help.

I've been working successfully as a tracking and mix engineer in nice big studios for about or 9 or 10 years now doing good work. Records I've done have been nominated for the highest prize you can get in my country...but i think i might be burned out. Ready to give it all up. 

The main problem is I'm incredibly hard on myself. I know this is a psychological thing but i kinda feel like its what makes me good at my job. I'm almost never ever satisfied with a mix in the moment im doing it. But because I work in expensive rooms. I mix to whatever budget the client has. Alot of the time I'll print a mix on a big analog board with tonnes of outboard, no hope of recall and think that probably ""this mix sucks"" Most of the time I'm pleasantly surprised a few days later when i get the guts to listen back at home and it doesn't suck, sometimes i even fall in love with these mixes, but in the moment of committing to a mix i can't just save and come back to I almost never like them. I truly convince myself my mix sucks. The only reason i finnish is because of budget or i legitimately can't find anything else to do to the track to make it more impressive. I know that that's a common place to know you've finnished. But my problem is I DONT LIKE THE MIX IN THAT MOMENT....almost EVER. It makes me very anxious and maintaining good bedside manner and inspiring confidence in my clients while im not convinced about my own work has put a lot of stress on me. Also how can my perspective as a Mixer be so skewed to the negative in the most crucial moment of a mix? Committing.

Consecutive 12 to 16 hour days have kinda got me beat. I've been trying to keep em to 10 hours tops but it's hard sometimes.

I hate extensive editing, drum manipulation and vocal tuning and hate that culturally some of the issue of performance has shifted to being a large part of my responsibility on a technical level. (i have no problems producing parts and insisting they actually be played) It seems to me to be something that is very bad for musicianship in general and it makes me hate my job...the best job in the world.(also i find them tedious - not so bad when i have someone else to do that stuff for me)

I recently took a student job at my university in audio preservation and I have no idea what I am doing. I don't have a background in audio preservation, or anything related, which I made clear, but am interested in it. I'm pretty much staring from scratch. My boss sent me several resources and suggested reading, and I've been through all of it multiple times trying to get a grasp on what I'm doing. 

It's like this whole new world has been dropped on me to explore, which is exciting, but scary without guidance. I'm not even sure where to start. Basically I need to transfer a vast array of media from analog formats to digital formats as cleanly as possible, making adjustments to the audio as necessary. 

I understand that there's specific protocols that must be followed like ASRC and IASA guidelines. I just need some guidance or some understandable resources that aren't too incredibly technical, until I can figure out how to navigate all of this. 

I don't even know the first thing about threading a reel-to-reel player, let alone adjustments and such, or how to operate the DAW software (we use Steinberg's Wavelab 8), or how to set up all of this equipment. 

I've been wandering around this subreddit for a while, and it seems as though you all are quite knowledgeable. Hopefully you'll be able to lend a helpful hand to someone struggling to get a grasp on all of this.

I just want to do the best work I can, but I need the knowledge to do that, and so far it has just been incredibly overwhelming.

So the dude says to my mate he can buy the gear for £8k and then rent the premise from him for £100 a week. The problem being he can't afford that, so he turns to me and our other friend (Simon) to ask if we want to be partners and run the business. The studio is already making money as a rehearsal space but is virtually unknown as a recording studio, so we'd like to build on both sides of the business as well as me offering guitar tuition.

So we create a business plan and start talking finances and at the moment the rehearsal room does 22 hours a week and is covering costs, we hope to push it to 40 hours which my friend assures me if we achieve this we can each take a part-time wage from it. 

In a sense it sounds too good to be true, I don't know.. I feel that having me there as well is just a bit of an overkill, there's only one jam space and one studio. Plus I've gotta figure out if it's worth me dishing out just shy of 3 grand, might be worth mentioning my age I'm 21.

I also know I can't pretend to have every instrument all the time, to make instruments that share frequencies sound well (What does that mean?) together before adding them to the main mix...

Here is a sample: https://soundcloud.com/ejvs_nl/pijn-drums-only-sample-glyn

I used the Glyn Johns method for recording this (2x OH, 1x snare, 1x kick). I recorded this on a Boss BR-1600 unit. I used 2x Samson C02-s for OH, a Shure SM57 for snare and a Sennheiser E902 for kick.
The sample is before editing, with just some quick mixing.

There is quite a lot of bleed from the guide vocals and guide guitar, since we recorded this on a shoestring budget in the practiceroom (i.e.: all instruments in the same room; all audio sources were pointed away from the drum &amp; dampened as much as possible without becoming impractical)

I plan to use two SM81 condensers as drum overheads with phantom power on, but I hoped to simultaneously record bass drum and snare with SM57's without the phantom power. 

This is surely a very silly question, but with the health of my gear at stake I want to be sure. Is the manual saying that you can't record phantom powered mics AND non-phantom powered mics at the same time?  Or, is it just saying to have the phantom power off while I'm actually plugging the non-phantom powered mics in?  It seems awfully strange that it would be all or nothing, but that seems to be what I'm reading.  I'm wondering if I should just use adapters rather than the Roland's on board phantom power.

I have a really good problem right now and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I know a lot of you are really experienced engineers and can maybe shed some light on the situation.

I graduated college back in August of last year. After college I applied for tons of internships. I ended up hearing back from one of them in Nashville so I packed up my things and moved on out there. I had been interning there for about 6 months and it was about time for me to leave (6 month internship program). Upon leaving, I decided that since I had been helping out so much around the studio ( many 2nd engineering positions) that it wouldn't hurt to ask the owner for a job. When I called him up, he didn't even hesitate. He was more then happy to bring me on as a paid apprentice. Now that being said, he decided to keep me on a retainer of 800 a month and I'm there about 60 hours a week. It's not great, I know, but I feel like I'm still learning a lot there, for I have been assisting on almost every session that comes in. 

Ok, so rewind back towards the end of my internship. I had been applying for other industry entry level jobs to move on to from the internship, one of those being live sound on a cruise ship. Turns out, the ship is hiring and it does pay very well (about 2400 a month), however I probably would not be getting as much experience as I am now. 

I'm really not sure what to do. I'm young right now and money isn't that tight, for I have a good weekend job valet parking downtown. I know a lot of you will ask which field I'm more passionate about, and honestly I really don't know. I really enjoy both live, and studio work.

**Which master do you prefer? Why? Which do you think is the high-end mastered version, and which do you think is the home version?**

Note: These are NOT subtle differences...!

---

**UPDATE**: Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Here's the full info.

The album is [""Identity Sequence""](http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/identity-sequence), which I released at the very end of 2012 - a project that took me five years and a Kickstarter to finally bring to life in physical (and digital) form. Normally I mix and master my own music, but this time around I hired engineer [John Rodd](http://johnrodd.com/) to do the mastering (a KS stretch goal). 

Version A was my own master.

Version B was John's.

Some interesting things to note:

* The self-mastered version was created as I mixed and produced the album. This is how I normally work, though given the long timespan of the project I never took the time to cohesively self-master since I knew it was going to a pro at the end!

* I mix and master everything on Beyerdynamic DT880 headphones. No monitors. I actually think these are excellent references and I can clearly hear all the differences between my original master and John's version. 

* My fans greatly preferred my own master (A) to John's (B), which is a very stark contrast to the responses here.

* John and I talked about how he would approach the mastering - we both agreed on a softer dynamic with more punch. I'm ultimately very happy with what he did because given the nature of the music, having that slightly softer dynamic and marked scoop in the low-mid goes a long way toward preventing fatigue.

* Since the album came out, especially since I've heard the pro mastered version and picked up some new tools, I think my own self-master would be a great deal better now and much closer to John's version. If I had to change anything with his, looking back, I actually think he dampened the highs a bit too much and added a little too much extra compression. If you look at an analysis of both WAVs you will see that his version has a marked decrease in the very high end 'shimmer' compared to my version. I personally miss that despite the increased clarity in the 8-10khz range.

I am much more of a studio and film location guy and I'm used to a more controlled environment, so I guess what I'm asking is if there's any way to avoid this without coming off like a dick? I have considered pulling singers aside and saying ""try not to point your mic at the monitors, it causes feedback,"" but I have no idea how I can put that nicely.

I think most often it probably just happens without them even thinking about it because they're energized and into the performance, which is cool and necessary if they're gonna put on a good show. 

But on the other hand, it's really frustrating seeing these fans who shoot me nasty looks when there's really not a whole lot I can do about it, and they obviously don't realize that. Sure, I can pull the level down or try to EQ it, but you can't just leave that the way it is, especially if you don't really know what comes next in the song. I don't want to pull his mic down to kill the feedback only to have him come up into the next phrase too quickly for me to bring it back to where it was. I don't want to drop the monitors down as feedback control only to have the crowd be unable to hear the singer (or the singer being unable to hear himself) over the drums and guitar/bass amps. Granted, if they bitch about not being able to hear themselves I can always say ""don't point your mic at the monitors and I don't have to cut them,"" but again, how do I say that without sounding like a total prick?

I'm trying to expand and get my confidence up to the point where I can BS with musicians in between sets and get a clientele going, so it feels like a balancing act between having to be a dick sometimes and being nice enough that they'll respect you.

I'm running a Mac Mini (2.6GHz quad-core, 16GB ram, Mountain Lion, Pro Tools 10), and need a new audio interface for home use. I do mostly post production, and not too much recording. So it's mostly just for an output, but I like having the option to record stuff if I need to (a rough VO, some foley, or quick ADR). I also do a little bit of music recording for fun, so I like having more inputs.

I really like the look of the AKAI EIE Pro, love the meters, and I'm actually a huge fan of AKAI products (especially love the MPC, which I still use from time to time). However, I've been reading some mixed reviews. I see a lot of people love the unit, but some people are experiencing noise with the phantom power on, and random ""hits"" of white noise while recording/playback, and sometimes the noise won't go away until you restart the unit. Also, I've read a few problems with running 24 bit and 96kHz.

I was wondering if anybody still uses this unit, and if you have the updated drivers and firmware, and if you still experience (or have experienced ever) these random white noise hits and phantom power noise, or any other problems. The reviews I've been seeing are quite old, and I'm hoping the new firmware and drivers solves these annoying problems.

On that note, if anybody can recommend a good interface, feel free to chime in. Again, I'm not much into recording, but having 4 XLR/1/4"" inputs to record with if choose to is a pretty good selling point. I'd rather have 4 I/O than just 2. It's also got MIDI (to sync with my MPC), VU meters, and a sleek look to it.

This is going pretty well, except I've noticed that pretty all my music sounds 'flat'. It's hard to define the layers and I when I compare it to 'professional' music I believe my 'mixes' lack a bit of width.

I'm very inexperienced, only know a few basic things about Gain, EQ, Compressing and Limiting, so I'd love to have some pointers on what I should learn/try the next time I'm doing this, or even better: some pointers about what I've done 'wrong' in the provided examples.

Here are some examples of my work. I'm sure there are lot's of things I can improve, so any help is appreciated!

As I am getting ready to set up my first home studio I am looking at the computer to run my DAW on. I have a medium to high-end home computer. However I would rather have this computer in a different room. So I've decided to get myself a laptop to run my DAW on and use for anything else recording-related. But I have no clue what processing power the laptop would need. I would be running either Sonar or Reaper (I haven't decided yet, which is a different story altogether).

**TL;DR: What kind of processing power would a laptop need to run DAW's?**

**Edit 1:**
Thanks veryone for the very informative replies! A sea of information with which I can most definitely work! I already posted this as a reply to someone earlier today, but I figured I'd edit my last couple of questions in to reach everybody:

Another couple of questions. If you could answer them I would quite appreciate it.
 1.7200 rpm is a must or could I go with 5400 rpm for my second drive?
 2.Finding a laptop with a Firewire connection (for both an audio interface which I already own which is both FW and USB compatible) is quite tough. USB 3.0 is truly good enough?
 3.Could you take a look at a couple of examples I have been looking at?
 •Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 (I am also looking at the other laptops in this series, but they are all very similar, mostly difference in how large the SSD is): http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ideapad/y-series/y580/
 
This is mostly a gaming laptop, but it has both a 32 to 64GB SSD and a 1TB HDD (the only problem is that the HDD is 5400 RPM). It seems like a good option except for the 5400 RPM of the HDD.
 •Lenovo Thinkpad Twist S230u: http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=37&amp;Code=TWIST_BETTER_SAP&amp;category_id=FA4F841D9789D55CA8028C8C3A1EC325
 
This page doesn't show the SSD, but I've found it in a Dutch shop with 24 gb SSD on top of the HDD. The main issue with this laptop is that it only has 4 GB RAM.
 •Lenovo ThinkPad Edge S430: http://shop.lenovo.com/gbweb/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-edge/s430
 
Same as above but with upgradable RAM so I can get it up to 8GB.

Now, I must say these are all quite high-end and would cost me quite a penny. My sessions won't be particularly large at my starting point (about 6 tracks at a time tops) but I want to be able to grow and not have to upgrade in 2 years. Considering this, would I still need something this high-end or could I go for a lower price-range (these are all around the $1000 mark, lower price-range would drop to about $750)?

The pastor is super sensitive of his monitor sound when he's speaking. It seems as though there are seasons where the pastor is really happy with his monitors and the main pa in general, and then there are times when he's just not happy no matter what I try. 

Today I had to bring his wedges up so hot it was causing phasing with his headset and was on the verge of feedback. He said afterwards that he couldn't hear himself, and that he felt like he heard his voice ""bouncing"" around.

Today was hot and very humid due to heavy rain yesterday. There are more storm systems moving in so the air preassure is likely high as well. The maintenance guys don't turn on the AC untill Sunday morning for some reason as well so it was a little warm and humid in the room as well. 

we tend to get some slap back in the room and it seems like it changes with temperature/humidity conditions. Is this true/possible to have audible changes in room characteristics with changes in weather? if so, are there any good articles I can read that explain/support this? 

tl;dr Is it physically possible for changes in weather (temperature/humidity/barometric preassure) to affect acoustics to an audible degree?

I will be using this for monitoring and may try to return it if I can get this project wrapped up in a few days.  I may keep it if it ends proving itself useful; I track onto hard disc recorders/ADAT and then dump the files into my DAW.  If whatever box I get will work with CEP 2.1 and Reaper and it records okay, I will probably keep it just to do a quick track here or there and for other computer-audio stuff (Google Voice, my podcast, etc).  

I'm thinking the ART just because it has a bass roll-off, Phase and Compressor(!?) settings but if it sounds anything like a stock Tube MP then forget it.  

Anyone?  Or just go with whatever is cheapest and deal with it until I get my Saffire...

I tried uninstalling the audio card and using the speaker-out jack on the motherboard, 3.5mm to Y-cable to TRS but being unbalanced, there is way too much interference.  


EDIT: Went with the 2i2, I've never installed everything so quick; had it up and running within three minutes!  Even the GC dude steered me away from the ART; for my purposes (monitoring) it works just fine.  The headphone amp is more than loud enough as well.  $130 on sale at GC, I'll be keeping it if the pre's aren't too colored... hell, I'll be keeping it anyways just as a monitor box if nothing else!

I work as an audio engineer for a medium sized production company. I entered around November as an assistant. About a month ago, due to unprofessionalism, the chief engineer was fired. The owner of the company decided to keep me on. I basically rebuilt the studio from nothing. I had an extremely low budget and I'm proud to have it functioning again. So a couple weeks go by and I'm being paid minimum wage. We were under the agreement that we would discuss payment after my first solo job. Think of it as a probation period to make sure I knew what I was doing. After struggling the last 5 years working the most soul-crushing retail job, I didn't care it was minimum wage with the promise of salary soon.

So, to the present. I've done a couple jobs. I can't get the owner to sit with me for more than 5 minutes and I feel like he is avoiding me. I can't afford this job anymore. You may be wondering why I just don't up and leave. Well, it's complicated. I have a baby coming in a couple of weeks and can't up and leave, I need the income regardless of how little it is. My wife and I make enough money to get by but it is not cutting it anymore. And there are no jobs around. It's a wonder how I even fell into this position.

My question: What would an audio engineer like yourself do in my position? What do I say if the owner lowballs me? 

I'm just tired of life lately. My life is a continuous struggle and I'm tired of it. All I want is a job that pays decent. Seriously, I would be the greatest addition to any company if they gave me a chance. Every job in the industry has screwed me over in some form or another.

Will things get better eventually? Or should I just suck it up and become a damn factory worker and hate the rest of my life? Honestly, I'm all over in this post. Sorry, and good day.

**Edit** - I should mention a couple of things I left out. I'm not in the music industry. I do a lot of voice over work and I even edit video. This isn't a situation I can't handle, I've worked/interned at other places as well. I guess what I'm saying is . . .I know what I'm doing.

* They would generate a frequency and you would guess from four choices they gave you.
* They would play a recorded rhythm/melody line, then the same line with a certain frequency cut/boosted and you were supposed to guess which it was.
* They would play pink or white noise, then the noise again with a frequency cut/boosted and you would guess which it was.

As a drummer myself it's always felt natural to mix from the drummers perspective.

EDIT: Should have stipulated that I was referring to a studio setting, however it's interesting how people mix differently for certain situations. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qkby,1370546988.0,,,True,t3_1fs2sy,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1fs2sy/mixing_drums_perspective/,
1370374914.0,20,self.audioengineering,1fo6up,"After yesterday's ""No stupid questions"" thread, I felt obliged to share the results of some dither experiments.",Duckarmada,26,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1fo6up/after_yesterdays_no_stupid_questions_thread_i/,"This experiment will allow you to hear the effects of truncation, with and without dither, more easily. Hopefully, this will give you a better idea of what you're actually doing and will help you make more conscious decisions during your processing. 

My steps:  
1) Start with a 32bit 44.1k test file from one of the Chesky Reference Discs.  
2) Turn the gain of the audio down -60dB.  
3) Change the bit-depth from 32bit to 16bit, no dither. Export.  
4) Follow the same steps above, but use Powr1, Powr2, Powr3, MBIT+ dither shapes before truncation.  
5) Reimport the resulting files.  
6) Normalize the files to 0dB.  
7) Listen to the results.  

**Note: All dithering was done with default settings. PowrX examples were done in WaveBurner and MBIT+ was done in Triumph.**

For additional listening, here are some examples with truncation and dither at normal volume ie. no negative gain change before dither/truncation.

Why do my bounced mixes sound different than they do, while they're being mixed?",bigbigtea,25,4,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1f9vqj/i_know_its_not_stupid_question_monday_but_i_need/,"So last night I finished working through a mix that I thought I was pretty happy with.  I referenced on two sets of monitors, high and low level, and everything seemed good.  I guess I should mention that I used logic for this track. 

I used Ozone on the master out, with a really subtle compression, and just a couple of minor adjustments. Instead of using the logic dithering though I used the loudness maximizer with it's dithering, and even that was very subtle. Like I said I was happy with the mix so didn't want to blow anything away with the mastering. Bit depth was set at 16 on the oZone loudness maximizer, and the bounce dialogue of Logic. 

Though the final track sounds not *as good* as it did in the session.  It tended to sound a little bit boomy in the low-mids. More so anyway than when I was mixing. I think this is the bit rate of 16?  What else do I need to check for?

Thanks guys!

**EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone. Great community for this sort of thing. I'll try and upload it tonight when I get back in, but I won't be able to get anything close to what the session sounded like because it's obviously in the session.  I'll at least be able to point out and say ""That's the boominess I was talking about.** ",,False,,t5_2qkby,1369852276.0,,,True,t3_1f9vqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1f9vqj/i_know_its_not_stupid_question_monday_but_i_need/,
