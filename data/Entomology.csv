Hey r/entomology,



Recently I did an [AMA](http://redd.it/n54v9) over on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) and several people asked me how they could get better at identifying insects in and around the home. One person in particular suggested I start a short class over on /r/UniversityofReddit to teach the basics of not only insect identification, but entomology in general. I've been thinking about it ever since and I wanted to run the idea by you guys, seeing as you're inherently the ones most interested in the subject. The idea is this: we would have a running series of presentations focusing on family-level identification and information, each one focusing on a different order of insect. At the end of each presentation, there would be a short sight ID ""quiz"" where we could go over the process of identifying the specimens we talked about. If there's enough people, I'd be willing to throw in a prize near the end for the highest scores!

I think it would be a great opportunity to get the community involved and try to make a positive impact (...and maybe lessen the number of ""IS THIS A BEDBUG?!?"" posts we get...)
The resources provided by /r/UniversityofReddit are quite substantial and would provide us with not only Mumble/Vent servers to for discussion, but personalized messaging systems to keep everyone informed and organized.


So what do you think? If you're interested or have any suggestions, lemme know down below!",,False,self,t5_2qygr,True,,,True,t3_ok7ds,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/ok7ds/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_university_of/,

She moved into our backyard... really just onto the back wall of our little rental townhouse... nearly a month ago, and never left.  She remained somewhere on that wall through the very noisy renovation of the patio area as well as a couple close encounters with our cat.  

It's been getting really cold outside, and I don't know much about insects so I had no idea what she was planning to do with herself come winter, but I figured nature knew what it was doing.  And I know it was nature's plan when I went outside Tuesday morning to find her looking quite dead, on her back, on the window sill where she fell... but I interfered.  I took her inside, put her in a large transparent tupperware container with a wad of wet paper towel, put my ""incubator"" in the sun shining through the sliding door and steamed her back to life.

My mother-in-law offered a small aquarium, which I cleaned out, laid some paper down, along with another wet wad of paper towel (I know I need to get a spray bottle), and a chunk of wood for...I don't know...climbing?...whittling if she gets bored?  I utterly failed to find any insects to feed her around the property, so I offered her a chunk of banana, which she LUNGED at, scaring the shit out of me.  Seems she's been restored to full vitality.  Yesterday night after a little reading I went to the pet store and bought some medium-sized crickets, dropped a couple into the enclosure, and saw a highly efficient killing machine at work.

At this point, I feel pretty confident about being able to take care of Zorak until nature catches up with her again.  This morning I dropped a few more crickets in and sat down at my desk to do desky things.  After awhile I looked up and saw that she hadn't moved from the top of the aquarium.  I hadn't nailed down how much she should be eating, so I figured maybe she just wasn't hungry.  But when I got up to take a closer look at her I saw what's keeping her... vomiting copious amounts of white foam from her ass.

A little more googling revealed that ""vomiting white foam from her ass"" is just mantidese for the beautiful miracle of childbirth.  SO now there's an egg wad in there too, and I have too many questions:

* I know this egg thing is supposed to survive the winter and hatch in the spring.  So what happens when there's no winter stage?  When is this thing going to hatch?

* Do they lay eggs even if they're not fertilized?  I ask because I've never seen a second mantis in the yard, and as far as I can tell she never left the yard.  How long ago could she have gotten knocked up?

* Am I feeding her okay?  The crickets are cheap, but how many, and does she need more than crickets and bananas?

* What should I do?

* JESUS MANTIS BABIES WHAT SHOULD I DO!?",,False,self,t5_2qygr,1352422460.0,,,True,t3_12vvmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/12vvmr/rescued_a_praying_mantis_now_i_think_i_might_be/,

I found this small-ish wasp on a window screen in central Michigan. I noticed an off color area behind the wing and captured it for a closer look. I suspected they were mites, I found a similar patch on a dead wasp a few weeks ago

1349860917.0,25,self.Entomology,118t8h,Let's talk about Jerusalem crickets.,Joseph_P_Brenner,27,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/118t8h/lets_talk_about_jerusalem_crickets/,"1. Jerusalem crickets are not found in Jerusalem.

2. According to the [Encyclopedia of Entomology](http://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2054&amp;lpg=PA2054&amp;dq=Stenopelmatidae+weissman+CAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWCjMwfMUS&amp;sig=LM7-A_YdYYfQFyCHflHQF_dfo7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iADgT9fZEais2gWNp8CoCg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stenopelmatidae%20weissman%20CAS&amp;f=false), Jerusalem crickets are a subfamily, not a family.  This means BugGuide assigned the common name to the wrong taxa.  Common names suck anyway.  Still not convinced?  Take a look at these [other subfamilies](http://anic.ento.csiro.au/insectfamilies/biota_details.aspx?OrderID=24892&amp;BiotaID=42646&amp;PageID=families) and note how they look **nothing** like the ""typical"" Jerusalem cricket.

3. According to [Species File Software](http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/Taxa.aspx?TaxonNameID=64245), there are 5 genera of Jerusalem crickets.  According to the [Encylopedia of Entomology](http://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2054&amp;lpg=PA2054&amp;dq=Stenopelmatidae+weissman+CAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWCjMwfMUS&amp;sig=LM7-A_YdYYfQFyCHflHQF_dfo7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iADgT9fZEais2gWNp8CoCg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stenopelmatidae%20weissman%20CAS&amp;f=false), only 4 exist in our region, namely, *Stenopelmatus*, *Ammopelmatus*, *Viscainopelmatus*, and *Stenopelmatopterus*.  For IDing purposes, if the stenopelmatid was found north of Mexico, it's almost always *Stenopelmatus*.  If the stenopelmatid was NOT found in the Kelso Dunes or in Point Conception, you can rule out *Ammopelmatus*.

4. It's probably best not to attempt a species ID with *Stenopelmatus*.  There are currently only 17 described species in North America, with 60+ more in the pipeline thanks to the work of Jerusalem cricket expert, Dr. David B. Weissman.  What this means is that many IDs found in current literature may actually represent a complex of species!

5. This just in: Somebody just submitted what may be the Internet's first ever photo of *Ammopelmatus* [here](http://bugguide.net/node/view/712551/bgpage)!

6. Does anyone know if [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/29845002@N02/3083881249) is a photo of *Viscainopelmatus davewerneri*?

7. Where can I find a photo of *Stenopelmatopterus*?

8. Where can I find a photo of *Macrelcana ungeri*?

9. Does anyone know how the heck does [one species live only in Eurasia](http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/editTaxon/Distribution/ShowDistribution.aspx?TaxonNameID=64245) while all other species live in North America?  That seems so random.

10. Look at [this madness](http://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2060&amp;lpg=PA2060&amp;dq=Stenopelmatidae+weissman+CAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWCjMwfMUS&amp;sig=LM7-A_YdYYfQFyCHflHQF_dfo7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iADgT9fZEais2gWNp8CoCg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stenopelmatidae%20weissman%20CAS&amp;f=false)!  Females at least some of the time engage in sexual cannibalism!

11. Stenopelmatids can draw blood with their huge, sharp mandibles.  Speaking from personal experience, they may even bite unprovoked.  My hypothesis is that invertebrates are so small that they don't recognize you as a much bigger animal, so opportunistic invertebrate carnivores may confuse you for ""edible matter.""  This happens rarely though, but adventive invertebrate biting does indeed occur, and have been a topic of scientific studies and papers (nothing conclusive yet though).

I'll keep this post up for posterity/hilarity

Yesterday I was driving through Indiana to pick up some things from my apartment in West Lafayette. Some time after I got there I needed to defecate, so I used the bathroom. Shortly after finishing up, I stood up to turn and flush when I saw something wriggling out of my feces and into the toilet water: a small insect, still alive. Alarmed, I captured it and took some pictures today. How did this get inside of me? I doubt it could have survived being eaten; could it have crawled in through the ""back entrance""? Will I soon die? /r/entomology, please help me!

**TL;DR**

* What I believe this insect to be: Termite, possibly soldier termite

* Where insect was found: West Lafayette, IN - in my toilet

* More pictures: http://imgur.com/a/KTXjf

* What I would like to know: **How the heck did I shit a termite?**

i was hoping i could get a bit of an insight into the working lives of entomologists.  at the moment im working as an accountant but am thinking of going back to university to study a zoology major with a focus on entomology.

1. what jobs do most graduates end up working in?
2. what is the salary like compared to the national average (here in australia its about 70,000 per annum i believe)
3. what do you do on a day to day basis? how is it different from what the common perception is of your work?
4. what qualities or 'type' of person would be well suited to a career in entomology?
5. what other fields can an entomologist work in?
6. can you recommend anything to help me gain a better insight?   i've tried applying to volunteer at the queensland museum, however it seems it is pretty competitive and i haven't heard back in 6 months.  i also tried a local wildlife park, but same thing, competitive and i didnt get short listed.

i would love to hear your advice.  im hoping to enrol for semester 1 of 2014.",,False,self,t5_2qygr,False,,,True,t3_1buj6d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/1buj6d/studying_entomology/,

It's breaking my heart when he's not getting anything.  

Basically, we just put a glass jar in the ground (he put dirt in it because he didn't want something to fall in and get hurt)  We made a T kind of shape with a big gap in the middle with cardboard and covered the top.  I think he put a couple of Doritos as ""bait"", ha ha.  I didn't know what to use honestly so I let him try that.

My little brother has been keeping millipedes as pets for several years now.  Today his last remaining millipede, a female who he has had for around a year and a half, was laying belly-up.  We assumed she was dead, but when picked up she did curl up, albeit slowly.  She must be very ill.  Any suggestions on helping her would be appreciated.  But the big mystery is that when we lifted her up, there was a baby millipede under her!  It's about 2 inches long, and as dark as its mother.  After some searching online, we discovered that for a baby this developed, the time frame does make sense if we assume she brought some stored sperm with her when we got her.  What DOESN'T make sense is one baby!  And never having seen it before!  We don't take the 'pedes out much but we do watch them a fair bit and there's never been any sign of babies.  This one appeared to be riding on the mother's underside, but we couldn't find any references to that behavior online.  In short, it's weird!  If anyone can shed any light on what the hell is going on here, we would be very grateful.  Also, we aren't sure how to care for the baby.  What should we be doing in terms of food and other care?  (pointing me in the direction of more appropriate subreddits is also appreciated!  I just didn't know where else to go)

1338716725.0,20,self.Entomology,uifxd,My review of ThailandUnique.com's edible insects,Joseph_P_Brenner,24,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/uifxd/my_review_of_thailanduniquecoms_edible_insects/,"**Note that all of these insects were dried.  I suspect that they would taste much differently if they were fresh.**

* [**Bamboo worm pupae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-bamboo-worms) - Instead of getting a bag of just bamboo worm pupae, I got a mix of various insects.  Luckily, in that mix, there were some bamboo worm pupae.  Also, they were actually the larvae, not the pupae.  How did they taste?  Great!  And even though they were dried, they still had some moisture in them.  Really hard to describe the taste, but they were genuinely good.  I can see why they are popular in Thailand.  I've had wax worms before as well, and they were really good as well.  Bamboo worms and wax worms are actually caterpillars, so maybe caterpillars really are just as good as they appear in that one scene in *The Lion King* when Timon and Pumbaa were going apeshit over various insect larvae.  **Rating: 5 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Big crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-crickets) - When they said these crickets were big, they were not kidding.  These were probably the largest, honkin' gryllids I've ever seen!  What about their taste?  Maybe because they were dried, but it was really mild.  I think I was tasting the seasoning, which was really good, far more than actual cricket.  **Rating: 3 labial palps out of 5 labial palps since there wasn't much taste**

* [**Chinese yellow scorpions (*Hottentotta*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/chinese-yellow-scorpion?filter_name=scorpions#.T8sha8Uv678) - Unlike the other bugs that resided loosely in the silver plastic bags, these came in a hard, plastic container.  Also, I only got 3 scorpions, and they were tiny.  However, they had big taste!  I would describe them as nutty and smoky.  Also, I chickened out and remove the stinger before popping in my mouth, ha!  According to the website, these are available for wholesale.  Mmmm, nothing like receiving a box of 500 dried scorpions.  **Rating: 4 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Giant water scorpions**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-giant-waterbugs) - Personally, I looked forward to trying this the most.  I've been reading a lot of hype about the taste of giant water bugs, and while water scorpions are not exactly the same, they are very closely related since they are in the same superfamily, not to mention they look and behave very similarly, so I assumed the taste of nepids would be similar to belostomatids.  Well, when I opened the bag (like a kid on Christmas), I did not get multiple bugs (despite the pluralized ""scorpion"" on the bag and website description), but rather only one.  HOWEVER, instead of getting a water scorpion, I got one HUGE, GINORMOUS giant water bug!  Woo!  This was great because not only did I now have the chance to try the real thing, but this was my first time ever seeing a giant water bug in person!  Before eating, I marveled at the beast, rostrum, swimming legs, wings, and all.  What a monster!  So how was the eating experience?  This thing was so huge I couldn't simply pop it in my mouth.  So I removed a front leg.  I have to admit, this thing was really fearsome looking and I would be lying if I said I did not place even just a front leg into my mouth with some degree of trepidation.  As I chewed the front leg, I soon realized that it was not quite palatable as it was 90% tough exoskeleton.  How about the rear swimming legs?  The same.  This thing was like a lobster in that you had to take the time to break open the shell to get at the meat.  So I removed the wings (which I did try to eat anyway out of curiosity, and they were also unpalatable) and bit off an end of the abdomen.  I thought the exoskeleton would be thin enough to easily chew, much like the crickets and scorpions above, but it was just as unpalatable as the legs.  However, I did get a lot of meat this time, and wow, was the taste truly unique!  Even though the giant water bug was dried, the meat still had moisture.  I can't think of anything to compare the taste, but it's strong and aromatic.  Perhaps one could describe it as minty and fruity?  Was it good though?  It was unique indeed, but it was ""just okay.""  Other unique tasting foods that were actually good include fois gras and caviar.  So I guess dried giant water bug falls under the ""unique but just okay tasting"" category like raw sea urchin.  **Rating: 2.5 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Grasshoppers**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-grasshoppers) - Just like my review of ""big crickets"" but with a little more taste, perhaps because the grasshoppers were twice as big so the meat-to-exoskeleton ratio was much higher.  The taste is really difficult to describe.  Maybe apple-like?  Not bad at all.  I think if these were fresh instead of dried, they would be exceptional.  **Rating: 3.5 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Mole crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-mole-crickets) - I have never seen a mole cricket in my life, so it was cool to finally see one up close and personal.  And then to eat one, haha.  So how were they?  Exactly like dried crickets.  I gotta try these fresh next time!  **Rating: 3 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* **[*Phyllophaga rugosa* beetles](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-macrodorcus-peudaxis-beetles)** - Unlike the other bugs in my order, these had no seasoning.  So how did these june bug taste?  They were totally tasteless (perhaps because they were dried), and because there was so much exoskeleton, the overall experience was like eating cardboard!  **Rating: 0 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Pregnant field crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-pregnant-field-crickets) - Not sure if these were actually pregnant, but they tasted exactly like the ""big crickets"" above with the only exception being that they were half their size.  **Rating: 3 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Queen weaver ants**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-queen-weaver-ants) - I think I tasted more of the seasoning than ant, but because these were much smaller than the other bugs I had above, and ants generally have exoskeletons that are relatively thin for their size, these were very palatable, even if I was tasting mostly seasoning.  Overall taste and experience was like [furikake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furikake), and like furikake, I'd bet these would also be awesome with rice.  I'd like to try these fresh next time.  **Rating: 4 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Sago worm larvae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-sago-worm-larvae) - WTF?  I got a bag of grasshoppers, gryllid crickets, mole crickets, and squash bugs.  No sago worms!  And why do they call them ""sago worm larvae?""  That's like saying ""human baby infant"" or ""dog mammal.""  ಠ_ಠ

* [**Silkworm pupae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-silkworm-pupae) - Interestingly, these tasted a LOT better than the canned ones I bought a while back.  Not sure why these would taste better dried, but I enjoyed them.  Pretty good meat-to-exoskeleton ratio!  **Rating: 4 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Squash bugs (*Mictis caja*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-squash-bugs) - I don't think what I got was *Mictis caja* but rather a different coreid.  Regardless, these were like the dried crickets in that I tasted more seasoning than actual bug.  **Rating: 3 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Weaver ants (*Oecophylla*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-weaver-ants) - My eating experience was exactly like the queen weaver ants except the workers were obviously much smaller.  I've read that these were supposed to be slightly bitter, but I didn't experience any of that whatsoever.  I wasn't sure if that was the case due to them being dried and/or the seasoning was really strong.  Regardless, they were just as good as the queens.  **Rating: 4 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Bag of assorted edible bugs**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/assorted-edible-bugs) - Why did I get this when I already got all of the above?  Because the website said this would also include dung beetles, and the dung beetle only bag was out of stock.  However, there weren't any dung beetles in this assorted bag!  ಠ_ಠ

---------------------

**UPDATE:** I voiced my complaints to ThailandUnique and they are resending out the sago worms!  They also said they forgot to update the contents of the ""bag of assorted edible bugs"" on their website as the dung beetles were replaced with squash bugs, so they are refunding me!

1366137719.0,19,self.Entomology,1ch75k,Searching for advice! This Bumblebee seems to think my home is a great place to start a nest (x-post from r/bees).,TarantusaurusRex,24,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/1ch75k/searching_for_advice_this_bumblebee_seems_to/,"This very determined and diligent little bumblebee seems to believe my apartment is the best place to start a new nest. This is what I assume, anyway, as she has been absolutely obsessed with being inside for the past 5 hours.

I went to the park for a few hours. I had left the window open. After I came back, a bumblebee flew in through the window, and hovered around for a few minutes before my boyfriend and I gently chased her out and closed the window.

But she wouldn't go away. She just kept flying around outside the window, urgently trying to get back in. After around 20 minutes of this, we finally decided to let her in so that she could do what she wanted and we could observe her. She flew around. Inspected things. Hid in a bunch of hanging scarves for a while. Crawled around in the towels hanging in my bathroom. Overstayed her welcome. Then she flew back out.
We figured she had had her way with the place, inspected it to her liking, and left for good.

Nope. Ain't no getting rid of a clingy bumblebee, apparently.

After around two hours of the incessant buzzing outside my window, we let her back in. She flew around curiously for a while, then flew behind the pedestal sink in my bathroom where she remained silently for around 20 minutes. Then, off she flew. My boyfriend closed the window, but guess who's back and wants inside?

We're getting a little tired of the little helicopter hovering around outside my apartment. Is there anything we can do to help her or make her go away? I obviously don't want to kill her. She doesn't really seem to mind us at all--she has barely noticed us in spite of how aware we are of her presence.

TL;DR: a bumblebee is desperately trying to move in with me and has been inside or desperately trying to enter my apartment for nearly 6 straight hours. What to do?

In case it matters: I live in Europe.

**UPDATE**:  Miss bumblebee went to bed around 9 p.m. and gave our ears a rest. I figured she would be gone for good. It is now 7 a.m. and she is at it again, buzzing around and begging to come inside. I probably should have mentioned that I have a ground-floor apartment, it was once a shed that has been renovated into a studio. 

My boyfriend will be home all day, he will probably try to take photos of her. 

**UPDATE 2**:  So, our busy little friend disappeared around 8 a.m. and we thought we'd never see her again. Wrong-o. She re-appeared around 6 p.m. this evening to say hello again, and she is currently having a total ball, crawling around in the bunch of scarves that she seemed to enjoy yesterday. She's sort of trapped in one of the scarves and we're going to wait a while to see if she frees herself. My boyfriend was afraid she was trapped and moved it, but she buzzed angrily so he let go and ran away. Pictures coming soon. She is definitely a cute, fluffy, yellow and black-striped bumble bee.

**Semi-related story**: At around 5 p.m., I found another exhausted bumblebee in the shower at work. She was too fatigued to move. We put her in a jar and gave her some flowers. She slurped up some nectar, wiggled her bottom, and flew away happily into a nearby tree with blossoms. Bumblebees seem to be a recurring theme in my life lately.",,False,self,t5_2qygr,1366217495.0,,,True,t3_1ch75k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/1ch75k/searching_for_advice_this_bumblebee_seems_to/,

For its downsides (it's right next to LAX, one of the busiest airports in the world), it's got some great saving graces: right on the beach, surrounded by parks and the last chunk of the Ballona wetlands, etc. 

Even cooler, it's really close to the last remaining speck of native habitat for *Euphilotes battoides allyni*, the endangered [El Segundo blue butterfly](http://www.urbanwildlands.org/esb.html). If you've ever flown out of LAX, that grassy wedge of dunes between the end of the runways and the ocean is the El Segundo Blue Butterfly Habitat Preserve.

This butterfly only breeds on coastal buckwheat, and so I was telling my partner that we should plant shitloads of it at the new place and lend a helping hand to this floundering species. Being the realist that he is, he brought up the possibility that this might not be a great idea: we might encourage the butterfly to spread out to a range where individuals won't be able to find mates, or where they'll only be further hammered by traffic and other things that have a tendency to kill small living things. I tried to do some research to settle these questions--how much coastal buckwheat is required to support a group or community of these guys, etc.--but no dice.

We have image recognition software, and we have traversible databases of species information and photographs (like wikispecies and  [catalog of life](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/)). 

It would be cool to see an open source group effort toward this end. I've been thinking about this for a while, but have no Bio or database background. 

If the app knows your location, that's a clue. If you know the phylum or class or just that it's some kind of moth, that's a clue. If you can provide pictures from multiple angles, that's a clue. If the robots can't identify it, there could be a pool for unidentified species that humans look through and catalog.

Upon investigation, I found that ants had made a home out of the FIOS Battery Backup Unit! As prescribed by the ISP, I tried plugging the box into another outlet with no success in bringing back my service. The unit was shorted out.

The punchline is that this happened once before, last September! Both times, the ISP technicians were surprised; they'd never seen this problem before. Also both times (not surprisingly), they decided to replace the whole unit rather than cleaning up the ants and reusing the equipment.

**Bug Lovers of Reddit** - Do ants like electrical equipment?! There were a bunch of them dead on the floor, I presume from shocking themselves to death. Why would they choose to *live* there? Are they going to come back again?

Some information:

* I live in zip code 97007 (Oregon)
* I suspect they are *Tapinoma sessile* ...but all I really know is that they look like ""sugar"" ants and that we generally get more ants in the house after a good rain.
* We have a single-family, single story detached home
* The equipment is mounted in the garage, near the ceiling.

I'd like to do something about them.
Considering that they all invariably aproach the window at some point in their life, a spider would be well fed.

Any recommendations for generally available species to look for that would take to this?

Further, is there any chance the spider will turn out to be anything more than a pet? I kind of doubt that a predator will wipe out its food source like I'm hoping.

If not, how many human generations will it take to domesticate a spider species for effective pest control, and do you have any recommendations for nursery rhymes, parables, or other mythologies that could keep the tradition of spider keeping alive through its gestational stage?",,False,self,t5_2qygr,False,,,True,t3_lzn96,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/lzn96/i_have_a_sandfly_infestation_and_a_penchant_for/,

With this community being used often for insect/arachnid/arthropod identification, I wanted to throw in some guidelines for pictures that will facilitate identification. These aren't rules, so if you don't adhere to these guidelines, you won't be banned or anything like that...it will just make it tougher for other Redditors to give you a correct ID. A lot of you already provide a lot of information with your posts (which is great!), but if you're one of the others that isn't sure what information is important, here you go.

**INFORMATION TO INCLUDE WITH YOUR PHOTO**

* Habitat: Such as forest, yard, etc. 
* Time of day: Morning, day, evening, or night will suffice.
* Geographical Area: State or county is fine. Or, if you're not comfortable with being that specific, you can be general, such as Eastern US.
* Behavior: What was the bug doing when you found it?

**Note about how to take your photo:**
Macro mode is your friend. On most cameras, it's represented by a [flower icon](http://i.imgur.com/wx7qc.jpg). Turn that on before taking a photo of a bug close up, and you're going to get a drastically better picture. With larger insects it's not as big of a deal, but with the small insects it's a must.

If you follow these guidelines, you'll make it easier for everyone else to help you identify whatever is in your photo. If you feel like I've left anything important out of this post, let me know in the comments.",,False,self,t5_2qygr,True,,,True,t3_jhci2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/jhci2/help_us_help_you_guidelines_for_submitting/,moderator

I loved catching them, studying them, trying to create habitats for them, learning everything I could about them. I told people I wanted to be an entomologist when I grew up.

I turned into a bitter teenager and entomology fell by the wayside, but I've been looking into it more lately, and I've seen incredibly varied careers related to it.

How difficult is it to major in most places? I've read up on some course requirements in a few places I've lived recently, and several of them require more higher end math than I would've expected. I understand that most science degrees are quite challenging, but I have no idea how rough it could be.

Is studying to become an entomologist even worth it financially? Are there jobs available, or is it one of those career paths that seems awesome until the real world punches you in the face? How many companies or foundations would really be looking for an entomologist? Would it be a viable profession to support a family with?

And most importantly, does it tend to suck the fun out of bugs? ",,False,self,t5_2qygr,False,,,True,t3_t2kjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/t2kjc/what_does_being_an_entomologist_entail_exactly/,

For any who are interested, his name was Azathoth and he was indeed [a destroyer of worlds](http://i.imgur.com/GU62x.jpg).

Though it may seem heartless, the entomologist in me would really like to preserve him, perhaps in a Riker mount or shadow box.  I know, however, that scorpions can rot if they aren't preserved properly.  I have seen various suggestions ranging from acetone soaks to dissections and baking.  Some of these seem rather farfetched, so I figured I would just ask the experts here on r/entomology what they recommended I do.  For now poor Azathoth is in a bag in my freezer.  I have access to all of the standard insect curating supplies, as well as copious amounts of 70% EtOH and acetone.  I don't particularly want to drop him in a jar of alcohol, though.

So, from those of you who have curated larger arthropods, any advice?

But he has some odd behavior I wasn't prepared for, despite my research on keeping this species as a pet before obtaining one.

First, he loves to dig. That was a surprise, but not any cause for concern. Second, he seems to spend a lot of time with his face buried in his food. Just sitting there, motionless. Is he asleep? Finally, if I pick him up, interrupting one of his face-stuffing sessions, he ""throws up"" on my hand. He'll secrete one or two big drops of brown liquid from his mouth. If the surface tension of the drop doesn't break against my skin, he sucks it back in after a moment.

I'm assuming it's just chewed up fruit from whatever he was eating. I'm guessing the act of picking him up startles him enough that he spits it out. Or maybe it's a defense mechanism? I'm really at a loss here! Mostly I just want to know if I should be worried about him. He seems perfectly healthy otherwise.

I found this monster of a Dragonfly outside my front door last night.  

Time: around 8pm
Location: Northwest New Jersey, Forest

Wingspan: about 5""

Easily the largest Dragonfly I have ever seen.

It was upsidedown on my deck and my fiance almost stepped on it.  I offered it my flip flop and it grabbed onto it.  I ran to grab my camera, got 2 shots off and didnt feel like blinding it anymore with my flash.  I offered it a step off the flip flop onto a bush, but instead it fired up it's wings and took off.

If you will notice, it looks like there are transparent golden bubbles on the back of its thorax and abdomen.  Are these filled with air or liquid, or is this an illusion of coloration?  If they are actual chambers, what is their function?  I haven't seen this on dragonflies before.  Thanks.

I'm not trying to get you to do my work - but I'm interested in why people are attracted to entomology. (i.e. why are you attracted to the field?) Would a kid who likes insects obsessively collect what she finds in her backyard, or would she soon read up on insects of the world? What kinds of jobs in entomology does a young person aspire to? Working in a museum? A researcher? I really don't know. 

I guess ultimately my question is: Would you mind telling me how/why you got into entomology? I'm trying to figure out what makes this girl tick (no pun intended.)

So I graduated in May with two liberal arts degrees, loved what I studied. For the fun of it, I took an entomology course my last year in college and fell in love. Wish I had taken one sooner. I took Medical Entomology the next semester, but as it was my final semester and it was an unnecessary course (for graduation) and was a tooon of work, I ended up withdrawing from it. That said, I really loved the course and wish I had gotten into entomology sooner.

My interest is geared towards public health and I'm considering going to grad school for public health, but after looking into and talking with advisers, I find out that I can get into medical entomology with only 2 pre-reqs. I'm a good student (3.9 GPA) and put myself fully into whatever I pursue, so I know that if I went the entomology route I'd be able to handle it.

Questions: How's the job market with medical entomology? I'm leaning towards it because it seems like the intersection of public health and entomology, best of both worlds, you know? Are there any medical entomologists in this subreddit? What kind of work do you do?

The adviser I spoke with strongly recommended urban entomology as far as job market &amp; salary. Anyone with experience with this? Is there any overlap with public health?

Honestly, again, I wish I had taken entomology sooner as an undergrad.",,False,self,t5_2qygr,False,,,True,t3_172kh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/172kh9/questions_about_entomology_grad_school/,

I tried to use a stick to push him off of me but he would not let go. He seemed like he'd rather lose his head than release the sweatshirt and I decided I'd rather lose the sweatshirt than kill a bug so I just took the sweatshirt off.
