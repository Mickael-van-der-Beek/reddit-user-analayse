Making bicycle repairs is quite simple and saves you quite a few bucks. I've compiled a list of videos I've found that should help you along with your repairs. If you know of any other videos that are excellent, please comment below and I will add them to the list below.

I think most of the videos are 9+ minutes but they go through the points slowly and try to explain all the angles.

Get watching and get repairing :)

Everyone I've talked to about it thinks I should go for it, my parents, business-owner friends, roommates.

What would I be getting myself into? I would intern for about a year then buy it, the owner would stay on part-time awhile and be available if I need help. He would let me pay him directly over 5 years for the place. He said that's how he got the place from the guy before him.

I'm fucking freaking out a little right now. He said I'm the only customer he ever let work on his bike back in the shop, I thought he just liked breaking my balls and calling me a Polock, apparently he was seeing if I could do the work or not.

I am almost 20 and haven't ridden a bike since I was around 8. I tried to ride one last year and scraped myself up and decided to say, ""Screw it, I don't need to know how to ride a bike."" But apparently my fiancé wants me to ride bikes with him so I thought it'd be nice if I took his bike while he was at work and teach myself how to ride again as a little surprise. I was doing fine until I had to turn right down a road, lost control and jumped off before I hit the ground. I got back up, realized the chain fell off the front part and put it back on. Everything looks fine. But it will only pedal backwards now. I try to pedal forward and it locks up and nothing will move. I don't know anything about bikes but I need this fixed within the next 5 hours. 

tl;dr Fell off bike, chain came off front. Put chain back on, now pedals will only move backwards, not forwards.

Here's my little step by step method for setting them up, hopefully it helps.

1) bolt the thing on just tight enough to not move when you aren't touching it (preferably this step is done with the chain off, it's a bit easier) 

2) Now move there derailleur up till it has 1-2MM of clearance from top of the teeth on the big ring (I use my fingernail as a gauge) 

3) looking at it from above get the outer plate of the derailleur as perfectly parallel to the middle (with a triple) or big (with a double) chain ring as you can

4) tighten up the derailleur 

If your chain isn't on yet put it on

5) put the rear derailleur into the biggest cog in back and turn the low limit in or out until the inner plate is 2MM off the chain. 

6) drop the rear derailleur into the small cog and bring the front up to the big ring (I usually loosely attach the cable and tug on that to get the derailleur to move over) then set the high limit till you have a MM or so between the outer plate and the chain

7) tighten the cable and give it a few tugs to get the housing to seat 

8) shift into the big ring, and add cable tension until you have the gap between the outer plate and chain again and the derailer is sitting gently against the limit

If everything is line up right your bike SHOULD shift correctly, some playing with tension is required some times to get the thing perfect and some time you will have to move the inner limit in to get the chain to drop down correctly. As long as you don't go off the inside this shouldn't be an issue, on the inside a properly adjust front derailleur is sitting on the limit screw not the cable",,False,,t5_2sje0,False,,,True,t3_11t2hg,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/11t2hg/how_to_adjust_a_front_derailleur_step_by_step/,

I kind of like them, as they're decent customers to us here in DC. Also: 

* their rigs are super easy to fix. Save for the occasional ""how do I turn this amazingly rare/bent-frame/pennyfarthing into a fixie"" crew, the components and repairs are straightforward. Nothing really to adjust or fiddle with except for chain tension and chainline, maybe. 
* sure, lack of brakes can be dangerous, but fewer components makes for a quicker tune-up. We can encourage, even recommend... but we still can't force 'em to buy a front brake. It is what it is. 
* lots of them like bling-y parts; gold cranksets, dura-ace track cogs, multi-color deep-V wheels... these things cost more money than your typical item. I know most of the revenue comes from accessories, but there's a good bit of those they move for us too.

I just figured it's unfair. I'm not a hipster, but I like being nice to people in general. I mean, they **are** riding a bike, right?

1347432960.0,20,self.bikewrench,zr7jm,"A Short Comparison of the Three Editions of ""Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance"" — For Frugal Shoppers…",talkingwires,21,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/zr7jm/a_short_comparison_of_the_three_editions_of_zinn/,"I bought my first new road bike nine months ago, and as I came to rely on it for day-to-day transportation, I started to look for books to teach myself the art of bike maintenance. Who wants to pay somebody fifty bucks for something you can do yourself with a little bit of education and a few simple tools? I checked out several different books, looked around for others' opinions, and came to the conclusion that [*Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance*](http://www.amazon.com/Zinn-Art-Road-Bike-Maintenance/dp/1934030422/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=134742934) was the best bet for explaining stuff to newbies with more than enough advanced information to build a bike from the frame up, if you're feeling ambitious.

Why's is this book so great? Brief review: He has two books, one for road bikes, one for mountain bikes. This helps filter out a ton of irrelevant information you find in comprehensive books. The books utilize line drawings and exploded diagrams to show each part and explain how everything fits together instead of photos of one specific bike. He covers all sorts of shifting and braking systems instead of focusing on just one, unlike some of the other recommended books. Each repair is categorized on a three-tiered system based on what tools you need, which I'll paraphrase as ""Essentials You Need to Own a Bike and Should Probably Carry With You on Longer Trips"", ""Hobbyists That Want to be Self-Reliant"", and ""You Could Open Your Own Repair Shop"". And, if you just want the basics, there's a chapter dedicated to maintenance you can do with the most basic of tools, and another about how to deal with mechanical failures on the road when you *don't* have all the tools you need.

(TIL from *Zinn* - If you don't have an extra tube or patch, you can tie the tube into a knot to isolate the puncture. Or, if you have multiple punctures, you can stuff the tire with grass and other padding to limp home without damaging the wheel.)

One criticism: No disc brakes coverage. At all.

*****

So, anyhoo, I headed to [Powell's Books](http://www.powells.com/), and was confronted with three different editions, published in 2000, 2005, and 2009. The earlier ones were used, the latest was only available new, and there was a twenty dollar difference between the three. Which to buy? I had some time to kill, so I sat down with all three editions and spent two hours doing some comparisons. I didn't take notes (what is this a blog?), so I'll try to keep it brief:

All three are solid tomes of bicycle knowledge, and each grows by about fifty pages. But are those extra pages useful? From the first the second edition, absolutely. The first edition seems to be stuck in the eighties, spending more time with parts like threaded stems and outdated braking systems than is really necessary. The second edition still includes the original information, but shifts the newer stuff (which has become the standard) ahead of the older stuff. Many more illustrations are included, and tips from other mechanics have been inserted in sidebars throughout the book or integrated into the text.

The jump from the second to the third edition is much more subtle, and I spent most of my time examining the two, in an effort to save nine bucks. The latest edition has much better typesetting, with no more awkward white space between words in paragraphs. The layout of the pages has also been redesigned, using new fonts, a second color, and white space to make everything much more slick. Unfortunately, that means much of the increased page count comes from the fact that there's less text on a page. There's even some regressions, like losing the chapter title printed on the side of each page so you can quickly thumb through the book to find the section you need.

As for new content in the third edition, there isn't much. There's a couple (literally) of new illustrations, the best being an exploded view of a threadless stem. Some stuff in the frame fitting chapter has been added about UCL regulations. The wheel-building chapter now covers a few alternative ways of arranging your spokes for racing or cyclocross. There's a bit more here and there about carbon fiber forks and frames. Some passages have had a paragraph reworked or inserted, such as the ones about self-sealing tubes and tubeless tires (he mentions other brands besides Slime, now). I even noticed one correction about using citrus-based solvents (they contain water and shouldn't be used for soaking a chain). And the mostly useless, seven-page chapter on bike computers has been dropped.

So, long story short, there just ain't enough added stuff in the latest edition to justify buying it new at full price. A prettier design is about all it has going for it. So, if you're looking for a great book on bicycle maintenance and mechanics, skip the third edition, pick up the second edition of *Zinn &amp; The Art…*, and save yourself some cash.",,False,,t5_2sje0,1347486481.0,,,True,t3_zr7jm,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/zr7jm/a_short_comparison_of_the_three_editions_of_zinn/,

It was so bad, it was ruining every ride and causing me several trail side meltdowns. I exhausted all options trying to fix it myself. Took it in to the shop where I bought it, they were stumped also (new pads and larger rotor, Motoex did nothing). They still had my bike and were trying to figure out what to do next.

 So I get a call yesterday: turns out the SRAM rep had stopped into the shop so they showed him my bike. He replaced my entire system (front and rear) withe the new X0 trail brake.

But, when I take my bike into the shop because the bottom bracket is creaking, or my wheel is slightly out of true, I feel like I'm getting a bit of attitude - that I should be doing a lot more of the ""basic stuff"" myself.

For example, my 2010 Secteur has developed a creaking noise from in or around the bottom bracket. It might be the bracket itself, but I suspect I need to grease the speedplay pedals. Problem is, this requires either ordering special tools and grease online or else getting the LBS to do it.

And, as for the bottom bracket itself, it's pretty clear that Specialized doesn't want me pulling the cranks myself - the bolt is covered with an odd dust cover that looks like I need yet another special tool to remove.

So my bike had been rattling especially when going over bumps and such. I thought it was the rear wheel but after checking it was fine the noise was still there.

Today I flipped the bike upside down with the seat post out and loads of this weird material came out (see pics). It's a black plastic type material that looks to be weaved like carbon. My frame however is aluminium (Planet X Superlight). The larger parts seemed to match the curve of the frame.

Quite a lot came out and every time I righted the bike and flipped it again more came out. 

There were lots of smaller shards of this stuff near the top of the seat stay on the inside.

Any idea what it is? I am boggled. Should I be worried or just keep on riding?

I have done a couple of builds myself and know my way around wrenches, but this being a Di2 I let the experts handle it...or so I thought. I have studied the relevant chainsuck guides I could find and checked off every item on the suspect list: chain and chainring (11 spd Specialized sworks) are flawless - well lubricated and no visible defects.
Chainsuck happens when I downshift from the large chainring while in the second largest cog in the cassette. Has anyone experienced this with the new Di2 11 spd?
My only lead: I noticed that the rear derailleur tension was not very high, is it possible that my mechanic missed something that accounts for the wimpy pull?
Also, what should I be looking for in terms of damage in case of chainsuck? I have some cosmetic damage to the chainstay, but should I be worried about the derailleurs derailleur hanger? In case the shop did screw this up I plan on asking for replacement parts.
This fatal flaw is heartbreaking, I cannot bear sawing into the frame and cranking the derailleurs once more. Also, I am concerned that this is unusual enough that the guys at the shop won't invest the time to get it right; time is money and they have more bikes to build.

Did one of the front a while back and had a request to do the rear, finally getting around to it

This works better starting with the chain off, but it can be done with the chain on

1) Bolt on the derailleur 

2) Looking at the derailleur from above and behind the cassette set the high limit till the top and bottom jockey wheel lines up perfectly (this is where it helps to have the chain off) 

3) push the derailleur all the way over to the easiest gear and push it all the way against the stop. Again line up the jockey wheels with the big cog. 

4) put the chain on (put it in big big and make sure it has a bit of slack) 

5) put the bike in the small chain ring and again push the derailleur over to the small cog 

6) now take the B tension screw (the one that pushes against the hanger and rocks the derailleur back) till you have a full link between the jockey wheel and cassette. Note! At this point your derailleur is adjusted if your having shifting issues it is all cable tension, unless you bend something DO NOT touch the screws on the derailleur, it will only screw things up

 7) hook up the cable (shimano and campy derailleurs like to be taught, and sram derailleurs like a bit of slack)

 8) at this point start shifting up and down, if it's slow going up into an easier gear, add a click of tension on the barrel adjuster. If it's slow going into a smaller cog take a click off. Just play with this till your shifting is perfect.

So my chain comes off the chainring (8 gears at rear, one gear at front, no front derailleur) at the slightest provocation, a bad bump or changing gears when going fast. Most days I have to put my chain back on the chainring twice per journey (it also always bounces off to the right, to the outside of the bike, getting stuck in the chainguard - [here's a pic](http://imgur.com/0t68msX) ). It's killing me softly.

I figured it might be too long, as it seems to bounce and wobble quite a bit when riding.

So I checked with Sheldon Brown [here](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#chain) and watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9YEcgQRHpA) video, and set about correcting my chain length. As a result I took off about four or five links. The result just seems utterly wrong.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/fLtrYCe.jpg) is my rear derailleur in the highest gear,

and [here](http://i.imgur.com/nMYUWqz.jpg) in the lowest gear.

Did I do this wrong? I followed the instructions to the letter. But that last picture... it don't look right man, it gives me the creeps.

A test ride round the block felt... well, great actually. But it just looks so wrong that I'm convinced I've made a mistake.

So I saw this bike parked outside this dudes house all Winter so I knocked and asked if he was using it.  Long story short it was swapped for a case of beers. 

Now I have no experience WHATSOEVER at fixing things like bikes.

The tires are flat- they look like the original Raleigh tires. No idea if the spokes are OK. 

The chain is rusty as hell. 

The paint job sucks.

The seat is comfy. 

*Edit: The brake pads need replacing but I guess that is the least of the problems.

Where do I start sorting the bike out so it is rideable? I almost certainly don't have the tools I would need. 

I tired taking the wheel nuts off but they are rusted on. My friend suggetsed sawing them off and buying new ones. Even if I do that there is the brake chain thing in the way.

4. And finally (no picture for this one) If i shift to the smallest cog on the cassette, the pulleys seem to be too far over towards the chainstay and are not in line with the cogs (H-Limit?)

I had a run in with a difficult customer and I'm interested in hearing reddit's feedback.

The way we operate is to walk the customer through the repairs, explain along the way, and let them use the tools to practice technique, in hopes that they'll gain some insight into the requirements of bike maintenance and be better bike owners. This dude comes in with an aluminum schwinn something or other from Kmart (he told me where he bought it) with a click in the bottom bracket. I examined the bb and couldn't see anything obviously wrong, except that the lockring on the adjustable cup was loose, but the cup wasn't loose or tight, so I guessed bad pitting or broken bearings and set to work pulling it apart for a rebuild.

I pulled the driveside crank myself, explaining to him all the ins and outs and what to watch for so that he didn't strip the crank on the other side. This guy was kind of oafish and immediately set to work tearing threads. I stopped him as quick as I could, but he had already ruined the first couple threads and when I pulled the tool out I saw that he had cross threaded it to begin with. My coworker and I tried two or three other crank pullers, getting as much purchase as we could on the remaining threads, but the crank was seized and going nowhere, probably severely overly torqued by the mechanic at Kmart, as many of those bikes are.

Stuck in a hard place (and not having one of [these](http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/dissident75/Misc%20Bike%20Parts/crank_puller.jpg) in the shop, which we need), we took the pickle fork to it for a couple whacks, being extremely careful not to touch the frame. No luck. Finally I found I was able to get a pair of long needle nose on the cup threads and with a lot of crunching of the cup, I unthreaded it and pulled the crank out with the bb spindle still attached.

I spent the next 30 minutes digging through parts bins to find a matching bb and useable crankset and as I installed them he asked what this was going to cost. I told him we charged $10/hr for the shop time and with the components, how was $30? And then he revealed himself to be a dick. He said his crankset was perfectly good when he came in and that I had ruined it, so he wasn't going to pay for it, and all the extra time was my fault (even though the crank puller was in his hand when the problem started.) I told him he was being unreasonable, that like it or not, Kmart bikes are not designed to be repaired and we do our best, but frankly that's just the nature of the game when you shop at department stores. He refused to pay any more than $10, so I pulled his bike out of the stand and kicked him out. He came back 10 minutes later and said that I hadn't finished the job because the new cranks didn't line up with the front derailleur. I told him that we don't do work for free and when he refused to pay, he forfeited his right to service. He made a scene in front of the shop for five minutes and finally left.

What would others have done? I probably shouldn't have let him use the crank puller, but that's kind of in the mission of our organization. We're reminded all the time by the shop manager not to do all the work for customers, to let them use the tools. Was I unreasonable? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I don't feel great about it, but like I said, it was a tough situation.

I have a decent of tools, although planning on investing in some of more specialized stuff I don't have yet, torque wrench, BB tool, chain whip, casette tool, etc.

Thinking about getting [this frame](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_511702_-1___202389) and some mid-level components.

* What are the trickiest parts? Anything that was unexpectedly tricky?

* Anything noobs tend to frequently fuck up?

* Seems like people suggest having the LBS press on the headset, although the frame is machined for an integrated headset, seems like only the lower race needs to be pressed on to the fork, and everything else just slips on with no need for a press?

* Someone also suggested having the LBS install the BB, so that they can face and chase the threads, how necessary is that?

* Cutting cable housing, is this worth having the LBS do? I have a park tool cable and housing cutter, but it sounds like it might be tricky not to crush the ends of the housing?

* Wheel building, seems a little bit little black art, anyone have any experience learning and/or recommendations on adding learning that on to this project vs just buying a decent set of pre-built wheels?

I've folllowed the Avid method for aligning the pads and calipers, and also I tried another method, here: http://www.ecovelo.info/2011/04/15/a-foolproof-method-for-adjusting-avid-bb5-disc-brakes/

I've managed to get my front brake setup perfect.
My back brake however I can't get lined up.  The inboard pad I can get lined up with the disc, however the outboard pad, for the life of me (so far anyways) I cannot get lined up.  It's always settling into an angled position relative to the disc and the caliper.  As a result, I'm finding it impossible to remove the rubbing.

I can't see anything inside the caliper that'd be causing a problem (granted it's hard to get a good look).

I wanted to get this up in case anyone has immediate thoughts.  If necessary I can try to get a picture up later this evening.

I'm hoping maybe someone has BB5 experience on this sort of a problem.
For what it's worth, this is on a 2012 Specialized Tricross frame.



And to nip it in the bud, I know, BB7s are better... I'll upgrade to those at a later date likely.

EDIT: Photo: http://imgur.com/6Xt8S
I drew red lines through the grips on the pads so you can see the angle problem.
I worked at it some more, and still haven't solved it, but I backed off the cable tension to allow it to run without rubbing.  It just makes the brake cable more slack than I'd like.  I think unless someone here has any other suggestions, I'll be taking it to the bike shop to get them to investigate, correct and hopefully tell me how to fix it in the future if I come across it again.

On a plus note, I adjusted my front derailleur as it was too high up and how the front shifts oh so sweet :)

FOLLOWUP: In case anyone is still reading ;)  I took it to the bike shop. It's still a bit wonky but they seemed to have tuned the tension and such better than I.  Ultimately they said they've seen this in bb5s and it seems the pads often don't like to sit the way they're supposed to due to the design.  Basically it was suggested that I expect rub on it (beyond that of normal rotor warping due to usage) or upgrade to bb7s as they are better designed.

I started into a personal, recreational, educational project, rebuilding an old three-speed someone had discarded. I came to you fine persons for suggestions on how to work on old three-speed hubs. I found your responses encouraging and helpful. Some said they would like to see pics of the completed rebuild, so here is an imgur gallery: [My Free Spirit (Sears) FS3, step-through, three-speed rebuild](http://imgur.com/a/l8h5x).

Given how uncommon they are, and how little info is left on them, I plan to post a video soon about how to disassemble, lube, and re-assemble these early Shimano hubs. They are very similar in principal to the more popular Sturmey-Archers, but are shifted in the opposite direction; in an SA, the shift cable pulls the mechanism to the right against a spring, whereas in the Shimano it actuates a push-rod which pushes the mechanism to the left against a spring. So, once I edit up my video and post it, I'll update it here.

So, thanks for the help, guys!


**UPDATE (1 day later):** I'm a horrible self-recording cameraman, and I'm not much better at editing, but I've uploaded a couple of videos on servicing the Shimano S3 hub. Shimano had a good number of models, and not all of them had the same parts. (In fact, that's a big part of why I'm doing this; I couldn't find any exact descriptions of this hub online.)

* * *
**UPDATE**

I emailed a few frame builders in town with the image that I posted here and estimates varied quite a bit. I ended up going with a frame builder a couple miles from me who charged $100 to fix both seat stays. He also fixed the seat tube so that I can fit a non-lathed 27.2mm seat post now.

[**IMGUR ALBUM OF WELDED FRAME**](http://imgur.com/a/9WKJ3)

For those curious, here's what a couple builders emailed me after seeing the picture I sent:

*Quote #1:*

&gt; Thanks for your inquiry. We can certainly repair your bike. Looking at the photo, your drive side is cracked on both the inboard and outboard fillets, the non-drive side is likely also cracked or about to be. Completely stripping the paint will allow us to examine the frame and locate any other potential problem areas.

&gt; $50 to strip the paint

&gt; $200 labor to repair the stays

&gt; $250 total without paint

&gt; We can provide options for repainting, from $150 and up depending on what you'd like to do in terms of color and decals/graphics.

&gt; Please let me know if you would like to schedule the work. We are currently 12-16 weeks out on repairs at this time.

*Quote #2:*

&gt; Without seeing it in person, I think there are two approaches you could take to repair it. 
1. Quicker and less costly - Disassemble the frame, sand off the paint around the area, lay some silver down over the cracks, rattle can the area with white gloss paint. 
Around $180.
2. Restoration - Disassemble it, strip the paint, replace the seatstay, repaint. This one depends a lot on paint choices but figure on at least $600. 

&gt; There is, of course, the third option of deciding that it has lived a full life and hanging it in the stable or moving its components to another frame.

Lately I've been taking my comfort commuter on longer and longer journeys. However it is not a road bike, and after 3 hours I'm really feeling it. What is needed is a road bicycle!

I'm not made of money, and I like the idea of buying a cheap second hand frame and doing it up during the winter (I'm in NZ, winter is coming). However I have more questions than I know what to do with. We don't really have the bike culture like other countries have, so there isn't a co-op I can go to in order to learn these things.

I'm looking at spending a few of hundred bucks on this. While I know if I were in the US, or even Australia, I would be able to get a new entry level road bike for that money, in NZ you can't get anything under a grand. I think that there are some importers in my country laughing all the way to the bank, but that's neither here nor there.

I have zero experience with this sort of thing. I want to do it myself as I can save on labour and pick up a skill at the same time. Also having a project keeps the winter blues away.

My googlefu is lacking. [This](http://www.carectomy.com/buy-used-road-bike/) website gave me some general tips, but what I want is nuts and bolts stuff. I also am looking for some wisdom on what to avoid, what to look for, and any other knowledge that you can only get from people who have done it themselves.

I've heard that its a good idea to grease all threaded parts on a bicycle before assembly but I don't think I've been told why. I think its so when you remove parts for service, they'll actually come apart. Is this true?

I think I've seen why with pedals where I actually stripped off the threads from a crank arm because the threads weren't greased.
But wouldn't this make parts that shouldn't come apart, like a lockring threaded against a fixed gear cog, slip off more easily?

[This site](http://bicyclemechanic.blogspot.com/2009/04/bicycle-grease-oils-cleansers-and.html) says that one shouldn't use automotive grease because its too thick, but I don't really see why that would be a problem. I feel the force from riding on the bottom brakcet and hubs would eliminate any concerns like these. Why am I wrong?

It also says one shouldn't use oils like wd40 (obviously, it evaporates and leaves you no lubricant) and 3 in 1 (not so obvious). Whats wrong with 3 in 1? Why does it say oils are essential for threads when I thought I should be greasing threads? Why is tri-flow generally considered better for chains than 3 in 1?

My dad recently gave me his old Mongoose dynametrix hybrid bike. It's old and has some issues, but still rides nice for what it is. The entire thing could use a good cleaning and definitely some parts need to be replaced.

The current issues that I know of:
All the spokes are pretty much completely rusted, the rim itself has bits that are rusty, I think it needs new rims. They are labeled ""Araya 7000 Japan"" 

Front brake is working pretty good, rear brake squeaks like crazy and you really have to pull it to get it to work.

Rear tire slides against rear brake hindering movement slightly

Chain and rear derailer seem to be in good shape, just covered in this black greasy stuff, but what do I know

Brake cables are rusty, definitely need to be replaced

The gear changer on the left handle bar doesn't work, don't know if it's an issue with the front derailer or what, but it's stuck in one speed

I was doing about 20 mph, tried to bunny hop, and hit them hard ... BANG! My bars dipped down about 2"" and I almost bit it.  So I stopped to torque the bars, and not having a torque wrench in the field, I went too far and crushed the carbon handlebar.  That was a long, sad ride home. 

Fast forward to today, I ordered a replacement Zipp aluminum bar and torqued it to spec (4 Nm for 4-bolt pattern w/blue loctite) in the stem.  I put all my weight on them and they didn't slip.  

Soooo hit the same tracks and the bar dipped AGAIN.   WTF? I used Tacx carbon paste on the original carbon bars, and no paste on the aluminum bars.  Both sets of bars have the ""grip tape strip"" and were torqued to spec. 

What gives?  This is really crushing my confidence.  We have a lot of bumpy roads around here, and I just attack the bumps like cobbles (fast) so i need to feel confident. 

Question 1: Should I be riding on the hoods or drops over major bumps or tracks?  Perhaps it's just too much weight on the hoods (downward rotation pressure) I prefer hoods for group riding, but switch to drops for more leverage when sprinting.  I don't like to ride the drops for long, I always end up back on my hoods. 

Question 2: I am thinking it's my stem ... it's a specialized 2-strip (4 bolt) clamp that doesn't have a lot of surface area. I am thinking about ordering a bigger stem with more surface area for clamping. Has anyone ever heard of this happening? 

**edit:** added a picture of my stem/bar setup http://imgur.com/73x8EeG.jpg

I was well prepared so I quickly changed the tube, but when I started to pump up the tube I noticed that a big bulge was forming around the valve. So big that it didn't fit inside the brake, even though the tube was still soft and the brake was open.

I opened the valve and tried again, but the bulge was still there. As I was quite close to home I pumped up the tube as far as it would without touching the brakes, and then slowly paddled the last 4/5 km home.

So I'm wondering, what would cause this? Was it just a bad tube (it was a Continental from my LBS, so seems unlikely), or did I do something wrong?

I've seen bulges like this before, but they wouldn't be noticeable until you'd take the tube out of the tire, so they weren't that big.

Another related question, do you normally fix a puncture (when you get home), or do you not bother and throw away the tube? I used to ride a city-bike where I'd easily fix a tube 5/6 times before replacing it, but there I never pumped them really hard, and I only just the bike for casual commuting. Now I've got a race bike I'm not sure if fixing it is even worth it, as I'm worried that it'd increase the chance of another puncture a lot.

EDIT: Was trying to find the cause just now and pumped the tire up outside the tire, and the bulge showed up right away, even bigger. Pumped it to about 2 bar maybe, tried pinching it on a few different spots, and then it exploded.

I got a new chain today at my LBS, who I won't hesitate to say I dislike. I was trying to fix a stiff link but the chain tool broke and I ended up using my bike as a scooter to get to it since it was the closest bike shop. 

Now, the chain works fine and my gears shift fine. (Fine is very subjective here as I've only ridden this bike 3 times so I can't really get a natural feel for how things should be and I just replaced a decade old chain.) The thing is, I noticed that my chain was routed a different way through the pulleys. 

What I mean by pulleys: http://i.imgur.com/ffgSaML.png

How it looked before: http://i.imgur.com/T5j2wwI.png

How it looks now: http://i.imgur.com/GXmzplN.png

My main guess for why the mechanic decided to put the chain through this way is that the chain he had wasn't long enough or he was trying to be cheap and save some links. I tried researching the purpose of the pulleys and the most I really got was that they: 

&gt; regulate the tension of the chain as it runs over different sized sprockets
 
So if I read correctly, the pulleys have to do with shifting and they seem kinda important too. The way my chain is going through the pulleys now, it looks like the only function they are serving is to hold the chain. 

**My Question/TL;DR**: Is it normal for a chain to be routed through the pulleys the way it currently is on my bike? Am I at a disadvantage in respect to shifting gears or drivetrain efficiency? 

**Edit:** So, thanks to /u/Zekohl , I found out that it was actually in the correct alignment. Like he said in his post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1fi5yx/small_question_about_how_the_chain_should_be/cabf3y4?context=3), its different seeing your bike in a higher gear. When I got it back my bike was shifted higher and later on my friend shifted it to the largest sprocket for me so the pulleys were nearly horizontal. At the time I thought the way it was, was wrong. I really should've double checked before posting. I'll be more careful in the future in self-diagnosing problems and jumping to blame the mechanic. Thanks a lot for your help guys! :)

There was an issue with the freewheel when I first got it, so I had the back wheel replaced right away, but I have had no issues otherwise.  

I really want to take care of this bike since I ride it so much, but I don't really know how to handle preventitive maintenance.  I have some downtime this week so I want to do as much work on it as I can to get it in shape for summer.  

I have a crank puller, a chain breaker, good bike grease, tri-flow lube, and access to general tools.  


I am looking for any and all **advice on how to take care of it**, and I also have some **specific questions to ask you guys**:  


First, there are some places where the paint has chipped away.  These spots looked more or less like this when I got the bike, and I have done nothing about it so far.  Here are some pictures:

http://i.imgur.com/ocwLiUQ.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/4XbFO3f.jpg


What should I do about spots like these to stop the corrosion and keep everything solid?  


I have noticed most other road bikes have rubber brake hoods.  Am I missing some kind of covering that I should replace or are mine fine like this?

http://i.imgur.com/ttcaGA1.jpg  


The bartape is definitely getting grungy, I took off one side of it already, going to unwrap the otherside right before I try and put the new tape on so I can try and emulate it as closely as possible.  Looks like there is a lot of tape/glue gunk on the bar from over the years, do I need to scrub this stuff off or is it fine to just put my new tape right over it?  

http://i.imgur.com/l84xIuY.jpg  


Since I have been using this bike regularly for 2 years, and I know it has been ridden hard in the past (triathalons and such), I am taking this week as an oppurtunity to replace the chain and brake/shifter cables.  I know these are parts that wear fast, and they are so inexpensive I figured why not. Plus I already have the grip tape off.  I've never replaced cables for downtube shifters or these kind of brakes, but I am assuming its pretty straight forward. Good idea?  


I already took the crank off to give the chainrings a proper cleaning, and I plan to do the same for the rear cogs.  I noticed the teeth on the chainrings seem kind of worn, how do I know how much wear is too much wear?

(pic soon)  


I plan on giving the frame a good wipe down and cleaning the derailleurs as best I can, but I think I am going to leave them on to do it.  That way I will only need to do minor adjustments to get everything working smoothly.  Is it a good idea to take the seatpost out and clean things there too, or should that be fine?  




Other things I have been thinking about but are slightly harder (especially since I only have basic tools):  

For some reason I am very tempted to take off the bottom bracket and repack the bearrings.  I am very much a novice (clearly) so is this a good idea?  I haven't had any issues like creaks or anything, I just have no idea when the last time this thing was tuned up so I don't want it to be getting all rusted or prematurely worn out or something.    

http://i.imgur.com/4SKlPHU.jpg

I'm a 22-year old (5'8"") who has been riding an 80s schwinn road bike for the past 4 years. I've beat the crap out of it, and now that I'm about to graduate and move across the state in September, I'm looking at selling this off and getting something new then.

Admittedly, I've taken poor care of my bicycle. I'm looking to get into the tinkering a bit more. I'm looking at buying an old road bike (bianchi, schwinn?) and over time, upgrading parts. I may eventually want to own a road bike and a fixed-gear (with flip-flop back wheel as well as brakes). I like bicycling, and 90% of the time I ride my current road bike in the same gear, so I feel like moving to a single gear would be fairly intuitive for me. 

I'm also looking at this as a good monetary investment. I'm hoping a one-time purchase of tools will save me a good amont of grief in the long run. In addition, I'd like to know the ins and outs of the mode of transportation that is hurtling me down hills and through traffic.

Got a hole near the stem and I can't patch it, so going to replace it. I noticed that 2 spokes broke when I got home, so I left it as it was. Normally I'd take it in to get it checked over and fixed, but I'm strapped for cash right now and would like to wait a little longer if possible to fix it, but at the same time I kind of need to use my bike. So if I replace the tube can the rim handle the stress of city use? Not looking for any off road use, just on roads and paths.

Pictures of the rim in question:
From the side showing the whole rim, one spoke can be seen by the rear frame of the bike, the other is the third spoke from the red reflector

What are the risks of riding it in this state, bend the rim, break more spokes, total bike failure resulting in it being scrap? Any help or advice is appreciated on this.

EDIT: I'm in Windsor, bit far from Toronto, but seems there is a growing cycling community in the area. I'm going to call around since I didn't know it was an easy fix and inexpensive fix.

[Before and after](http://imgur.com/a/nq4Yf)

Here is a list of what I have changed so far:

1. Removed and cleaned wheels with wire wool.

2.  Cleaned and oiled chain. This took two days- the chain was so grimey!

3.  Re-greased the bearings under the cones.

4. Fitted new inner tubes and tires.

5. Oiled the sturmey archer hub.

6. Cleaned and weather-proofed the bicycle.

7. Trued the spokes so that the wheels don't move so much.

There are still lots of things that need doing. The brakes and cables need replacing, as do the pedals. Eventually, a new seat would be nice. Any recommendations would be appreciated! The steering and crank both run smoothly.

I need to replace the axle(?) on the front hub. How easy is this? I'm not even sure what kind of part I need. You can see from the photo below that the thread is totally wrecked; I couldn't even get the nut back on! Any suggestions of what to do next?

They were returns at my shop and I noticed they had some slight play, but I didn't really mind at the time.

About 2 months later the side to side play increased so much that I thought my cleats were loose. I had the head mechanic check it out but strangely, he couldn't get the dust caps off.

Heres an image of the exact model: http://media.performancebike.com/images/performance/products/1500/50-7925-GSL-ANGLE.jpg

The dust caps if you can't tell have a flat head socket and are made of plastic.
I bought the newer model(as far as I can tell the only difference is the spring is silver) and strangely, those dust caps were locked on too. Lightly testing a few other brand new ones revealed that the majority out of the box eggbeaters have irremovable dust caps.

I found ones that I could remove without damage, and lo and behold a week later they have absurd amounts of side to side play.

I took it apart and what I found was a very simple assembly. There is a single cartridge bearing on the end, which is held in place by an 8mm nut, which is right below the dust cap. The bearing is in turn pushed against a rubber bushing fixed in place, upon which the spindle tapers out, and the other side operates as a greased sleeve bearing. And thats it.

Apparently, this rubber bushing is either squished or compressed to the point where it gets play as the bearing now has free space upon which it can move, and the threads are limited so you cannot readjust the 8mm nut down further. I believe my old used ones lasted as long as they did because the bearing was stopped and compressed by the dust cap, thus binding the plastic.

So to me this seems kind of stupid, and although I'm kinda impressed by the simple design per crank brothers seeming design principles, I'm dissappointed that it has such a glaring flaw. Are there any experts out there that could show me something I'm missing? Is this what I get for buying $60 dollar pedals?

I searched on google for others with this issue and the consensus seems to be that they do get side play, but they(bikeforums) think it does not affect their pedaling.

So after I visited 3 different bike shops (Chicago_Lakeview) I am now a more confused about the bike racks, well more of the attachments. 

So in regards to the trunks/panniers/boxes that can be attached to a bike rack. What is a cost effective bag and rack combo? Any great deals? 

I am trying to lighten my load while commuting, I have a laptop, notebook, reading book and water bottle, tuber ware (lunch) with me when I go out. 

The weight on my back is annoying but I mostly want to get rid of the sweaty backpack feeling after a ride.

I feel as though the length of the derailleur cage is affecting the shifting because it's so stubby, it doesn't take up that much slack, so I had to get liberal with the chain tightening. Please tell me how wrong I am and if there's anything I can do to get it to behave. Thanks everybody!

All that being said, I'm interested to hear from some experienced wheel builders on variations of the spoke pattern. Should I pursue this, or sell the rims and get proper 32h to build. Since the C2s are a bit harder to find, I'd probably go with some Velocities.

I do a bunch of city riding on currently a carbon frame with aluminum drops and I was wondering if it would be worth upgrading to carbon drops (not for the weight difference) but for vibration dampening to reduce fatigue.

Usually about 40 miles in or so, I'll end up with super sore shoulders and pretty tired arms so I'm wondering if they would help at all.  I'd be picking them up from an independent builder located in NYC that uses T700 3K carbon (pressed in China, obviously) for about 120 installed?

2 questions, I guess: 1) Is it worth upgrading to carbon drops for vibration dampening 2) Is T700 3K carbon a decent material for drops?   From what I've been reading, it should be fine since a decent amount of frames are build with T700, but I'm not sure about the ""weave"" count.

The problem is that when I get up to the spokes that are threaded under other spokes, some will not reach the hole and I cannot apply the nipple. Am I just really crap at lacing a wheel (my first one), are the spokes perhaps too short, or is there a better way to make it easier and work.

I'm using the three cross method with 36 spokes, as directed by the bike store guy. Any help would be great. Thanks!

Update; I watched a couple of different instructional videos and got the right method down straight away. The wheel is not fully-spoked and most of the truing is done. I'll keep at it over the next few days and I'm pretty confident It'll turn out great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there. So I blew a seal (heh) and thought I'd try my hand at servicing my fork myself. I already had the 3 special tools for this job (slider protector, seal press, and syringe-style air pump), so I ordered Marzocchi 7.5 wt oil and an oil &amp; dust seal kit. I downloaded instructions from enduroforkseals.com and went to work.

Everything looked good &amp; aside from one blown seal theree were no cracked or corroded o-rings, and the color of the oil was good. I cleaned everything thoroughly, lubed everything with fork oil, and followed the reassembly directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Problem 1: far from being able to simply ""press"" in the replacement oil seal, I had to hit the top of the seal press with a hammer to get it close to where it needed to be. Even then, there was still about 3mm of space between the bottom of the oil seal and the top of the upper washer, so the upper washer was free to rattle around between the bottom of the oil seal and the top of the pilot bushing. 

* Problem 2: after filling the stanchion with the recommended amount of oil (leaving 30mm of headroom) and pressurizing to 2.5 BAR, the fork was stiff as hell. I could barely get an inch of travel out of it.

* Problem 3: figuring I has mis-measured the amount of oil I put in, I removed a further 10mm of oil, then repressurized. A tiny bit better.

* Problem 4: I now have something like 60mm of headroom and am barely getting 1.75 inches of travel when I really, really jam on it. I basically have about 3mm of preload, which has resulted in a rather weird-feeling ride. The action is smooth and the new seals are working great, but it's just crazy stiff.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what did I do wrong? Is the problem that I left 3mm of rattling space between the oil seal and upper washer? Should I get a bigger hammer and try again? Maybe the replacement seals were a little swollen?

Your ideas are greatly appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: I figured it out (but only after disassembly and reassembly to get that oil seal fully seated). The problem is that the manual does not specify whether the fork should be filled with oil with the fork fully extended or fully compressed. I had assumed I should fill it fully extended, but the diagram shows a sorta-kinda partially compressed fork, or maybe it's a fully compressed fork. Who knows? Those coy Italians! In rereading the directions and reexamining the diagram, I concluded that you are supposed to leave 30mm of headroom when the fork is fully compressed.

So I did just that, pressurized to 2.5 BAR, and all is well. Hoo ray.

There is no apparent contact of the chain with anything that it shouldn't touch. Changing of the gears is smooth, no problems.. just the sound. It gets louder in higher rpm, that's why I took the video at such speed. Beware, it's quite loud (captured with shitty microphone on my compact camera).

I recently decided to swap out the drive train on my homebrew Salsa Vaya. I'm going from Apex to X.0 as it suits my use better. My problem is that I cannot for the life of me get the front derailleur properly adjusted.

The reason I went with X.9 for the front is because I couldn't find an X.0 front derailleur that specifically said it was compatible with a 42/28 crankset, even though the crankset is also X.0.

I cannot get the front derailleur to reliably move the chain from the small chainring to the big chainring. The chain catchers on the big wheel will catch the chain, but have an extremely difficult time actually getting the chain onto the 42t chainring.

I have the Low limit screw bottomed out, I have the high limit screw backed almost all the way out, and my cable is tight.

Any input/advice? I'm fine with getting a new front derailleur if I need to if that is the problem, and in fact would be willing to if someone could tell me specifically which X.0 derailleur is compatible with the 42/28 crankset.

Cranks have horizontal play - pedaling I can feel both pedals and cranks shift back and forth left and right, like 1/8"" of play.

Gears - A couple teeth have worn down, pedals fine in mid gears, going to 3 and 7 has slipped off before, generally stick to 2 and 4-6 without issues.

Rims - original, show some wear, but not sure how much is acceptable/safe. Small chance the rear wheel is slightly bent after hitting a big dip, heard a rubbing sound after hitting the dip but haven't found evidence that it was the rim.

I'm a fairly handy guy and I'm quick to learn the in's the out's of projects that I pick up. 

I want to build a cheap single speed bike that I can use for short distances (less than 5k one way). I have a budget of around $300. I know I can buy a pre-built bike for that much, but there are two caveats:

1) Living in Canada, my options are limited, unless I pay a ton in shipping. 
  2) This would be a good project for me to learn how to disassemble and reassemble a bike entirely. 

I've also been looking at used bikes in the local classifieds, and though there are many, its hard to find one thats 59 cm's. 

The bike will be used primarily for Grocery shopping, or a quick trip to a friends house. I have Kona Jake, but that being an expensive investment, I only want to use it for rides &gt; 10km's one way.     

The single speed bike will just be a bike that I don't really care about maintaining as much. i.e. I don't care about the elements, dont care about dings, dents, etc. Just a beast that I ride anywhere and that's easy to fix. 

I've been looking at cheap frames, and I saw this one on ebay: [http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Nineteen-Richter-59-cm-bike-frame-NEW-/181054263505?pt=Road_Bikes&amp;hash=item2a27acd0d1&amp;_uhb=1#ht_2102wt_1271](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Nineteen-Richter-59-cm-bike-frame-NEW-/181054263505?pt=Road_Bikes&amp;hash=item2a27acd0d1&amp;_uhb=1#ht_2102wt_1271)


I've already sent an email to the seller asking if he knows the spacing for the front and rear hubs, that way I know what wheels to buy. 

Can anyone help me figure out the other parts that I would need?

- Fork, Bottom Bracket, crankset, chainrig. I can figure out the rest (brake, rack, handlebar etc)

These are just thoughts for now. If there's a single speed bike that I find fits my budget and is decent, most likely i'll just scoop that up instead. But if and until that happens, chances are I'll be building this one. 

Your thoughts, advice, opinions and comments are always welcome!

The situation:  I popped off the plastic cover from the outside of the nut.  Inside the nut was some lube and some small metal shavings.  I was able to put everything back together with a socket wrench, without difficulty, and the threading didn't look like it was stripped, but...

The question:  Are those shavings evidence of some sort of damage or is it just post-manufacturing debris?  Does it need to be cleaned out and re-lubed?  And what can I lube it with?

I got the tires on the recommendation of my bike mechanic, hoping it was just my last set of tires that was the problem, but was disappointed to find that it was at least as difficult as before. I have a ridiculously hard time even just getting one side of the tire off of the rim. People much stronger than me and with more bicycle expertise have had trouble too, with both my old and new tires.

Then, if I do manage to get the tire off and get the new tube put in, it is damn near impossible to get them back on without the use of the tire lever, which of course, runs the high risk of puncturing the tube. The only way I've managed it is with someone helping me by someone actively pulling the slack of the tire toward the section that I'm trying to put on.  Fortunately, I haven't been stranded more than walking distance from home with a flat yet, but if/when that happens, it's going to suck.  Honestly, it's really not safe for me not to be able to fix a flat by myself, and the problem is not lack of knowledge or inclination.

So, what do I need to change?  It seems likely that the wheels are the issue, since this has happened with two sets of tires.  I really don't thing the tires are the wrong size, but is there some measurement I'm not taking into account?  If I do need new wheels, how do I go about figuring out which ones to get.

I knew it was machine built (they special ordered for it me at a really good price).  When it came in, the owner wasn't there.  I asked the tech's who installed it for me (I don't have a cassette tool) if they had run it through a truing stand.  He said 'well they're machine built' and basically shrugged it off.  Soon after I started riding I noted a pretty bad creak.  I thought it was my fenders running loose as I couldn't reproduce it on the stand.  Still nothing. Did some more research and found:

http://sheldonbrown.com/creaks.html#wheel

Which matches my symptoms exactly.  So I do a quick tension check and find ONE very loose spoke.  Like, it has probably 1/2 inch of play.  IT's on the non drive side.  I tighten it up to match the paired spoke on the non drive side and  true the wheel to better than it was from the store (it ran perfect through the stand and there wasn't any obvious loose spokes when I was done), however, on my ride this morning it still creaked quite a bit.  

I'm going to try to go back to my LBS and get them to resolve the issue.  There is another LBS that will rebuild the wheel totally for not TOO much (iirc it was around $35-40 for a total wheel rebuild), which may be an option if the place I bought the wheel from gives me some trouble about working on it.   

And for the record, it's a 36 spoke Velocity Deep V rim laced to Shimano 105 hubs.

Ugh. The rear hub has started to squeak and to me that means it's time to open it up, clean it out, replace the bearings and what not.

It's a newish bike (2012, ~400 miles on it), kept clean but ridden on limestone trails a lot. I recently put ten miles on it during a ferocious rainstorm on the trails and have had lots of issues with the derailleurs, cables, etc., so I'm not surprised to see it acting up - everything else has.

A little help, if you can:

* Does anyone have a different diagnosis for the squeak? It only occurs during slow revolutions, is a little intermittent and the sound corresponds well with a noticeable drag on a free-spinning wheel. It started as a chirp, chirp, chirp just a couple of days ago and has been increasingly quickly, though at higher speeds it either goes away or is unnoticeable.
* Is it worth fixing? Let's face it, it's a cheap-ish bike and even cheaper hub. I'd replace the entire hub (it's about $17.00) but that means rebuilding the entire wheel and I really don't want to do that - too much time and, frankly, I don't have the skills or tools.
* I haven't been able to find any documentation on the web about the Formula hubs so any tricks or advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone knows the specs and count on the bearings (1/4"" x 18 or is this a pre-assembled cartridge?) that would be a big help, likewise should I just plan on replacing the cones? For simplicity sake, I'll probably just use the Park grease but might end up with a little marine trailer wheel grease instead.

Overall, I'm very mechanically inclined though I have little experience with bikes. Conceptually, I get what needs to be done and have rebuilt axle bearing assemblies on larger wheels before. I have or will have the tools to do the job and actually think it might be interesting (weird, huh) and the worst case scenario is that I end up at the bike shop with a basket full of parts. They've seen it before, I'm sure. I'll take any advice offered, especially from anyone who has actually done something like this before.

Also, looking at a ton of other axle assembly pictures online, they all seem to have an extra spacer that I don't appear to have. I really, really think I have all the pieces, but I guess it's possible I lost a spacer or something.

Here are a few pictures of my axle assembly. They're laid out in the relative positions they were on the old axle (I think). I'm basically wondering if anyone could tell me if I'm definitely missing a spacer, or there's something else I should really know:

Step 7-9 discusses the dampening shims, this is where oil pours out of when unlocked, possibly the previous rider was very light-weight and reduced the dampening?  Still want to ensure I have everything back together correctly.

After riding it for a bit, I figured that the easiest rear gear while being on the largest front chainring, is probably lower than I'll ever need to go.   So now I got it in my head that I want to go 1x10.  A few questions/things though:

1) Right now, when I'm in my largest chainring up front, and my smallest gear in the back... the chain rubs the front-derailleur quite a bit.  I literally just got it out of the shop for derailleur adjustments a few hours ago... is this normal for 10 speed cassettes?   This is one of the things that is kind of prompting me to ditch the front derailleur to begin with. 

2) From what I've read, a new chainring is obviously recommended, but I guess it's not technically required.  Are the benefits of a 1x10 specific chain ring definitely worth the cost? 

3) This (http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=87847) is the chainring I was considering (I was thinking about going up to a 36t... my current big ring is a 34t).  

Do I need new bolts?  Which ones (preferably from here http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/SearchResults.aspx?Search=chainring%20bolts)

What about spacers?   I can't really find any? Are these a thing?

4) I guess I should also add that my current drivetrain is all Shimano XT, since I'm assume that affects the answers. 

5) IS there a way to remove my front derailleur without breaking my chain?  (Like does it come apart in a way that allows it to not be looped around it)?

6) Chain guides? Right now I have a blackspire dually.  IT has a bashguard and a lower chain roller, but no upper.  Is this even compatible with a 1x10? (I assume it would be, just that the roller would be a tad wider than really necessary... but not that big of a deal to me).   Will chain retention be fine?  I'm not a hardcore racer so dropping a chain every now and then isn't going to kill me... I was fine with no guide on my old bike for years so, I figure this would be okay, I just wanted to make sure. 


For now, I think that's all I have to ask.  Thanks so much in advance for the help.

So after taking it to my university's bike repair place (they couldn't identify it before so I thought I'd find the source here and take it to them to fix since they had the tools).

Anyways, I took my bike to the bike repair place and they rebuilt my bottom bracket. I took it for a spin, but the problem actually got worse and the wobble in cranks got worse as well. I took it back and they tried tightening it again but to no avail. After they rode it around (they couldn't before because it's usually a busy shop but they were perplexed at this point) they decided to look at the crankset. Sure enough, a bunch of teeth were worn off on the third and second gear (the ones I use the most) and I had only had this bike for less than a year so that was really weird. 

After they replaced the crankset the problem still persisted so they rebuilt my bottom bracket again since the wobble was still there. Upon doing that, they noticed that one of the cups had like an indentation thing on it so it wasn't tightening properly and was the main cause for my problem.

All in all, I'd like to thank you guys for your help, it was a little bit of what you all said, and I'd like to thank you guys for teaching me a bit more about bikes and being patient with me if I didn't understand your vernacular.

I figured it was better to post this here than to muck up r/bicycling. I'm having issues with my tires. Nothing insane, mind you, but I have started to dread riding for fear of another flat. I will try to provide as much information as possible and the ideas I have been mulling over.

My bike is a 48cm Specialized Dolce Sport from last year. I bought the bike secondhand in June of this year, nearly everything is stock at this point. So...the rims, rim tape, front tire tube, both tires are all stock. Rear tube is of course not stock as it keeps getting flats. 

I live in NYC and as such there's always glass everywhere or sharp little gravel rocks from the DOT resurfacing roads. The type of riding that I do is commuting throughout the week and then on the weekends I enter ""tours"" or go on 30+ rides with my friends. Sometimes I travel during the weekend to visit family and go on long rides. I would consider myself someone who prefers riding longer distances than just for commuting. I always try to ride on nicely paved roads but sometimes gravel/chips are unavoidable. I push myself when I ride but don't usually try to race unless I have entered a ride that I paid for. I try my best to avoid hazards but it doesn't always work.

My LBS told me to inflate my tires to 115 psi for the type of rides I go on, and my size. I'm female, about 140-145 pounds and fit. My tires are 700c x 23 mm and my rims say: ""Mavic CXP-22, S6000 622x15.""

The flats I get are from debris punctures. My most recent flat was causes by what looked like, I kid you not, a cat nail. I am constantly wiping and picking stuff off the wheels, but they are just so buttery and pick up tons of stuff.

I want to do longer and longer rides. I want to be able to do a ride bike/ camp along the way combo trip without having to take like 6 spare tubes with me. I did a century ride this past weekend and my flat tire really screwed me up.

A friend of mine works for REI and has installed Latex stand ins on his mountain bike and he raves about them. I've seen mixed reviews about them on Reddit. Probably the best advice I've seen on Reddit was to just eat the cost of new rims and tires for the tubeless road bike tires. I don't know how much that'll run me though.

So I've been researching Conti Gaterskins and Conti Gator hardshells and the Conti GP4000S. There are so many tires though, and I don't want to accidentally get one I can't corner with or is super heavy. It's already a little dicey carrying a fully loaded bike down the stairs of my apartment.

One thing for sure I know to steer clear of from what I've seen are the Slimer tubes.

I guess at this point I'm trying to decide whether to A.) just replace tires, use standard tubes, B.) replace tires and go with the caffelatex, or C.) go tubeless.

I have another big ride in two weeks, at least one more century ride this fall and I'm just sick of blowing tubes at inopportune moments.

Thank you for any help you can provide.

EDIT: I talked to my LBS owner today (not the guy who told me patches are worthless, don't worry) and we talked tires. He also said the gatorskins or armadillos would be great. He recommended actually getting a road touring tire for when I ride outside the city and swapping out for a tough puncture resistant tire for riding around the city. I don't really like the idea of switching tires back and forth, so I'm leaning more toward the Conti Gatorskins at this point. He also said to just replace the back tire since the front hasn't ever given me a problem. I was wrong on my size, I have 700-25c on my bike currently.

I live with my girlfriend and neither of us have bikes, so it would be awesome if I could get it riding again.

To be honest, I'm not even sure how you're supposed to shift it, but everything on the handlebars is seized.

They are original to the bike actually, and I'd like to keep them on there but I generally can't lock up either wheel under any conditions. 

I used to have some xtr brake shoes that took M65 cartridges but I stopped using them awhile back because replacement cartridges are hard to find. Currently I have some standard road cartridges on there (velo-orange). I can't say I see a huge difference between the two and from what layman knowledge I know of friction coefficients changes the size of the pad shouldn't change the stopping power, only the wear rate on the pad.

I have the rebound springs on the front brake on their highest tension, otherwise the straddle cable hanger is too loose and rattles against my headset. The rear is on the middle setting but I want to bump that one up too, the brake rebound just fine but there is a little slack in the cable when at rest that I'd like to take up. Even still though, I keep them closely adjusted, there is not much more than a mm of clearance between pad and rim at rest with the cable taut.

So what can I do? Is there some way of adjusting the straddle cable that will help? Will changing the rubber compound of the pads help any? Or do I need to just switch to a better brakeset with better leverage and stopping power?

Last time out, about halfway through my run, the chain came off the crank and got stuck between the frame and the crank (no biggie, this has happened a couple of times before) I flipped the bike over, guided the chain back into the crank, and all was well.

A few minutes later, however, I noticed the chain would slip every five cranks or so.  I stopped again to examine the chain for obvious imperfections, the derailleurs and crank teeth for signs of wear, but nothing.  I was able to rule out the crank since this seemed to happen in every gear.  My gut says it's either a problem with the chain or one of the derailleurs, but I wasn't able to spot anything with obvious. The chain looks to be in good shape, and the rear derailleur's tension and jockey pulleys appear to be in line. Googling the issue in every combination of words I could think of yielded only suggestions that it might be wear (this bike has probably been ridden ~20 times) and links to sheldon brown's site.

Before I take it to the LBS tomorrow I plan to take another look at it tonight.  Basically what I'm asking here is, does this kind of thing sound familiar to anyone, or are there some other troubleshooting steps I could take before handing it off to the experts?  I'd like to get better at maintenance so when things happen like this on the trail I can diagnose and fix on the spot, or at least keep myself from making things worse.

I am a complete newbie and really am looking to start riding more, and start using my bike for commuting again.  I currently have a '86 Cavaletto Centurion men bike that fits me perfectly (female 5'3""). I have very little information on it other then what I can find through Sheldon Brown's catalog post. If needed I can post pictures later, I am at work right now and can't. It is in pretty great condition for being that old with all the original parts when I got it for $12 at Goodwill. I put about $100 into it to fix a bent rim and general maintenance when I acquired it 5 years ago, and got at LEAST 1000 miles out of it over the course of several months. Sadly it has fallen into disrepair after moving to a few different states and being on the bus line that takes me directly to work.








The current issues I have with it are, the stem shifters will not stay in place (tend to drift down no matter what I do), something is rubbing causing a squeak and resistances (have not been able to find the source thus far, sounds like it would be a rubber on rubber sound and it is not the brake pads or the tires rubbing), the chain nearly derails when shifting and will not stop making noise against the front derailleur (I am guessing this is due to the shifter issue), the front wheel appears to still be or has rebent or untrued itself, and the brakes leavers (can't find a name for the kind I am talking about, but they aren't generally in use in modern bikes anymore, and are nearest the stem on standard drop handle bars) are really loose/warped and nearly come out of the hand brake on the curved portion of the handlebars. The wheels need new tubes and tires, but that is normal for it sitting for as long as it has and I don't consider a real issue.








My question is should I a) drop another $100 and get it refurbished professionally (Bike Farm in ATX), b) look into fixing it myself (know I have ZERO idea what I am doing so that could get interesting), or c) buy a ""new"" road bike with longevity in mind?









I am asking y'all because you would probably have the best idea of cost to future performance of my current bike vs cost to future performance of x bike. I really can not say how much I appreciate ANY help you can give!

I'm having a hell of a time getting the last little bit of the wire bead over the rim. I can get the first bead over, though admittedly it was tough, but getting the entire second bead is damn near impossible. I've already given myself a giant blister on my thumb from trying.

I've searched online and watched all the videos I can find on the subject but nothing is working. My first question is if anyone has any techniques that have worked for them in the past. My second question is why would these particular rims be giving me more trouble than I've had in the past. I can't count the number of times I've mounted tires and I've never had ones as difficult as these. The rims are Sun Swift SL-1 and as I mentioned the tires are Gatorskins.

UPDATE: Took the wheels to my local bike shop and paid them $5 to do it. They had to use one of these.

I have a 2007 Gary Fisher Mako with stock rims and 26x2.0 tires and 6100 miles.  Recently, if I pump the tires up to the max pressure (65, identical to the original tires), my brakes lock up.  It appears that my rims are expanding outwards or something.  Is there anything I can do about this, or do I need new wheels?  Are mine unsafe?  How can I avoid this in the future?  I reduced tire pressure to compensate, but I'm wondering if being exposed to extreme temperatures and weather has fatigued the rims.  

Thanks for any help.  :)

EDIT: While I was at work yesterday (a bike shop, actually) we put the rear wheel on the truing stand.  It's definitely failing.  The inner part of the braking surface (i.e. towards the hub) was true, and the outer edge (towards the tire) was bowing out in various places.  The braking surface itself is concave.  I never use the rear brake (except in icy conditions), so it is most likely from a combination of temperature fluctuations, inflation pressure/tire shape (26x2.0 is rather puffy), and having to ride a few miles on a flat a few years ago when I got stuck in the ghetto.  

I ended up ordering a new rear wheel.  The front wheel is beginning to suffer a similar problem, likely due to insane brake wear, but I'm going to wait a bit before replacing it.

I bought a single-speed bike second hand a couple of weeks ago, and seem to be having unending problems with it!

I initially had a problem with the left (non-chain) crank side working loose while riding, no matter how much I tighten the crank bolt before riding - I even purchased a set of allen key crank bolts to help me get it as tight as possible! After doing a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that the square taper on the crank must have worn out somehow, so I bought a [new set of cranks on eBay](http://r.ebay.com/y15vSK). Admittedly, these cranks were crazy cheap, and when they arrived, I inspected the square-taper fitting and observed that it looked pretty shoddy - not the ""perfect square"" I would have liked to have seen.

Anyway, I fitted them to the bike, all was well for a few days, and then exactly the same problem again - left-side crank coming loose mid-ride. I've been re-tightening when convenient, but given that the cranks were cheap and bad, and I wanted a different-sized chainring on the front anyway, I've shelled out a bit extra for some [decent branded cranks](http://r.ebay.com/npRCLR). 

But my question is this: if I fit these new cranks to my bike, how can I make sure this doesn't happen again? I'd hate to chew up the taper of another set of cranks if it comes loose again. I've seen some people suggest blue loctite, but then others state that this is only an interim solution at best. When I initially bought the bike I removed, cleaned, and re-greased the bottom bracket - and it didn't look (to my untrained eye) particularly worn out. Could this be the problem though?

On cable-brake bikes, switching the levers over the right way is easy.

Is there a way to take apart the lever and switch the lines ? Or in general, a recommended way to get them to switch sides, without opening the hydraulic loop ? Thanks for any pointers.

EDIT: thanks for the discussion. I went and switched side with the whole brake assembly, then realized the levers are positively meant to stay on the side they're meant for, switched the levers and now the logo on the brakes points down (there is not switchable cover that I can see) and screws point up, but it works fine.

- Buy the hub that I want, realise that it's a different size to the current hub, buy shorter spokes, fit the hub and new spokes.

- Buy the hub and a completely new wheel, fit the hub in the new wheel

- Buy a new wheel with the hub already fitted

Just to add, I have never built a wheel and would not carry out this work myself, I just want to know the facts and likely expense before I visit my LBS.

I had to pop in for a service regarding a creaky bottom bracket recently and wrote up a list of instructional notes for the drop off that were listed under their service details. Dropped it off and got a text to come pick her in the afternoon up but unfortunately the sales persons generally approach you to to return the bike as the mechanics go home when they're done so I had no one to talk to regarding technical stuff.

Anyway, I noticed the creak was still there as I took it for a ride before dropping it in my car and went back and asked if I could show them using the wind trainer. The guys mentioned they can't fix it (as they're sales) so one of the guys took it for a ride acknowledged there was a noise in the high gear and mentioned it was just lateral stress on the crank and just to keep a high cadence and it should be fine.

When I got home I had a chance to properly look at things and noticed that the sound was actually the chain rubbing against cage in both the high and low ring. If I manually move the chain over, the noise stops. On top of this, the shifts between the high and low on the front derailleur weren't crisp so I had to use the barrel adjusters to fix this, making the tension in the shift gear lever almost uncomfortably tensioned. The rear derailleur was also shifting poorly (hanging in certain gears) though this is something I can fix myself by just using the barrel adjuster. 

Finally, I noticed that the seat post clamp actually didn't belong to my bike. It's silver and black where my colour scheme on my bike is completely black as a part of its FSA finishing kit.

On my instruction sheet, I had also asked them to let me know of any chain wear but they didn't let me know.

I don't want to cause any conflict but I feel a bit let down as I was looking to riding on the weekend and don't want to end up with a beat up cage or making things worse. Am I being too unreasonable to expect these things? I feel like my bike should come back in a better condition than when it went in. What's the best way to approach my LBS and get these things fixed?

I ran a few flats two weeks ago on my back wheel.  Three years with this setup, never too many issues flat wise so I didn't think much of it.  Did a quick scan of the rim and tire, didn't really find much at fault.  Chalked it up to bad luck, new tubes, and kept going.

Ran another flat last week, found some potential issues on the rim, maybe?  The stock rims come with that weird plasticky rim tape?  Seems to cover all the spoke holes fine, in some places its a little off centre.  It's not really a tape so I can't really push it back to the exact of the inside of the rim but I put some rubber tape on places where it might be an issue, seemed to take care of the hard edges.

The tires I really really checked, I've put a lot of mileage on them, they're wearing out, but nothing sharp and no rips aside from a little tiny one that I patched up.  Another new tube and kept going.

Another flat yesterday.  So I checked all my tubes that have gone flat lately recently. All the holes seem to be on the tire side (outside) but in different spot relative to the valve. So I'm thinking tire issue right?  Figure I'd put in a new tube and buy a new tire today during lunch - crossing fingers that I don't run another flat in that small window.

(EDIT: Should note that all the flats to this point have been one tiny hole - indicating puncture flats, not pinches.  And also, I've used three different brands of tubes.)

So I wake up this morning and it's completely flat... UNUSED SINCE THE NEW TUBE I PUT IN LAST NIGHT!  Not even out the house yet.

When I tried to put the new tires on originally, I thought they were too wide, and wouldn't seat on the rim, so I hung them up and figured I'd use them on some other bike down the road.

The amount of pull to get to full on braking is only about a half inch, which I'm find and dandy with.  The problem is at full braking, I don't have room for my fingers to grab the handlebar which makes braking sort of daunting.

I can see the end of a screw inside the brake which is showing much more than my back brake, which is set just fine.  I have a hunch it has something to do with that.

I'm just trying to figure out if I can do this myself without worrying about fucking anything up too badly or if I should just take it in for a quick adjustment.

They are ~~shimano~~ Hornet hydraulic brakes, and the last thing I want to do is mess with them without asking anyone first

1. Tires. The rear rim is bent, so I'll need a new one anyway.
2. Chain and chain system. The chain system is rusty, so I want to get it a new one that's nice and clean.
3. Brakes. I can already see myself barreling down the sidewalk towards an intersection and have my brakes fail. Possibly can get by with just tuning, but may need to buy new ones.
4. Handlebars. This is more of a cosmetic change, but the current configuration of the handlebars is whacked up, and the metal is completely rusted.

After getting the functionality to where I want it, I'd like to repaint the frame to get rid of the Roadmaster decal and horrid paint job!

I include frames like the c'muter and the pacer because I'm having a difficult time choosing between the tradeoff: it seems like long chainstay bikes don't handle as responsibly. Is that right? Reviews seem to put the snappiness of surly frames as Pacer&gt;CC&gt;LHT. 

Are there any other frames (&lt;$500-ish) that I should be considering?

Now onto drivetrain - looking to do 2x10 for simplicity, ease of setup, elegance. I'm coming from a 12-speed 60s schwinn so I'm used to the double crankset, and I feel that at triple you're introducing more redundancy than actual versatility compared to certain 2x10 setups (or maybe that's just SRAM's propaganda getting to me?). Anyway, I'm looking to cobble together a budget version of SRAM's Apex group in terms of gear ratios. compact crank, and about a 11-32 cassette. 

The problem is that I'm starting the build with bar-ends for budgetary reasons. hoping to eventually get the funds to upgrade to brifters after owning the bike for a while. Not very picky between STI and DoubleTap but I'm worried about compatibility issues. Here's what I'm seeing for options:

* cranks: Tiagra/Apex, any issues doing tiagra crank+apex cassette?
* Front Derailleur - would anyting work? Should I just choose something cheap (sora/acera)?
* Either Apex or Deore cassette/RD.

My understanding is that the RD is what truly matters for brifters, and the FD shouldn't really care. In this case, is sticking with SRAM back there the way to go? I think I read somewhere that 10-speed deore has issues with shimano  STI's? I could use a 9-speed mountain RD for the STI's, but then I'd be losing gear and at that point it may be more practical to go 3x9, something i would rather not do.

So the latest adventure of my [second-hand bike](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1ifnck/advice_dealing_with_centrepull_breaks/) is under way, the problem this time is just identifying exactly what a particular bit of my bike is actually called. 

To fit a new light I bought, I had to remove the front brakes (well, technically it was removing the housing for the old, broken, light which required me to remove the front brakes). Unfortunately once I did that, the end-cap at the bottom of the centre of my fork fell out. and it turns out that (even though the rest of the fork is just fine), this cap is is seriously bad condition - it's rather misshapen, and now i can't get it in position to screw the brake-mounting bolt back through it properly. I may give it another shot, but I doubt I'll have much luck.

Unfortunately I didn't think to get a pic while working on it earlier. But to make it clear what type of thing we're dealing with, [here](http://i.imgur.com/7FhA46yh.jpg) is an image of the front brake. Just behind those two crossed arms is a bolt which runs through the tube, and also acted as support for this end cap. 

**So the real question(s):**
What the hell is this thing called? It's some kind of cap, located on the bottom of the fork (directly between the two legs of the fork, right above the front wheel). It appears to have been held in position exclusively by the bolt that holds the front brakes in their place - is it even important anyway? And is it something that I can easily find a replacement for? For what it's worth, the bike's a Peugeot, but new enough that everything is standard sizes (none of the weirdness involved with older French bikes).

Any answer would be great, but there are bonus points* if you can tell me what the German term for this is. I'd rather not make the local bike guys suffer through the above description in my very broken German…

There is some play in the bump/groove and I can get it to be well aligned at the extreme of the play. This is good enough for me.

The problem comes in when I'm riding, specifically when I'm starting and putting a lot of pressure on the frame. I've found that the handlebars will rotate to the default misaligned position and the shift can be quite jarring and dangerous.

A quick run-down of the build first:

* Titanium triathlon frame
* Sturmey Archer 3-speed with drum brake
* S-A Drum brake in the front
* Double front chainring
* Pursuit bars with TT brake levers
* Thumb shifters inside brake levers (https://www.dropbox.com/s/viz4k6oinajluif/IMG_20130618_224919.jpg)

And here's the problem I've run accross:  What's the best way to get the rear shift cable from the BB guide to the guide arm?  The guide arm for the hub sticks farther forward than the housing stop on the chainstay, so I can't run it normally.  I initially tried using a short section of housing from the BB to the arm, but that either interfered with the crankarm or introduced too much friction for the hub to pull the cable back in.  After a bit of tooling around, I ended up with this godawful setup:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihjxn7yxjhjxakj/IMG_20130701_203718.jpg

This has two benefits--first, it seems to be fully functional.  Second, it looks absolutely ridiculous, which is a bit of a goal for this bike.  It just seems a bit hammer-fisted to me, and I'd like to know if anyone has any other ideas on how I could cleanly and effectively route that shift cable.

Thanks in advance!

(Other problems I've encountered:  What is there in the way of useful shifters for S-A hubs that can go on a modern bike?  Solution was thumb shifters just inside the TT levers.  How to get better gearing options than S-A's wide range 3-speed?  Added front derailleur and double chainring with 46/38 gears to split it up nicely.  How to fit 117mm wide S-A hub into 130mm road frame?  Got my hands on internals from a different hub, used it's longer axle to span the dropouts, and spaced it out properly with a few nuts and washers.  How to attach the front brake's reaction arm to the deep-section TT fork?

So I'm riding a 1987 schwinn World Sport(Tour?). Anyways awhile ago I needed to change out my crankset and seeing as it would be all new teeth, I replaced the chain. I found out that the axle(bottom braket?) that was originally there, and that I was keeping, is really wide. So wide that the new crankset isn't close enough for the front derailer to be of use any more(I'm not too concerned as I RARELY use that other gear anyways). But then this new problem has come up. 

If I have the chain on the smallest ring in the back, it jumps. to be honest, I'm not really sure whats going on because if I put my bike on a stand, it doesn't do it. So this is only happening when there's real wieght behind the push. It could be jumping or something else. I just know that while riding it's a little crazy having something happen like two or three times in a full pedal rotation.

I went to the obvious answer that I need to adjust the limit screws and it'll be all set.

Nothing. Fucked with both the screws(incase I was adjusting the wrong one) and it didn't help.

If I put the chain on the ring next to it, no problems. In fact that's how I've been getting to class and work is running on this slightly bigger ring. This is alright, but sucks not getting the speed I'm used to, or having all my energy used. 

I had a rack on and thought that the screw might be the cause. But I took that off last week and still have the problem.

I'd like to fix it myself to gain some more knowledge/ fixing skills but I don't want to risk fucking up something as important as the gears. 

Should I try fixing it myself or should I let the pros do it?

I'll try to give complete information and background below, but basically I have three questions:  how much force should be required to move the handlebars if the front wheel is held in place, how do I adjust this force with an NVO stem and shim, and is this a normal problem or should I be worried that something is damaged?

For background, I rode over a couple hundred yards of rough road where I was forced to the far right, getting sucked into the seam between the gutter and the crumbling road, and I was using a little bit of force to keep the bike tracking and not let it get stuck in that seam and other lengthwise cracks in the road.  While I was doing this, my handlebars came thirty or forty degrees out of alignment with my front wheel.  Halfway through this length of road I stopped, braced the wheel against my leg, and realigned the handlebars.  After emerging from the rough patch I stopped and adjusted again, but the second adjustment was minor.  However, while riding home on relatively smooth pavement, the handlebars started to come out of alignment again, this time without any unusual force applied.

The handlebars have only come out of alignment twice before, when I first bought my bike and was learning what toe overlap was. 

My bike has an [NVO adjustable threadless stem](http://www.nvocomponents.com/), so the stem attaches to a shim that goes over the steerer tube.  The stem is not rotating around this shim -- there's a ridge on the shim that prevents it -- so I assume the steerer tube is rotating inside the shim.  I'm a bit uncertain because on a normal threadless stem, the stem would be rotating around the steerer tube, and I'd tighten the stem bolts (right?)  By process of elimination, I've decided the stem bolts serve the same function in my setup, but I don't know what level of tightness to shoot for.

Any guidance will be much appreciated!  Thank you!

EDIT:  There is a single stem bolt, and I just noticed it has a torque rating (7-8 N m) printed on the side.  I don't have a way to check the torque, though, and I'd rather know how to do it by feel anyway.

So the rear wheel is crooked, the hub (Is that what that part is called in english?) is broken and the spokes are all kind of messed up...

I've tried adjusting the barrell adjuster, fiddled with the + and - screws, and checked the chain to see if it is stretched and don't think any of those things are the problem.

The problem I see is that after I shift the droptube lever and then release the lever, I can see the cable gives up just enough slack (1/8th inch?) to cause the rear D to shift into a higher cog.  It's as if the droptube lever has slop in it.  Is this likely a problem with the lever or the cable?

I dropped my bike off at the LBS this morning with a hydraulic brake lever that would easily pull back to the grip, even when standing still.  If I lift the nose of the bike up and quickly pump the lever, I can get pressure back for a while, but it eventually fades away.  

They are now telling me that the pad and rotor are contaminated and that this is causing the sponginess.  However, I do not understand how a greasy pad and disc can cause a soft lever when the bike isn't moving and how pumping the lever fixes the the problem temporarily.

Am I being taken for a fool?

NOTE:  They originally quoted me a Brake Bleed, but now say that this will not solve the problem.

NOTE:  Shimano BR-M505

UPDATE:  Looks like I let my cynical side get the best of me.  They bled the brakes FREE OF CHARGE, kicked $10 off of a $20 wheel true because it ""wasn't that bad,"" and took the time to explain to me what was going on.

While he fixed the ""spongy"" feeling in the brakes with the bleed (again, for free), they still don't have much bite because of the contamination (he pulled a new one off the rack to show me the difference).  New pads and rotor will be here before the weekend, special ordered WITH NO DEPOSIT.

I definitely need to re-cable, and I think that might help, but I'm wondering if I should replace the brake levers with more modern style ones. I figure that might result in more pulling power?

What are your thoughts? Ideally, I'd like to not spend that much money here, but I wouldn't mind dropping $30 or so. Cables seem to be ~10 and new brake levers are $20 at the shop nearby.

Bit of a weird problem here to explain in words. But I just bought some CityRide tyres to replace my mountain bike tyres on my 26"" MTB and as these are my first new set of tyres (I'm basically orgasming by the thought of using them) I'm having a problem chucking them on.

[Here's some images showing the problem](http://imgur.com/a/gTFyn). Basically if you look at the white reflective strip, you'll see that parts of the strip are much nearer the rim than other parts. Thus I think the bead isn't pressed up against the inside of the rim, but rather curling under the tube.

My instinct would be to inflate the tube up to it's recommended pressure (as it's currently low) but I'm concerned that it might not fix the problem and damage something.

I looked back and my feeble little white boy heart sunk, my rear derailer was dangling by the chain.

The lock ring is plenty tight (I don't have a torque wrench, but I don't dare go much tighter) and there is no play in any of the cogs as far as I can tell. 

The wheel came with a little spacer washer that I didn't put in since the cassette came with its own.

I recently took my 1999 Mongoose D40R apart, cleaned (but did not service) all parts, and replaced all cables and am now encountering a problem with the rear derailleur not clearing the largest cog when shifting - the derailleur arm wants to shift inward but is not open enough and rides against the larger cog instead of shifting. All other shifting works fine including shift down from the largest cog after I've manually caused the rear derailleur to shift to it (i.e. pushed it in and opened it up). Chain length is proper and no slack in derailleur cable at any setting. All H/L screw settings seem fine and this is the same derailleur I had before I replaced the cables. Any ideas why it's not working after replacing the cable? Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: Took entire bike apart, so previous description of merely ""changing cables"" was inaccurate. I didn't service the deraillers or any other parts but rather just cleaned them. Fairly certain I didn't lose any pieces when putting the bike back together. 

EDIT 2: So no b-screw on the rear derailleur and the mystery continues. I'm taking it to the LBS tomorrow or the next day and will post another edit/update if they deduce a solution.

My current bike is using the Sora groupset and this cassette:

What it was doing on the trail is beyond me, but that's not the point here. The typical method -sand, cement, patch- seems like overkill in this situation, because the hole is literally the diameter of a staple.

I did some research into sealants, but the only things I could find seemed designed for preventative use, i.e. you squirt it into the tube beforehand and it seals up punctures as you go. Is there any reason that I couldn't use some strong adhesive like superglue to seal the hole? Would it hold up under the pressure when reinflated?

It has been sitting untouched in an underground parking lot for at least 10 years if not more, and is DIRTY.  There is light surface rust on all of the chrome surfaces, and the tires appear to be rotted through as well.  Mechanically it seems sound, except for three broken spokes on the rear wheel.

Im planning to clean and lube up the bike, as well as replacing the rotten tires with Conti Ultra Sport 27x1 1/4"" Tires, Mr.Tuffy tire liners; and replacing the rotten handlebar grips with Fizik handlebar tape with gel pads.  I will replace the brake cables, shift cables and liners as well as the cables where exposed are rusty as well.

Before I can order the parts and materials that I need, I want to know if I should source spokes and nipples to replace the broken ones on the rear wheel; or if I should hunt down a new/used aluminum 700c wheel set that is either compatible with my existing freewheel, or can be re-laced to my existing rear hub.

The parts on the bike as I recieved it are:

1341713511.0,7,self.bikewrench,w7dae,Yesterday my chain started to get stuck in between the big and small front chainrings every time shifting the front derailleur.,wantstoremoveagcoat,7,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/w7dae/yesterday_my_chain_started_to_get_stuck_in/,"I got it unstuck, but it will not shift properly any more.  It lands between the chainrings and gets jammed by pedaling.  I don't know what causes this.

Update 1:
Chain pic: http://i.imgur.com/JheYm.jpg
Nothing is obviously bent or loose.  There seems to be a consensus building that the space between the chainrings is too wide.  The small chainring does flare out just slightly- away from the large chainring.  Should it be like that or might they have installed in backwards, albeit it's curious for that to happen in the mid-80s and not to noticed until I rode it since the bike's always been with family.

Also it may be related to the distance between the lowest part of the derailleur and the big chainring as it is about 4.5mm.

Update 2:  [Edit:I THOUGHT] Problem was fixed with a quick derailleur calibration.  *facepalm*
I'm still considering moving the whole derailleur down by about 2mm just to optimize the shifting.

Thanks everyone for contributing your insights.  Upvotes for everyone!

Update 3: Test ride resulted in a some successful riding with shifting, but eventual failure.  Took bike to bicycle co-op.  Fiddled with front derailleur for an hour.  Moved front derailleur down on the seat tube by 2mm.  Still has the same problem.  A few guesses that the people there and I made:

The front derailleur cable is not installed properly- with bends that are much, much too sharp resulting in too much friction.  Will post pics tomorrow.  The chainrings are bent apart from each other.  They don't look obviously bent.  However this is a popular theory.  The small chainring does flare away from the large.  Might it be installed backwards?  Seems unlikely that if so, a problem wouldn't crop up until 25 years later.  Might be bent thou.  Will post pics tomorrow of the outward flair.  The teeth might be too worn, unlikely, as they aren't really so badly worn.  The chain might be too worn.  The chain might be the wrong size.  I will ask the bike owner if they've ever changed the chain.  They didn't mention it the last time I asked if they'd ever replaced any parts, thou.  The chain might be too long.

The most popular theory at the bike co-op was that replacing the front derailleur cable with a new one, installed properly this time, will greatly improve shifting and may solve the problem.  Also, that the chainrings may have been bent farther apart from the chain jamming in between them, and they may need to be bent back in using pliers, or by separating the chainring and banging it straight.  One guy told me he'd never seen this happen before.  No one really knows what's causing it.

I've had the bike for almost two years, and ridden about 8-10k km (5-6k miles).

In the last few months I've been having increasing problems with brake squeal in the front. Stopping power is still acceptable, though I avoid hard braking because the squeal is really annoying.

I've cleaned pads &amp; rims numerous times, re-adjusted pads with toe-in. Just last night I trued the wheel and  replaced the Kool-Stop dual-compound pads with new Shimano BR-M770 shoes (stock pads). This has only increased the squeal. I'm pretty confident that the pads are properly positioned.

I noticed when replacing the shoes that the brake arms have a bit of play. With the retaining bolt tightened as much as possible, I can still wiggle the arms a bit.

Is this play normal, or is it indicative of worn bushings? Other than ensuring proper headset adjustment (cable stop hanger is on the steerer tube), can you suggest other possible causes of squealing?

Edit 1: Tried a different wheel. Squeal was reduced but not eliminated. I suspect the wheel normally in use has low overall tension and this may be exacerbating the problem. Next step: more playing with pad positioning, double-checking headset adjustment.

Edit 2: Now that new pads have worn in a bit, squealing is much reduced. Thanks for all the help.",,False,,t5_2sje0,1341430548.0,,,True,t3_vovh8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/vovh8/cantilever_brake_squeal_due_to_play_in_the_arms/,

For those of you who are also doing this for the first time, a few things I've learned (and I haven't actually assembled anything yet).

* When you buy your frame, immediately inspect it to see if you need some simple (yet critical) things, like a seat post clamp, front derailleur clamp, or other small attachment/hangars.

* When working on any ""piece"" of the bike, make sure you have everything you need before you start.

* Don't try to install a headset and cut the steerer tube until you have spacers and a stem.

* Don't forget to have cables on hand when you are assembling the derailleurs and brakes.

I'm starting assembly next week, bringing the headset/frame/fork/spacers/stem to the LBS and learning from the wrench there how to install the headset, measure the steerer and cut to length. Then it's off to the workshop and I'm on my own (other than QA here).

Riding home in the cold tonight I hear a distinct pop/twang/thud and figure it is a broke spoke.  Being only a block from my house I just keep listening to make sure there is no mechanical interference taking place and rode on home.  Upon inspection my suspicions where confirmed in that I have a broke spoke on my rear wheel.  My questions are are as follows:  Can I continue riding the bike for my commute w/o causing damage short term? Long term? Can/does this indicate a larger problem with my wheel?  How important is one spoke to the overall strength of the wheel?  Will one spoke failing cause a domino effect of failures to adjacent spokes?  Do spokes have an expected useful lifespan, or do you just replace as needed? Lastly, as someone who does minor bike adjustments and maintenance can I perform a replacement of the spoke or should I leave wheel work to the pros?

edit:  [Here is my bike from a day before spoke break '11.](http://imgur.com/a/OWxij#0)

edit 2: New shit has come to light: I did drop the chain into the spokes about a month ago for the first time.  I just went to go inspect the spoke in the daylight and it broke a few mm from the hub, not an inch as I previously indicated.  It is a drive side, pulling spoke. I also quick tested the tension on the remaining spokes and noticed that the spokes on the non-drive side at the point of the failed spoke are somewhat loose. The spokes on the drive side seem to have the same tension while the spokes on the non-drive side seemed to have more variation in their tensions, however this is slight.

Update: Rode my bike to campus this morning and noticed that the wheel was definitely untrue when I was on the bike.  Took the bike to the bike shop next to campus that I have done some business with in the past and they got me fixed up for $18 which included a truing of the wheel, a spoke, and a nipple.  Went and picked it up after class and rode it all day.  I felt somewhat at ease riding the 3 miles to campus and then the shop based on the anecdotes given here, however I did take it easy. Bike mechanic at the shop said the wheel could last me a long time if I wasn't too hard on it but he suggested that I start thinking about replacing both wheel based on the difficulty in truing the rear wheel and the wear on the brake surfaces of both.  Anyway, based on the input here I won't be surprised if I start getting a few more failures and at that point I'll probably replace the wheel sets.

Short version: my front disc brake ""works"" but has very little stopping power and squeals extremely loudly. By ""little stopping power"" I mean I can hold down the (hydraulic) brake lever and still keep pedaling and moving, with some effort (and wake up the neighbors at the same time).
Long version: I bought this bike new two weeks ago and it's my first hydraulic brake system and my first disc brake system. I took it out for a ride last week and it worked great, but I noticed some occasional rubbing against the disc so I fiddled with it afterward. Being a hydraulic noob I loosened a screw I shouldn't have and squirted out mineral oil (oops) and sucked air into the hydraulics. I took it to the LBS today and the kind mechanic bled my brakes for me, which I figured would resolve any problems and I just took it home.
Now the hydraulics seem fine and the brake lever feels solid, but when I depress it while riding I get an extremely loud squeal and it only puts up some minor resistance, not nearly the kind of braking power I had when I took it out last week.
I will of course take it back to the LBS tomorrow but they're pretty swamped and I'm taking this bike with me on a trip on Friday, so I'm on a tight schedule. Does anyone have any ideas of what might be wrong? It would be extremely helpful. Thank you.

Line a bunch of zip-ties on some old cardboard and spray the underside of the zip-tie, that will contact the frame, with a few passes of the magic spray.

Unfortunately I don't have any pictures, but the hole where the spoke enters the rim were so big, that the spoke eventually could pull itself to freedom (no cracks or visible bumps, just a slightly bigger hole).

My spokes looks all right (no visible damage to the nipples), but my rim is obviously trashed. Could it be some kind of corrosion, and is this common? My bike sees a lot of salt during the winter.

I'm curious to what makes this happen? Is it the spokes? Too much/little tension on the spoke? Can I reuse my spokes or are they cursed?",,False,,t5_2sje0,1376602701.0,,,True,t3_1kfz6b,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1kfz6b/spokes_ate_through_my_rim/,

1376496198.0,6,self.bikewrench,1kcs5w,Question about Shimano compatibility - rear cassette replacement.,ErichUberSonic,6,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1kcs5w/question_about_shimano_compatibility_rear/,"Hi All, 
I'm looking to upgrade my cassette/chain on my [2012 Scott Speedster s30](http://road.cc/content/review/53749-scott-speedster-s30) as after 2.5k miles it has started to wear (this is my first road bike, I've gone a little hard on it). My question is as follows: 

If I purchase a [10 speed shimano 105 cassette](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RT81SY/), can I just switch it out with the old 10 speed tiagra cassette, or will I also need to replace the crank set as well? I wasn't planning on replacing any of the other components this year, just the cassette and chain. Is that going to be okay?  

Also, will it matter if I use a [105 chain](http://www.amazon.com/Shimano-CN-5600-10-Speed-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B0011ZDHA8/) or a [Ultegra chain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XDL5QO)? Prices are pretty similar, not sure what the difference is there. 

Thanks!
