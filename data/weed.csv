For a while now, I've been working on compiling an easy to use resource that contains an overview of anything and everything related to the cannabis plant. That goal turned out to be too lofty for me so I'm asking for the help of anyone who is willing to learn something new about their favorite drug! Some of the topics addressed in the attached pdf include but are not limited to:

* the anatomy of the bud you smoke
2. the pharmacology of thc, cbd and other phytocannabinoids
3. a little bit of history about marijuana use
4. an overview of the endocannabinoid system and insights as to why it 5. exists (why you are even able to get high)
6. a look at a couple of synthetics that are floating around
7. an in depth look at the metabolism of thc ingested both orally and via inhalation
8. information about drug tests (THIS IS A MUST READ)
9. the taxonomic classification of cannabis sativa and its subspecies
10. the chemistry behind thc's solubility in oils and alcohols
11. basic vocabulary (ALSO A MUST READ)
12. a look at the trichomes and how phytocannabinoids are biosynthesized
13. a whole slew of references (70, enough to explode my brain anyway)

Trust me, you don't know as much as you think you do. Of course this is a rough copy and errors may be present. However, I added in text citations for every single sentence in the document so check the source before you tell me I'm wrong. That being said, I'm sure I made some mistakes; I'm not perfect and I still have a lot to learn as well. All feedback is welcome. If you express interest in helping make this free source of information even better you of course will be credited.

1292881459.0,24,self.weed,eoz5w,Buying the bong that made me cry,justawesome,29,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/eoz5w/buying_the_bong_that_made_me_cry/,"I was fortunate enough to be in Germany this December visiting my girlfriends family. They live a short train ride from Enschede in the Netherlands. We visited the small town one day to relax in one of the coffeeshops. I forget which one or the address (not surprising :) ) but after we smoked a gram of k2 we visited the town. There isn't much to see if your giggling like a girl but when we got tired, we headed back to the same coffeshop. It turns out that next door to the coffeeshop is a place called magic mushrooms and it was a bong shop. It was well kept and because my girlfriend broke the pipe I bought in Amsterdam [25 mins after I bought it :-( ] I decided to have a look inside. Another thing I found about the place was that it stocked items a regular smoker would need eg a bristled bong cleaner! I had good vibes about the place and we visited it.

For its size it was not heavily stocked but most of the bongs were original i.e. no amsterdam logo's etc and very fairly priced ( very cheap compared to Amsterdam). There was a great selection of bongs and very few of the tourist orientated ones that you find littering the souvenir shops in Amsterdam. The main problem was that every bong was such a good price I struggled to choose one. Luckily a young guy in his mid twenties came over to help my girlfriend and I. He asked me what I was looking for and started to show me around his shop. The first two I liked he looked over and pointed out minor defects in the glass blowing and he didn't feel like selling them to me. I found one on the bottom shelf which I found appealing and it fitted my strict ""carry home"" specifications.

Then he set out to make sure it had the bowl I liked and dug around for pipe adapters that would make it work with my bong. This is not what you get when you shop for a bong in Amsterdam (or anywhere else for that matter). Most places don't have the ability to interchange parts and will rip you off like a tourist. Not to mention I managed to get a bong cleaner the right size from him (this impresses me for some reason, but if you smoke a lot you know the reason).

When it came time to pay my bong was 10 euros's, in other words fuck all and it was hardly anything for the cleaner and adapter. The sad part is, while we were chatting the young man was telling me how the new government was limiting the weed tourism and in the next 2 years they were expecting the surrounding head and coffeeshops to close down.

He was explaining to me that he wasn't stocking his shop because he was going to lose it and he'd barely been open in the last few months. While I was listening to him it struck me that this guy was losing his business but more than that it was his passion and it was being taken away by a prejudiced government. If I had been living in the Netherlands that could just have easily been me running that shop. This was striking all the sensitive chords in me and I just wanted to embrace him because it looked like the thought of losing his shop was really hurting him. 

When I paid his till had clearly not seen much action and he didn't have exact change, which he  looked embarrassed about, but I asked him to keep the change. This was unacceptable to him so he presented my girlfriend with some Holland souvenirs that he had from the front of his shop. 

I left his shop with a tear (freezing) running down my cheek, and I needed to have a spliff in his honour.... They say its good to share your feelings and here they are. If anyone in in the Enschede area please support his shop. This guy made my holiday and I just wish some good karma would go his way. Thanks for reading.

One simple way for this to happen is if it was growing all over the place.  People commonly dispose seeds, because these can be weighed by the pigs and increase sentences.

1.  I submit, that if you are smoking pot you are already breaking the law in many places, but especially in the US because of draconian, racist laws.

2.  There is a reason it is called weed.  Because it grows and acts like a weed.

3.  Millions of seeds are destroyed, everyday, FOR NO GOOD REASON.

4.  These seeds can be casually dropped in public areas (does anyone remember The Great Escape?), at the beginning of spring, or even TODAY, and some will grow and even spread.

5.  City budgets are being slashed.  Maintenance of public land is one of the first things on the chopping block.  This year may be the best ever to ""Green with Weed.""

Use your head, and be safe when you drop a seed.  A highly maintained building front is not the best place to drop.  A ""green island"" in a public parking lot is probably better.  A few yards beyond the ""mowing zone"" in a large public place is the best.

When you drop, don't do so with the intent of growing for production.  If you want to do that, there are hundreds of articles to help get you started.  This method is for ""seeding"" the public mind with the fact that NATURE CANNOT BE ILLEGAL.  If however, you have some success with this technique, post a picture on imgur and drop a link here.

We're going to be taking over here as moderators because eloisius and worldsdet aren't really into it anymore, and we feel like reasonable stoners on Reddit need a decent place to go.

As you may or may not know, r/trees has recently completely gone to shit.  [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/f3i0r/50k_ents_is_just_too_much_without_any_rules_this/) post by JoeNaguib basically outlines the problem--there are just way too many people and content quality is at an all time low.  Cait and I would like to see this subreddit become a home for stoner Redditors from r/trees and from other subreddits a like, and we can't do it without all of your help.

There are going to be some changes around here.  Cait and I are working on a new design, banner, and style sheet.  You also might notice that you now have to be an approved submitter to make submissions to this subreddit.  This is to deter folks from posting bullshit and spammers from posting spam.  If you PM Cait or I, I can almost guarantee that we'll have you added as an approved submitter within the next couple of hours.  Approved submitters are exactly what we need because we need submissions!

So, if you currently have this subreddit front-paged along with r/trees and you post there, or if you have it front-paged alone, but rarely check it out or post, give us a try over the next few weeks and see what you think.  Cait and I just have an idea, but together, we can build this into a community--one free from by so much awful content that decent posts don't receive the upvotes they deserve.

I did ample amounts of research on how to make effective cannabutter and mine seemed to turn out great. Any suggestions on more efficient ways are welcome!
 

Cannabutter Recipe


Ingredients/tools:

1/4 oz of weed (~7 grams)

1 stick of butter (1/2 cup)

filtered water

a stove 

a pot (or a crock pot)

an oven

baking tray

metal mesh strainer

digital thermometer that reaches 200+ degrees F (optional)

plastic tupperware (simply my preferred container)



Directions:

1.	Bake your weed in the oven at 300°F for 15 minutes for decarboxylation (one of the most important steps! Seriously, it won't burn. Without this step, your cannabutter will not be near as potent as it could be!)

2.	put ~1 cup of water in the pot on the stove and heat until it is boiling and then add your butter. You want to keep plenty of water in the pot or you will burn your butter. The more water, the slightly harder it is to drain later but it's totally worth your butter not tasting like burnt shit. 

3.	Add your decarboxylated weed to the water and butter. I ground mine up first but it probably doesn't make much of a difference.

4.	Keep it at a steady but moderate boil at at least 200°F. Add more water if too much of it boils away. 

5.	Boil for 5 hours, stirring every 15 minutes or whenever it starts to boil too much. 5 hours may seem like a lot but it has been tested by the scientists at Cannalytics (which sounds legit) to make a relatively significant difference in the amount of THC that gets dissolved into the fat of the butter. 

6.	After 5 hours, pour the water and butter into the tupperware through the mesh strainer. I would suggest metal mesh over any type of cloth or paper because metal doesn't absorb oil. (Same reason you don't use paper coffee filters. It soaks up all the oils and makes your coffee tasteless and bitter. Seriously…you Folgers drinking motherfuckers are no better than crack addicts) Then use a spoon to mash all the leftover weed to squeeze as much oil out as you can. You can even pour more hot water through the strainer to get as much oil out as possible. 

7.	Put the lid on and put it out to cool off at room temperature. After a few hours of sitting out, you'll see the butter separate to the top and the nasty looking water at the bottom. At this point you should put it in the fridge overnight to let it fully separate and harden. 

8.	If using plastic tupperware, gently squeeze the tupperware until gaps open up to allow water out and pour all the useless water down the drain. Clean off the gunk at the bottom of the butter if you want. It's just watery weed gunk, not useful. 

9.	Use just like normal butter to cook with. I suggest using 1/2 cannabutter and 1/2 boring butter when baking as a potent but frugal ratio. I ate one brownie (16 brownie batch to half a stick of cannabutter, half a stick of boring butter) and was pretty amazingly blasted for 3 or 4 hours. Although it did take an hour to kick in.

1351370799.0,17,self.weed,126sar,Weed high has changed for me.,Icemanrussian,18,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/126sar/weed_high_has_changed_for_me/,"So I have always been the occasional smoker, ever since I was 15. I never smoked daily, just because at the time when I did start smoking weed, I promised myself I would never turn into some failure because of it. I got this image in my head simply because I saw a lot stupid pot heads in my first year of high school, and I was acquainted with some, and all I ever knew from them was that they always failed at their classes.

Now, going to the present time, I'm finishing up high school career this year, and having a lot of uncertainties, doubts, and anxiety about my future. Much of this mentality is being portrayed in my life at the moment, all due to the whole “college application process” at the school I go to(I transferred to a college prep/private school after my freshman year; I kiss my parents feet everyday for an oppurtunity it gave me, academically..). 

During the school year, I smoke less than the summers. At most, it would be every friday, as a “break day”. Now, I've been smoking almost half the week. It's been really weird, and the high has changed for some reason. 
 
Know that this is some dank indica. 

All my highs are now just not “relaxed, hungry, creative mode”, but it feels more of mental drug for me, somewhat like LSD experience(from my research); it's more of a mental, deep thinking drug, along with some hallucinations.

Weed for me is like that, only without the hallucination part. For some reason, I'm getting some good work done, and I'm not as anxious about how much time im spending on it, or whatever ADD symptoms I have. 
With some my medication Vyvanse, and a small toke in the morning, I get things going. I somewhat during the day, recollect myself and think to myself, “why am I taking this medication? I feel trapped because of it.” 

So in the end, I'm getting things done, and find it more easy to put everything in order and do it in order, as in what I need to get done through the day. 

Anyone have some similar experience(s)?

At first I thought I had stepped on a bug, but looking down I saw a zip-tie, and I know those things make odd noises when you step on them.

I then lifted my foot and found a mushed beetle.

So both times I was incorrect, maybe.  I had stepped on both a beetle and a zip tie, both capable of making the same exact noise.

Then I started wondering, did I step on the zip tie and not the beetle, and it had been squished at an earlier time? Did I step on the beetle and not the zip tie, and the zip tie was just a silly coincidence.

I stared at the scene for about 10 minutes before I came down enough to go back in my room.  It boggled me for a severe amount of time.  It still does.

ive looked on google with little luck but heres my story: after using the vap with some old weed left overs i got a very bizarre experience, i started feeling light-headed so i sat down and started taking deep breaths. little did i know that the worst was yet to come. after sittingdown i couldnt feel my heart at all, and my head felt wiegthless, but then i started to feel very relaxed, very weak and everything around me started goign black, (i know TCH is a vascular constrictor but i didnt know its responsible for this: ) aside from everything going black i felt as though my extremities (arms and legs) were being pummeled by millions of diffrent bums everysecond. my fingers and hands became VERY tense, moving my fingers felt as if they were hooked to weights and moving them ( simply squeezing a fist) was very difficult. aside from that, if i relaxed my fingers they would contract into this weird like position (as if muscles were not contracting, see here: http://www.netterimages.com/images/vpv/000/000/032/32969-0550x0475.jpg). after 20 minuets or so it was over and i could make a fist with ease, however my hands and fingers hurt quite a bit the following day. 

 (if you can, give me a better answer then ""you didn't breath enough"" because its to obvious. )

I hadn't noticed because the process was just gradual it looked normal. 

I'm going off to a real university from Juco. I'm sure I'll start doing it again a little at least. My new room mate I got matched with is an admitted pot smoker every day.

Needless to say I didn't even think that I would get a reply, much less from a Texas rep.
But I got this (http://imgur.com/Wd6pg) in the mail just 2 days ago, so I'm sharing it with all of you Ents. I was very excited! It's legit, a personal signature and everything (none of that printed signature bullshit).
I wrote about misconceptions and myths surrounding weed, scientific proof of benefits, destruction of innocent lives, wasteful government funding of a useless war, medical benefits (cancer, glaucoma, etc..), potential tax revenue, benefits of decriminalization (less polluted jails). I should have taken a picture of what I wrote but oh well.
My main reason for posting is to get people to take action and that it wouldn't hurt to write something, even if it's just a page long.. just mail it away. It will definitely get noticed and if it isn't necessarily backed by your senator/rep, at least you are raising awareness to the fact that ""public opinion on....marijuana"" is shifting. Especially if you live somewhere like me, where it's highly unacceptable to use marijuana. We have no where to protest, no where to gather and march, etc.. (fucking conservative ass little Texas city) So the next best thing is to call and write.
Sadly, not enough people do this. So please please please write and call (If you send e-mails, you'll probably get ignored/automated responses.. they DO NOT take e-mails seriously). If you can't do one, do the other. Every little bit helps.
www.norml.org has a bunch of information on how to contact the right people, take a little bit of time and do it. Let's get this shit legalized. Demand change! (Hopefully this year)

Weed is legal where I live so that's something in my favor(Although I don't agree that laws dictate whether an action is morally right or not). So far I've planned to argue:

*Weed is not as bad as alcohol and yet weed is socially unaccepted while consuming alcohol is something that people see as normal.

*Weed is not addictive.

*Weed is legal where I live so I will most likely not get in trouble with the law just by using it.

*There are no historical records in which someone has died by using weed, it is also impossible to overdose on it.

I just want to have a rational conversation with my parents. Do you have any tips? Have you ever been in this situation before? Do you have any related stories you would like to tell?

True Story.,Curiouscrispy,10,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/15t0cn/haunted_batch_of_mids_true_story/,"So it's long gone now, and I'm new to Reddit or I'd have had pictures and posted about this shit sooner.  About two months ago we stopped by our dealers place for a quad of mids--we stop in bullshit for a minute we get the stuff and are on our way home when the first of a string of unusual and unfortunate events begins to unfold.  

We're riding our bikes (we can drive, but we're gym rats so this makes more sense) along the route we always take when my front tire catches a seemingly harmless crack in the sidewalk, stopping my bike cold in it's tracks.  I flew forward and caught the handlebars across my pelvis.   It hit me so hard that it dislocated my leg partially from the socket (unbeknownst to me what the real issue was)  We got home (smoked some) and were watching TV when I kicked back in my recliner and my leg came the rest of the way out of the socket.  A Dr visit and a few trips to the chiropractor later I was pretty much recouped.  

The next time we smoked on these mids (we primarily smoke dank) everything seemed normal, until we began to hear our neighbors arguing. Shortly after that we were treated to a burning Dodge Ram pickup truck on the street right in front of our house. And the slide of our bong got broken. 

Another bike crash resulted, as well as just a multitude of bizarre occurrences out in public. We marked the baggie as haunted and put off smoking it (we were planning on a Ouija board seance and etc to find out if it was haunted or not) for a good stretch of time. We procrastinated too long on getting a Ouija board and one night we decided to just go ahead and use it.  

When I was breaking it apart I found a feather (I think it was some Indian burial ground spirits or something). Anyway--we smoked it and I went to bed, no problem.  When I woke up at 5:30am to go pee, the bathroom light was on, door closed,  and all I could smell was the most putrid stench of shit I had ever smelled. I thought it incredible that the roommate would be up shitting at this strange hour, so I go to the basement bathroom/laundry room when I see his clothes covered in diarrhea.   

After I went to bed he was sleeping on the couch with his dog--when his dog had a horrible bout of Montezuma's Revenge and shit allllll fucking over him and the couch.  It smelled like Gary Busey and Tom Waits were pissing on the rocks in a sauna.  It was just god awful.  Not to mention that this Rat Terrier/Shelty mix puppy laid some of the longest nastiest human-sized turd logs on the couch that I never would have guessed came from a small dog.  They smelled like ammonia soaked underwear that were passed back and forth between Larry the Cable Guy and Tensai from the WWE.  They never actually wash them to get them clean, they just ammonia dunk em and let em dry.  Yeah--the living room smelled like that. 

I swear to God, that weed was haunted.",,False,self,t5_2qhpc,False,,,True,t3_15t0cn,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/15t0cn/haunted_batch_of_mids_true_story/,

backstory...
 the other night some friends and i went to the movies. we toked up as we always do, everything's fine.. i took a really big hit unintentionally that went straight to my lungs leading to a bad cough  due to a bong pipe sticking to the stem as i tried to pull the piece off to clear the hit. it stuck to the stem and pulled the stem off leading the bong to pull more weed through at the same time i breathed in heavily trying to clear the hit.

Weird Part...
So we get to the movie and everything's fine until we begin to sit down. My body went completely numb almost immediately and stayed that way for about 5 minutes and this kept happening periodically throughout the movie. I thought i was tired and that id end up sleeping through the movie no big deal, but instead i just sat there, eyes open, watching everything and not being able to feel any of my movements. i would lean forward to stretch out a bit then lose my sense of balance (while seated) thinking i was gonna pass out, so i would lean back again.. and this went on the entire 2 hours we were at this movie... another thing that happens to me when ever im stoned aside from that is I constantly feel like I'm opening up my urethra to pee... constantly anxious/nervous that id have pissed myself. even if i would pee before leaving the house or something...

TL:DR after smoking before a movie, my body kept feeling numb and  paralyzed while i was seated in the chair and i constantly feel like I'm pushing urine out my pants while I'm high. not sure if its a pot issue, anxiety issue or what. 

im sorry to bring the mood of this sub down with my awful post, but I'm really hoping someone might have some insight as to whats going on. this whole pisslucination thing is really bothering me to the point to where i think ill never be able to smoke again because of it.",,False,self,t5_2qhpc,False,,,True,t3_1k4q6j,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/1k4q6j/had_a_weird_experience_with_smoking_trying_to/,

What it says: 
""GravHits is a creative alternative to the conventional practice of simply 'remembering' how many bong hits are taken by each person. Use the GravHit chart to tally each Bong hit taken by each person. Tally's can be anything you want as long as they resemble some sort of number. Watch the tally's get more and more creative as you take more hits. Save your chart as a testament to how stoned you got!""

For a little clarification: 

* Jake's 3 is the hebrew number for 3. 

* Myles's 5 is the Russian word ""pyat"" meaning ""five""

* Myles's 3 is a bird's eye view of a buffalo running. (Like said in the footnotes) ",,False,self,t5_2qhpc,1370926427.0,,,True,t3_1g3nc6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/1g3nc6/cool_idea_me_and_my_friend_came_up_with_gravhits/,

The first couple of times I smoked weed (about 8 or 9 times), Was with a friend of mine. Now keep in mind these times I smoked, I never got high. He was Jewish, and when i say Jewish I mean stingy with his weed. I didn't realize this until I became an avid smoker later down the road. We would go to his balcony and smoke like 2 hits out of his one hitter, and that's about it. After about 2 hits he would be stoned out of his mind, listening to pink Floyd and acting hilarious. I however would always tell him I'm not high, and he would reply with ""dude, you just gotta sit back and let it happen, your minds not letting it happen. BULLSHIT haha.
       Well one day this girl I liked named Kelli Invited me to smoke weed with her, and to impress her I agreed. On Sunday morning, her parents left to go out of town, so we went to her back yard and she brought out this small sized bowl/pipe. I was damn scared I'll tell you, cause at the time I thought I was getting into some serious shit. I can remember, I was so nervous, shaking, stuttering my words when we talked. Luckily, she thought it was cute, and showed me how to smoke out of the bowl. It was my turn, and I suddenly felt at ease with doing this. I felt like such a fucking badass lol. We took turns back and forth hitting the bowl until she was out of weed (we smoked about a gram and a half). After it was over, I still had felt nothing. I was so disappointed; she kept asking, are you high, are you high? I said no, but we got in her car to go get something to eat at popeyes.
      Right before she started her car, she said ""oh shit, I left my bowl in the backyard"" and we both started laughing as she went to go put it away. As she left she put on ""Drop the world"" from little Wayne CD, and closed the door. It was at this point, when the music came on and I watched her walk to the backyard, I knew I was high. The music was fucking INCREDIBLE. I had heard nothing like it before, I was In tears because I thought it had sounded so beautiful. I started uncontrollably bobbing my head to the song. everything around me was in slow motion, and my body was vibrating all over. I felt so great. She came in the car and there were tears in my eyes, so she stopped and looked at me. She started getting all upset, and was like ""what's a matter, are you okay?"" The only thing that could come out of my mouth was ""FUCK YES"", and we both starting laughing so hard we couldn't control our laughter.
   The best part of this story, is that we were in a convertible with the top taken off, and her next door neighbor was standing in his lawn, with the hugest grin on his face looking at us as we drove off.

To this day every time I listen to that song from Lil Wayne, I get intense nostalgia. ",,False,self,t5_2qhpc,False,,,True,t3_qawna,http://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/qawna/itt_reddit_tell_me_about_the_first_time_you/,

My dic was completely out of action and my mind quite so too.

The best i could do was try and shove people away from me as i watched my girl get fucked by two people i thought to be friends.

Anyway afterwards i expressed my distaste to my girlfriend who said it was my own fault and that she had fun but I cant help but feel raped, i never agreed to any of it yet i never said no.

Not even 20 hours into it I am beginning to feel emotionally unstable and I'm expressing aggression towards people I would otherwise enjoy. I also have this one friend, whom I met last semester, who tends to dislike me when I'm not high. He also refuses to enjoy himself being around me if weed isn't involved. I love being around him either way, but not if he's going to be unsupportive. The way I see it, I have two options smoke weed and suffer possible academic consequences, or lose my only good friend at college.
