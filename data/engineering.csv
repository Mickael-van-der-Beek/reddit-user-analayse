Walmart Employee: Yes, but they are a different business group, and we don't share prices between departments.

Me: Ugh, fine. (walk over to housewares) Hi, can you tell me how much a shower curtain costs?

Walmart Employee: Certainly. What conditions is it going to be used for?

Me: Um, a shower? Should be a pretty standard thing.

Walmart Employee: Okay. Would this be a shower with water, or superheated molten sulfur?

Me: Water! Why would... who would even...?

Walmart Employee: What is the temperature and pressure of this ""water""?

Me: I guess 90 degrees or so... I'm really just trying to keep my floor from getting wet.

Walmart Employee: What is the required curtain size?

Me: Isn't that a standard thing?? Like 6 feet by 6 feet or something?

Walmart Employee: And what are your material requirements for the curtain?

Me: Plastic I guess... Isn't that what they're normally made of?

Walmart Employee: Would that be a Polyhydroxybutyrate, High Density Polyethylene, or Polyvinyl Chloride?

Me: I... I don't know. Whatever is cheapest I guess.

Walmart Employee: And do you need the reinforced grommets option?

Me: Grommets? I honestly don't care.

Walmart Employee:  Would you consider our deluxe package with magnets and suction cups to keep the curtain in place?

Me:  No, no, no.  Please.  I just want your basic, run of the mill shower curtain with no frills.

Walmart Employee: Will you be purchasing shower curtain hangers as well?

Me: No, I just need a price for the curtain.

Walmart Employee: It is important to replace the hangers when you replace the curtain. In the event of a hanger failure, you would be facing a catastrophic water spill in your shower room.

Me: I already bought them elsewhere. I don't need them.

Walmart Employee: Let me take 30 minutes of your time to explain why our shower curtain hangers are superior to our competitors in every way...

Me: NO! I don't need them! Can you please just tell me how much a shower curtain costs??

Walmart Employee: Absolutely. All you have to do is put all the information you just told me into an email and send to SALES@WALMART.COM

Me: Why?? Why can't you just tell me how much it costs?

Walmart Employee: Our shower curtains are an engineered product. One of our applications specialists will examine customer requirements and designate a net price based on company resources.

Me: Fine! Please just get back to me ASAP.

But, i dont think its sensative, like, im not going to upload schematics and system diagrams, This would be, legally, Ok?


If i was to upload my photo's (hundreds) would you guys be interested





EDIT: Wow, wel i decided to do it after 3 people said ok xD. Il upload them when i get back this afternoon! Thank god for a 10mb/s upload speed.

just for some proof, But il get onto it all later. I just didnt want to upload a few hundred photos for no reason :P



EDIT2:


Ok im currently uploading around 15gb of pictures, then i will start putting them into catogories, and try to write some descriptions. This is might take a while, but will try and get it all done today! Watch this space! 



EDIT3: im on lunch atm, 1 of 4 albums uploaded, another 12gb to go.... i will leave it on until i get back later! and i accidently duplicated 60 pictures....will fix later...

I worked as an engineer at a fabrication company (water slides). The company took on a rush job and missed the completion date. Although I worked for 3 months designing and producing drawings the manufacturing was never started. During this time whenever asked by the customer I would let them know where I was with the project as far as engineering goes. If I am ever asked if manufacturing is on schedule I would tell them to ask someone in manufacturing.

Later I find out the owner of the company I work for (let's call him dick) took a $158k down payment and was lying about being on schedule. Well, dick never gave back the down payment. So the company that hired us sues the company, dick, the salesman and me. They say I defrauded them by saying manufacturing was on schedule.

I've been long gone from the company but the suit lives on. Now dick is dead, US Slide is closed and the lawyers are still coming after me for $170k.

And it was awful.,YourFormerBoss,459,231,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1edr7a/i_had_to_fire_a_guy_today_and_it_was_awful/,"I run a small job shop that does contract CAD work. Times have been tough lately due to the recession and more and more work going to bigger firms with more ability to advertise and cut rates because they hire low-skill CAD techs with associates degrees while I have a staff full of degreed engineers.  
A couple months ago, I had to pull back bonuses in order to make payroll. Some of the employees were pretty mad, but should I really pay bonuses to a few employees while laying off others? One employee in particular was very incensed about not getting his bonus.  
Because things are so tight around here almost everyone pulls extra hours when there is work, but the problematic employee didn't feel like his extra hours were appreciated enough, and he complained loudly. In order to save money (this is a small firm here, I don't exactly have float to buy Herman Mill Aeron chairs), we use some older furniture. The troublesome employee complained about that too. I gave him a laptop to work at, so he wouldn't have to sit at his ""horrible 80's desk"" but he thought working from a laptop was insulting.  
Once things got really tight, I actually ""hired"" a friend to do some work for the company. By ""hired"" I mean he was literally working for almost nothing, he was in between jobs anyway and he offered to get some work done for us so we could hopefully get some momentum going business wise. This, too, incensed the troublesome employee because the felt like I was giving favors out to my buddies with no justification.  
  
Eventually, I had to fire the employee. He was just a toxic presence to my company and after I fired him, it was amazing how everyone in the firm said it was a change that needed to happen a long time ago.   
I hope that employee finds some other place that he is happy to work, because he certainly wasn't built for a small entrepreneurial company like mine.",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_1edr7a,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1edr7a/i_had_to_fire_a_guy_today_and_it_was_awful/,

1364746766.0,223,self.engineering,1bd361,"Is the common ""engineers are in demand"" advice a scam?",Joscelin2,297,74,393,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1bd361/is_the_common_engineers_are_in_demand_advice_a/,"I'm just wondering if anyone else is having the same experience as me. I got a degree in 2010 in Chemical Engineering with a 3.7 GPA and research experience, but I can't seem to find any work beyond temporary low paying lab-tech jobs. I have a spreadsheet of jobs I've applied to and I've applied to over 2000, and I've gotten a whopping 10 phone interviews and 3 in-person interviews. Most of the phone interviews I find to be very rude. For example, last week I had an interview that went like this:

INTERVIEWER: Have you worked with Aspen [EXTREMELY SPECIFIC VERSION]

ME: No, but I've worked with Version X and it's very similar. I'm sure I could easily learn your company's version. 

INTERVIEWER: A yes or a no is all I need.

My advisor told me companies do this because they're legally required to disqualify a certain number of U.S. candidates before they can apply for h1b visas. There's an article in my local newspaper right now talking about a local company who claims they can't find enough engineers. I can't help but think they're full of shit. I've noticed that none of these kinds of articles are supported by actual data (i.e. we have 10 openings but only 8 qualified engineers applied). They just talk vaguely about how we need more engineering graduates. I think it's really code for ""we want to pay our engineers less.""

I've had my resume reviewed by quite a few people, and no one can find anything wrong with it. In fact my school's career counselor told me it's one of the best resumes she's seen. I'm aware that I'm not a spectacular candidate since I didn't do an internship, but surely there should be jobs for average people too? 

Most of my friends from college are in a similar position. Those that found real engineering jobs had a **close** friend or family member who pulled strings for them. I'm a first generation college graduate, so my family can't really help as far as networking, and my close friends are in the same position as me. I know I'm going to be told to ""network more"" but making close friends in hiring positions is a long and exhausting process. 

I feel kind of like I fell for a scam. Engineers aren't really in demand, and I wasted 4 years of my life working towards entering a field that I'll never be able to. 

Anyone else in a similar position right now? Can anyone in a hiring position comment on if there's really a ""shortage"" or candidates?

EDIT:

Wow! I didn't expect the overwhelming number of responses. I haven't had time to read or reply to them all yet, but I've skimmed most of them. I didn't make this thread with the intention of getting career advice. I only intended to discuss the current demand for entry level engineers. But most of you have offered it and I am thankful for that. To those of you who think I've been sitting at home doing nothing for the past 3 years: that's not true. I've been working as a temporary lab-tech for very low pay ($9/hr) so I'm technically gainfully employed. The company I'm working for keeps extending my contract, but it's pretty much impossible to get a full time position with them without a PhD. I've also found odd jobs for weekends on craigslist to help make ends meet. 

A few people have called me ""elitist"" for not wanting to be a lab tech. I would be perfectly content to be a lab tech for the rest of my life, if only it paid a living wage. Right now I'm blessed with a very healthy 1 year old, and I lose sleep at night when I think of what might happen if she ever needs medical care beyond a standard check up. Not to mention raising a child in a studio apartment on $9/hr and food stamps in one of the most expensive areas in the country kind of sucks. Sure I could relocate, and I'd be happy if a company would be willing to pay the expenses.  But doing it on my own would mean risking money and moving away from family. Go ahead and call me entitled. I feel that people should be entitled to a living wage if they're willing to work. 

To the people who called me ""lazy"": I take offense to that. You're probably the very same people who make it nearly impossible for the unemployed to find work. I will not address that any further.

Do you know any more like it?,afxjzs,242,29,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/17jhr1/my_favorite_kind_of_engineering_parable_do_you/,"A toothpaste factory had a problem. They sometimes shipped empty boxes without the tube inside. This challenged their perceived quality with the buyers and distributors. Understanding how important the relationship with them was, the CEO of the company assembled his top people. They decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, and third-parties selected.  Six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, and high quality. Everyone in the project was pleased.

They solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighed less than it should. The line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective box, and then press another button to re-start the line. As a result of the new package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the factory.

With no more customer complaints, the CEO felt the $8 million was well spent. He then reviewed the line statistics report and discovered the number of empty boxes picked up by the scale in the first week was consistent with projections, however, the next three weeks were zero! The estimated rate should have been at least a dozen boxes a day. He had the engineers check the equipment, they verified the report as accurate.
 
Puzzled, the CEO traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line where the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new $8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. He asked the line supervisor what that was about.

""Oh, that,"" the supervisor replied, ""Bert, the kid from maintenance, put it there because he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang.""",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_17jhr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/17jhr1/my_favorite_kind_of_engineering_parable_do_you/,

1) Edward Snowden was granted a security clearance and agreed to protect the USA's secrets in the course of his work. The disclosure of the information Mr. Snowden had access to has most likely damaged National Security prospects. Do you think Mr. Snowden went to far? I see no mention of an attempt to correct what he saw as ethical issues internally.


2) Mr. Snowden clearly thought it was in the public's best interest to release this information. At what point is it an engineer's responsibility to protect society in lieu of fulfilling his/her professional responsibility?

Many many aspects have been left out for brevity. I acknowledge specific users who have brought up points in the comments section at the bottom of this write up. They are correct in their statements. If you feel that there is misinformation here please provide some input so it can be corrected.
 
 
The radio that handles the 4g signal at the tower (Called a BTS or base transmit station ) is the EnodeB.

EnodeB's typically transmit at a max of 20 watts. Conversely a NobeB ( umts ) transmits at double that power. ( 40 watts )
LTe can be understood very well by understanding how a *parallel* cable in a computer works. Large ribbon cables are used to bus information around in a computer because you have many cables all transmitting the same ( essentially ) information. They are just doing it many times with less data. It all gets summed up on the receive device and boom high throughput.

In LTE you have subcarriers (sc) and resource blocks ( rb O. In a 10Mhz channel you usually will have 300 sc and 1024rb . The size of one subcarrier is 15 khz.

It gets much more complicated though. LTE's used a orthognal frequency multiple access technology ( ofdm ) scheme on the path from the tower to the phone ( downlink or dl ) and single carrier frequency division multiple access ( sc-fdma ) And the spectrum is modulated up to three different ways currently. Quadrature phase shift keying ( qpsk ) 16 quadrature amplitude modulation ( 16qam ) and 64 quadrature amplitude modulation ( 64qam)

Holy bat farts that's vague! What does it mean?

The ofdm portion is basically saying that the user data is broken down and transmits that data across multiple streams like a *parallel* cable. Making very efficient use of the spectrum on the DL. The sc-ofdm says that it each user has a single sub carrier that they transmit back on. This is much easier and requires less power and less sophistaced electronics making it ideal to fit in phones and the like.

When it comes to the modulation it all depends on the total quality of the signal. Or the signal to noise ratio ( SINR ) the higher the SINR the better the modulation scheme the faster the throughput.
Qpsk is the lowest modulation scheme that can be used by LTE. It is basically saying that the phases of an analog signal ( the radio frequency wave ) are modulated to happen at certain times. If the peak of a wave happens in this time is considered a 1 and if the trough of a wave happens in this time it is considered a 0. This means what have modulated a digital signal on an analog wave. The next modulation scheme is 16qam. The QAMs do everything that the qpsk did but adds amplitude into the mix. The basically says that now you can have a loud 1 and loud 0 and a quiet 1 and a quiet 0. 64 quam just adds more volume positions to the mix so instead of just loud and quiet you have quiet , a little louder, medium, kinda loud, and loud. Modulation schemes get very mathy but are typically expressed in constellation charts. For those that remember geometry a constellation chart is just a graph over a x/y axis. There is also a negative quadrant for each positive quadrant.

By visualizing the mod schemes in a x/y axis form we can understand what the error vector magnitude (evm) is for each modulation scheme. The evm is the margin of error allowed when plotting a symbol to the constellation point. A symbol can be thought of roughly as a packet. (Remember LTE is a digital data application ). So when you send you packet back on sc-ofdm it will be assigned somewhere on this graph.

At Qpsk the graph only has 4 points. One in each quadrant. Its evm is the distance from the point to the y axis. Assume that each point is in the middle of each quadrant.

16qam has 4 points in each quadrant and its evm is the distance from one symbol th halfway to the next symbol ( mathy )

At 64qam there are 8 points per quadrant and the evm is the same. The quadrant size is the same during all of this you are just adding more lines in parallel ( remember *parallel* cable ).

The problem arises when your packets start slipping into other symbols. When that happens ( due to low sinr ) the modulation scheme will shift down.

Wifi has been using these modulation schemes for years. Wifi has also been using MIMO for years.

MIMO is defined as multiple in multiple out. Simple put this is again the redundant application( *parallel* cable ) MIMO has different forms. 2 x 2 ( 2 transmit and 2 receive ) 4 x4, 8 x 8 etc.... Currently we are using 2x 2 for mimo because each addition is a seperate layer and must be kept seperate. That means seperate cables seperate antennas etc...
In theory MIMO 2 x 2 doubles your throughput. Like all things I practice the answer of how much throughput increase is "" well, it depends. ""
So this is getting quite long. 

TL:DR:
-Lower frequency will have less attenuation over distance. In the US, ATT and VErizon have their spectrum at 700 MHz. They are also starting to deploy LTE at 2100 Mhz. This is the difference between a subwoofer and a tweeter in terms of attenuation.

-LTE uses complicated digital modulation streams which allow for error correction.

 -The receiver sensitivity of an EnodeB ( lte tower radio ) is very low meaning the phone doesn't need to talk loud to be heard ( and it uses sc-ofdm remember ) -the EnodeB does not transmit loud but very directive antennas are used on towers which add a lot of ""gain"".


If you guys want to know more, let me know. I can explain CDMA , WCDMA, GSM. etc.. 

Qualification. I am an RF engineer working in D.A.S ( distributed antenna systems ) I have engineering designs that have been implemented in countless hundreds of buildings across the U.S including stadiums, hospital systems, and airports.

(edit ) Originally drafted on my phone. Edited for easier readability, spaces, new paragraphs etc...

(Edit) xavier_505 has pointed out that there are some errors in the write up. This is partially true and I address them in the comments section. I have left out a lot of very technical aspects and broadened the application quite a bit. 

(edit ) nosjojo has correctly pointed out that SINR is actually signal to interference and noise ratio ( S/IN ). This was left out for brevity.  Interference has to be defined many different ways. And was left out to provide a more streamlined explanation. 

(edit) fourier_loko pointed out that I used mHZ one time instead of Mhz. A lowercase ""m"" would imply milli whereas an uppercase ""M"" implied mega. there is a fairly substantial different. Thanks for that catch fourier!!
Ausey also chimed in on it.  Thanks guys( or gals )!

(edit ) xooxies pointed out that OFDM is like a parallel cable instead of serial. A ribbon cable is a parallel cable I was referring to it wrong through the whole article.  Anytime parallel is in italics it has been changed from serial. Thanks xooxies!!

Start as early as possible and don't stop applying for them. Make it a goal to apply for X amount per week (5-10ish should be good.) 

Like I said, I have a good GPA and extra circulars (Tau Beta Pi, Chi Epsilon) but my resume is lacking the crucial relevant engineering experience. I tried applying a little late in the game (fall of Junior year in hopes of getting a summer internship) but I applied to around 25-30 positions and didn't hear back from a single one. This year I applied to 40-50 and still have not heard back. This has lead me to go to grad school (M.S. in structural engineering) but if I had a job offer I would take it in a heart beat. 

Please, students. TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO NETWORK! Get those internships! You do NOT want to be going through what I am right now after years of hard work. That is, the feeling that all of said years of hard work were a wasted because you didn't get relevant work experience.

I've worked at a large aerospace company for the past 2 years.  More and more, I feel it matches the stereotypes of the comic strip Dilbert. 

1.  Upper Management is disconnected from what is going on.
2.  Management only cares about meeting dates, nothing much else
3.  Employee morale is low, employees make jokes about new employees ""still having the optimism and wide eyes of a fresh engineer""
4.  Most of the work day is spent on tedious tasks, of which the importance is judged based upon if it has a tracked management ECD.

Prior to working here, I worked at a small engineering services provider for 4 years.  The culture there was the exact opposite.  I felt it didn't align with stereotypes about ""the office"".

So do you feel your job aligns with ""Dilbert"", or other common negative office stereotypes?

Please mention the industry, and whether you work at a large, medium, or small company

I figure any of you Transportation or Traffic engineers would be interested. Apologies to the traffic folks; I really simplified your roles.

&gt;As a transportation engineer, I think they bungled this whole thing up by trying to simulate individual behavior.

&gt;Glassbox is a neat concept but ultimately unnecessary. City planning is all about statistics. It isn't about looking at individuals but rather the whole. Seriously, when I get a report from a traffic engineer, all they did was collect massive amounts of statistics and push those numbers ahead 25 years. SimCity doesn't need to collect this info, it is part of the game itself. From that point, just use Traffic Engineering!

&gt;We have very simple principles that only require a fast matrix calculator. This work is already done for them. I don't get why programmers need to reinvent the fucking wheel for a game. Sometimes nature is simpler than our solutions.

&gt;The 4 Step Traffic - Modeling Process:

&gt; 1. Trip Generation (How many trips to and from a specific area)
2. Trip Distribution (Match up the results from step one for a Origin-Destination Matrix)
3. Mode Choice (Choose method of travel based on weighted equations - very simple)
4. Route Choice (Equalize the road selection -- what SimCity currently fails at big time)

&gt; \^--- THIS is where the game should start. You can model a whole damn city with this just by knowing the zoning, road types, and parking lot sizes. Once you have this figured out, add a small amount of randomness and give people their personalities based on the Origin-Destination table (because now you know you have 500 people working at or traveling to Factory X).

&gt; **Bonus**: You can even use this for Sewer, Power, and Water distribution. Hell, it would be an even simpler calculation resource-wise.

In my opinion, the 'limit' means the maximum safe speed.

Many roads in my state have speed limits set with the 85th percentile rule.  Many times, these speed limits are set 5-10 mph below the design speed.

This really irks me.  As someone who's done all the math to find the design speed for a road, it is so frustrating that all my math and calculations, all of my engineering experience and expertise, can be trumped by what amounts to, in my opinion, a psychological study.

Here's specifically why I don't like the 85th percentile rule:

1.  If the road is designed for X mph and the 85th percentile sets the speed limit at X-10 mph, then the road will be 'calling' you, encouraging you, to drive faster.  Wide lanes, safe medians, wide shoulders, few driveways.  All of these will be 'pulling' you down the road, so to speak.  The road 'wants' to be driven faster.

2.  If there are speed limit signs on the road where I conduct a speed study (which in my state is done by driving to a spot in an old Sheriff's truck and shooting cars with a radar gun, discrete my ass!), then I'm getting a tainted data set.  Many drivers are only driving X-10 mph because that's what the sign is telling them to drive.  My data, then, cannot accurately return an 85th percentile value.

Finally, don't even get me started on state legislated road speed maximums.  I'd rather a speed limit be set by a properly conducted 85th percentile speed study than just arbitrarily set by government at 55 mph.  That irks me more than anything!

""Hey, thanks for your years of research and experience.  But we're going to go ahead and set it at 55 mph because that's what we feel is right.""

Anyhow, my rant is over.  I'd love to hear some feedback on why you're for the 85th percentile or against it.  Or, if it's possible, why you're for state legislated maximum speeds.

The pay and benefits are significantly above average in my field but it's not worth it. The hours are supposed to be 8-6pm, which is normal, but in reality I'm expected to stay until 10 or 11pm every night to get my work done or I'm ridiculed by my boss for not being a team player. Leaving before 9pm is considered ""early"" for my company and I have to ask permission to do so. I want to get out. I'm also expected to work 8 hour days on Saturdays and Sundays. It's been 3 weeks since I've had a day completely off, though I took a half day last Saturday.

I have no time for socializing. I barely have to time to do simple necessities like going the bank, getting a haircut, going shopping, etc. I want to GTFO very badly but this company is in a niche field (hint: in the Raleigh, NC area. Can anyone guess the company? They have a reputation that I should have listened to.) and my experience isn't really applicable anywhere else. So basically I'm gaining experience that's only useful at a single company that I hate working at. What should I do?

So to help out those of you who'll be attending Fall career fairs, I thought I'd repost it, with a few additional tips from this year.  Again, a lot of these will sound obvious, but the number of people who don't abide by them is shocking.

* **Wear a suit / nice dress or skirt.** There was a surprising number of people there who looked like they just came from class, wearing whatever they were wearing, like a t-shirt and sweats. And when I say suit, that means black or blue, not tan. Don't do ""crazy"" or neon ties. If you want to stand out, make your resume stand out. Unique clothing can only negatively impact you.  And for the love of god, don't wear shorts and flip-flops.
* **Research the companies you want to work for.** If you come up to a recruiter and the first thing you say is ""What do you guys do?"" then you're going to have to fight your way out of the rejection pile. Even better is if you have a specific job posting or program you're looking for.  It takes 30 seconds to take a few steps back, take out your phone, and Google it.
* **Make eye contact.** There was nothing behind me but collapsed bleachers, but you'd be surprised how interesting some people found them while I was explaining the program to them. I want the impression that you're excited about what I'm telling you.
* **Points on resumes:** If there's something you really think the recruiter should see that's relevant, be sure to point it out, because we don't have time to go through the whole thing word-by-word. Also, use bullets, don't write paragraphs. Make sure everything's well-formatted and good-looking. Get someone, or even better, lots of people, to critique it for you. Make sure you keep it to a page. If you have so much stuff that there's just no way you can keep it to a page, make different resumes for different jobs (I have one for aero, one for general ME, etc).
* **List your objective.** Be as specific as you can be. If necessary, even print out different resumes with specialized objectives (CAUTION: Don't list the specific company. It can come off either as pandering or it gives away what you're doing). This gives the impression that you're excited about a certain field. A generic ""job in the mechanical engineering field"" is far too broad. I got a resume that just said ""Job.""
* **Be professional.** Someone came up to me, put down a briefcase, handed me a seven-page resume (at least), patted me on the back and put his arm around me, and said ""get me a job."" ""What are you looking for?"" ""A job."" I was immediately looking for reasons to not give him a job.
* **List your GPA.** If you don't, I'll either ask or assume the worst.
* **If necessary, list your citizenship status.** A lot of companies, including mine, can only hire US citizens or permanent residents due to government contracting. If you think I might have to ask, put it on the resume.  It takes up practically zero room.
* **Ask questions.** What's the culture like where you work? What do you do on a daily basis? What benefits does the company have outside of work (sports, grad school, etc)?

I was interviewed by a women and she pretty much said things along the lines of how I should reconsider being a female in engineering since it is male dominated. She talked about how she has to work much harder then her male peers just because she was female and that her mistakes in her work was noticed more than similar mistakes in her male coworkers work. It was very discouraging. I still want to be an engineer but it really got me wondering about it.

**So my question is:** What is it like to be a female engineer? *and* How do guys see females in engineering?

I was told about some great ones... and during the year I've found a few more websites that helped me get through my first year of Electronic and Computer Engineering. 

Some helped a lot more than my lecturers did and I'm now confident I'll finish with good marks. 

In an effort to give back, I've compiled a list of the websites I found particularly useful at getting me through the year. (Please post others if you know them!) I use these websites more than my lecture notes. 

**Math**

http://www.khanacademy.org/ 
Literally invaluable video tutorials on every math related topic from basic addition to college level calculus. Great for brushing up or getting a better understanding of complex new topics. (Also covers chemistry and physics).

http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/
Pauls Online Math Notes: No video content and a little more formal in its style but a great website. 

http://www.wolframalpha.com/
Not really tutorials but a great place to do graphing and check answers you're not sure about. Much lower learning curve than software such as Maple and Octave because you can ask Wolfram questions in many forms and it will still give you the right equation. 

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ has tutorial content on a wide range of advanced math related topics.

**EDIT** http://patrickjmt.com/ More great video math tutorials


**Electronics**

http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/
This covers everything in my first year digital and analogue electronics course. Much easier to understand than my lecture notes. 

**Programming**

http://www.highercomputingforeveryone.com/
Created by a redditor for redditors! Based on C programing but useful for someone learning any language. Gives you a very good -- if a little heavy -- understanding of what the computer is really doing when you perform certain functions. It helped me a lot.  

**General**

http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm
MIT's free content. Many subjects have full video lecture sections. Others have less useful slides/notes. But worth checking for many subjects.

http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/
Open Universities free content section. Lots of great content on a wide range of subjects.

And lastly, a bit of advice: Buy an Arduino and start messing around with it. It's a very cost effective and enjoyable way to learn about electronics, physics, and programming all at the same time. 

More info here http://www.arduino.cc , http://www.instructables.com/index , and some great starter circuits here http://www.oomlout.com/a/products/ardx/ . 

It sure beats the boring stuff you build / program in college labs when starting out. 

**EDIT**
Berkeley Webcast  http://webcast.berkeley.edu/courses.php 
More video lectures on a wide range of topics. 

**Mechanics and Materials**
http://web.mst.edu/~mecmovie/ Found this in a recent post. Haven't used it much as I don't do much of this stuff but it looks good.

That is all.

It's exactly in what I want to do and it's local so I really want to make an excellent impression. The position would be for a mechanical HVAC design position. How should I prepare? I know to talk about the psychrometric chart and how to use it, my HVAC design class and knowledge from that and my use of AutoCAD are really the only things I have. 

Any other ideas/tips/topics I should probably brush up on? Thanks!

EDIT

Just got back from the interview. Overall I think it went well. Completely stumped me on 2 questions bc he asked for specific equations when dealing with the psychrometric chart. We talked and I learned some new things about the field/industry. So we shall see. Ill send a follow up e-mail a bit later.

Or at the very least, can you preface your post with a disclaimer? (e.g. 'I don't have firsthand experience with xyz, but my understanding is...') I don't want to pick on specific posts, but I was reading a thread today where there were essentially two opinions represented in the comments. Even though my experience strongly favored opinion x, opinion y had an approximately equal amount of support, which I found surprising. However, I looked through the comment history of those that supported opinion y and all but one were still students (the thread was asking questions about the working world, so it's unlikely the students had the necessary experience to comment on the topic at hand). This isn't an isolated incident, and it's frustrating when I have to sift through bullshit in threads where I'm trying to learn something and engineering students are filling it up with false information.

As an aside, if you are a student, please understand that most engineering jobs are very different than academia. You are learning a lot of stuff right now that you will never again do once you graduate. And many of the things you will continue to do in the working world will be done very differently than you do it now.

Obviously this isn't entirely limited to students, but they seem to be the most frequent offenders.",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_yj4lg,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/yj4lg/a_request_for_the_engineering_students_of/,

Our calculus classes were taught by two professors simultaneously, Dr.T and Dr.R. They are both landmark educators at the university, not only for teaching for so long, but because everyone must take their classes to be an engineer. They had worked together for years teaching all four core calculus classes, and this particular incident happened in my Differential Equations lecture.

Dr.T had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had brought it up in class on several occasions during his ""story time"" breaks. It was getting close to the date for his transplant, and his skin was badly jaundice, but despite his state he refused to take time off. One day, Dr.T was explaining a new concept and writing on the chalk board, and his voice began to trail off. He kept writing, but the characters became indistinguishable. All of a sudden he collapsed behind the desk at the front of the room. 

The lecture hall was in stunned silence, and nobody knew what to do. Dr.R ran over to the side of the desk while Dr.T was still out of sight from the students, and she asked in a shaky, sobbing voice ""Are you okay?"" From behind the desk emerged a quivering hand with a piece of chalk in it, and we all heard Dr.T say ""Keep.... Teaching...."" Dr. R nodded and continued the lecture, obviously in shock.

To the relief of the class, Dr.T popped up from behind the desk 20 minutes later, and said to us with a big smile, ""Bet that scared you!"" He got his transplant and is still teaching to this day.",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_munan,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/munan/hey_engineers_got_any_favorite_stories_about/,

Most of my work has been on the capsule for the next flight, but some of my qualifying tests provided needed data for this launch.  This is my first internship, and I was damn geeked when I saw this baby fly.  

I'm pretty sure the veteran engineers here won't be too impressed, but it was a big moment for me.  There's nothing quite like seeing something you participated in work as designed.

To compare:

Engineers:  Let's say average salary is around $75k CAD per year.  On top of this we can get up to a 10% bonus if we complete a matrix of measurable objectives.  Engineers are basically expected to work overtime for free - they say an assumption of overtime is factored into our salary.  I'm lucky if I get a cost of living increase.

Union: Base rate is $83k, plus overtime (and factored overtime rates, min. 2X), paid for every single hour worked, and 5% bonus if they meet very easily attainable goals.  Our union just went on strike because they didn't like these terms, and now get a guaranteed minimum 2.5% raise each year.

How is it that I went to university for 5 years, have multiple professional designations, tremendous responsibility, and I'm paid far less than a guy who was paid to go to school for 2 years to turn some wrenches.  Why do they deserve to be paid for every hour, yet engineers are 'expected' to do so.

I've never really considered one until quite recently. I'm currently doing a summer research placement, so in a few weeks I might hate it, but I was wondering what other people thought. Because its the summer and I'm at a campus university, the only engineers around that I can talk to at the moment all either have or are doing PhD's, so it'd be good to hear from some people in other areas.

EDIT: to add more info..

- As of September, I will be a doing a masters in civil engineering in the uk. 

- My research this summer and my final year dissertation is on 3D printed, textile reinforced concrete. My PhD would be something along those lines.

- I'm interested in this area because commercial, large scale 3D printing (ie small buildings) is set to start somewhere in the next couple decades and has the *potential* to eventually revolutionise construction within my lifespan. It may not happen, of course, but I would love to see that happen. Developing the technology and understanding with small scale things like wall panels and beams is crucial to the future viability of the technology. In other words, you can't jump into the deep end before you can swim in the shallow end.

- In a lot of ways, I'd rather get into R&amp;D at a big firm (there are some working on it apparently, but they're being very secretive, because of the profitable potential of this). However, I don't know how possible it is to get into any of these companies. I get the impression that in the Civil industry, there really isn't a lot of R&amp;D... partly why the civil industry has barely changed in decades, in a lot of respects.

- I'm the sort of person who can work basically tirelessly on a project, especially if I feel I'm getting something out of it, especially on long projects.

my region near Stuttgart is one if the biggest manufacturer/developer for cars (Mercedes, Prosche and Audi) and we created more jobs than our universities can cover with new graduates. 
We also have many IT companies like HP, Microsoft and IBM who are searching for new employees.
The city (Böblingen) also started a program to build new houses in the area, but they also lack new people who want to live there.

If you want to see how the area looks like, here is a movie which was produced to show potential new employees the city:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgfpZUUwUJs

So if you think you want to work abroad for a little while, visit the Feni Website: http://www.feani.org/site/ and if you like the area around Stuttgart (especially Böblingen :) ) just tell them that and they will help you.

Of course you can ask me anything via pm or in this thread and I will try to answer all your questions.

TL;DR: What to work in germany for a shitload of money? Read above text!

1312505401.0,107,self.engineering,j9dsm,10 Design Engineering tips I've learned over the years,Knotritenaou,119,12,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/j9dsm/10_design_engineering_tips_ive_learned_over_the/,"I design consumer products for a living. Over the years, I've learned some valuable lessons and wanted to share. This list is tailored more toward the the mechanical / design crowd, but I’m sure that If you make parts which fit together – this list is for you.  

I’ve broken this down into two sections: Planning and Design.  

**DESIGN**  
=======  
**1. Draw it like you mean it**  
Fully dimension all part drawings, with proper material and special notes. The drawing is a ""contract"" between you and your vendor. If the vendor delivers a part that meets print, but is not what you wanted - you are responsible for the cost of changes or re-work. If the vendor delivers a part that does not meet print, they are responsible.

**2. Tolerance Nazi**  
Do your tolerance analysis - nothing is worse than spending a thousands of dollars on tooling or prototypes, only to find out that the pieces don't fit together. Tooling changes can *sometimes* be as expensive as the tooling itself – so measure *more than* twice, and cut once.

**3. You missed a spot**  
Have someone check your designs. No matter how long I stare at a design that I think is perfect, someone else will find something that I could do differently or better - either that, or I made a flat out mistake – nobody’s perfect.

**4. Check yo'-self**  
When parts come in from a vendor, make sure you do a 100% inspection (on a few parts) with the drawing. Change part dimensions in the solid model according to inspection results. Check assembly model for interference issues. Investigate dimensions that are out of print.

**5. Reduce-Reuse-Recycle**  
The fewer parts you design, the less the product will cost. There is a term for this: KISS Principal: Keep It Simple Stupid! 

* Extra points for designing a part that has more than one use. 
* Extra^extra points for making a product out of ""green"" materials.  

**PLANNING**  
=======  

**6. Get used to rejection**  
Don't get too attached to your own designs. Not everything you design will make it's way to production. If you can't learn to let it go, or drastically change it, you're going to have a difficult time being open minded to other people's ideas (which may be better than your own). If you are not open to other people’s ideas, you will be considered “difficult to work with”.

**7. Puttin your 'specs' on**  
*BEFORE* starting the design process, a Product Specification or Product Scope should be created. A Product Specification should contain all said goals and features a product will have. Make sure all parties agree to the specification *before* design starts. By doing this, there will be less time spent re-designing a product, and avoiding ""ad-on's"" or ""band-aids"" to said product in the future. 

**8. Time, Money &amp; Scope**  
Every project hangs in the balance of these three things. You can't increase one without increasing one or the other two . Time, Money and Scope go hand in hand, and must be properly balanced to have a successful project. For example:  

* You want a project done faster: you've got to either increase the money, or decrease the scope. 
* The budget is running thin: you have to decrease the time or decrease the scope. 
* The Scope of this project is enormous: you've got to push back the deadline and/or increase the money. 

 **9. Choose your words wisely**  
When describing your ideas to other people, use the word ""Inexpensive"" instead of the word ""Cheap"". The word ""Cheap"" makes people think ""Crap"". The word ""Inexpensive"" makes people think ""Cheap"". 

**10. “Go speed racer, GO!”**  
Take your time. ""Speed to Market"" is a good thing - but don't speed too fast. Take time to design a solid product.

1) Spell check your resume.  Fill out the online form completely and don't complain that you need to attach your resume and fill in resume content into text fields again.  It sucks, we know.  

2) Don't be afraid to follow up with the company after you submit your resume.  
- You would be surprised how many resumes get submitted which makes it hard to review them all.  Following up pulls yours to the top for review. 

3) Do your homework.  Research the company, its products/services, and the industry it is in. 
- It shows you're interested in the job and company.  It's impressive when a interviewee can talk shop. 

4) Show up on time to the interview.  Bring copies of your resume. 
- Too early is slightly annoying.  Late is inexcusable.  Good engineers will test experiments before they have to show others the experiment.  If you can't do a test drive to find the office before the interview; you're showing that you're not that good of an engineer. 

5) Before the questions start, ask that all the interviewers tell their name and their position in the company.  Be polite about it.  This will help later on. 

6) Offer to give a powerpoint about your experience. 
- This shows your speaking and writing skills. It also give you a chance to speak about specific project you have worked on.     

7) Avoid rambling and waving your hands around.  Try to make your answers concise. Stay calm. 
- Its pretty annoying when a interviewee won't shut up and let the interviewers talk.  It's also an indication on how you will communicate with other employees at the company. 

8) When the interviewers are done asking questions, it is good for you to ask questions about the position and the company. 
- If the interviewers ask ""Do you have any questions for us"" and the interviewee says ""No"", that's a red flag that the interviewee is looking for any job and they don't have genuine interest in the position/company.  The questions you ask may be the best thing you say in an interview.  Asking questions shows that you are inquisitive, thorough, and invested in the company.   

9A) Don't go crazy haggling over salary.  That's a great way to screw up an interview.  
- It's better to have modest salary requirements, get the job, then bust ass and get raises.  Also, if you push hard for a high salary it gives the impression that you'll leave the job as soon as another slightly higher paying job opens. 

9B) Don't say you have other interviews or job offers unless they ask you.  That tactic generally backfires if you are trying to squeeze out some more money.  Hiring managers want to hire people that are genuinely interested in the job.  When you bring up other offers, it's a big middle finger to the interviewers.  Just keep it to yourself. 

10) Show genuine interest in the position and company. 
- People that are interested in the work, tend to be happy, productive, and stick with the job for a long time. Don't' BS them on your interest; they can sniff that out.  Also, obviously you need to be qualified for the job.  Genuine interest will help you bet out other qualified engineers. 

11) Follow up with HR and the hiring manager after the interview.  

12) If you don't get the position, don't be afraid to ask why. 
- Bad hiring managers will hire anyone flashy.  Average hiring managers will try to ""hire someone like them"".  Good hiring managers will hire good engineers and then find positions for them, even if it's not for the job they applied to.  It never hurts to ask. 

13) If you didn't get the job, but see that the job posting is still open for weeks/months afterwards don't be afraid to call up the company and ask to try again.  
- Going back to #5, sometimes the hiring manager, or their boss can't make it to the interview, which may leave interviewees that can't see valued skills past a few fumbled technical responses.  

Other tips for engineering students:

1) Join a engineering competition club and rise through the ranks to become the leader.  
- Hiring managers are also looking for management potential engineering students.  Engineering competition groups are great for fostering those type of people.  Student groups that just have meetings and don't actually do a project are weak on a resume, but can helpful to get scholarships. 

2) Get a pet project and put it on your resume. 
- Software engineering students that make a website, or program on their own time indicates that they genuinely like coding.  Also teach yourself a software language.  If possible, show the application in the interview.  Mechanical and electrical engineering students, pick a hands on project that shows you know how to get dirty and pick up a wrench. 

3) Try to get at least one internship. 
- An internship is important, but honestly if someone did great on #1 and #2 above, I'd take that over an average internship.  Other hiring managers may not have that same philosophy.  Also, of course, an internship often leads to a job offer.  So in general you can't go wrong with an internship. 

4) Cold call companies for an internship
- Most companies have a ""off again, on again"" internship program.  A student that takes the initiative and shows interest in the company often can lead to an internship. 

TL;DR  Show genuine interest in the position and company. 

EDIT: Still haven't learned how to count; I just changed it to 9A and 9B.

I need to vent on the way down.)",HorribleRacist,135,34,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/j3zt2/longwinded_psuedoracist_rant_about_asianborn/,"(This is a throwaway account for cowardly but I think obvious reasons.) 

IamA (white) engineer in the US, mostly apolitical, with, let's call it 10+ years professional experience. 

**(Obligatory ""I'm not a racist *but...*"" disclaimer, feel free to skip):** I have never ever thought of myself as a racist. I usually find even *discussing* race to be exceedingly ugly and sort of crude, unless in the context of legitimate sociological or medical studies or some such, or in a sort of MLK-style dismay and exasperation with superficial divisions and bigotry. 

From time to time I've peripherally heard of news stories about the problems of supposed ""cheating cultures"" among some Asian university students. Things about how growing up in an environment of poverty with notions of family honor and extremely high stakes etc would lead to getting good grades at any cost and so on. It's not the kind of news I follow, and to the degree I have ever been aware of it, I've regarded it as a somewhat tragic thing, yet another example of the cruelty of poverty, forcing people at the bottom to climb over one another in an effort to keep their head above the shit that always rolls downhill.

I'm not a software engineer, and I've never been in danger of being outsourced. I've always thought of engineering as, well, exactly the sort of purely-technical thing where race, background, culture, etc was entirely irrelevant. 

**To the point, I have worked with loads of *extremely* smart, talented, skilled, and honest engineers of Asian ethnicity. There is nothing intrinsic to Asian-ness or any other racial background that makes anyone a good or bad engineer.**

That out of the way, some background: I don't want to get too specific but I work in a fairly rigorous field where there are a lot of engineers from different companies and organizations all scrutinizing one another's work. For the benefit of non-engineers, a lot of engineering is sort of like technical lawyering: You have a contractor whose engineers are reviewing the engineering of the subcontractors, and the customer has engineers reviewing *that* engineering, and you have various gov't and regulatory engineers in turn reviewing everything, and so on. Much like corporate law or accounting, it's often a matter of getting all the nerds to agree with each other so that the people who sign checks feel confident that all the ducks are in a row-- when your surveyor and your neighbor's surveyor both agree on where the lot-line is, then you can build the fence with no worries. If it's a $100mm fence, then there might be a lot of surveyors that have to agree.

That's the world I live in, and the soup I swim in. Sometimes I'm the customer, sometimes the vendor, sometimes just a third-party evaluator, and very often I'm somewhere in the middle. Whether I am doing the original engineering, or checking/verifying/modifying/vouching for someone else's engineering, I'm often in a sort of pool of variously cooperative/competitive engineers who are constantly second-guessing each other until everyone agrees. 

**Onto the pseudo-racist rant you've all been waiting for...**

I have worked with lots of great engineers from all kinds of backgrounds, but it seems like in the past few years I have seen a parabolic rise in Asian-born engineers whose skills are *vastly* worse than their credentials. Moreover, I am regularly encountering what feels like not just a competency differential, but serious honesty problems with Asian-born engineers. And it's not subtle. I have not had this problem with western-raised engineers of Asian descent. 

I'm used to practices where engineering is thorough and transparent: the assumptions are documented, and the calculations are either standard textbook ones or else explained in comments. You show your math and back it up, and you use the most accurate assumptions and calcs you can. If another engineer disagrees with, say, the noise-insulating value of your proposed flooring construction or the heat-transfer capacity of your cooling system or whatever, it's because they think you're overlooking some degradation factor or using incorrect input assumptions or whatever: everyone's cards are on the table, and everyone's playing by the same rules. The customer wants the quietest floors and the best-performing HVAC at the lowest cost, the vendor wants to skate as close as possible to the edge of spec in order to have most flexibility in terms of construction, the gov't/code inspector just wants to make sure it all fits the book requirements, etc.  But we're all using the same numbers and engineering calcs, we're just hashing out the input variables, margins for error, which calcs to use for which scenarios, etc. 

But I'm increasingly seeing this phenomenon with Asian-educated engineers where the engineering is not just low-quality, it's often downright dishonest. I have no problem with copy-pasted input data or calculations if they are textbook standards, but I'm getting stuff that doesn't even make sense. I call them to see where it came from and I get vague non-answers about ""standard engineering calculations"", eventually offering to let me re-do it if I'm going to be so picky about the details... I see the same engineers over and over submitting seriously flawed copy-pastas of junk engineering that has already been rejected multiple times... 

I'm also increasingly getting a very unpleasant impression of a phony ""language barrier""... Engineering should not even strictly require verbal Q&amp;A-- I'm pretty sure that I could sit down with an honest and competent engineer in my area of specialty and sort out a technical problem using diagrams and numbers on bar-napkins without ever speaking, maybe requiring nodding and hand-signals. The ""english"" or whatever is just there in the comments to clarify and simplify the wheres and whys of the assumptions and calculations. 

Piling on, there seems to be a sort of ugly ""personal"" aspect to this particular breed of bad engineers. I have dealt with mediocre engineers before, and I have dealt with ""sales engineers"" who had a personal stake in it, and I have dealt with engineers who were embarrassed or ""showed up"" by dumb mistakes, but there seems to be a special breed of hostility among bad Asian-educated engineers. It's like questioning their calculations is attacking their manhood, like you're not even supposed to ask why they assume that all people walking on the floor will weigh less than 50kg.

As I said above, I pretty devoutly don't think of myself as a racist. In a technical sense, I'm not complaining about a ""race"". The correlation seems not to be with asian skin, eyes, names, or anything like that, but with asian *schooling*. I am sure it's unfair, but I'm starting to inwardly groan whenever I call a fellow engineer and hear an asian accent.  I see this at all levels of credentials.

Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

* edit to clarify: this is most specifically a complaint about dishonesty. Varying degrees of competency are part of any field. I have no ""character"" complaints about people who know less than I do. I know a lot less than some other people do.

Could someone help me fix his mouse for his birthday?",coxee,124,30,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/w31dj/fellow_engineers_my_30_year_old_brother_with/,"July 7th will be my brother's 30th birthday. He is totally wheelchair bound and his movement is limited to his fingers, mouth and some movement of his neck. His most beloved thing is his computer. It is how he talks with friends, uses his cell phone, discovers new music, and basically keeps himself sane. 

The way he has to hold the mouse due to the shape of his hands and the way he has to rest his hands on his stomach cause the mouse's signal goes out randomly every few seconds, making it extremely difficult for him to do anything. I am wondering if it is possible to wire the signal emitter outside of the mouse so that his hands and stomach aren't covering the signal. We are pretty sure it's the signal because placing a folded up pillowcase between his body and the mouse helped the signal a little bit.   

This is the mouse that works best for him.
http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-TrackMan-Remote-Pointing-Device/dp/B00000JDG8 

These mouses are no longer produced and over the years, we have had to buy 5 different ones. Some have problems with how hard it is to click the buttons, some have problems with the trackball. The mouse with the signal problem has no problems otherwise. We still have the ones that don't work perfectly for him. We would by the few that are out there but the new ones didn't always work and were not consistent.

He cant use other handheld trackball mice because of the way his hands are and he cant hold it with one hand. Over the years, his hands have formed to the shape of this mouse. If anyone has any connections with logitech and could somehow help us through them that would be awesome. Or if some electrical engineer on here can help us by improving the signal or something we would greatly appreciate it. What he ultimately needs is a way for his joystick on his wheelchair to become a mouse for his computer but the conversion would costs us thousands and thousands of dollar to have done which we can nowhere near afford. There's a place just across the street from my house called switch it that does these type of conversions for disabled people and nearly every day when we get out of the house he sees what he could have. It's so frustrating for all of us to have to see that.


**Edit:** 
[Here](http://www.asl-inc.com/products/product_detail.php?prod=16) is a picture of the joystick he uses.
[Here](http://imgur.com/a/aU0il#MOXbO) is a picture of him and his wheelchair.

I'm beginning to have trouble following the different replies. If there is anyone who is able to help in the process of converting his wheelchair joystick into a mouse, can you post a new reply to this thread? There is a switch already on his wheelchair that is used to switch between joysticks on his chair. We have one that we can use also if he is having too much trouble doing it himself. Maybe rewiring the switch and dropping the extra joystick would allow for us to put the computer side of that into the switch. [Here's](http://imgur.com/pHFJC) an ugly diagram I drew to visualize that switch.

Maybe r/coding, r/ECE, or r/programming can help with that end of the conversion? I don't know which this would fall under more.",,False,,t5_2qhpi,1341596657.0,,,True,t3_w31dj,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/w31dj/fellow_engineers_my_30_year_old_brother_with/,

All of our fabric is still cut by hand, either with insanely sharp shears or with a sort of jigsaw cutter on a massive work table. All of the cutting is done by two to four fairly skilled guys. The problem is, even given very clear instructions on patterns and where to cut, there will still be mistakes and such (""Oh, I used an extra half meter of this incredibly expensive fabric that we have a frighteningly short supply of, is that ok?"").

My engineering brain is going ""I wonder if we could automate our cutting process."" I've found things like the GERBERcutter systems online (don't know the prices yet). They are fast, accurate, repeatable, and do exactly what you tell them. (there are downsides to that too...operator has to know what they're doing) They're like CNC fabric cutters, as far as I can tell. This might make our company more cost-effective and competitive, as well as keeping up with the pace of technology.

My ethical (EDIT: personal ethics, not corporate) brain, however, says to me ""If you convince the company to buy this machine, several people will be out of a job."" I don't think it'll be that easy for our workers to find work elsewhere. And, in my thinking, if we automate everything...who's there to buy the products? I remember hearing a quote, ""The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.""

My question is, now what? Do I push for the company to start using a cutting machine, potentially costing these low-wage but fairly skilled workers their jobs...or do I keep my mouth shut and stay with the situation as it is now? And furthermore, if I'm not comfortable with the slow march of progress and ever-growing consumption/automation...should I just give up on engineering altogether?

EDIT: Ran the idea, no numbers yet, past my supervisor (Technical Manager). He says that we're not nearly high-volume enough for it to be worth it, and we're not likely to be. I might press on a bit in my spare time, to get numbers and see if it actually IS worth it. He's probably right, but if not, this could be big for the company.

This structure has an elegant design, with three field splices in continuous curved girders over four bridge spans. The splice placement results in a 40' cantilever out over the third span. The resulting deflection (approx 1"") made the field splice unworkable and a crane had to be brought in to hoist the ends of the girders while the main rig set the final pieces.

Additionally, the curve of the last span was great enough that a holding crane was required to support the first beam set and prevent it from rolling over. A 300 ton hydraulic crane set the first piece while a 40 ton cherry picker removed the aforementioned deflection from the splice. After the beam was landed, a second cherry picker snaked its boom under the massive spreader beam and hooked on to the center of the piece. The headroom was so tight the two-block sensor on the rig had to be removed. With this complete, the big rig was able to disconnect and set the second beam while the first cherry picker lifted out the deflection at the splice. After landing the second piece, the crane used for lifting the splice ends was used to fill in the intermediate diaphragms between the two beams being supported by two cranes. After the diaphragms were hung the structure was stable and could be released. 

The location of the site, over a busy parkway, allowed only a four hour window (1am to 5am) to complete this operation. Had the designer added a fourth field splice, just over the cantilever pier, the third crane would not have been required. Sometimes I feel like design engineers give very little attention to the actual construction process.

Im basically just summarizing his thoughts on part failure. 

Basically its the idea that 100% of engineering failures are of human origin. Whether it was poor design, improper maintenance/servicing, bad manufacturing/tolerancing/process control, failure to understand the true operating conditions, misuse, inaccurate analysis, anything: The failure is always human. 

This is unfortunately a tough pill to swallow, because you have to look in the mirror every time something goes wrong with something you designed. Parts dont ""decide"" to fail, their failure is predictable and preventable. Not enough engineers internalize this idea and instead blame things on parts, which had no say in the matter.

Obviously this doesnt mean everything should be without failure, because there is always an acceptable level of risk for a design. Its just saying that blame should never go to the part, but instead looked at as a way to improve things for the future. 

Just figured Id share my fav engineering lesson which I think everyone should internalize. I also challenge everyone to come up with an example of a non-human engineering failure.

Math, physics, chemistry, none of them were ever my strong point and I never figured I'd go into a career that involved any of that, I figured I'd be a history teacher. But this past year I said fuck it, I can't deal with how I think/read/research about cool engineering stuff all day on my own and never see how far I could take it with the education to back up my ideas. 

So, with only a year left on a history degree, I changed majors. I'm going to be a civil engineer and that is that, but it's hard. I think anyone who has gotten a bachelors in science can tell you that it's hard, especially when you are in your mid 20's and haven't taken a math or science class since high school. But I am a fool in love with this profession, and it has progressed to becoming my obsession. Even though I'm just starting out, I'm so happy and so terrified at the same time, but it's all in a good way.

I was part of a Reduction in Force (RIF) six months ago, despite getting promotions and excellent performance reviews. The department was forced to reduce headcount by the business. 

Six months later my new job is about to have layoffs (today and tomorrow, then smaller ones throughout may until 400 people are gone). My wife is expecting and our first ultrasound is Friday. I'm praying that if I'm on the chopping block (semi-likely), that I'm in the later group, because there's a gap before layoff insurance kicks in, and there's a good chance we would have to pay the ultrasound out-of-pocket.

I feel like a failure for not being able to provide for my family, even though it hasn't happened yet and may not happen. I feel guilty for placing all this stress on my wife while she's dealing with morning sickness, etc.

I'm a little mad at the company for hiring me six months ago. I turned down two jobs to take this one, now both of the other jobs have been filled, so I may be SOL.

I have gotten a full-ride MBA offer from a local school that would give my wife and baby medical insurance. Today or tomorrow may very well be my last day as an engineer.

Do any of you folks ever feel like the expendable people in a company? I feel like engineers are seen as a ""fungible"" commodity, where we are seen as easily replaceable. I haven't seen business development, for example, affected so much by these layoffs. 

EDIT: Thank you for the encouragement everyone. I am letting this get me down more than I should. I don't mean to sound whiney; I'm grateful I have a job I love. 

I should also add that during the last layoff, my wife and I used it to spend some time together, and it gave us a sense of freedom to check out jobs in other cities. With her expecting though, I don't like the layoff threats.

Orthopaedics is rough right now. Zimmer is about to have a layoff. Smith Nephew had two within a couple of weeks of each other. Medtronic had two in a year and may have a third. Wright Medical had two in a year. Coviden had a big one. J&amp;J bought Synthes and will probably cut people as they integrate. Biomet bought a section of J&amp;J (so the SEC would let J&amp;J buy Synthes). Stryker may also be having layoffs soon.

It lets you view all the engineering (or whatever else you choose) Reddits at the same time!

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering+engineeringstudents+askengineers+ece+cfd+plastic+compsci+engineeringporn+machineporn+infrastructureporn) it is.

Quick list of Reddits included:

- [/r/engineering](/r/engineering)

- [/r/askengineers](/r/askengineers)
- [/r/ece](/r/ece)

- [/r/compsci](/r/compsci)
- [/r/engineeringporn](/r/engineeringporn)
- [/r/machineporn](/r/machineporn)
- [[/r/InfrastructurePorn](/r/InfrastructurePorn)

I think it's a really cool way to view engineering material on Reddit. New content shows up much quicker in the multi view, and you get exposed to some cool posts you might not have otherwise sought out.

Again, the goal is to compile a list of works that are engaging and fun to read recreationally - I don't want to be suggesting they go out and read a textbook. At the same time, I'd like the books to teach them something, whether it is engineering history, theory, case-studies, trivia. Basically, trick them into learning things during their downtime, without them feeling like it is some sort of assignment. Have any suggestions?

My recent internship is at a small MEP design and commissioning firm. After working there for only a few weeks, I can honestly say I am terrified of my future if I work full-time at a place like this. Everyone there seems to work far more than 40 hours a week. They regularly work through the weekend and have to travel all the time, sometimes for over a week. I've been told this is just the mentality of a smaller business in general since everyone has so many responsibilities compared to a huge corporation. But that lifestyle is not what I want. I am not a huge go-getter career man. I live a simple life with my girlfriend and value my free time very much. I take my work very seriously and come home tired everyday from giving my best effort. I'm just worried that as I progress in this field I will be expected to invest more of myself than I am willing. Am I just being naive? Or do other engineers have more normal, less all-consuming jobs than this? Is this more prevalent in the HVAC industry?

During the second half of the semester, we've been learning the basics of Labview, and I have to say, I despise it.  I have a background in programming (C++ and Java mainly), so I know what I'm doing in basic text programming, but I can't make heads or tails of Labview.  Even the most trivial programming techniques (if statements, resetting a loop iteration, having a variable that the program can both read and write to while running, etc.) are all but impossible to do elegantly, if at all.  I realize that the instruments they make are easy to interface with Labview, but the program itself just seems like such a horrifically inefficient and awful way to program.  Perhaps I'm missing something.  Can one of you kind folks shed some light on this for me - why do we use Labview?

 **TL;DR: why is Labview the industry standard?  It seems to make programming unnecessarily difficult.**

I'm a mechanical and aerospace engineering undergrad. As difficult as my majors are compared to say, my English-majoring or psychology-majoring friends, I wouldn't trade this for anything. The workload is enormous, stressful, and testicle-quakingly difficult at times.

Sometimes it feels like I'm drowning in work and sometimes I want to rip my hair out because I don't understand a concept or a particular solution (pun not intended). But when I spend an hour/a few hours working on a problem and come up with the correct solution, the feeling of triumphant superiority, of awe and satisfaction and pride, it makes all of this worth it.

I was working on homework earlier tonight and was nearly at wit's end with the final problem. I was ready to just axe the problem and turn in the assignment with that problem excluded, but an idea struck me and it ended up leading me to the correct solution. And the high that I got from that is incredible.

So, to all of you engineers, thank you. You're awesome. You make the world work. To all the engineering majors, you know exactly what I am talking about. To all the prospective engineering students, there's nothing like the pride that comes from this major, learning how shit works, and learning how to solve problems.

I told him this, but several months later he started pestering me by calling my office and emailing me every couple of days. 

He called me yesterday and started bitching at me for not returning his emails, and wouldn't take ""I'm not interested"" or ""I have to go now"" as an answer, so I hung up on him. He then wrote me an email calling me a ""prick"", ""moron"" and ""little asshole"". I responded to tell him to never contact me again, and he just kept throwing out insults, calling me a pussy and all sorts of other shit. 

It was completely insane. This guy is like dealing with the worst Troll on Reddit, only he's not at all anonymous, and supposedly a professional. 

So, my question is, is there anything I can do to report this guy or get the word out that he's not worth working with? ",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_1j3eat,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1j3eat/recruiter_troll/,

I'm a graduating senior from Michigan Tech with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a 2.6 GPA. my GPA has never been above 3.0 my entire life (HS or college). I was able to obtain 2 internships with the sub 3.0 GPA. The GPA doesn't really reflect my intelligence, but more my attitude towards school work. I had a 30 ACT score, math was higher, reading was lower. After spending the past 9ish months hunting, I finally got a job at a place i wanted to work at. It has definitely been the most frustrating and painful processes I've been through. 

As you would imagine, not making the 3.0 mark makes finding a job incredibly difficult. It is still possible though, it just requires more work. You really have to turn yourself into a salesperson in order to answer the potential employers question of: ""Will this person be worth the money I'm going to pay?"".

I could write books on the process, what I went through, and what i learned along the way. I don't have that kind of time. So, whatever information you want to know just ask. I'll be around most of the day.",,False,,t5_2qhpi,False,,,True,t3_mqvz4,http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/mqvz4/ama_as_requested_graduatingemployed_student_with/,

I am kind of at a loss, I usually don't have this much trouble learning new subjects.  That's not to say I am some kind of wunderkind who can pick up anything without effort, but usually if I persist at something long enough it will click.  Not so with MATLAB I have spent countless hours on my assignments, sometimes hours on single problems that appear to be simple to my classmates, and on a troubling number of them I just never really figure out what I'm doing.  We are working w/ matrices and currently how to use element-by-element operations to express answers. I am really confused and disheartened at the moment and I could use some cheering up that it gets easier.  Thanks

EDIT: Holy crap guys/girls, thank you all for your advice and words of encouragement, after a frustrating session in the library working on my MATLAB homework among other things, it feels amazing to get such a warm response to my worries.
