First, I'd like to apologize. It's been a while, I know and I'm sorry for delaying this tutorial so long.

Stuff happened; school exams, work, my birthday, friends, family. Everything piled up and I didn't find enough time to finish the tutorial. I worked on it bit by bit but never actually finished it. Now it's done. And it's short. *Really short.* I really don't know if it'll suffice for anyone out there but.. oh well.. might release it so *Brukh4r* stops shooting me. ;)

If you have any *constructive* feedback, please leave a comment or contact me. You'll find my contact data at the end of all my tutorials.

* small HowToHack tutorials covering a tool / feature / technique
* personal ramblings about my life and Q&amp;A's

I would really like your opinion on this:

* Do you want to see me write stuff in a blog form?
* What do / don't you want to see?
* Should I trash my blog idea and continue with my *short* tutorials in this form?

I thought everyone would profit from some tutorials. So I decided to write my first one for this subreddit. I'm also thinking about starting a series specifically for this subreddit. 

First things first: I've never written a tutorial. *Ever*! So I'd really like some honest and constructive feedback.

Although it's a tutorial, I don't want it to be some step by step instructions, so I'm not doing screenshots or write about everything. I think this will encourage people to research stuff, learn it by themselves and get really into it. It's like an appetizer of some sort. :)

Maybe I'm wrong. But that's why I really want some feedback.

Enough babbling. Here's my first HowToHack tutorial:

This is a [session hijacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking) program that was just released for free. 

Every time someone logs into a site, a session cookie is created. If they are on your network, it is possible to use that cookie and log in as them.

However, the developer is trying to avoid script kiddies using the program by making it necessary for the user to set their network card to monitor/promiscuous mode before being able to use Cookie Cadger.

I ask you, the /r/howtohack community, for your cooperation in writing a simple, yet comprehensive guide on how to use this program effectively.

We could split up the tutorial into 3 parts.

* How to check if your network card is compatible.
* How to set your network card into monitor mode.
* How to use the Cookie Cadger program.

It would be best to start on a Windows guide, since that is what most of us are using. Then we could move to working on a Linux and Mac tutorial later.

I've found so many strange things skydriving. 

*Example Skydrives I've found:*

-A ton of iphone IPAs, including ""asian boobs.ipa""

-119 sheet music PDFs with Classic music &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;linkin park

The fun is that you can find virtually anything. I've found a cache of SNES roms, a huge ebook library of the best scifi and cyberpunk books, and even whole OS installs.

Alot of the Skydrives are in different languages, so I think that adds a bit of mystery, too.

My understanding is that a SIP card contains the key to decode calls and texts, so if you wanted to listen in on someone's calls who you had access to their phone, could you just use a SIM card reader to grab a copy of their SIM and use that to decode their calls no matter what lvl of encryption their provider used?",,False,,t5_2uxyh,False,,,True,t3_11k4w8,http://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/11k4w8/using_wireshark_to_listen_in_on_cellphone_calls/,

I hope this is an acceptable place to post this. My house was robbed on Thanksgiving (on break from school) and among the many things stolen was my 6 year old, 1st gen Macbook Pro. I have been in contact with the local authorities for the past 5 weeks, but I've come to the long suspected conclusion that they really just don't give a damn and are far more content handing out a slew of drinking tickets every weekend.

Thankfully that computer really didn't have anything too important on it. Being 6 years old it's uses were dwindling to that of just storing some music and movies, and website testing (I do some web development). While making the rounds changing my different account passwords online, I got to my Dropbox account and noticed that the asshole(s) who have my computer had very recently been active on it, and have been so to this day (The IP changed once during my course of monitoring my Dropbox info, it is currently being used at 98.215.193.52)

I have lobbied for the authorities to get a subpoena for this information but they continue to drag their feet and be generally useless.

Basically what I am looking for is anyway I'd be able to glean more information from this IP address to figure out it's whereabouts. My initial thinking was to attempt wardriving around town using some Backtrack5 tools but I don't know if I'd be able to get anything more than some ssid's and MAC addresses.

This is a tutorial for cracking WEP enabled WiFi security with your phone.
This tutorial only applies (currently) to the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Google Nexus 1.

You will need to root these devices and install packages through an SD card.

So here we go.

1. Install [Busy Box](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsInN0ZXJpY3Nvbi5idXN5Ym94Il0.) and [Terminal Emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImphY2twYWwuYW5kcm9pZHRlcm0iXQ..) on your phone

2. Download the proper packages (this is the utility that allows you to put your WIFI chip into monitor mode needed to scan for WEP packets in order to obtain the WEP key.

[Nexus One](http://bcmon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bundles/nexus_bundle.zip)
[Galaxy S2](http://bcmon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bundles/gs2_bundle.zip)

3. Follow these instructions:


**Cyanogen 7 &amp; Nexus One**
Download the zip: (Above)
Extract the zip on your device (your sdcard will do fine)
Run 'sh setup.sh' on some terminal (adb ssh, terminal emulator, ...)
Now you have a wifi interface named eth0 in monitor mode
Now run 

'iwconfig eth0' and check that you get a similar output:

    eth0    IEEE 802.11-DS  ESSID:""""  Nickname:""""
              Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: Not-Associated
              Bit Rate:72 Mb/s   Tx-Power:32 dBm
              Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
              Encryption key:off
              Power Managementmode:All packets received
              Link Quality=5/5  Signal level=0 dBm  Noise level=-92 dBm
              Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
              Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0


**Cyanogen 9 &amp; GS2 (I9100)**
Download the zip: (Above)
Extract the zip on your device (your sdcard will do fine)
Run 'sh setup.sh' on some terminal (adb ssh, terminal emulator, ...)
Now you have a wifi interface named wlan0 in monitor mode
Now run 'iwconfig wlan0' and check that you get an output similar to the one above
GS2 Update:  iwconfig wlan0 will show 'Mode: Managed"",  ignore it - airodump should work fine.

*
Other phones
Check out the source from  http://code.google.com/p/bcmon/source/checkout
Build the KO for your device (cyanogen wiki should be helpful)
If it works please tell us and send us the compiled version so we can list it here (if it doesn't work contact us)

4. You can now use aircrack-ng with your phone!

I think it would be interesting for me to learn more about exploit development, but I don't really know how.

I have of course googled for it, read some books about it, watched videos about it, but all exploit development seems to be gravitating around buffer overflows. However, there are now a lot of countermesures for it which makes it alot harder to make exploits now, and I don't feel like I have the experience for it. Another problem I faced was that most resources are for 32 bits programs, and I'm running a 64 bits machine. I understand how buffer overflow exploits work, I just can't create any.

I would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.

Both are wireless, and both will have regular use from its owners. I've instructed one to not patch their machines for the past couple months, so I can try out a few metasploit modules. The other, I've instructed to patch their machines completely a day before I arrive, to include Microsoft and third party (Adobe, flash, shockwave, etc) vendors. I've also insisted that both users change all of their passwords, to include their router password, so I can practice cracking and whatnot. I've also asked them to try to lock down their routers to the best of their knowledge, without attempting to flash the firmware... I did tell them that I would do that for them to remove the WPS vulnerability that I'm going to use to get in. 


I already know their logical network layout, to include vendors of the routers, and I'm certain that I can get access to the network. I even have a buddy who, without their knowledge, is going to try to social engineer one, or both possibly, of the owners, to try to get information from them. This will be a learning experience for all of us.


My setup - I have a both a netbook and a gaming laptop that I will take with me. Both are dual booted with windows and BT5, and I have Alfa cards for both. The netbook has an internal wifi card capable of injection and monitor mode... I will likely be using both at the same time - The netbook will be my primary, while I'm using my gaming laptop to crack passwords and other heavy lifting. 


Now, I already know a lot of the more common hacks, for lack of a better term, such as various MITM methods (ARP poisoning, honey pot), viewing/intercepting traffic, re-routing traffic and directing them to fake sites with help from SET, grabbing credentials, a bit of metasploit, etc. 


Oh, I should include that only the person who is patching their machines will know beforehand that I will be there, as I'll be staying at that house for a few days. The other person gave written consent and will be unaware that I'm doing it, as I'll be hidden behind the alley in my car for the majority of it. 


So my question is, what else is there that I can do? Give me something fun and challenging! I'll have approximately 4 days total, and I have about a week to prepare/practice any new ideas that you guys can give me. :)

(i'm not expecting to get any good in a couple of months, this is going to be a multi-year journal, i'm sure. I'm not looking for the quick way, i'm just trying to keep my interest peaked. I'm not following a tutorial, just trying to figure out exactly what's happening when I do something on the computer)
So, without further a due, let me begin journal'ing my way to knowledge!


Thank you all in advance for any advice.

Your newbie,

Matt.

June 24th: Bored at work, i'm studying TCP/IP's, everything about Ports. 

TCP/IP:

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/TCP_IP.html
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_white_paper09186a008014f8a9.shtml

I just found this book from IBM, I haven't read through it yet, but it certainly has an awful lot of information on TCP/IP. I might not read through the whole thing if it's too technical / overwhelming, but so far it's been helpful in understanding some basics:

http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243376.pdf

Ports:

http://www.pcworld.com/article/230520/dlink_understanding_ports.html

Note: I found a great website that I will probably use quite a bit during this journey. The site is listed below.

I also decided to try my best to avoid using my mouse, and run things from cmd

https://ssd.eff.org/

_______________________________________________________

June 25th: Installed Ubuntu on an old iMac ppc G5 that I had lying around, so I've been pretty caught up in it. Learning the to use terminal is SO MUCH FUN! Holy cow, I'm having a blast. I've also started reading about how websites are hosted, and DNS. I'm not sure if they will help me on my journey, but it's interesting stuff to know.

_______________________________________________________

June 28th: BAH! I'm sorry for not updating this. I've been very caught up in learning Linux, I've totally forgotten about Reddit over the past few days. I've got all of the basic terminal commands down. I'm using XChat as far as IRC goes, if anybody has any better recommendations, I'd certainly appreciate it. I've got Precise Pangolin (12.04) in Dual Boot on my laptop with Windows 7, so maybe I'll just try and stay on my Ubuntu Partition more often.

Anyway, I'll be posting some links and books here in about an hour. I just wanted to update everybody and apologize for having gone rogue for a minute or two.

On a side note, I'm looking for a Webhost / server to host a site for me. I don't have anything interesting to put ON the site, per-say, it's just something to goof around on. Any suggestions?

_______________________________________________________

June 30th: I've finished Learn Code the Hard Way, and I'm moving into Learn Python the Hard Way.

I've also begun a course on Python at www.codecademy.com. Last time I went through this course, it took less than a week, and I didn't retain any of the information. This time around, I'm going to take my sweet time and try to remember everything that I learn.

I'm thinking about picking up SQL as well, but I'm sure that I shouldn't begin this until I've got a firm grasp on Python (might be quite a while).

I've tried entering the IRC channel that /u/Ausome1 suggested, but every time I enter, the room is empty. Any other suggestions on good channels with other beginners?

I'm also looking in to building a NAS Server. I think this will help me understand port forwarding a little better, and just give me an overall better understanding of how things work.

So far, Ubuntu has been pretty difficult to get a solid understanding of. It definitely looks nice, but I feel that I can do much more with Windows. I will not let this deter me from learning the ins-and-outs of Linux, though. I definitely understand the benefits behind free and open-source software.

If anybody has any suggestions, please send them my way! I appreciate all of the help that I've received from this community, and I'm looking forward to one day giving back to this community. All of the messages I've received have been a BIG help.

Maybe somebody can let me know if I am correct in my understanding of SQL injections:

From what I understand, this is when you input some SQL code into, let's say.. a comment on facebook? or some sort of a site that let's you input text. In this text, you would actually write code in SQL that get's filtered into the code of the site itself, thus letting you input your own code (and therefore granting you access to ""inject"" code into the source of the site itself).

I have been tasked with trying to bypass security measures on both the wireless and wired guest connections.

I will be reaching out to 2 separate networking team mates. One governs the wireless and the other* the wired network. 
Question 1: Are there specific questions that I should be asking the networking teams?

Question 2: Any good tutorials on achieving this goal? I am currently researching different methods. For instance I noticed that there is a product called the [PWN PLUG](http://pwnieexpress.com/pages/nac-802-1x-bypass) that supports NAC/802.lx bypassing tools. If that thing can do it I am sure I can figure out a way to do it also.

I know HTML and some basic JavaScript, and am interested in pursuing a career in IT.

Now. I go to school with a gentleman who likes to harass me, and due to his superior size, a physical altercation would not end well for me. Thus, I have chosen to use my computer skills to my advantage. 

The basic idea goes something like this. I would be grateful for any and all corrections or revisions to my plan. I plan on sending him the ProRat trojan, (perhaps through a facebook message?) binded to another file such as a picture or something. Would any kind of antivirus software alert him about the trojan binded to the picture? And if installed, would it be detected by an antivirus software and removed?  I've heard that encrypting the file would make it undetectable, but I know little of how to encrypt files. Or is there anyway I could secretly and remotely install the trojan without ever having to send him a file to click and open? If I were to know his IP, could I use it to install the trojan secretly? Lastly, could I use TOR or a proxy service to help conceal my identity, and decrease the possibility of the hack being traced back to me?

I know I'm very ignorant of the hacking ways at the moment, but I'm willing to learn. I've been reading up on this extensively over the past few days, and decided to come here for assistance. Any and all help would be appreciated.

**TLDR:** I wish to install a trojan remotely, and would be greatful for any help.

Allow me to stop right here and say that I am not here to ask how to crack into someone's computer, steal personal information, or any other stupid shit like that. All I want to do is learn the most basic skill all hackers possess: programming.

Ive read up a bit on the subject (namely [this article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1) which I have so far found to be very well-written), and it appears that a good place for a person like myself to start is to install and begin using Linux or Unix. However, I am on a Windows-operated PC, and from what I've read, Windows and Linux dont get along very well. 

The approach that seems to be highest recommended by individuals with knowledge on the subject is installing a virtual machine, and running Linux within that. 

So, I would like to know: considering my level of knowledge on the subject (slim to none, but enthusiastic to learn), and my current operating system, is using a VM my best approach? And consequently, which VM in particular should I use?

This way if I do ever want to truly uninstall a program I can just reverse the install process and make it like the program was never installed in the first place.

You might say that an uninstaller packed with the program does that anyway. No it does not. More often than not files and reg keys are left behind.

I've always been curious about learning to hack, and now that I'm finally out of school (for unrelated studies), I think I finally have the time to dedicate to learning. Looking through here, I saw a lot of posts on what to learn, but I felt like a lot of the suggestions - many of which were good suggestions - are all over the map.  Some people recommend learning programming, or linux, or hardware, or tools, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of path for someone who would be completely new.

From what I've been able to piece together, it seems like the best thing to do would be to get a solid understanding of how a computer works, and how networks operate; so looking into things like A+ and Network+ would be great.

Learning Linux is something that I know I'll need to do eventually, but I'm not sure what a good reference would be for that. As far as programming is concerned, it seems like the things to learn are C/C++, PHP/Perl, Python, SQL (and Assembly at some point). Python and C are what most people have tended to recommend, but I suppose it depends on what path someone would want to take.

I think it's by this point when I should be at a level where I'd be able to follow along with things in the web games. Seems like a pretty steep learning curve to me. Does this seem like it's a fairly logical progression to really understand what's going on?




TL;DR Does this sound like a good progression to learn? A+ and Network+ -&gt; Linux -&gt; Programming (C and Python) -&gt; basic hacking

I'm a nooblord.

I, like many others as of late, have a hankering to hack and I will soon have a lot of time on my hands, however, I don't exactly know where to start.

I guess I'm a sort of ""script kiddie"" currently (the [Jargon File]( http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/script-kiddies.html) is very useful). I can code HTML and CSS (I have a freely hosted site I mess around on), and have recently been dabbling in black hat script kiddie methods (like keyloggers and basic PHP for phishing), but solely for some basic learning, nothing malicious. I would like to start learning an actual programming language, but I think that learning Linux first would be better.

I have never used a PC OS other than Windows, but I would greatly enjoy for that to change. I've heard some good things about Ubuntu, and some even better things about Backtrack/Kali Linux, but I don't really know which to choose. Sadly, I am on a shared computer, and thus can't have a dual boot, but I could make a bootable DVD or a VM: not sure on those choices either. EDIT: I recently have remembered an old PC I can use as a completely Linux machine. 

Pretty much anything constituting of even mediocre advice would be greatly appreciated.

I need to write a script that will automatically vote for a user every day. Now that sounds pretty simple, but the catch is that I need this script to vote on a 3rd part app hosted on facebook. 

Note: It is actually not against the rules of the app's contest to vote everyday.

Here is what I have gathered so far:

The vote button for a particular entry is done like so:
        
`&lt;a class=""vote_link vote"" href=""#"" onclick=""SST.vote_for(widget_12266787, 16869325, this); return false;""&gt;Vote&lt;/a&gt;

Essentially the format is:

`&lt;a class=""vote_link vote"" href=""#"" onclick=""SST.vote_for(widget_id, entry_id, this); return false;""&gt;Vote&lt;/a&gt;

Anyone know how I can execute this from an external website using facebook login or something?

~~EDIT: So of course after writing out this wall of text, it suddenly starts working. I'm not sure if this whole time I was actually forgetting to enable IP forwarding or what, but I can now watch in realtime as packets are forwarded or not by toggling net.inet.ip.forwarding on and off. I swear it wasn't working before...oh well. I'll leave this here in case anyone else has any suggestions or questions regarding the usage of Ettercap.~~

~~~

I've spent the past couple days tooling around with Ettercap with a decent amount of success, but I just can't seem to figure out one big problem with performing a man-in-the-middle attack against any of the computers on my home network. In short, I can successfully sniff traffic between any host and the gateway, and browsing remains (relatively) normal on the target machine with the exception of any connections over SSL (i.e. anything on port 443).

A little background info on the environment: I'm using a mid-2011 macbook pro with Ettercap installed via Homebrew. I have a working sslstrip plugin for Ettercap, but as the issue occurs with or without it running, I'll ignore that for now. Starting the attack looks something like this (using another computer on the LAN at 192.168.1.134 as a target and 192.168.1.1 as the gateway):

    sudo ettercap -TqP ""autoadd"" -i en1 -a ""/usr/local/etc/ettercap/etter.conf"" -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.134/

After some trial and error I discovered that setting net.inet.ip.forwarding to 1 before running Ettercap is pointless, as Ettercap apparently sets it back to 0, so after running the above command I then run:

    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

Lastly, in my etter.conf I have the following lines uncommented and modified appropriately:

    ec_uid = 0
    ec_gid = 0
    redir_command_on = ""ipfw add set %set fwd 127.0.0.1,%rport tcp from any to any %port in via $iface""
    redir_command_off = ""ipfw -q delete set %set""

The above is enough to get a basic mitm attack working, and I get a lot of interesting data as a result. This includes https traffic; however, the big issue is that while I see traffic over SSL, the target computer apparently never receives the intercepted packets. I can continue to access any site over normal http (albeit slightly slower, as ping tests have shown me), but any https requests time out. In Ettercap I see something like:

    Sat Apr  6 16:00:50 2013
    TCP  192.168.1.134:57302 --&gt; 173.194.46.9:443 | S

So I know requests are being made and data is being transferred, but if I try to access facebook.com or google.com (for example, really anything prepended with https), I get nothing but a blank screen. I would expect a warning page from the phony certificate, but I never see that either. OpenSSL is definitely functional and I'm under the impression that it should be the one generating certs on the fly, but correct me if I'm wrong.

As an aside, my connections list looks something like this, and I'm curious what the ""M"" designates:

        192.168.1.134:57554 -  74.125.227.180:80    T open    TX: 0 RX: 0
        192.168.1.134:57555 -  74.125.227.180:80    T open    TX: 0 RX: 0
    M   192.168.1.134:57556 -  74.125.225.225:443   T opening TX: 0 RX: 0
    M   192.168.1.134:57557 -  74.125.227.180:443   T opening TX: 0 RX: 0
    M   192.168.1.134:57558 -  74.125.227.180:80    T opening TX: 0 RX: 0
    M   192.168.1.134:57559 -  74.125.227.180:80    T opening TX: 0 RX: 0
    M   192.168.1.134:57560 -  74.125.227.180:80    T opening TX: 0 RX: 0

i want to automate a process that i am only allowed to use every 24h. I already unscrambled the Javascript to get some useful informations. But let me start from the beginning. 

I have this &lt;a&gt;-tag that i want to ""click"":

    &lt;div id=""bump_info"" class=""notice_box""&gt;
        &lt;a href=""#"" id=""bump"" title=""asdasdasd"" class=""site_fbtn""&gt;
            TEXTTEXTTEXT
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 

Due to the JavaScript i found those two code snippets in the scrambled code. The first is the actual request:

    $('#bump').bind('click', function () {
        if ($('#log_edit').length != 0) {
            alert('Save or cancel the log that is currently in edit mode.')
        } else {
            var options = {};
            options.resource_id = $('input[name=""resource_id""]', $('#data_form')).val();
            options.member_id = $('input[name=""member_id""]', $('#data_form')).val();
            options.action = 'bump';
            $.get(qajax, options, function (data) {
                $('#bump_info').empty().append(data).hide().fadeIn('fast')
            }, 'html')
        }
        return false
    });

And the domain variables in a separate JavaScript file:

    var domain = location.protocol + '//' + location.hostname;
    if (domain == 'http://www.xxx.com') {
        //my_url        = 'http://localhost';
        //bpath         = '/xxx/';
        //cdn_domain           = 'http://localhost';
        my_url = 'http://www.xxx.com';
        bpath = '/';
        cdn_domain = 'http://www.xxx.com';
    } else {
        my_url = 'http://www.xxx.com';
        bpath = '/';
        cdn_domain = 'http://cdn.xxx.com';
    }

But now there is still something missing... The informations for the actual request (resource_id and member_id). I took a look at the HTML again and found this:

    &lt;div class=""hidden""&gt;
        &lt;input type='text' name='member_id' value='550XXX'/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""resource_id"" value=""989XXX""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""subject_id"" value=""3""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""group"" value=""resource""/&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""server_id"" id=""server_id"" value=""147XXX""/&gt;

        &lt;div id=""resource_updated""&gt;0&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

So i played a bit with cURL but without satisfaction. :/
What i have so far is:

    #!/bin/bash
    cookieFILE=""cookies.txt""
    
    curl \
      --trace trace.txt \
      --cookie $cookieFILE \
      --cookie-jar $cookieFILE \
      -H ""X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"" \
      ""http://www.XXX.com/qajax.php?action=bump&amp;resource_id=989XXX&amp;member_id=550XXX"" \
      -vL

My cookies.txt:

    # Netscape HTTP Cookie File
    # http://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html
    # This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.

- Windows Server 2008 (not R2)
- Ubuntu 10.04
- a couple of Kioptrix VMs

So, on the Server 2k8, I had installed the DHCP service. This was so that I can do a UDP scan and see its open port. I found though, that when I ran -sU against the Server 2k8 that the DHCP port wasn't detected. Any ideas why that is? When I would run the same scan against the Linux distros, they were returning ports of interest.

Okay, how do I understand the XMAS and NULL scan. I do understand that an open port will send no response back, whereas a closed port will respond with an RST packet. When I'd scan the Server 2k8, nothing would happen as the scan would hang there. The same scan against the rest of the targets would return results within 2 seconds. Likewise for the NULL scans. What is the difference between the Server 2008 and Windows XP that one hangs and the other doesn't? Can someone please explain this. Is it because Server 2k8 is more TCP RFC compliant than XP, or less than, and that's why the XP and Linux VMs respond to a XMAS and NULL scan?

they've managed to block 3rd party IRC clients from having access.

I was wondering, how is this achieved? To my knowledge, it's not something the server itself can do so I assumed it was something on the Flash Client that alters your data in some way when it is passed to the server (e.g. tagging a key at the start of your Nick) then something on the server checking for this key and disconnecting you if it isn't present.

Curiously, I've noticed it only disconnects you when you try to perform an action. The initial connection works, server info, MOTD, etc. But it's after running a JOIN command that it detects the client and disconnects you.

Additionally, there are users with 'hacked' clients which can still access it but I can't work out HOW.

I've run through the client's Actionscript and found nothing, however I lack fluency in AS so I might have missed something.

Does anyone know how they are achieving this, and how it could be overcome (e.g. how to create the so-called 'hacked' client)?

We have another account for administrator access on the PC, which we use with logmein and RDP to manage the PC.

My dad changed the workgroup/domain on his laptop for some reason, which ended up with him not being able to log in. Rather than have him grovel at the feet of his superiors, I figure'd I'd try my hand at saving him.

Booted it up in kali, grabbed an unencrypted SAM dump file, took it back to my main kali box, and ran John the Ripper on it. Immediately the crisis was averted, as there is an administrator account named 'Spare', with no password on it. WOOT. That works fine to log in. Now we can change his workgroup back, and get everything working as it should.

Here's why I'm here -- It revealed a 2-part Administrator password that _doesn't work_.

Output looks like this:

    56           (Administrator:2)
    ABC1234      (Administrator:1)

In my case, the letters aren't `ABC`, but they're close, and only 3 digits long, all seemingly in capitals. When I combine these two lines together to form the _magical_ `ABC123456`, it doesn't work!

I'm not sure what to try. Is it correctly displaying all caps, or is it always displaying all caps? Any ideas?

As an initial caveat, I should say that my experience with hacking so far has been purely social engineering, I know how to google my computers errors but little beyond it.

I have a project in mind, to create a computer the goal of which is to hide my identity on the internet as well as possible, here is what I *want* to create and the purpose I want it to serve.

1. Build a computer out of old spare hardware parts
2. Complete HDD format and fresh OS install (Unsure which OS)

I want the computer to be set up so that you *cannot* access the internet in any way whatsoever, without pre-setup anonymizing safeguards being activated.

Humans fuck up, someday I *will* click the wrong button or not iniate the proper programs in the correct order and that will then rather ruin the entire point. I thus need a safeguard built into the computer that would make it basicly go ""Human Error, you're an idiot and I just saved your bacon"" when that day comes.

Things I might want to do on this computer:

* Social websites (Facebook, Twitter and so forth)
* IM/Video/Voice chat software (Should be capable of running all the major ones, AIM, Yahoo Messenger, Skype etc)
* Downloading/Uploading files to the web and other computers directly (Be it via DCC, IM services, Dropbox etc)
* Stream video and audio
* E-mail
* Online gaming (Be it via steam or World of Warcraft)
* Operate a RAT (This last one isn't really high priority as again, I'm more of a social engineering guy but it seemed fun and I might want to do it just to fuck with someone's CD tray at some point)

Now, I'm looking to keep this simple. I am a firm believing in keeping things simple and streamlined, and not to mention with extra redundancies.

My ambitions are probably disappointingly boring, I am not part of the arab spring, I probably won't steal millions in bitcoin or anything particularly nefarious, honestly, I'll probably just end up using it for some very simple social engineering stuff just to keep my hand in the game. But if you're going to do a thing, might as well do it right.

So let's pretend I'm a super duper evil master criminal bent on world domination, and that everyone will be after me. What options do I have? What are the pros and cons and what levels of security do they grant me?

This computer is 100% dedicated to this purpose, unintended people will not have physical access to it.

There will be multiple other computers in the home, all connected to the internet, as it stands through the same router, these computers will be used in the normal way. I am not sure what issues this might cause if any but hopefully someone can tell me if this is an issue.

Hope you guys can help, and regardless of the outcome thank you all for the many other contributions to this subreddit I've enjoyed since I found it, interesting stuff even if your tech know-how is low.",,False,,t5_2uxyh,False,,,True,t3_1c9j78,http://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/1c9j78/need_some_help_in_creating_a_stealth_computer/,

I am a researcher that does a lot of molecular work.  I use a program called Vector NTI.  

Background on the program.  Vector NTI is a sequence analyzer that can be used for many features like cloning, making primers, finding restriction cut sites, etc.  This program used to be free!  It was awesome, you had an issue with it, you emailed the guy and it was fixed damn near immediately

It has been since sold and sold with a HUGE price tag.  It is now costing $1000/year to use the program, and if you are non academia, that price ticket can be up in 5000/year price ticket(in case you don't know, this is potentially TAX dollars paying for this because of where the grant/funding is coming from...).  Did I mention this program WAS free.  The improvements that have been made do not suffice the price tag!  If you have problems with the program, you have to email them with a long turnaround time, or leave a message and they will get back to you in a 24 hour window.  If any one is in science, time is money, and if you are sitting during an experiment, you are literally stuck until the next step...

Anyways, I believe this product should be free again due to the lack of support this program has with a high price ticket, oh and this money is also TAX dollars

Basically, there's a hero called Twisted Fate. His W cycles through three cards (Red, yellow, blue, repeat). You have a 0.525 second window to select each card. Now here's what makes this a difficult skill to use effectively: After selecting a card, it stores the amount of time it took for you to pick it (ie. if you selected a yellow card .3 seconds into the pick it would save .225). Once you throw the card (it activates on your next autoattack), it starts the cooldown. As soon as the cooldown is up, it begins cycling through again (from the .225 stored before). 

This essentially means that to use the skill perfectly, you have to keep a running timer, 100% accurately, throughout an entire game (potentially 60+ minutes). If you can't do this (and trust me, very few TF players do this, not even the super high level ones) then you have to wait a second after casting it to pull the correct card.

What I want to do is somehow read data from the game (ie. that the CD is up) and automatically display which card would be selected if you were to double tap W and lock one in instantly. My main problem is that I don't understand how to get this data; doing the rest should be fairly simple for me.

Again, sorry if this is the wrong place (and I'd love if someone could direct me to the right one!), I just have no experience with injecting into an EXE, and it sounds like hacking to me :P.",,False,,t5_2uxyh,False,,,True,t3_1gzuto,http://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/1gzuto/not_sure_this_is_the_right_place_looking_for_help/,
