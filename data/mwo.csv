Since missile damage has made LRM's basically no threat, everyone is sitting back and sniping. It's ridiculous, it's really really shit when 75% of your own team just sits and hides behind a rock, waiting for an opportunity to snipe one highlander as it jumps up from behind another rock over there. Anyone who tries to get in brawling range just gets owned, either because their back up is sitting back at base waiting to PPC someone, or because you can't make it across the field in the first place. On top of that, when you aren't getting shot in the face from 1km away, you disconnect and have to wait 5 years for the game to realise your mech isn't actually still in a match. 

Things that need to happen:

* Jump jets need to make aiming extremely difficult, particularly as mechs get heavier
* Mechs mid jump should suffer effects of newtonian physics, i.e if their left shoulder takes a PPC/AC/whatever shot, the mech should spin to the left.
* missile damage needs to increase, not to levels it was before, but enough to make people think about keeping their heads down
* please fix this fucking disconnection problem
* **Edited: It's been suggested that it's SRM damage that needs a boost, as there is currently no incentive to close down the distance and brawl, I tend to agree with this**


For the love of god sort this out, because I'm losing all enthusiasm for the game. It was better than this during the LRMpocalypse, at least you could use cover and AMS to get from one place to another, then when you were in brawling range the LRMs couldn't get you.

Right now, sniping takes no skill and makes the game incredibly boring. It's also made medium mechs utterly useless, as even if you don't charge ahead, you get completely and utterly annihilated due to the whole match devolving into a high damage alpha snipe fest. 

Edit: I'm aware this is probably going to get downvoted into oblivion, as there are probably quite a few people who are raking in plenty of C-bills with tactics such as this, but it IS making the game fucking boring. 

**Edit 2: Well, this has been upvoted higher than anything else in the last month and some good points have been raised. If this is going to get attention, try and keep the thread geared towards healthy discussion**

As part of a recent push by the competitive tournament community to reach out to the devs, I spoke with several other members of the community.  They are all seeing the same meta (both in 8-man and in PUGs), and recommend the same balance changes.  I'm trying to raise awareness of the issue (and some quick, simple solutions), since PGI doesn't currently seem to have a good structure for listening to the players who spend the most time trying to break game balance.  The mwomercs forum post can be found at http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/124605-the-gameplay-balance-problems-leading-to-the-peek-and-shoot-meta/

**Introduction**

There is currently a growing consensus among many of the more competitively-minded players that the game is rapidly becoming one dimensional. Not only in competitive 8-mans, but in higher-ELO PUG matches, the game tends to devolve into a sniping match. Due to low heat and high projectile speeds of PPC-type weapons, it is very easy to hit any ‘Mechs which expose themselves for any considerable period of time. In particular, it encourages “peek and shoot” snipers (usually Stalkers, due to their narrow profile with high-mounted energy hardpoints) who spend a minimal period exposed to potential counter-fire. Moreover, even when these snipers are closed in on, they are often able to out-brawl supposed brawlers - in large part due to the state of SRMs (normally a crucial part of the brawler’s arsenal - now obsolete), and the relative heat efficiency of PPCs and the ERPPC+Gauss combo.

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Ballistics**

Really, there is only one in each category worth mentioning: the AC/20 for brawling and the Gauss rifle for sniping. 

There are some real trade-offs here. The gauss weighs an extra ton, and will explode (though its ammo will not). It also does 5 less damage. On the other hand, it gains extreme range, increased projectile speed, and very low heat. 

Ultimately, the extra fragility the Gauss provides, along with the fact that the AC/20 still packs a hard and heat-efficient punch make the trade-off here an interesting one. These two super-heavy ballistic weapons are close to balanced in their different roles - one of the few examples of this. 

**Ballistic Supplementary**

You can ""snipe"" with AC/2s, their range is long enough. However, they will spread their damage at range, and don't work well in the peek-and-shoot strategy currently prevalent. A gauss will destroy them every time if well played. Likewise, the UAC/5 is a potent weapon, but its fast refire-rate precludes defensive torso-twisting, and therefore really falls more into a fire-support role (where AC/2 and AC/5 also live). The AC/10 tends to be outclassed by the AC/20 or the gauss rifle, depending on the intended use, while the LBX/10 suffers from spread preventing panel-focusing. Machine guns are getting better, but still remain relatively weak. Damage is very low, and ""criticals"" after armor is stripped are unimportant when it's still so much easier to just knock out the entire section with a ""real"" weapon.

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Energy**

ERPPCs and PPCs represent the energy weapons used for sniping. For brawling, the favored weapons are medium and large lasers (and in the past, large pulse). The difficulty, of course, is that heat efficiency is actually not in the favor of brawling weapons. Medium lasers provide a significant tonnage savings compared to the sniper weapons. However, they have the same heat efficiency (i.e. staying power) in a brawl. Moreover, the tonnage savings cannot be used to improve this - since heat sinks are mostly maxed out on snipers anyway, nor can additional firepower be acquired, due to hardpoint number limitations. Large lasers are taken on brawlers primarily to offset hardpoint caps (if you don’t want to take SRMs, and have only 1 ballistic slot, then you need to put on lots of energy to still have firepower). They too have comparable heat efficiency to the PPC (somewhat ahead of the ERPPC) - but suffer from having a one second beam duration, during which the torso must remain still and on target - enough for a skilled opponent to easily line up a shot, while the PPC user is able to shoot and immediately defensively twist. 

The PPC is a better brawling weapon than the supposed brawling energy alternatives. Before HSR was implemented for PPC/ballistics, PPCs received some (needed) buffs to their heat and travel speed. The weapon was relatively balanced - even on the strong end. However, once HSR improved their ability to hit targets, those buffs became excessive and these weapons came to dominate gameplay. It may make sense to increase heat and/or decrease projectile speed again. 

**Energy Supplemental**

ERLL seem superficially to fill a similar role to the ERPPC. However, at ranges where they have an advantage over the standard large laser, it is very difficult to keep the beam from spreading damage on a moving target. It is also roughly as hot as the ERPPC. Small lasers and small pulse lasers can have a role on very fast ‘Mechs. However, their 90m range is too close for effective brawling focus fire. Large Pulse and Medium Pulse have shorter ranges and weigh more than their standard variants. More importantly, they generate even more heat per point of damage dealt. This is widely considered to more than offset the slightly shorter beam duration. 

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Missile**

None of the missile weapons really fall into either category effectively at the moment. For the same reason AC/2 is not a sniper weapon, but a fire support, the LRM is also relegated to the fire support role. SSRMs are useful, but the very low total damage (3/hardpoint) means they are really only useful against smaller, harder-to-hit ‘Mechs. 

**SRM Balance**

SRMs have been the quintessential brawler weapon in MWO in months past. In fact, throughout Battletech lore, nearly every ‘Mech that aspired to brawl carried at least one launcher. In the past, SRMs were overpowered. At one time, they did 2.5 damage per missile, and splashed full damage to many components. Moreover, the old trajectory meant that if you ""face hugged"" an enemy (collided with, and stayed within ~10m), your missiles would all hit in a pinpoint manner. The new trajectory prevents this, and encourages use throughout the effective range - a welcome change. 

However, SRMs are currently gimped. Compare, for example, ASRM6 to a large laser. With one ton of ammo, weight is equivalent, and 2 extra crits (and explosive potential on one of them!) are paid. You also do the same damage with both systems. The large laser generates slightly more heat, but the SRM spreads the damage, has a very slow projectile, a limited number of shots, and has a hard-capped 270m max range. The quintessential brawling weapon is out-classed in a brawl by the medium-range weapon. This is not to point out that the Large Laser is overpowered. In fact, it is one of the most balanced weapons in the game. SRMs are inefficient right now, and need a buff. The flight path, spread, and range all make the weapon unique, so the obvious thing to buff would be the damage. 2.0 damage would be a good start. More numbers can be tweaked in the future. 

**Why the ""boating penalty"" currently proposed will not fix PPCs or the ""peek-and-shoot"" meta**

One of the most popular builds at the moment is the Stalker with 4 PPCs (often ER, but sometimes a mix of standards or even all PPC). They “ridge hump” to expose themselves to minimal return fire - cresting just the head and arms for a second, shooting, and dropping back down. The game often boils down into two broad stages - first is the sniping phase. Here, the team crests, fires, and drops down to cool off and take cover. Heat is of minimal concern, since you should be safe from any return fire until you decide to crest again - so a 10 heat penalty can be shrugged off if needed. The second phase is encountered when one side tries to push up on the other. For lack of a better word, it is the brawl, when cover is, to a large extent, negated. Here DPS comes into play significantly more - making the penalty meaningful. However, PPCs and ERPPCs generate heat very quickly - even just firing 3 at a time at cool down will quickly bring you to max heat capacity. The extra little bit of alpha would be nice, but is ultimately superfluous during the brawl. Moreover, many other highly effective builds feature Gauss with 2 or 3 ERPPCs - which would not at all be impacted by this change. 

Nerfing the interesting (and in no way OP) HBK-4P to the ground would be in vain. 

**Conclusion**

The “peek and shoot” meta, which saw its first iteration with quick shots from minimally exposed jump-snipers has remained completely dominant in high level play despite changes to the dreaded jump sniper. With the changes to jump jets, jump snipers must now expose themselves to significant counter-fire in order to line up a good shot (though it would be nice to remove some of the more nauseating effect - as well as make jump jets useful again in light-on-light combat). However, ‘Mechs such as the PPC-boat Stalker, which could already compete with jump snipers at their best, were unaffected by this change. Naturally, they have become dominant.

Two problems present themselves, leading to the current one dimensional state of the game, where there are 3 weapons (PPC, ERPPC, Gauss), and one strategy (peek and shoot). First is the efficiency of the PPC/ERPPC relative to other weapons. It is both too easy to hit enemies at 1000m+ range and keep up a barrage if and when they close. Both heat and projectile speed (if PPC projectile speed is lowered significantly, Gauss should slow slightly, to preserve the different behaviors between the two weapons) should be looked at for nerfs. It is impossible to know what the right number is without testing, but it certainly does not seem that the current values are comparable to the other energy weapons. 

Second (and most important) is the state of SRMs. In the past, a good sniping team still had to fear an aggressive and clever brawling opponent. While running across the open was dangerous, if a team could close under cover to 270m and only take a hit or two on the way there, they could expect their weapons would out damage the enemy’s. However, only the AC/20 is even close to that mark currently - and SRMs are desperately needed to fill that void of viable super-close-range weapon. 

What’s more, the presence of effective SRMs also encouraged builds other than pure sniper or pure brawler. Hybrids, which carried both PPC/Gauss and SRMs for defence were very popular, as were fast flanking mediums which could afford SRM tonnage, but not AC/20 tonnage. Very strong PPCs have also contributed to the decline of use of the light and medium classes, since these sniping weapons are very heavy - precluding them from being boated on the lighter classes, and are so fast that hitting even a smaller, faster target at extreme range is not uncommon. Presumably a decrease in their effectiveness would help the light and medium classes. 

Once the public test server becomes available, many competitive players would be absolutely delighted to help PGI test some of these changes and come up with solutions that work not only for high-level competitive players, but also more average players. Dialogue between the developers and some members of the competitive community could help the game reach a more dynamic state. Other games, including the wildly successful League of Legends, have followed such a model with great success. We want MWO to be as successful, but fear that it might falter if it does not get input from some of the players who spend the most time and effort studying the game in order to kill each other most effectively.

1362770255.0,80,self.mwo,19xego,How PGI Can Make Lots of Money From Testing Grounds—And How Players Will Love It,devourerkwi,89,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/19xego/how_pgi_can_make_lots_of_money_from_testing/,"I had what I believe to be a very good idea to not only make the Testing Grounds even better for players with added value but that will potentially make PGI a lot of cash.  Here are the details:

* Allow Testing Grounds mode to let a player test any 'Mech—including and especially Hero 'Mechs—with any configuration, even if the player does not own the variant or necessary components to do so
* Once a player selects ""Training Grounds"" as the game mode it would pop up a 'MechLab that includes their currently owned 'Mechs in addition to every stock variant
* The player can then select and customize any variant of any chassis at will—including components, upgrades, and modules—in a fee-free, non-persistent way
* The player won't pay for anything done in the Training Grounds 'MechLab and once the Training Grounds are exited the changes are lost
* Any changes made in the Training Grounds 'MechLab to 'Mechs the player owns would revert back to their previous state after the practice match
* Having a separate ""Saved Training Grounds 'Mechs"" section would be an even better way of enticing players get excited about possible new designs, but constantly rebuilding the design being tested—assuming it hasn't been built and purchased on the live server—is acceptable for now
* On the endgame screen leaving the Testing Grounds, have a button saying something like, ""Like this 'Mech?  Click here to make it yours!""
* The button auto-navigates to the 'MechLab and selects the 'Mech the player just tested for purchase with MC (which would then have to be confirmed again by the player)
* A secondary option (as suggested by [tunarr](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/19xego/how_pgi_can_make_lots_of_money_from_testing/c8s82wp)) is adds a button that allows the tested loadout to be purchased with C-Bills if the player has enough in their account
* If the player does not have enough bays to purchase a new 'Mech, they would get a message that 300 MC were added to the cost of the purchase in order to facilitate the acquisition (I think this is a good idea in any case)
* When the player does not have enough MC available to purchase the tested variant (and, if necessary, a bay slot), the button instead changes to say something like, ""Like this 'Mech?  Click here to add MC to make it yours!""
* In this case, clicking the button would automatically select the smallest MC package necessary to afford the 'Mech (and its bay, if necessary), using a system akin to the one outlined above
* Should the player already own the variant brought to Testing Grounds, this system would invite the player to test a variant they do not own, invite them to add Premium time—using the same system as above, defaulting to pre-selecting a purchase for 30 days of Premium—or would simply not activate

This system lets the players test out literally anything they can think up, giving us the ability to make live-fire trials of designs we math out, and then purchase them when we fall in love with them.

2. This is BETA.  NOTHING here is set in stone.  Remember the qqing over the Laserback?  They fixed it.  LRMs?  Fixed it (and are still tweaking).  Ridiculous engine caps?  Fixed it.  And they're working on ECM.

3. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.  Hero 'mechs being MC-only caused a huge uproar...  For about a week.  Now how many posts are there on this subreddit about heroes being ""Pay to Win""?

Update: SOME numbers, and a target date.

**Machine Guns**
MGs are getting their damage doubled to 0.08/shell.
MG range is going to be 120m and they will fall off to 0 damage at 240m.
MG Spread will remain unchanged for the moment. 

**LB10-X** has had it's cone of fire reduced by 20%, giving it a bit more focused punch through it's travel space.

**LRM** speed will be increasing from 100m/s to 120m/s. This equates to about 5-10% more missiles hitting a moving target and it's quite a bit harder to dodge LRMs.

**AC/5**
After reading my last post, I think I was smoking something other than a cigarette when I said AC/5 damage would be changing. AC/5 damage is NOT changing. Their range however is increasing from 540m out to 620m.

**NARC** is going to have its firing distance increased as well as it's duration. This is still undergoing testing and will have numbers for you when they're ready.

**BAP**
Now here's the biggie. BAP is meant to increase your sensor range by amplifying your sensor systems. It allows you to get detail targeting information faster and also allows you to detect nearby shutdown Mechs. Yeah? So?... well...

**BAP will now negate ECM within 150m (tuning number) of the enemy.** Negate? What 'chu talkin' 'bout Paul?

If Mech X has BAP, and Mech Y has ECM, and Mech X gets within 150m or less of Mech Y, Mech Y loses all effects of ECM. **It is a 100% counter to ECM**. Mech Y is now vulnerable to LRMs/S-SRMs as long as Mech X stays within 150m. Any friendly Mechs to Mech Y will no longer be shielded until Mech X leaves the 150m area around Mech Y.

ECM is now a long range Mech item. A scout can now use it to remain hidden from LRMs while performing their job. A LRM/command Atlas can rain down death while maintaining LoS on their distant targets without worries of LRMs coming back at them.

**ECM is now getting a dedicated hardpoint that works just like AMS**. It will be located in a dedicated component such as the right or left torso.

**ECM will also no longer mess with friendly IDF markings** so you always know who's friend and foe.


**Missile Update**:
Missiles are coming along. A lot of stuff has been rewritten and we have to test and retune numbers to get them ready to be released back into the live game. So far LRM's are looking really good and SRM's are soon to be addressed as well. As of this writing we're putting the final numbers on LRMs so they'll be ready for large scale testing very soon.

**DATE: All of the above is expected to be released in the May 21st patch.**

_________________________

*1st day playing MWO:*

Holy fuck. JESUS. So many stuffs (and buttons) to learn! Eh what this alpha thing button do... and boom goes the back of the mech leading in front of me. Uhhh maybe I'll start with training mode.

_________________________

*2nd day:*

Oooh there's a lot of logics in this game. *You actually gotta think man.* Where I move, where I shoot. And plus its *slow* (reminds me of X3) so any move I did counts a lot. A BIG LOT. People playing this game are quite clever too... and then cue the fifth time downed by a Stalker. :/

_________________________

*3rd day:*

Still hardly remember those variants. Also why the hell some mech can almost 1 shot you? Right now running the trial assault mech that can jumpjet. Also liking the indirect LRM so far (prior to LRM patch + hotfix). Well, I think I found my range...

_________________________

*4th day to week end:* 

Got my first Atlas (DDC). Sooo now I'm broke. Looked around and I just realized that those crazy C-bills rate is only for the first 25 matches. 

Hmm.. WELL WHO CARES. I FUCKING GOT AN ATLAS WOOOOO

_________________________
*Atlas DDC first match:*

Twas grilled hard. And some guy in the chat asked what's the point of getting DDC if I don't even equip ECM.  
My thoughts: what ECM?
_________________________

*Atlas DDC, lots of matches afterwards:*

PPC YOOO. Them pilot skills almost halfway getting that 4x magnification. Equipping LRM now. It seems I'm pretty comfortable fighting at long ranges. And then I had these sad realization about why bother purchasing an Atlas at all if I'm fighting all the way back? Trashed my atlas build and came up with..
_________________________

Atlas DDC ""Yamato"":

Weaps: 2 ER PPC, 3 Streaks SR2, 1 AC20, 1 MG
Others: DHS, Artemis, BAP, ECM, AMS, STD300, leg armor ~51-ish

Yes yes. Noob build of course but what's important here, I know these words.

__________________________

*Past week:*

Taken a more direct command of the team.  

Map: Tourmaline.  
Mode: Assault  
Situation: Dire. Enemy already halfway thru the map and almost encroaching base.   

The team has been sticking under my ECM religiously so I shouted to approach into C4 (or D4?). Even then, everyone is too close. ""Hold and spread"".

One guy copied. The rest followed. An Atlas head pops up over the corner with no blue mark. Looking at everyone's aiming direction, I signal the Raven, ""let them in"".


End of round: 8-0.  
Personal record: 2 kills 5 assist, dmg 600+.

After that, I went outside, take a breath, smell the fresh air, and then sit down for a long time thinking how amazing that battle went and how harder to even pull it off without knowing anybody on the team. 
_________________________
**Final Verdict:**  
**This game is fun. Slow, yet fun; Hard to grasp at first (learning the ropes was not that bad) but since most of it was rooted in understandable logics (i.e. heavy = bulkier/more weapons, lighter mech, = less weapons, fast), it is much easier to understand. If anything, it is a properly made pseudo-FPS that lets you relax while playing it. I like it.**

Things I wish they change / add:

1. Clearly notify user about that Cadet Bonus period in-game.
2. Final damage display on some weapons (SRMs, Shotty) (minor quibbles)
3. Add a quick note about choosing your first mech.
4. Custom HUD (hard call I know)
5. Those auto-detect screens in your cockpit. Why can't you use them?

I am sure lots of people have much better stats, I just want to establish that I am an experienced player.

I've been pretty quiet about this stuff, but Paul's recent post is so internally conflicting and differs so greatly from my experience of the game that I feel compelled to weigh in. 

SRMs were the dominant brawling weapon. In a brawl, you needed a mech that could mount a bunch of SRMs to be competitive. As much as I enjoyed using SRMs, this was pretty unbalanced. An SRM damage reduction made sense, although the extent of that reduction seems somewhat excessive given their limited range and accuracy.

The problem with the SRM damage reduction has been that, given that SRMs were the best brawling weapon, reduction in their damage reduced the usefulness of brawlers in general. Simultaneously, the PPC heat reduction and projectile speed increases increased the usefulness of snipers in general. I think the community outcry regarding SRMs is more about wanting to have some more useful close range weaponry, so that if you manage to close the distance against the now-dominant long range mechs you will at least be rewarded for it.

Conversely, PGI is worried about balancing SRMs only in the context of a brawl, with particular concern (at least from Paul) for Splat Cats. This is Paul's current justification for keeping SRM damage so low.

Many people are also upset about the preponderance of PPCs. PGI has taken a different approach here. Instead of reducing damage (as they did with SRMs), increasing heat, reducing projectile speed, increasing weight or increasing size they are proposing a new mechanic that penalises (using heat) simultaneously firing multiple weapons of the same type. This seems like it is intended to address boating in general, rather than PPCs specifically - but PGI has conflated the two by presenting is as a solution to PPC boating.

In my assessment, there are three things going on here: Balancing brawling against sniping, balancing SRMs against other brawling weapons and making boating impractical because Paul wants us all to run bracket builds. If PGI actually felt PPCs were an issue, they would address them the same way they addressed SRMs.

Additionally, I think it's fairly obvious that if you do in fact implement a heat mechanic that punishes boating - and you are concerned about SRM boating - you should address SRM boating using that heat mechanic rather than reducing SRM damage (which affects all mechs using SRMs, not just boats).

I feel PGI should either invest development time in a proper hard-point system - where individual weapons are mounted in individual hard-points with size restrictions - or stop worrying about boating and just balance the weapons.

All in all, the philosophy being applied to weapon balancing here is inconsistent and poorly thought-out. It reeks of ill-conceived executive-level intervention. Maybe Paul should leave this one to the person actually responsible for weapon balance?",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1373604435.0,,,True,t3_1i4qd2,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1i4qd2/feedback_from_an_experienced_player/,

Tribes had a fairly large fanbase and was released just over a year ago. Now, the devs have called it quits and are ending all content creation. They will maintain the servers for now.

I never played it and my understanding was that it was very unbalanced and buggy.

I wanted to post this as a sign that bad production, bugs and lack of balance, can and will kill games. This may seem obvious but the number of times Ive had BT fans tell me nothing could ever really kill MWO is staggering. It does *nothing* to pretend that the game is perfect.

That said, I dont think this will happen to MWO. Atleast I hope it will not. But I hope that it helps people to see the value of a balanced, bug free experience. 

Edit:

I was actually expecting to be downvoted quickly lol. From these comments I see that Hi-rez was probably a  much worse developer than PGI.  Im pretty confident in MWO but at the same time Im taking  a break till it ripens a bit more on the vine.

What's happening here?,jorgenheim,85,30,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1d5oar/heavyhanded_dissenting_opinion_whats_happening/,"We have 3,000 subscribers. We are a relatively small sub-reddit. But I've noticed a disturbing trend that really shows itself on the larger game community reddits. When people make comments, they are heavily downvoted and sometimes with no rhyme or reason.

We, as a community, need to work on improving our tolerance for opinion. The most notable examples, of recent, that I am going to be showing are the following two threads:

[The game as it is now is boring.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1d37ns/the_game_as_it_is_now_is_boring/)

[Just bought a Yen-Lo Wang, any tips on builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1d56gs/just_bought_a_yenlowang_any_tips_on_builds/)

Take a look at the comments section. If you have RES, you can see the ratio of upvotes to downvotes. Most comments are just opinion, yet some with simple descriptions of their builds (Yen-Lo thread) are providing at least a good point in response to the issue. Yet they are heavily downvoted.

I am not asking for people to explain why they are downvoting. They can and that is fine. But remember that voting up or down someone's post is a moderation tool. That's how reddit functions. Even if you disagree, it's a good idea to consider either not voting or even upvoting if you feel the person makes a good point.

We should be keeping [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) in mind here;

###Gameplay###

* 15% of critical damage dealt to an exposed 'Mech component will now be directly applied to the internal structure of that component.

&gt; * This is only applied to the critical damage done. Base weapon damage is not taken into account.
&gt; * Critical damage is not applied through armor.
&gt; * Armor must be reduced to 0% before any crit damage is applied to internals.

* Large Pulse Laser duration reduced to 0.6 (down from 0.75)

* ER Large Laser base heat reduced to 8.5 (down from 9.5)

* SRM6 and 4 have a shared Max Alpha of 3. (SRM4s used to have a 4 threshold)

* **12v12 gameplay is now in.**

&gt; * The 8-man queue is now replaced by a 12-man queue.
&gt; * Players can launch in groups of 1,2,3,4,12. Numbers between 4-12 will be addressed when we get tonnage limits into the game.
&gt; * CB rewards have been adjusted to compensate for the additional 4 players on the battlefield.

* Assault mode base captures now take longer.
* Conquest point captures now take longer.
* Players should be aware that capping in Conquest mode takes longer now, and that it is often wise to pre-plan your routes to account for that.

###Performance###

* Created low and medium spec optimized versions of weapon effects.
* Removed ground level vegetation and debris in Forest Colony and Forest Colony Snow for low spec.

###Bug Fixes###

* Added missing LOD's to Quickdraw Battlemech.
* Added missing LOD's to Highlander Battlemech.

###General###

**First Victory of the Day**

* The first time of each day you win a match for each 'Mech variant (owned or trial), you will earn double the XP rewards at the end of the match
* If one of your Mechs is eligible for the first victory bonus, it will be marked with an ""XP x2"" icon in its Mech Bay
* Once you earn a first victory bonus with a 'Mech, you can't earn the bonus again for that 'Mech until the eligibility resets at 12:00 AM UTC

Also scouting, and lights in general, are significantly less effective. Its a lot more difficult to get a fix on enemy positions or get behind the other team for picks/capping if there are enemy mechs everywhere.

Editing as I go along:

-Ammo does actually run out much quicker, either because there's a lot more to shoot at or because the games are longer. And ideally, yes you'd have extra ammo on your teammates but they don't always pull their weight. So you'll end up in a jager with 0 ammo in a 4v4 situation (Which then becomes a 3v4). Much better to take energy weapons.

-Every match so far has been a total rickroll. I have yet to see a game end with more than 3 mechs down on both sides.

-It is almost impossible to carry a team the way you can in 8v8. Whether that's good or bad is up to you.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1373565066.0,,default,True,t3_1i3bzn,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1i3bzn/12v12_first_impressions/,

Can you hear the sound of bagpipes off in the distance? That is the sound of the Highlander standard variants marching into your mechbay.   This ‘Mech is a sight to behold and now you can take it for a spin without having to be in a Hot Pink Hero mech.

Introducing our first Champion ‘Mech! Chosen by the people for the people! The Dragon 5N is the first stock ‘Mech to get the Champion treatment with a 10% XP boost. Will this replace your existing DGN 5N?  Will this be your first Dragon?  Take the Trial Mech 5N Version for a spin and see how effective this ‘Mech is. 

Battlefield coordination just got easier. We have added Lances and Lance Leader who can issue orders on the battle grid menu. The Commander can now issue orders to both Lances. You can press U to start a Lance Chat message in game. Read and use this feature to coordinate your team and dominate the battlefield! 

For those customization lovers we have new 'Mech Statues for your cockpit and a cool new pattern called Fractal.

  We have Projectile network improvements as well. Auto cannons, Gauss Rifles, and PPCs are affected by this change.  This should make some builds effective for players with high latency.

Read on for more fixes and changes.

____

**New Cockpit items:**

    - Raven statue.
    - Stalker statue.
    - Commando statue.

**New Skin:**

    - Fractal camo spec.

____

**Gameplay**

**Maps**

    - Added baked in shadows to terrain in all maps.
    - Changed geometry near edge of Tourmaline Desert where many players were being led out of bounds.
    - Updated Warning Billboard signs shader in River City.

**Networking**

Host State Rewinding Phase 2 (Ballistic/PPC weapons)

    - You should no longer have firing delay when shooting a ballistic/PPC weapon.
    - You should now be able to hit moving targets with these weapons even when experiencing
       latency up to ~450 ms.
    - Missile weapons are not affected by this change, but will be in the next host state rewinding phase.
    - The complete list of affected weapons:
        - PPC.
        - ERPPC.
        - AC20.
        - AC10.
        - AC5.
        - AC2.
        - Gauss.
        - LB10-XAC.
        - UltraAC5.

**Performance**

    - Extra server compression of movement state transmitted to clients, reducing client downstream costs.
 
**Matchmaking**

    - Added ability to tune weight class and Elo matching thresholds during runtime.
    - Adjusted player Elo down to their correct values by re-simulating match history (to account
       for the Elo-inflation bug).    
    - Users who disconnect during matchmaking are now correctly removed from their pending match.
       This should help reduce the number of erroneous 'failed to find match' errors.
 
**Lances**

    - Players will automatically be grouped into lances when they join a match.
    - Players who are grouped together before entering the match will be assigned to lances
        together as best as possible.
    - There is a maximum of 4 players per lance, and 3 lances per team.
        - Currently, the third lance will only be created if needed because of player groupings.
    - Players will now have a lance HUD element in the upper left of their screen which will inform
        them of their lancemates' health and grid location.
    - Members of your lance will be marked in a different color on your HUD.
    - In addition to taking command of the team, players can choose to take command of their lance
        while in the BattleGrid.
        - The team commander is automatically the commander of his lance.  The team commander's 
           lance cannot have a separate lance commander.
    - Lance commanders can assign orders to their lance.  Only members of their lance will see the orders.
        - Lance commanders are marked with captain's bars.
    - Team commanders can assign orders to all lances, and see the orders given by all lance commanders.
        - Team commanders are marked with a star.
    - Commanders can remove orders they have given by clicking the order on the BattleGrid and choosing
        ""REMOVE ORDER"".
    Team commanders can rearrange lance membership by dragging the players' names to different
     lances on the BattleGrid.
    - Players can chat to just the members of their lance by pressing 'U'.

**Bug Fixes**

    - Fixed an issue where certain users were getting random graphical corruption in the 
        HUD (lots of multi colored polygons).
    - Fixed one case of users crashing mid game.
    - Fixed an issue where users with high latency would be stuck on a black screen after loading into a match.
    - Fixed an issue where after a user failed to load into a map other users could experience a black screen.
    - Fixed a bug that was causing Elo to rise by a large amount when defeating a weaker opponent,
        see details in command chair post.
    - Numerous map bug fixes.
    - Numerous Front End bug fixes.

**General**

    - Additional tooltips added throughout the Front End.
    - Gameplay tips added to loading screens.

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

We decided to head upper city from the low base. Once we reached upper, the entire enemy team was base defending with basically all PPC boats, jump, and ballistic snipers. 

After trading fire between building cover for 30 seconds, it was clear we would be picked apart if we kept that up. The rest of the team did the smart thing and just took cover behind buildings to avoid the 4-5 PPC mechs lined up by the bridge. 

We discussed what the hell we were going to do about it, and decided to send a lance of the faster mechs all the way back to base then around to lower city and back up to flank, since it looked like the other team wasn't going to budge. Being the slow heavies and assaults, we stayed behind in upper trading some potshots and took some light damage to keep them interested. We charged across the river as soon as the other lance reached their base from behind, and in under 30 seconds the match was over 8-1 in our favor with mostly brawlers and short range mechs.

Me too.,lichkicker1,72,18,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1h1f0y/tired_of_negativity_complaints_about_the_latest/,"I had an unfortunate few rounds in a teamspeak dropship with a player that wouldn't shut up about everything wrong with the game. 

Every second of every match was about how PGI have screwed the balance yet again, about how IGP are only out to ream players of their money. Oh, was that a PPC boat that killed me? Fucking PGI screwing with the balance. Why the fuck weren't you guys helping me out? Where was the back up? Why am I playing on teamspeak if we aren't going to help me. 

Me and another guy just suggested... you know, well what do you LIKE about the game? How about some less negativity, you're really bringing us down from enjoying the game here. We're here to have fun blowing up some giant robots.

He ragequit. 

Not even in a hissy fit, where we could mock him and feel better about ourselves. Just dropped group, quit the game and quit teamspeak without another word. What a toxic player.

Now I don't know if you guys have had this experience. But let me tell you, I don't have enough free time in my life to waste it complaining about things. Yes, I am now a hippocampus, as I'm writing this post complaining about complaining (How's THAT for meta ;) ). 

But guys, let me tell you about what I LIKE here. 

I love playing the game, it's fun! I've been playing since closed beta, like many of you I'm sure. I learnt the school of hard knocks in a commando after multiple resets - it's all I could afford! But the mech that has stolen my heart is my DRG FLAME. I have tweaked my FLAME to such a point that any alternative loadout sees a drastic drop in my average match performance. 

I've got it stocked out with a 300XL, 4MPL, AC10. It's not a perfect build for everyone, sometimes I do terrible, sometimes I get on a roll, top the match score charts and get 5 kills! (rarely &gt;_&gt;) But I've found it's always due to my playing, and not the build. I do have it elited, which does a lot for it I suppose.

I get more kills in my AC40 Jager, do more damage in my DDC and I have about 10 other mechs, but I always come back to my FLAME. 

It's a build that has weathered Gausscats, Splatcats, ECM streak carnage, LRM hell, PPC alpha and I believe will do me well in metas to come. 

Yes, there is a lot of work that needs to be done on the game - but let's face reality, PGI isn't a willfully ignorant pack of satans. They aren't trying to wreck your favourite franchise and if they only did it like THIS then it'd be perfect. 

I'd much rather spend my free time just enjoying myself. That's the point of the game... right? I could be wrong on that.

If you see a yellow and black FLAME sporting that build, kill me so I know it's you :)",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,,True,t3_1h1f0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1h1f0y/tired_of_negativity_complaints_about_the_latest/,

1372118393.0,51,self.mwo,1h059j,Complex balance solutions are a step in the wrong direction for the future of this game.,Bukkaking,76,25,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1h059j/complex_balance_solutions_are_a_step_in_the_wrong/,"I think both PGI and some players are wrong in their beliefs that adding layers of complexity into the game is the solution to balance.  The fixes only serve to make the game less accessible and more unattractive to new players.  The best solution to the problem is NOT more resource management or added layers of artificial depth.  From my experience trying to get people interested in playing MWO, most people who come from WoT or other FPS games already complain that the game is too complicated, hard to understand and not newb-friendly.  I understand that to us Battletech fans it doesn't seem that difficult but to a player new it is quite daunting.  PGI does not want this.

I enjoy playing this game and I want it to last, I want new players to keep joining and buying MC so that PGI can make money and continue to develop and expand on the game.  I don't want it to be a small obscure game driven by the wishes of entitled and elitist hardcore fans.

Let's take a well known example in the F2P gaming community, LoL vs DotA:

DotA is well regarded to its fanbase because of the complex and deep levels of strategy involved.  But the downfall is that the systems involved are so esoteric that it is unfriendly towards new players, one needs to learn systems such as denying the opponent CS, leashing jungle camps to reset spawn timers, and complex heros etc which are ESSENTIAL to winning.

LoL is similar to DotA but simplified the model to make it more accessible to new players by removing the more tedious elements and streamlining the interface.  This is GOOD because although the game is easy to learn at face value, it is still difficult to master.  People start having fun right away and it scales in difficulty as you get better.

Right now the problem is that MWO is difficult to learn and easy-medium to master.  New players either can't get past the hump of figuring out how to build a decent mech, or once they figure it out, they get bored because there's nothing to strive for afterwards.  Adding a artificial heat limiter (PGI's idea) or a target computer overload value (Player idea) will just add another unnecessary layer of information that will only serve to frustrate and confuse players.


I think that after the initial balance problems, PGI has learned their lesson in that making broad sweeps and big changes results in disaster (ECM, PPCs, LRMs).  They have recently taken a much more measured approach to game balance (recent LRM patch) which has been successful in my opinion.

Demanding that PGI make big changes that some random guy thought up is not what I want.  I want PGI to keep doing what they are doing, making small balance changes and tweaks and spending their development time on things that matter like CW and 12v12 because that is what will make me spend money on the game.  I don't want them to waste time on a new system that may or may not work to improve the quality of my gameplay.


BOTTOM LINE:
The problem with this game isn't balance, the problem is that there is no endgame or content for people to strive for.  People just whine and cry about balance because that is all they have to focus on since due to the nature of how easy it is to max yourself out in this game: all there is to do is endlessly grind c-bills/xp on the same maps over and over again.  That's why new content is badly needed.

If the MWO team focuses on constant player requests for balance and implementing complex arbitrary systems it will leave them with less time and resources to expand this game in the areas that it needs to be expanded.  If PGI gives in to the wishes of the loudest complainers, then they will be setting a bad precedent of appeasement instead of working on adding content to give veterans something to achieve and streamlining current content to attract new players.

I'm not posting this to bash the Golden Boy. I'm sure there are those who enjoy owning it. Rather I just wanted to applaud PGI in a public manner for resolving a customer complaint in a timely fashion, especially when it concerned a refund of MC.

The game may deserve some of the criticism we aim it's way, but as a customer, I have nothing but respect for the company behind it.

UPDATE

Greetings MechWarriors,

So we have gone and done it again! Victor Hero is releasing first and what a beauty it is. Having The Dragon Slayer in your Mech lab will probably melt your face off with pure ""Mech goodness"". Then again, if you don't buy one, someone else will and they'll melt your face off in battle. The 30 percent C-Bill boost doesn't hurt either. Did you know with a hero Mech and a Premium account you can literally** swim in C-Bills? Sometimes I upgrade and downgrade double heat-sinks just to have a laugh and burn through some C-Bills.
Oh boy It's the ATLAS Champion! Want to try the Atlas RS build that was the Piranha Favourite for much of closed beta? Here you go! It's a mostly-brawler, sometimes sniper build we found very, very fun. So go check it out!

Hey look some Cockpit Items! Mech Statues. Enjoy!

Hey Look a new Mech Pattern! Tartan!...Bless you.... Thank you... You're Welcome!

We have some interesting gameplay tweaks that are going to change how you play. Movement on inclined surfaces and a new overheat mechanic so watch your heat or you might get beat.

Various other Items are all in the patch notes for you to read so go ahead and read them!
See you on the Battlefield!

Matt Newman

###Gameplay###

**New Movement Archetypes.**

* Mechs are now unable to traverse slopes greater than 45°
* Mechs will now slow down when climbing slopes from 20° to 45°, depending on mech size.

**Critical Heat Damage System.**

* Mechs reaching 120% heat will start taking damage to their center torso at (0.75 damage + (0.001 damage per tonne) + (0.001 damage per engine rating)) / 1.5 sec. 
* The damage will continue until heat drops below 100%. This damage will occur both during an automatic shutdown and when overriding shutdown.
* To indicate this heat damage is being applied, a yellow siren light will turn on inside the cockpit.

**User Interface**

* Now showing all three lances on the EoR Screen.
* Changed all references to ""Team Commander"" to ""Company Commander"".
* Minor clean up for Lance UI.

___
###Bug Fixes###

* Quickdraw will now have jump jet effects.
* Fixed an issue where LRMs shot at close range &amp; off target were causing the missiles to perform a gravity whip maneuver.
* Heavy Metal will no longer play it's on kill music if the mech if it's not fully powered.
* Fixed an issue where LRM volleys would share the same spread pattern when firing from a weapon with a small tube count - ie. LRM15 from a 6 tube launcher. Subsequent volleys will now have a different spread.
* Fixed an issue with SRMs and closed weapon doors. SRMs would launch instantly on the client from a weapon with closed weapon doors; however, the server would properly delay the shot to simulate the weapon doors opening. This could result in missiles colliding on the local client but not register any damage. This fix will now open the doors properly before firing. Please NOTE: This issue ONLY occurred with SRMS being fired from launchers WITH CLOSED weapon doors.

___
###General###

* Jenner Founder has a new pattern, with this pattern comes the ability to color it as well. Other Founder Mechs will be getting the same treatment and will come in later patches.
* Added environmental sounds to the levels.
* Updated spawn locations so lance mates will spawn together.
* Improvements to 'Mech damage glow.
* Re-enable F9 button to display the FPS and users location.

Now with MWO, I really want to support the dev team for what they're doing, but in regards to premium time increasing cb and xp gain, 50% of zero is still zero (to put it in exaggerated terms).

If anyone has heard of the game cosmic break , something similar to its ""quest mode"" or story missions with cut-scenes/voice overs. 

It seems to me that the biggest hurdle to this would be the implementation of AI, but I would imagine it shouldn't be too hard, given the amount of resources PGI has at it's disposal. 

Heck they already have a decent number of maps, and if maps are re-used for different ""levels"" they should be fine. as an example of how this goes down, something like this; You are being dropped into forest colony, and need to take down a lance of scouts, and then defend the area against in-coming re-enforcements, then on the next level, its forest colony snow, and you have to lead an exodus of civilians out before the area is bombarded.

“All systems nominal,” declares Betty and our team begins to advance through the diverse environment of Canyon Network.  Everything is going as usual, lights speed off to scout and harass while the rest of the team gets into position for the initial engagement with the opposing mech forces.  

As our scouts reach the enemy team we begin receiving quick pings of available targets mixed with the sound of launching missiles, both incoming and outgoing.  Mechs begin orchestrating their positions to get ready for the first major battle.  Lasers start buzzing through the air like warning shots and ballistic shells shake and rattle the battlefield as initial hopeful rounds are fired.  A few PPC rounds zip by as mechs in the distance try to pick at those who haven’t found cover yet.    

Then things seem to quiet down momentarily, a calm before the storm.  All I hear is the thud of friendly mechs adjusting their positions and the sounds of light mechs dancing in the distance.  Team mates turn and look at each other, silently acknowledging each other, preparing for what is to come. 

Suddenly the calm is broken with a giant volley of LRMs from the opposing force, the real battle has begun.  Our team answers as our own LRMs fly over the landscape of Canyon Network, lasers trail across the terrain, scaring their targets with a molten glow. The report of ballistic shells add a calm yet intimidating cadence to the battlefield’s ambience as they slam into their targets.  PPCs rounds begin hitting targets with silent, deadly precision, their shooters rising and falling from the skyline.

The team communication system suddenly comes alive…

Brave Soul: ""I'm going to sneak around and over heat them with my flamers!""

Brave Soul then turns to the team in his newly found Blackjack and fires off a full armament of flamers at once, almost as a salute, as if indicating he knew he wasn’t going to be coming back.

Rest of the Team: ""lol god speed""

Intrigued, I watch Brave Soul break off to the right, navigating through the canyons and hills, getting closer and closer to the core of the enemy line.  So far he is unscathed, all light mechs are off to the left or intertwining through the center trying to heard the other mechs and break stragglers away from their teams.

An opposing Centurion suddenly comes into view, racing straight towards Brave Soul.  However, the foe has picked his route poorly; most of our team turns to the vulnerable target and open fire.  The enemy Centurion is caught out in the open, only one hill away from Brave Soul, who has come to a stop to allow for the supporting fire to clear the path.  With nowhere to go, the enemy Centurion tries to turn and retreat, but it is too late, one final mixed blast of fire from the team violently blow him up.

Curious, while scanning the battlefield for my first target, I keep an eye on Brave Soul as he pauses behind a hill very close to the enemy team, as if he is contemplating his decisions.  However, his mech suddenly turns towards his targets with confidence; he knows what he must do.  

The battlefield is now a beautiful display of organized chaos.  By now several mechs from each side have fallen and people are engaged in hard fought battles. Brave Soul makes his move and charges his first target, a Stalker PPC boat.  The battlefield is suddenly introduced to a glorious blaze of 6 or more flamers.  Brave Soul navigates behind his target, which is slowly becoming white hot in color.  He goes ignored at first; his target hasn’t caught on to this new pesky threat.

I forget to maintain firing at my target as I watch Brave Soul.  I shift focus to his target who just sent off a deadly volley of PPC bolts in my direction, slamming my center torso, putting my CT armor into red.  I am now exposed as I gravitate towards the phenomenon of Brave Soul, and the Stalker is looking right at me, I am clearly targeted.  The next round of PPC volleys slam into my right torso, the Stalker is met with an immediate shutdown.  

Brave Soul…you son of a bitch.

Being shutdown must have allowed the pilot to notice the pillar of flame engulfing his cockpit. The Stalker pilot must have called out Brave Soul to his teammates since a few other enemy mechs in the back line turn and open fire on Brave Soul.  Brave Soul begins to maneuver and use the Stalker as a barrier and keep it between him and the new enemy threats, flames still roaring.

The Stalker powers up again, still looking right at me, cockpit rattling from the triple UAC5 barrage from my Ilya Muromets.  I take a risk and do not prepare to torso twist, I think I can destroy my target before he gets a final volley of PPCs off, which will surely be my end.  I was wrong, I don’t kill him in time; PPCs get fired into my direction. However, only a single PPC round is sent my way! He must have been trying to manage his heat.  My center torso is now critically damaged, but regardless of his caution, the enemy Stalker still over heats!  

Brave Soul…You son of a bitch.

As I pound away at the Stalker, I see Brave Soul being ripped apart component by component, his pillar of flame getting smaller and smaller as his weaponry is stripped.

Close to overheating myself, one last coordinated barrage of ballistic shells eliminate the enemy Stalker, who slowly slumps over.  I have now gone into complete tunnel vision mode, completely unaware of the rest of the battle, I must save Brave Soul!  Brave Soul’s attackers have been somewhat distracted by the rest of the friendly force who won the battle in the center of the battlefield. The eneymy mechs hesitate between switching targets and pay for it.  A heavily damaged Catapult continues to fire upon Brave Soul, determined to take him down.  I engage the Catapult, trying to distract and interrupt the best I can.  

Despite my efforts, I see Brave Soul charging the enemy Catapult!  You fool!  Only two flame pillars remain and are at a constant roar.  My heart is pounding, I am not going to be able to save him…

Brave Soul begins scorching the enemy, he dances with death as he maneuvers around the best he can do dodge the incoming fire.  A wave of relief washes over me as I see a friendly Atlas begin to crest the hill.  My heart is still pounding; it is going to be so close…

A violent alpha strike annihilates the enemy Catapult from behind.  The match is over.  The battlefield falls silent and there he is, alive, standing in the middle of the battlefield carnage…

Before I have a chance to type out a message to this crazy pilot I see:

Brave Soul has disconnected.

With no need to flaunt his flaming victory or desire to receive any kind of recognition for his feat of blazing glory, he leaves as silently as he arrived. 

Brave Soul…You son of a bitch

While I would have much rather had Brave Soul equipped with actual weaponry, the experience he provided was one of the most exciting MWO moments for me so far.

Yesterday was April Fool's day but these patch notes are no joke!

First is our Hero BattleMech Heavy Metal! Yes this 'Mech is pink and does really play music when you get a kill! This is the first time we have released the Hero Mech before the base variants (coming April 16th). Don't let the color stop you from buying it, though, we will eventually add changing Hero 'Mech colors.

Next we have added air-strike and artillery consumables. I think Conquest mode just got more interesting! Here is a pro tip: Use them for when a light is capping your base on Alpine and save yourself a walk back to your spawn!

New Thermal and Night Vision modes are in! They look amazing and are balanced for game play! No more BlueWarrior for you!

We also have cool new digital camo patterns for your 'Mech and more 'Mech Statues for your cockpit! Keep reading for other fixes and tweaks!

See you on the battlefield!

Important Known Issue

During testing we ran into a crash issue that only occurred using Nvidia 311.xx drivers, drivers before 311 tested fine as did drivers after 311. The 311 drivers have since been removed from the Nvidia website. If you are using 311.xx drivers YOU MUST UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS failure to do so will likely result in a low frequency (3 out of 10 games from our tests) crash when playing the game.

Change Log

**UPDATE**

Greetings MechWarriors.

I am going to keep this intro short and sweet because you should really be playing the game.  If you are currently at work, I would start acting sick, because you should really be at home downloading this patch with BIG FPS IMPROVEMENTS! Now repeat after me “I don’t feel so good… Cough, Cough”.

Pretty Baby is Awesome, Literally.  This lore based Hero Mech strikes fear with a paint job that screams ”I’m going to destroy you”. Read on in the patch notes for the hard points and start dreaming of OP builds to make your enemy QQ.

Visual Customization, was revamped, reset and refunded.   We have updated the camo/paint job purchase system so you can now choose to permanently unlock skins. We also have over 100 unlockable colors. To celebrate we're having a sale so get the colors while they are hot. See this post here for more details. http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/95728-camo-spec-phase-2/

All New In Game Screens! More information, More Chat, More Screens! I have never been more excited to die and see the super informative death screen.  You now have time to chat at the end of a game and say GG!

Are you still reading? I was trying to keep this short so I am just going to rush through the rest of this list.

Tiger Camo Pattern! Year of the Snake Cockpit items! Weapon Tuning! Jump Jet tuning! Awesome Variant Tweaks!

NOTE: For the Camo Spec Revamp, all your Camo's have been reset to the default pattern and default colors and all users have been given back any MC or CBills they have spent buying patters and colors.

See you on the Battlefield.

Matt Newman

**""Override Engaged"" Visual + Audio + Gameplay Tuning**

    - When engaging override shutdown, a visual will flash on the screen “OVERRIDE ENGAGED”
    - Betty will also alert you when override has been engaged
    - If you manually power down while over 100% heat, you will remain powered down until you manually
      power up
    - While in the middle of a power up/down sequence, you can press P to queue up the command to perform
      the opposite sequence
    - It's also worth reviewing how the override and automatic shutdown system works, including the most 
      recent changes:
        - At any time you can press P to power your Mech on/off
        - Each time you press P, there is a 0.75 sec cooldown before any additional presses of P are recognized;
            this is to help prevent people who constantly spam the P key from continually powering up and down
        - If you press P while in the process of powering on or off, you will queue up a command to perform the
            opposite sequence once the current sequence is complete
        - If your heat level reaches 100%, your Mech will automatically power down; it will automatically power 
            back up again when your heat level drops below 100%
        - Your Mech can be manually powered up again after an automatic shutdown by pressing P
        - If you press O, you will command your Mech to override the automatic shutdown
            - When O is pressed, Betty will alert you that override has been activated, an override warning will 
                flash on your HUD, and it starts a 5 second timer during which, if your heat reaches 100%, the 
                automatic shutdown is ignored. (Note: Even after the 5 seconds have passed, your Mech will not 
                automatically shutdown if you are over 100% heat.)
            - Each time you press O, you reset the 5 second timer
            - You can manually power down after overriding the automatic shutdown by pressing P, however you 
                will not automatically power back up when your heat drops below 100% (though you will know this               
                has happened when your screen stops flashing red)
        - If you remain powered up while over 100% heat, you will take damage to your internal structure
		
**New IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) Colors**

    - The hue of the IFF colors have been changed slightly.  Enemies still = RED, Allies still = BLUE

**End of Round Screen**

    - Chat enabled
    - Tabbed screens showing players information and players results ( kills, cbills + exp )
    - Match score will be displayed for all players:
        - Match Score is an early ranking system for the End of Round screen only.  This number will be later 
            worked into or made part of Combat Score which will be your global ranking.  For now it's just a 
            handy way to rank players in a match.  It is subject to tuning in the near future.
		
**Camo Spec Phase 2**

    - Patterns can now be unlocked permanently or applied once.
        - Each pattern unlock is valid of only one mech type.
		    - Example: You can unlock the Dazzle pattern for the Atlas and all it's variants.

        the mech type you bought it for..

        at the same time
    - Advanced zoom will automatically turn off on death

Your last favorite shooter has filled your head with LIES.,CakeBandit,58,12,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/125hjq/learned_bias_and_mwo_your_last_favorite_shooter/,"I'd like to take a wall of text and yammer about why a bunch of our learned biases are wrong in the context of MWO.

To all outward appearances, MWO looks like it's about hopping into a multi-story, bipedal death machine and marching your way around a map turning things to piles of molten steel and generally being the biggest, most badass thing the galaxy has ever seen. That's what the advertizing is selling players. They're seeing Atlas stomp around cities, laser beams charring gaping holes in other mechs and glorious explosions everywhere. Once you dig yourself into the mechanics of the game you see why this might not even be how we want to market the game. Let's hit the big points that seem unimportant but really set Mechwarrior Online apart from the rest of the shooters of the past decade. Some of them fundamental things you have to re-learn to succeed.

* 1: **LIMITED MOBILITY. MOST NOTABLY TURNING SPEED.**

&gt;Alright, turning and moving is sluggish, who cares? It's annoying but it's no big deal.

Wrong you are. It's a very intentional mechanic. It forces you to be deliberate and decisive in your actions. It's part of why I struggle so much in the heavier chassis. Your momentum and your movement matter in a very significant way in MWO, unlike most other popular shooters on the market today. TF2, CS:Go, CoD all feature the ability to rapidly re-orient your vision and by association your ability to deal damage.

In MWO, the decision to turn your atlas around to try to swat a Jenner is a *very big decision*. As such, it is directly at odds with the lessons most gamers have learned through their gaming career. It can cause frustration when they don't realize why they keep dieing quickly. Steering is sometimes annoyingly unresponsive **but that is awesome.** You can use this in an organized team to keep an undisciplined opponent shifting back and forth wasting valuable time re-aquiring targets instead of just focusing down on one. Even as a light you have to decide wether it's worth fighting all you momentum to stop and turn around or blast past an opponent and hope you can reach cover before he turns. If he turns.

* 2: **TEAMWORK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVEN IN TEAM FORTRESS 2.**

&gt;No way man, that game has Team in its name. We're in giant walky tanks anyway, I'm invincible.

Wrong again, wandering E-bushido! Teamwork and combined-fire operations are incredibly important in this game. It's not a failing of the game either, it's by design. 

In a lot of games your individual ability as a player is defined by your ability to put targets down faster than you can be put down. Most notably seen by sniper classes that tend to deal lots of damage to very specific parts of players but are fragile themselves. These classes are typically seen as the pinnacle of play, too. They are the objective of every encounter distilled into a single role. Most of the time it doesn't really matter where a sniper shoots an enemy. It hurts!

That's not how it works here. Not quite at least.

DPS is still important, but we have a lot of health in MWO and then take locational damage to absolutely stupid extremes. Taking TF2 as an example here, if you miss a headshot and hit a body, it's still a fairly reasonable assumption that another shot is going to take the target down unless they run away. In MWO, if you miss a shot, your next shot is liable to thunk harmlessly into a non-vital area. Even if you were to make the shot there's almost no such thing as a one-hit kill. Add to that the fact that the only hitscan weapons we have in the game require you to maintain your aim on a target to deal their maximum potential and you have a lot of very confused/unhappy campers.

All of this goes against what we've been learning in a lot of different games. Nothing wrong with it, we're just getting accustomed to a sort of way things should work in the shooter world. It's just that MWO is coming in and turning it all on its ear. Focusing fire on places that aren't the head is now super important, and if someone gets crafty and denies you this focus fire through your aforementioned mobility issues you can be in for a world of hurt very quickly.

* 3: **THERE IS NO MEDIC**

&gt;Wait, why does this matter? I die so quickly in a lot of games there isn't an opportunity to heal anyway.

Because there's also no revival feature. If you make mistakes mid-match *everyone has to live with them.* Even you. Y'know what? Especially you, Armless Stumpy McOne-Leg. In most other games there's either a way to revive teammates, a respawn mechanic within the match, or a way to heal teammates/yourself. Other games don't slap you and tell you to walk it off.

Not here. Walk it off, sister.

You run out ahead of everyone, get torn up, and somehow manage to get back? Great. Good for you. What do you want? A Band aid? Let me just hop over there with my welding torch an FIX YOUR *SKYSCRAPER* REAL QUICK. Trying to fight too independently in a match is likely to end up with you on the wrong end of several enemy mechs. Even if you get off with just a legging, you're going to pay for it later. Which brings me to my next point.

* 4 **YOUR MISTAKES FOLLOW YOU OUTSIDE OF A MATCH**

&gt;I bought an Atlas and can't make any money with it! I thought this thing was supposed to be good!

It is! It's just covered in a lot of very expensive metal that you keep getting blown off and filled with very expensive parts that you keep having to replace. If you manage to do really poorly in a match, it doesn't just end with you spectating another, more successful pilot until round end. It follows you back to mech bay where you get to pay to repair your mechs. Even if you don't die but wasted a lot of really expensive ammunition in the process, it's going to come back and bite you in the end.

In other games, it doesn't matter how much you fire your gun and miss in a match. It also usually doesn't really matter how often you die. Here, it has immediate fiscal impact. Engines are expensive to replace, so are bullets. Waste neither.

So yeah, **TL;DR: Forget what you know, every shooter you've played for the past ten years has been filling your head with falsehoods in the context of MWO. Let go of the lies and embrace new concepts.**",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,BL,True,t3_125hjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/125hjq/learned_bias_and_mwo_your_last_favorite_shooter/,

Change Log

Update:

_Greetings MechWarriors_

_I am truly excited to welcome you to this patch for 5 good reasons:_

_#1 - The Jagermech: Ballistics fans, this is your BattleMech! BOOM! BOOM! DAKKA! DAKKA! It’s seriously fun. I’m going to buy them all and paint them Desert Tan for reason #2._

_#2 - Tourmaline Desert: You're going to love this map. It looks amazing and plays even better! It’s perfect for the Jagermech I just bought._

_#3 - New Controls: Gas pedal? Check! Arm Lock? Check! Centre Legs to Torso? Check! Improved joystick controls? Check. Changing all these options in game? Priceless! (Test them out in the Testing Grounds!)_

_#4 - Consumables System and Cool Shot: Do you ever find yourself running hot? Is override not going to get the job done without BBQing your internals? Try using the brand new Cool Shot on your BattleMech and you just might survive to fight another day._

_#5 - New Customizations: We’ve added the Vagabond pattern and some new BattleMech statues for your cockpit. What better way to show the Jagermech you just bought that you love it than a new paint job and some decorations?_

_Did I mention that we also increased the server count for the new map we just added? See you in the desert, my friends._

_Matt Newman._

**Tourmaline Desert**

The Tourmaline Desert is found on a small sun-baked planetoid in a binary star system. The bedrock is largely granite covered, with a thin layer of schist and sporadic veins of liquid sodium. The most striking features, however, are the endless, towering outcrops of massive tourmaline crystals that reach up against a scarlet nebula. The mean temperature is ~97°C, with an atmosphere comprised mainly of carbon dioxide with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, sodium and water vapour.

The planetoid is located along a strategic corridor, and has therefore seen many battles over the past centuries. In some circles it is known as ‘The Boneyard’ as its surface is littered with the carcasses of abandoned BattleMechs and wrecked dropships. A derelict 52000 ton Mammoth class cargo carrier dropship can be found half-buried in the middle of the desert with its bones jutting out into the sky. Slowly being consumed by the desert’s blowing sand, the last two centuries have left it sand-blasted and corroded.

BattleMech warriors will have a challenging fight ahead of them. Heat management will be a huge priority, and steep walled craters may pen them in for easy pickings. The giant tourmaline crystals will offer some protection from missile barrages, but the long corridors and accessible peaks will make any BattleMech vulnerable to sniper fire.

**New Consumables Modules**

    - General Notes:
        - Consumable modules cannot be sold back to the store.
        - Cool Shot is activated by pressing Delete (when a cool shot module is equipped).
        - If more than one type of cool shot module is equipped, the first press of Delete will
          activate the Cool Shot 6.
            - The second press will activate Cool Shot 9 or Cool Shot 9 by 9 or Cool Shot 18
                (whichever is equipped).
        - If the player shuts down while coolant flushing, the flush pauses and any remaining
          flush automatically resumes after powering up.
        - If a consumable module is not used during a match, it is not consumed and remains
          on the BattleMech

        - Only one of these can be equipped on a BattleMech at a time.
        - Consumed upon use.
        - Costs 10,000 CBills.
        - When used, it removes 6 heat per second, for 1 second, from your BattleMech 
          (in addition to the standard heat loss from your heat sinks).
            - This is equivalent to the cooling provided by 60 single heat sinks.

    - Cool Shot 9
        - Only one of these can be equipped on a BattleMech at a time.
        - Cannot be equipped on a BattleMech that has a Cool Shot 18 equipped.

            - This is equivalent to the cooling provided by 90 single heat sinks.

    - Cool Shot 18

        - Only one of these can be equipped on a BattleMech at a time.
        - Cannot be equipped on a BattleMech that has a Cool Shot 9 equipped.
        - Consumed upon use.
        - Costs 15 MC.
        - When used, it removes 18 heat per second, for 1 second, from your BattleMech
          (in addition to the standard heat loss from your heat sinks).
            - This is equivalent to the cooling provided by 180 single heat sinks.

New Modules

    - Cool Boost

        - Costs 15,000 GXP.
        - When bought, automatically increases the cooling provided by every cool shot by 20%.

**Gameplay**

**New Controls**

    - Added Arm Lock gameplay option (ON by default):
        - When Arm Lock is enabled, the arm reticule is fixed to the torso crosshairs and
           moves at the same rate as the torso.
    - Added Throttle Decay gameplay option (ON by default).  When Throttle Decay is enabled:
    - Gameplay options can be enabled/disabled on the fly from the new in-game Options Screen.
        - Pressing the ‘W’ key will sets the throttle to 100%.
        - Pressing the ‘S’ key will sets the throttle to -100%.
        - Releasing the ‘W’ and ‘S’ key sets the throttle to 0.
    - Keyboard users can now use the NumPad to directly control throttle (using the 0-9, +, -, and . keys). 
    - New Bind: “F"" - centers Feet to Torso.
    - New Bind: “Shift” - toggles Arm Lock while held. 
    - Analog turn support for joysticks.

**In-game Options**

    - The Video, Game, and Control settings are accessible via the in-game pause menu.

**Catapult Variant Quirks**

    - The CPLT-A1, CPLT-C1, and CPLT-C4 have had their torso twist angle reduced from 140 to 120.
    - The CPLT-A1, CPLT-C1, and CPLT-C4 have had their arm pitch angle reduced from 45 to 35.
    - The CPLT-K2 has had its torso twist angle reduced from 140 to 110.

**Raven Hitbox Adjustment**

    - The hitbox complexity of the Raven has been reduced.
    - This will result in the Raven being hit much easier and brings it on par with it's light counterparts.

____

**Bug Fixes**

**Gameplay**

    - When a user is killed with jump jets on, the jump jets will now turn off properly.
    - SRMs will no longer set off the ""INCOMING MISSILES"" warning.
    - Fixed an issue where firing SRMs at close range at an enemy BattleMech's leg does little to no damage.

**Mech**

    - Added in the laser caps that were missing from the CPLT-K2's center torso.
    - The machine guns on the CPLT-K2's side torsos will disappear when the user removes them.
    - Autocannons and Gauss Rifles are now represented with the appropriate meshes on the CPLT-K2.

**Options**

    - Fixed a key binding corruption issue that could occur when switching between user accounts.
    - Resolved an issue where the native resolution of the user’s current desktop was not available
       in the in-game list.
    - Fixed the Invert Throttle bind so it actually flips the current throttle value.
    - Improved the Action Map binding mechanics.
    - Ensured that the user’s custom key bindings are always preserved when controls with
       new defaults are added.
    - The default system specifications are now properly restored when they are reset.

**Mechlab**

    - Disable scene lighting when the user is viewing the cockpit during customization to reduce saturation.

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

1369776018.0,41,self.mwo,1f83ps,"Achieve balance by creating unique weapon mechanics: PPCs, LB-10X ACs, Pulse Lasers, LRMs",Thuraash,63,22,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1f83ps/achieve_balance_by_creating_unique_weapon/,"**TL, WR: PPCs divide their damage between 6 points of direct damage and 4 points of splash; LB-10X AC shells fire as slugs and fragment before hitting things, pulse lasers actually pulse, and LRMs need a do-over.**

It's evidently very difficult to balance MWO weapons. A small tweak to a heat value or cooldown swings a weapon from complete irrelevance to total dominance, or vice versa. PGI could go a long way towards making more of the weapon arsenal relevant by giving them unique mechanics that go beyond simple tweaking of heat, damage, and cooldown values.

**PPCs**

The clear flavor of the past few months, PPCs possess a unique combination of pinpoint damage concentration, high alpha damage, less high than before but still rather high DPS, and reasonably good heat efficiency for the non-ER variants. At 7 tons apiece, they should certainly be powerful weapons, but right now the dominant strategy is to simply stuff as many of them as possible into a CTF, STK, or HGN, and go to town. That's indicative of a problem.

To make PPCs simultaneously more interesting and better balanced, PGI should do what past MW titles (and MWLL) did and make them a combined direct and splash damage weapon. Instead of doing all of its damage to a single component, it does a portion to that component, and the rest spreads to surrounding components.

By way of rough guide, I'd suggest that about 6 points of damage go to the point of impact, with 4 damage dividing itself between secondary components. 

*Edit: Perhaps adjust to 7 direct with 3 splash, per the suggestion of /u/glycerin256 and a couple others. Changing it to 4/6, per /u/Dworgi's suggestion would require some rebalancing and maybe a return to the old fire rate... that might entail problems. */edit 2.*

This creates an interesting dynamic: the weapon itself is a highly precise instrument. Unlike a laser, if you hit the target, you will still do the full 10 points of damage. The damage, however, is not precise and necessarily spreads from the point of impact. This allows the PPCs to maintain their high damage output, and therefore remain very useful weapons, without being overpowered. This also creates a unique niche for the Gauss Rifle as the only weapon capable of dealing a pinpoint 15 damage at extreme range.

**LB-10X ACs**

Fixing LB-10X ACs by continually tightening the spread will never work. One ton is pretty much chump change when dealing with 10-caliber ballistics, and on its current course, the LB-10X will be as viable as the AC/10 when its spread hits damn near zero, i.e., when it IS the AC/10. One of them will be redundant, no matter which numbers you tweak.

Making the LB-10X viable without breaking the AC/10, therefore, requires a creative solution, and number pushing isn't going to be enough. Instead, much like BT does, have the shell launch as a slug, just like the AC/10 does, then break into pellets whenever it detects a solid object within 90m ahead of it. This way, the 540m range is actually usable, and most of the pellets will hit a well-led target.

**Pulse Lasers**

This one is very simple. Have them actually function like pulse lasers. Instead of doing their damage in 20 or so tiny bursts like they do now, have them do it in 3 or 4 concentrated stitches. Small pulse laser damage would also need a buff.

**LRMs**

These probably need the most work. As multiple LRMageddons have shown us, these swing from completely worthless to hideously overpowered at the drop of a hat. That they are currently such a low-skill and low-teamwork weapon is part of the problem. This is made more tricky due to the bugged out missile tubes. It's impossible to make LRM30 viable when LRM80 is possible. I think LRMs need a complete re-work.

* *Overheat Breaks Lock:* This one is a no-brainer. If an LRM asset overheats, its missiles should immediately lose lock and go ballistic. That a missile boat can fire off a chain of LRMs, overheat and shut down, and still have them connect is crazy.

* *Implement Missile Acceleration:* You don't want LRMs to be near insta-hit weapons at short range. You also don't want them to take fourteen seconds to hit a target at long range. The solution is missile acceleration. Missiles launch slow, at around 60m/s. Over their first 500m of flight, they accelerate to 240m/s. This increases time to impact at very short range, and decreases time to impact at long-range, making LRMs more effective at the range they're designed to operate at, and less effective at shorter ranges.

* *Change the Targeting System:* Right now, LRMs are a completely no-skill weapon. You don't need to aim; you just need to keep your reticule inside a box. That's a problem. They're way too easy to use, and that makes balancing them impossible. Change it as follows: To acquire lock, you need to keep your reticule over some VISIBLE part of the enemy 'mech. It has to be on the 'mech itself, and not simply in the box. If your reticule slips off the target, you've got a quarter or half second grace time to bring it back on (which doesn't progress lock acquisition), or you have to start over. 

*Edit:* Just to be clear, you don't need to keep the reticule over the 'mech throughtout lock; just when you're acquiring it. Once you're locked on, simply keeping the reticule within the box is enough to maintain the lock. */edit.*

*Edit 2:* Perhaps a better change to the targeting system would be to implement two layers of lock. Let's call them a ""soft-lock"" and a ""hard-lock."" Simply placing the reticule inside the target frame like we do now can acquire a soft-lock. This could be represented by a lock indicator that flashes between yellow and red. Hard locks would be represented by red lock indicator, and accompanied by a clear, continuous tone. The system could use a a beeping tone to indicate that it is acquiring a hard-lock. 

LRMs fired on a soft lock take the super-dispersed firing pattern, do not track very well, and are overall pretty ineffective. You can acquire a hard-lock by placing your reticule directly over a part of the enemy 'mech or in the frame of a TAG- or NARC-designated target. Hard locks cause missiles to behave as they do now, with full guidance capability and proper flight patterns. Or... you could just do away with the soft-lock entirely and make the hard-lock be the ONLY type of lock. */edit 2.*

*Edit 3:* See light warfare discussion at bottom. */edit 3.*

* *Indirect Fire Requires Teamwork:* Having a teammate simply target an enemy should not be enough to acquire an out-of-LoS. In order for missiles to fly, SOMEBODY has to do the work of aiming at the target and either maintaining a TAG laser marker or landing a NARC. To compensate, the grace time on TAG locks would have to be extended, and NARCs should lose their damage cap, or at least have it substantially increased.

*Edit: Alternative (credit to Epitaph):* Instead of outright requiring TAG/NARC support, have the missiles spread like crazy when firing at out-of-LoS targets without TAG/NARC (soft-lock), resulting in a large portion of the cluster missing. This turns out-of-LoS missile support into a really crude missile artillery when used without a TAG/NARC-assisted hard-lock. */edit.*

*Edit 2 (credit to /u/Autoxidation):* NARCs could bestow the side-benefit of allowing missiles to fly fire-and-forget to the target, so you no longer need to maintain lock. TAG's cluster size and tracking buffs should probably be greater than NARC to compensate. /edit 2.*

* *Fix Missile Tubes:* Right now, for some absurd reason, you can fire multiple sets of missile launchers out of the same tubes at once. This is why the CN9-A can launch 18 SRMs out of 10 tubes, and why CPLT-A1s can launch upwards of 40 missiles out of each 15 tube ear at once. Once a missile tube has been used, it should be reserved for the full cooldown of the weapon. Also, salvo intervals need to be increased to half the weapon's cooldown or, if that's not workable, to two seconds. That way, the most you can fire out of a 6-tube launcher is LRM-10 before you start firing for longer than it takes the weapon to cool down. This would bring boating under much more control, and allow missiles to be actually balanced for reasonable salvo sizes.

**Light Warfare Discussion**

The missile changes would create a potentially interesting dynamic for lights. Getting a streak lock would now be quite difficult, even with a shortened lock time, as you would have to keep the reticule on the target light and not just within the frame. Landing a NARC, however, will allow friendly lights to acquire a hard-lock as they do now, by just holding their reticule in the frame. Thus, in order to get easy streak locks, the NARC asset needs to be a good enough shot to land an unguided missile on the target, and by doing so confer a huge tactical advantage to the lance. This comes at the cost of one asset in the light lance having to give up a streak launcher for a NARC. 

Enemies may then choose to focus down the NARC asset in the lance early, or may leave it for last due to its reduced damage dealing capability and focus on the bruisers instead. This adds a layer of strategy to light dogfights while simultaneously shifting the focus away from easy streak locks towards gunnery and piloting skill. Streaks still play a large role, but they are harder to use without help and coordination.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1370065584.0,,,True,t3_1f83ps,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1f83ps/achieve_balance_by_creating_unique_weapon/,

I'm old school.  So old that remember when the Atari 1st came out.  I got into PC gaming very early on, playing the old Microprose simulators, like Gunship, and Stealth Fighter.  I played Ultima Online, and Beta tested WoW, DAoC, City of Heroes, and several others.  I remember playing a couple of the old Mechwarrior games, but can't remember which ones.  I have been playing MWO, on and off, since late last year.

I should also point out that I was in the Army as a M-1 tanker, and find that modern tank warfare and tactics directly apply to piloting a mech in MWO.  Maybe that's why I like it so much.  I hope all this explains where I'm coming from.

When I 1st started MWO, LRMs were king.  Getting caught out in the open meant a quick death.  Forest Colony was really bad, they didn't have the wreaked boat out there for cover, so nobody even went in the water.

Then they added ECM, and within a week everyone was driving a Raven 3l.  Seriously, I would drop into game with my ol' 4sp, and be the only one, on both teams, not in a 3l.  This, is when I took my 1st break from the game.

In the past couple months they have put out some great patches.  they fixed the lag shield that made lights un-hittable, and gave us 2 big maps to play on.  I believe that the size of these new maps, and the fact that they are weighted to come up more often than the old small ones, is what has led to the current long range/sniper tactics, and not the addition of the new highlander and Trebuchet mechs. 

Right now, I think this game is much better than at any other time since I started.  You can't turn on your ECM and run around invincible.  You can't just load up on LRMs or SRMs, scream ""LEEROY JENKINS"" and charge right at your enemy.  What does work is ""shoot, move and communicate"", just like in the M-1 Tanker manual.  Establish defensive lines, cover avenues of approach, set up primary, secondary, and tertiary fighting position.  Hold off your opponent, then launch a well time counter offensive, and capture the enemy base.  

To sum up, I find the current game to be much more challenging and interesting, and am looking forward to more improvements and even tougher maps.

1357723003.0,43,self.mwo,168or4,Pre-Match Lobby Suggestion - Taking a page out of LoL's playbook,Thuraash,50,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/168or4/prematch_lobby_suggestion_taking_a_page_out_of/,"PUGs lack teamwork, and I think that's largely because nobody has a chance to talk or plan, and we don't even know what 'mechs our teammates are running unless we dropped with them, or take a look around at the start of the match.

**Pre-Match Lobby to Meet your Team**

A pre-match lobby (""dropship"") would make this situation a whole lot better. It gives you 45s or so to chat with your teammates, see what 'mechs, weapons, and equipment they have selected, and see what map is next. This will allow some some very basic teamwork and organization, where players can decide who they'll cover or run with, what cap points they'll go for (vs. either zerg-herd or scatter), and come up with very basic strategies or plans.

**'Mech Selection in the Dropship**

A great feature would be to allow you to have access to all four of your ""selected"" 'mechs in the dropship, and allow you to choose which one you want to drop with that round based on the map, what your teammates are using, and your battleplan. The game already has the four selection slots, so this feature would go along with that great.

**Lance Selection**

If PGI implements the dropship, they could put a ""lance selection"" layer to it, where players are allowed to group themselves into a ""lance slot."" There could be five lance slots that can each hold a max of 4 (just to make sure you can always have a new slot if you're rolling with a group of 4). 

Lance-members would be highlighted in neon green instead of blue on the HUD, so you can easily find your lance-mates. This could be a great feature both for pre-mades who want to run together, and for people without a group, since they can quickly find one. It creates a layer of organization to allow the team to function as a set of two or three lances instead of just one disorganized swarm. 

Being able to name the lance would be awesome, so merc companies can identify themselves to the rest of the team.

**Best of 5 (Campaign) Mode**

Another feature could be for matches to be a ""best of 3"" or ""best of 5"" instead of single runs. Matches would run for a more satisfying length of time (~20-30 mins), and could be worth more XP/c-bills per minute compared to one-off rounds. You have the same team throughout, which would be great for building teamwork and bridging the gap between PUGs and pre-mades.

Each warrior has access to only their 4 selected 'mechs for the duration of the campaign. This can have lots of interesting impacts on gameplay.

Needless to say, for the best of 3 system to work, there would need to be some penalty for ditching. A 10-minute lock-out should suffice, with maybe c-bill penalties for repeat offenders (like more than 3 bailouts in a day). You also forfeit any c-bills and xp earned if you leave early, but still pay for damage (if R&amp;R comes back).


*Persistent Damage*

There are no repairs of internals, weapons, or equipment, and only limited armor repair between rounds. 33% of each section's max armor sounds like a fair amount of armor repair for an emergency refit mid-campaign. This means you need to preserve your 'mech if you want it next round, or else drop with a damaged 'mech or choose another one.

*Strong team-building*

If you're only playing with people for one round, they're strangers when you meet them, and by the time you get to know them, they're gone. This way, the team sticks together for longer, and gets to work together for longer.

*Competitive Play with ""Long Campaigns""*

For competitive play between merc groups or 8-man pre-mades (or even PUG players if there's enough interest), there could be a ""long campaign"" mode. Everyone's got access to their 4 selected 'mechs, but this time it's a best-of-seven or even best-of-nine. This means attrition matters, and it's a real possibility that some mechwarriors might have only damaged 'mechs (or NO 'mechs) left to choose from by the end of the campaign. To compensate, it might be a good idea to have ""escape zones"" at certain places near the edges of the map where players can run off the map to save their 'mechs. 

That sounds like an AWESOME mode for competitive/""serious"" play.

What do you all think?

**TL, DR:** A pre-match lobby where you can meet up with your teammates, choose from one of your four selected 'mechs, see which map is next, and organize into lances would be AWESOME for PUG gameplay.

Also, could have a ""campaign"" mode where instead of exiting after the match to the main screen, you go back to the dropship and drop again with the same team in a best of 3 or best of 5 format. Could have a best of 9 for comp play. No repairs to criticals between rounds, and armor repairs only 33% of max points for that section per round.


**Edit:** [x-posted](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/89907-pre-match-lobby-suggestion-taking-a-page-out-of-lols-playbook/) to MWO Suggestions forum.

**Edit 2:** In retrospect, I don't know if allowing for armies to be routed is a great idea; it might just add unnecessary complication. Alternatively, it might add an interesting transition to battle strategy, when a lost match goes from a fight for victory to loss preservation mode, where teams fight to hide their most valuable/slowest assets, and escort them off the field. Cutting off armies from routing also then becomes a concern for the winning team in terms of how and where they attack. What do you think?

###Locust

|Modules| 2           | 1               | 3             |
 
##General
This is an interesting paradigm for a 'mech.  The variant determines which arm hardpoints you get, and not much more.

Also notice that none of the selected variants carries MASC.

The lightest 'mech yet will also be the most to benefit from the coming scouting bonuses.
Also with the coming tonnage limits I expect this 'mech to become the go-to when you need a scout, as it will serve the role while providing the most tonnage to another team member.

##LCT-1V = The Ballistic Variant
I can see the LCT-1V being the least used.

Machine guns are doing much, much better now, but still not quite as good as other options IMHO.

There will be the occasional AC-2 build, but not anymore common than you see it on a Spider.


##LCT-3M = The Energy Variant
This will be the most common Locust.

The LCT-3M will serve as a light-weight, poor-man's JR7-K.
Note the lower module count, a la the JR7-K.

As this 'mech naturally carries AMS, a question arises, ""Will they follow the tradition of adding and extra AMS slot?"" 
An anti-missile scout would be quite an interesting option; it would scout at first, then tuck behind the main group to provide cover from LRM's.


##LCT-3S = The Missile Variant
Why one missile hardpoint per arm and not two?
I admit it's possible.
However, the potential for a 4x SSRM-2 build, even with the SSRM nerf, makes me leary that they'd allow it.

Assuming this, typically when a 'mech has lost hardpoints (in quantity) it's been compensated for with modules or agility.
As scout 'mechs tend to carry more modules and already be very agile, this is what I'm expecting.

##General
The only (normally) jump-jetting 'mech of the Project Phoenix.  

The shoulder cannon is reminiscent of a left-handed Hunchback.
The lack of energy weapon slots seems to balance the mech against the HBK series.
This mech is also going to (mostly) follow the same pattern of Ballistic, Energy, and Missile variants.

##SHD-2H = The Ballistic Variant
As soon as I saw this 'mech's hardpoints, I instantly compared it to the DRG-5N.
It's a 'mech with too little tonnage to make use of it's ballistic hardpoints.


This variant will not be loved by many.
Its most prominent role will be due to its C-Bill and Loyalty bonuses.


Expect variants that equip a Gauss Rifle with a PPC and SSRM-2's.

## SHD-2D2 = The Energy-ish Variant
Missile hardpoints are all over the 'mech and limited by both tube-count and critical space.
Don't expect to launch more than 10 missiles in a volley; this is the balancing factor. 


The extra ballistic hardpoint is only there to match the seven-hardpoints per variant count.
Otherwise, expect it to the follow the lines of the CN9-D, DNG-1N, and FANG (no one uses the second ballistic slot!)

I expect the tiniest jumping 2x ERLL + Gauss 'mechs to appear from this variant... just barely.


## SHD-5M = The Missile-ish Variant
What to do with this 'mech...
I'm expecting that this will be an Trebuchet tribute 'mech.
The 20-tube hardpoints will be awesome for this.


However this 'mech will be plagued by number of defects, and overall be the bastard of the family.
Despite more jump-jet ability, it will be shunned due to the general difficultly in mounting enough missiles to be a true missile boat (due to tonnage), overall reliance on the right arm, and mostly pointless dual ballistic slots.

##General
There's an elephant in the room with this 'mech, What to do with the 'ear'?""
It's supposed to have a shoulder-mounted missile-barrel.  That would also greatly increase its target area.
Will we see the first instance of a 'special' target region?  If so, how will it's armor and internals be calculated?


Note that only one variant of the Thunderbolt has the missile-barrel on the right shoulder.
Another has it on the left shoulder.
And the last one questionably has a missile-barrel at all.
All of the possibilities have been illustrated over the years.

The models for this 'mech will be very interesting, to say the least.


## TDR-5S
A typical heavy, with extra hardpoints.
I expect that this 'mech will give Cataphracts trouble.  More, and better, hardpoints are hard to question.
If this 'mech is in anyway limited, it's by tonnage and possibly agility.
Sadly, I expect that this 'mech will make the present 60 tonners extinct.  You get much more capability for only five tons more.


## TDR-5SS
This will be the energy-themed variant of the Thunderbolt.
It will also be a weird, jet-less, competitor to the Quickdraw.
One question is: ""Will it have a missile-barrel, or will the missile tubes be in-torso?""

## TDR-5SE
What a mess; very left-torso dependent.

I think it's a new attempt at a missile boat.  If the tubes are dynamic, and extend passed the default ten-count, it might work to complicate the existence of the Catapult.

The ability to jump may be its saving grace.  It should be able to carry enough energy weaponry make it a viable alternative to the energy-based variants of the CPLT-K2.

##General
I will quicky admit that this the Project Phoenix 'mech that I've had the most difficulty characterizing.  It just doesn't flow into obvious variants like the others.

##BLR-1G
This 'mech give along with the BLR-1S, gives the Stalker a run for its money.
I expect this will be balanced by a lack of agility and a generally tall profile, similar to the Atlas.

##BLR-1D
Frankly, I'm not sure what to make of this one.


It's a missile-less version, but I have little idea how to place the additional hardpoint, if at all.
I've made my best guess, and thrown in an extra module slot, that may be its trick.


It's interesting that the ballistic and energy arms are reversed versus the BLR-1G.


Commentry is especially welcome here.

## BLR-1S
Holy missiles 'Mechman!  


Something to compare to the AWS-8R?  The tube count will really matter with this one.


If it turns out that all of the launchers are dynamic, the number of missile slots will make this an excellent LRM boat.  An odd task for Battlemaster, but if it fits...



### EDIT: 
Typos and Additional Thoughts

###General Engines

Another conversation that needs to be had is with regard to the engines these 'mechs are going to be best capable of using.

For two of them, we know the answer simply due to their weight classes: the Locust will run XL's and the Battlemaster will run Standards.  These are the general rules for lights and assaults, with a few exceptions.

The Shadow Hawk and the Thunderbolt are where the interest lies.  The ability to reasonably carry XL's, or not, will greatly define their places in the MWO continuum.

While there is no way to predict this with certainty, the developers seem to be making a push to muddy the decision for the heavy and medium weight classes.
Several older chassis' have fallen into distinct categories.  'Mechs like the Hunchback and Centurion are notorious for needing to carry a Standard, while the Dragon and Catapult have been XL oriented 'mechs.  However 'mechs like the Trebuchet and the Quickdraw have avoided such distinction, carrying either engine when it is suitable.  The Kintaro is a recent anomaly, one which the developers seem eager to correct, which only reinforces my suspicion.

There is constraint to what can be done though.  The models of the 'mechs only provide so much flexibility in assigning the dividing lines between torsos.  Going beyond that greatly reduces how intuitive it is to hit any given region, not a desirable feature in general and when new players are considered.  If you know a weapon is mounted in the left torso of a mech, and you shoot it directly, it would be disconcerting to see the damage register on the left arm or center torso.


##Thunderbolt Engines
If we accept the notion that the torsos should encapsulate their corresponding weapon mounts, the Thunderbolt is going to mimic the Centurion.  That is, the side torsos will be so prominent as to be destroyed before the center torso, invariably.  The provided artwork shows the left torso energy weapons mounted fairly close to center.  Dividing the torso at the point just beyond these yields a stick of a center torso.  This means Standard engines will by typical for this 'mech.

As any balancing factor, this will be a boon and a detriment for this chassis.  While the Thunderbolt won't be able to 'zombie' as well as a Centurion, it will be durable, if a bit slow.  This has the positive effect of preventing it from instantly outclassing the Catapult and Dragon which rely on XL's to provide speed and weapon tonnage at the cost of absorbing the bulk of their damage to their core.

I expect Thunderbolts to be slower and more lightly armed than I initially thought, as well as unexpectedly durable.

## Shadow Hawk Engines
This 'mech can go either way.  It really depends on whether or not the developers cut the side torsos to-the-inside or to-the-outside of the depicted heat-vents.

To-the-outside means a large center-torso, and next to no penalty for carrying an XL.  The Shadow Hawk will then become a heavily armed striker, closer to a Dragon in playstyle.

To-the-inside means larger side-torsos, and the need for a Standard to be viable.  The Shadow Hawk becomes a bodyguard, similar to the auto-cannon variants of the Hunchback.

Down-the-middle creates a more balanced 'mech.  While I would expect this will be the developers' goal, there's another factor to consider: the shoulder cannon.
Fearful of a Hunchback repeat, I anticipate some overcompensation.  The predominant cannon (which will be an opponent's primary target) will worry the designers.  The compensation will be to reduce the number of side-torso hits otherwise occuring.  Thus I feel that it is more likely that they will cut to-the-outside of the heat vents.

May is going to be a great month. I can feel it! Let's start by going over the content of this patch!

The Stalker Hero 'Mech ""Misery"" sure does live up to its name, with a paint job that reflects its war torn soul and the hard points to cause plenty of misery on the battlefield. 
[Just check out this trailer to see what I mean!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVnkBs9WQMM)

A new Trial 'Mech Champion! The Jenner JR7-F(C). This is a legendary developer build that has been tearing through Atlas armour since closed Beta. Give it a spin and prepare to be tempted to purchase this Champion 'Mech on May 21st.

After making you wait long enough, you can now change the colours on your Hero 'Mech. We can't wait to see what kind of colour combinations you guys create.

We have a real treat for you, the Buccaneer custom pattern! I asked Alex (Flying Debris) what his inspiration was and this is what he said. I was imagining ""Some crazy, bearded, malnourished man with missing teeth going to work with a paint roller in the 'Mech hanger while indulging in questionable substances. This mech painting bender happened after the force he was attached to made off with thirty tons of potatoes, women's shoes, and stereo equipment,from the last backwater planet they raided"". Ok Alex. I am just going to back away slowly now. Plenty of hidden messages in this cool custom pattern can you spot them all?

New 'Mech statue Cockpit items added to round out the customization.

We have some good improvements and fixes as well, to clean up functionality and stability.

You should also be aware we are working hard to address the HUD issues and are getting closer to a solution.

See you on the battlefield,

Matt Newman

The Hotfix

What it addresses:
The insane amount of damage missiles started doing including splash damage and something weird that caused said splash damage to spike through the roof.

How it used to work:

(Note: I'm going to use the term 'secondary component' below but you can read it as 'a component that did not get hit directly but is taking splash damage')

All missiles used to have a 4.0m splash damage radius that took into account the percentage of the volume of secondary components engulfed in the radius. 

With the advent of smaller/tighter component groupings on the smaller Mechs, an issue arose where too much splash damage was being spread across those Mechs. Basically it turned into a hot mess.

What does the hotfix do?
A number of things. First off, it reduces the splash damage radius from 4.0m (for both LRM/SRM) to 1.8m (LRM) and 1.3m (SRM/SSRM). This obviously reduces the amount of splash damage caused to secondary components.

Any location directly hit by a missile takes the full damage. Any secondary component hit by the splash damage radius takes splash damage based on how far the location is from the center of the explosion.

We also added a scaling factor of 0.4 to the amount of damage done to secondary components. From the impact point to the outer radius of splash damage, this factor of 0.4 drops linearly to 0.0. This means that if somehow magically the point of impact is so close to the secondary component, the maximum damage it would take from splash is WEAPON DAMAGE * 0.4 (that is 40% of weapon damage).

But Paul, you said you'd REMOVE splash damage!!!!
I know I did, but here's the kicker and yet another part of the mystery of missile damage. We tried removing splash damage and it did exactly what you think it was going to do. Pinpoint on target damage. Cool right? Yes... but...

Doing this exposed a problem with the grouping/clustering of missiles. We now have a high percentage of any incoming missile targeting the CT. This is BAD.

Now our primary concern as to what is happening on the live servers is to curtail the incredibly high damage levels of missiles/explosions. To make the missile explosions/damage feel like they should and to keep the damage spread across a Mech, we kept the above mentioned splash damage work along with the following damage changes to missiles:

LRMs drop from 1.8 damage per missile to 0.7 damage per missile.
SRMs drop from 2.5 damage per missile to 1.5 damage per missile.

DO NOT HIT REPLY TO FREAKOUT YET!

It is at these levels that missile combat falls back to a level that we AND the community felt was right for a long period of time before the badness appeared. I'm going to ask you to help us test these values by FEEL. Not by playing SpreadsheetWarrior.


Missiles are STILL a very big threat to the target but just aren't doing these chart topping damage numbers.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS MESSAGE:
This is a TEMPORARY fix to quell the damage done by missiles at this time. We are fully investigating the damage model AND focusing on the grouping of missiles and will update as soon as we can on how any changes will be managed/implemented.

1. You can't exit the chat without hitting escape. So if you type something and don't want to send it you have to go to an escape menu.

2. When you're dead, sending chat to one channel frequently has it show up in other channels (e.g. type in team, send to all).

3. When transitioning from the game to the score page, anything in the chat buffer is erased, and sent as a separate line to a random chat channel when you send something else.

4. Holding down backspace has no effect. You either have to hit shift-home or press backspace repeatedly to erase a line of text.

Procedure:

1. Put a PPC back on my 'phract.

2. Enter a live match so we know for sure there are no training ground shenanigans. (sorry to the people in this match!)

3. Face a flat surface at 300m. (Flat so we know there are no convergence issues)

4. Take hands off wasd and the mouse, make sure PPC is assigned to a weapon group that uses a key on the keyboard.

5. Hold space.

6.  When the JJ meter is even with bar in the throttle (for consistency), trigger the PPC, then hit PrtScr a split second later.

7. Release space.

8. Repeat 5-7 a few times.

9. Get shot in the back as a nosy BJ finds you shooting at a wall.

10. Attempt to kill nosy BJ until his friends come up and finish you off.

Note that these are all the shots I took during the test, I did not remove any. So, this should be a pretty good representation of how accurate you can expect your shots to be if you shoot while your jets are on.

I wanted to thank PGI and remind everyone that we're played a pretty damned awesome game. Not just generally, but also in one specific, and very important aspect:

I've played a lot of games where if you aren't playing with the ""theorycrafted optimal"" build, you're holding your team back. I think that MWO has somehow managed to make it impossible to make a ""perfect"" build. As much as we might like to bitch about ECM Ravens doing their murderous little vulture thing, or how LRMboatins is unsporting, there are very few ""wrong"" ways to skin a 'mech. 

Sure, a fully-tricked out D-DC is going to beat an untweaked one, but that's a matter of investment, experience, and a great deal of player skill. Ravens, Commandos, and Spiders may be the ""best"" light mechs, but [Jenner jocks still love their mechs](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/17au3o/the_jenner_is_awesome/)
 and contribute as much as anyone else. There are so many ways to skin a Cat', and even laserboat hunchbacks seem to come in increasingly bizarre and wonderful varieties. And god know's I'm terrified of any Cataphract I come across, even before I see the loadout. Maybe I'm just playing too many PUG matches, but the breadth of creativity and design afforded by the system is breathtaking, and the skill and ingenuity of this game's pilots are something worth saluting, and the designers who make it possible, worth commending.

I hope this isn't taken as a total qq post. I've been a loyal supporter of this game, buying MC for constant Premium Time, around 16 mech bays, and three Hero Mechs. I've also tried to be a voice of reason and supporter of PGI's efforts through the Great ECM Debate, 3rd Person View Affair, LRM'pocolyose, Consumable Fury, Maps and Mechs Can't Cost THAT much revolt, and the THIS ISN'T BETA issues on the official forums. 

While PGI has made amazing progress in a short time with this game, there is a glaring piece of content missing that is making me re-think some future purchases until it's implemented. I know CW is a major priority for PGI, and I'm sure it's an all hands on deck effort. I also know you're trying to stomp out bugs, and while all of that is important and all, I need to see some attention given to the content I'm writing about. 

Content is very important in F2P games and we have some great content so far, but there something's been overlooked. PGI needs to address this immediately or players are going to start to leave. 

The Highlander was released on Tuesday and I was VERY dismayed that there was not a Plaid camo pattern. Tartan would be acceptable. 

If you could bring this to Paul or Bryan and make this happen, preferably by next patch, I'd be a very happy customer (and millions of other players too). CW can be delayed a few days to make this happen.

UPDATE


Greetings MechWarriors,

We have another great patch ready for you today.  It's packed full of content, improvements, tuning and fixes so let's dig in. 

The Trebuchet is now available in the MechLab.  We have been having some serious fun with this BattleMech in our play tests.  It’s great to have a new medium `Mech on the battlefield, not to mention it has jump jets!   Those jump jets are going to come in handy too, on our new map Alpine Peaks.

What is Alpine Peaks you ask? It’s a huge map.  H U G E.  Bring your scouts, stick together, and load up some long range weapons because you’re going to have to change up your tactics for this snow-capped map.

If you liked our New Year’s holographic cockpit items, you are in luck because, we have just released the Faction Logos in the same style.  Pick one up and show your allegiance.

On top of all this there are a lot of cool new improved features to play with. Personally I can’t wait to disable someone’s ECM with a PPC. Now I just have to put a PPC on one of my `Mechs.

See you on the battlefield 

Matt N

But after this long time without it, I feel like I've come to a realization that can be quantified.

R&amp;R was only stifling the creativity of the player base, and released from that constraint I've seen more and more builds emerging throughout the community.  We really do have all kinds of builds now, and people realize the Artemis upgrade is situation, not a strict enhancement.

I thank the developers for releasing our creativity, and I honestly hope that CBills aren't used as a gameplay balancing mechanic in the future, but rather just the means for which we can play with our toys in different ways in the mechlab.

Well, that and I own 24 mechs at this point, and obtaining all the equipment for them (and future mechs) is a daunting task even without the unpredictable ups and downs of R&amp;R

So yeah, PLEASE don't bring it back, I've never had so much fun playing MWO has I have been these last months, and yesterday's patch only made things better.


**2/8/2013 Edit: from Ask the Devs 31**

**blinkin - Will repair and rearm ever come back? if not please explain the reasoning behind removing it.**

A: No plans to bring back RNR. RNR was removed to create a balanced economy. In the end it created more problems than solved, and was essentially a tax. The system was prone to abuse by farmers and active players. The decision was made to protect the integrity of the game at the cost of removing a feature most people did not use (based on telemetry).",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1360358986.0,,default,True,t3_17zwlm,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/17zwlm/rr_has_been_gone_a_while_id_like_to_say_i_hope_it/,

1353585338.0,36,self.mwo,13m8kq,"PSA: Software development is not linear, and bugs are hard 
to fix",mishagale,51,15,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/13m8kq/psa_software_development_is_not_linear_and_bugs/,"A sentiment I see a lot from players, both here and on the official forums is ""Why did PGI implement X when they still haven't done Y?"" or ""They should be focusing on A instead of B!""

I'd like to clear something up for people who may not realise this: In any large software project involving multiple developers, such as a game, tasks *must* be handled in parallel. If some feature is going to take 50 man-hours to complete, you can't have 25 people work on it at once and complete it in two hours. The only thing you can do it split it into subprojects and have one or two extra people working on those, but the extra co-ordination within teams means doubling the number of people won't halve the time required: more like 60-75%.

I'm not sure how large PGI's development team is, but I recall someone saying 45 people; I don't know if that's just programmers or includes artists, designers, QA etc.

This means that you can't just pull people off camo-specs and have them make levels; the skillsets may not be transferable and the level may already have all the modellers and texture artists it can support.

It means implementing new features takes place in parallel with fixing bugs in existing features, not instead of; usually the best person to fix a bug is the person who implemented the bugged feature, you can't just assign them to whoever is available.

It means the matchmaker will take as long as it takes; pulling people off other projects won't make it go any faster.

Always remember [Brooks's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks's_law): ""Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.""

On a related note: The hardest part in fixing any bug is usually reproducing it. People say things like ""PGI *knows* about the 4FPS bug, why haven't they fixed it yet?"" The problem is that bugs like framerate slowdown, crash-to-desktop, blackscreen are all *intermittent*. They don't happen reliably every time you do a certain action, or if they do, they don't for everyone. There are a lot of factors that could possibly be causing this bug, or it could be many bugs with the same symptoms. The best way you can help is by reporting bugs whenever you see them, with as much information about the circumstances in which they occurred and the hardware and settings you are running as possible.

**EDIT**: I made this post to try and clarify why PGI often ""fail to deliver"" with their patches. It wasn't either defending or decrying their business model or QA process (about which we know little), nor does it have anything to do with whether MWO deserves the label ""open beta"".

Give me a U! U!

Give me an I! I .... don't want to do that any more. I want to stomp around in a new 'Mech. F.Y.I. I was spelling ""Quickdraw"", which is the new 'Mech.
This heavy 'Mech weighs in at 60 tons and likes long walks on the beach, as long as there is glorious 'Mech combat at the end of that beach.

What happened to the Orion? The factory had some issues with orbital bombardment... production of the Orion will resume once the factory can be rebuilt. These 'Mechs don't just grow on trees, you know.

Which reminds me of a joke. If a tree falls in a forest... you must not be playing MWO.

We also added a new Champion 'Mech and made it a trial at the same time. The HBK - 4P©. A nice loadout at a good price with a 10% XP boost. Try it then buy it.

Design is tweaking weapon numbers, so read on and if you think this patch is small, all I can say is enjoy the calm before the storm because big things are aligning for July.

Many, many, things.

See you on the Battlefield

UPDATE

Greetings MechWarriors.

  Death's Knell is here! With a 30% C-Bill boost that lets you make money while dancing around Atlai burning 
their armour off with four medium pulse lasers.  You know you will look good because this BattleMech has possibly 
the coolest Hero skin yet!
    
  All Systems are… Nominal? (we're getting there!) Finally!  the Bitching Betty start up sequence is in game!  If 
this doesn’t give you warm nostalgic feelings, then you my friend, are dead inside.  There are also some additional
 animations and functionality for overheat and shutdown.

  Some nice bug fixes round out the rest of this patch.  Thanks for your help in tracking down and squashing 
them!

    See you on the Battlefield,
 
Matt Newman


GENERAL

 “The Death’s Knell” COM-TDK

    - Base Mech:  Commando
    - Tonnage:  25
    - Top Speed:  113.4 kph
    - Armor:  176
    - Weapons &amp; Equipment:
        - Left Arm:  2 Medium Lasers
        - Right Arm:  2 Medium Lasers

    - Hardpoints:
        - Left Arm:  2 Energy
        - Right Torso:  1 AMS
        - Right Arm:  2 Energy

    - Internal Structure:  Standard
    - Heat Sinks:  11 Double
    - Jump Jets:  n/a
    - ECM Capable?:  No
    - Module Slots:  2
    - 30% C-Bill Bonus

New Trial Mechs:

    - Spider SDR-5V
    - Hunchback HBK-4SP
    - Cataphract CTF-3D
    - Awesome AWS-8V
	
Gameplay:

    - Start-up animation at the beginning of the match.
    - Normal power on/offs during gameplay now have animations.
    - Now able to manually shutdown during an override

Power System: (Powering on and off the Mech):

    - There has been a significant change in how the power system works in regards to powering on and off your Mech and when overheating.
    - Pressing the ‘P’ key will always turn on / off your Mech even if your Mech is shutdown from overheating.
    - Pressing the ‘O’ key will temporarily prevent the shutdown of your Mech due to overheat.
	
What does this mean exactly?

Pressing the ""O"" key just prior to overheating will temporarily disable the overheat Mechanic for the next 5 
seconds.  If you do not overheat in those 5 seconds, the override is cancelled and will need to be toggled the 
next time you wish to engage it.

If your Mech DOES overheat within that 5 second buffer, your Mech will continue to operate but will cause you 
to start taking damage to your internals.

Pressing the ""P"" key now powers your Mech on/off no matter what state you are in.  Hence, if you press the ""P"" 
key while you are overheated, your Mech will power up but you will start to take damage to your internals until 
you have cooled off sufficiently.

Performance:

    - Anti Aliasing is Disabled by default for low specs.
    - VSync off by default.
    - Optimized visibility checks.

Bug Fixes:

    - Fixed some issues with CryEngine.
    - Fixed a few memory leaks.
    - More fixes done to the FE.
    - NARC/TAG reward now shows up in the EoR screen.
    - Fixed texture LOD issue with the cockpit items.
    - Additional movement code bug fixes and improvements

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

UPDATE

Greetings MechWarriors!

Say hello to the Spider! The spider doesn't pack a big punch, but man he can run and jump! We have been having a blast play testing the Spider on one of our upcoming maps “Alpine” where we managed to fly higher than anything we have seen before. We hope you enjoy the variety that the Spider brings to the battlefield. It should be noted that some people may notice warping with the Spider when they have high ping. We are rolling out new networking code over the next month to improve your gameplay performance. For More details see this post. http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/77907-net-code-roadmap/page__p__1740750#entry1740750

We have added a few new Modules to boost your Target information that I am sure will be popular, Target Decay Rank 1 and 2, as well as Sensor Range Rank 2. A must for those LRM boats still feeling the pain from ECM.

My personal favourite pattern is in this patch, Woodland pattern for all Mechs! You can really make some interesting looks when you play with the colour choices. If you use Whites and Greys you can make a really cool winter Camo. 

Enjoy this patch and we will see you next week.

Matt Newman

            next to the close/minimize buttons).
    - Combined patch types (no in-game)
        - In-game patches were performing terribly due to the overhead of the game itself, so patcher and
            in-game patches have been combined into a single patch type.
    - General bug fixes

[Death's Knell](http://static.mwomercs.com/img/hero/bg/13.jpg) is a tasty blue painty-job commando.  It appears to be sporting 4 laser hardpoints, and has a lovely skull on it's shoulder joints, quite the fashion statement.

  Thanks to EnderPhoenix for the headsup!

Edit: Pulled some history from [here](http://www.pryderockindustries.com/thegateway/taurianconcordat/mechs/commando_com_2d.html), which appears to be sourced from the 3025 Tech Readout:

&gt;Notable 'Mechs &amp; MechWarriors:

&gt;Captain Bono Duganmare
&gt;
&gt;Commander of a company of the 22nd Skye Rangers, Duganmare has the unenviable task of training inexperienced warriors.   Quiet yet demanding in his silver Commando, The Death's Knell, the captain moves about the training field, cajoling his men to work harder.   If that approach does not produce results, he resorts to a trainee 'Mech's backside instead.

&gt;Though concerned about his men's welfare in battle, Duganmare knows enough to let them do their jobs with great tactical expertise.   Not a flashy hero with many kills to his name, he nevertheless has earned the respect of both his men and of his superiors, who treat him like a valuable resource.   Some recent rumors suggest that he will head up the first Commonwealth Military Academy on Tharkad.


And from the BattleTech 3050 Tech Readout:

&gt; Komandant Bono Duganmare: 

&gt;Not a flashy hero, Komandant Duganmare served with the Twenty-second Skye Rangers where he was given the unenviable task of licking new recruits into shape. His success earned him and his “Death’s Knell” a tranfser to the prestigious Nagelring on Tharkad to head up the light BattleMech training program following the Fourth Succession War.

The #savemwo Town Hall was a success beyond our wildest dreams. It was great to see everyone logging on to speak up, and everyone agreed on far more points than we disagreed. We had around 30 community leaders present representing competitive, casual, and league players. Rough estimates for numbers of those being represented places numbers at anywhere from 5000-8500, and at peak we had 300+ players in attendance listening in mumble and chatting in the jabber #saveMWO channel. What's more, our statement to PGI is already in Garth Erlam's hands, and has been forwarded to the developers for consideration.

For anyone who wasn't there, we archived it for you, to listen or relisten at your convenience.

Special thanks to Niko Snow and the moderators of the official forums for putting up with what I know was a moderation nightmare until after the event.

What now? For now, we want to keep this conversation going, and we're going to hold this again, sometime in the near future. For next time, we're going to borrow a setup that Goonfleet of EVE uses to broadcast special events, which will allow people to listen in without needing to deal with all the headaches of installing and shuffling into Mumble. We're also going to take a different approach to get questions from textchat into the discussion, something we couldn't effectively manage this time.

In particular, I'm a little unhappy we couldn't get more groups who were more or less happy or just ambivalent about the way the game is going, for contrast. I'm also unhappy that we couldn't get anyone who represented just themselves involved, both for logistical reasons and because of how we solicited speakers. Do you have something to say for next time, good or bad? We want to hear it.

To keep the conversation going in the meantime, we've also set up [savemwo on Jabber](http://wordoflowtax.com/saveMWO/?r=savemwo@conference.goonfleet.com), for open and anonymous chat.

Maybe this has been done before but fuck it, I have a mustache. 



----------------------------
--------

**Lights:** 

**Primary Functions: Scout, Diversion, Light swat**

**Scout**: As a scout, report enemy movements, keep a UAV on hand to give a report to your team mates. You're the eyes and ears, if you see/hear something moving, call it out. Hopefully your team will respond in kind. As a PUG, don't count too much on have a TAG. LRM's are popular, but let the LRM boats worry about their own tags. UAV's help enough as is. 

**Diversion**: Cap, cap cap. That's really all that can be done right now for diversion. It serves as a way to split your enemy team (if they are disorganized) allowed your heavier forces to push into a weaker force to secure better ground. 

**Light Swat**: As a light, it's much easier for you to chase down and kill other lights than a heavy and assault. Mediums are better at light swatting, but rarely do they go fast enough. Keep your teams butts clean when they need it. 

**DO NOT**: 

**Be slow** - If you're going to be slow, get into a heavy or assault. Lights need to go 120+ Always, no exceptions.

**Be Silent** - As a scout, always be relaying what you see and hear. If you're silent, you're not fulfilling your role. 

**Brawl** - Jesus Christ, if you need this one spelled out for you, there's no hope. You won't survive long wading into a force of enemy mechs and taking pot shots. That's not your job. Even if you're on your last leg and no weapons, go sit on cap. Never brawl. If I see a light that's brawling, I'll shoot you myself.  

**Go Alone (If you can help it)** - Work with your other lights. Strength in numbers. If you go alone, prepare your anus because even if you do all these good things, when you're outnumbered, you're toast. I get it, sometimes, you're the only light. I play that role a lot. If you do, never directly engage unless you have a clear advantage. 

-----------------------------------------
**Mediums** 

**Primary Functions: Support, Heavy Hitting Skirmisher, Light Swat**

**Support**: As a Support unit, it's all about capturing the aggro and disengaging as quickly as possible. Let your bigger guys get the big shots in, you're there to be the distraction while your guys set up good killing shots. 

**Heavy Hitting Skirmisher**: CN9-A with 3xSRM6 running by you at 100 KPH or a Hunchie with an AC20. It's about hitting hard and running away. You can't soak up the damage your bigger brothers can take. Shoot, and get away. These are the bad asses of the match because while the main forces are engaged, they sneak around and get the back sides. 

**Light Swatting** - This is just like the lights, but the focus is getting them killed as quickly as possible. Medium Pulse, Streaks, LBX10s. These are the weapons of choice. Go for the everything. They're carrying XL's always.Shoot for the biggest portion until they're dead. If you can reliable hit the legs, do it. Your team will sing your praises when they can finally have those ankle bitters off their asses. 

**DO NOT**

**Be Slow** - You're biggest benefit is that you can fit heavier hitting things than a light, but you only have a tiny bit more armor. Speed will be your best friend. In and out. Aggro and disengage as quickly as possible. 

**Go Alone** - Same with lights, strength in numbers.You'll have a better time teamed up with a like minded medium pilot. If you don't, stick around with the heavies if you're sub 100K and the lights if you're +100k. You'll be a bit slower, but you'll be the fire support in any situation.  

**Be afraid to take Damage** - That's your role. You take damage and keep ticking as long as you can to allow the bigger guys to get their shots. Draw the Aggro, disengage. You're going to get pummeled. Use your torso twists to spread the damage. 

---------------------------------------------

**Heavies**

**Primary Functions: Damage Dealers, Fast Brawlers, Support** 

**Damage Dealers** - High Alpha. As high as you can make it without sparing armor and speed. There's a reason you see 2xPPC's 1xGuass on a Cataphract. It's High Alpha, pinpoint damage. They need to be mobile and hard hitting. AC40 Jager, those thing are mean as a barn cat, but they've got the teeth to tear a bear to shreds. More Ballistics and Lasers, the better.

**Fast Brawlers** - I'd recommend no XL engines but I've seen it done. They are piloted like a Medium, but they can stay in the fight a bit longer. Get in, Stay in, die gloriously if you have to. Brawlers don't typically live long if it's a hot brawl, but like a Med, use your torso twist, protect your big guns, and do work. 

**Support** - LRMS, mostly. I could die happily as a light pilot knowing that my UAV I suicided for provided enough time for LRM boats to get some good kills in. As LRMs focus on mediums, Heavies, assaults, lights in that order. Take a god damn tag with you, don't blame other players for not holding targets if you're too stupid to get your own. 

**DO NOT**

**Go Alone** - Do you see a Theme here? 

**Misplace your shots** - Heavy pilots have to be the best shots in the game. They can't take the ammo an assault can. Use your damage wisely and make the most out of each shot. 

**CHASE THE SQUIRREL** - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IF YOU CHASE A LIGHT AS A HEAVY OR ASSAULT PILOT, I HOPE YOU DIE OF SYPHILIS YOU CONTRACTED BY BEING RAVAGED BY A BADGER IN A FOREST FIRE. 

-------------

**Assaults**

**Primary Functions: Damage Dealers, Support, Brawling Tank** 

**Damage Dealers** - Deal out as high as damage as you can. Target other assaults and heavies and just go to town. Don't bother trying to rack up a bunch of kills. They'll happen if you do your job. It warms my heart to see an astronomical amount of damage from an assault but only 1-2 kills and 6-7 assists. Leave the heavies or Mediums to finish off the task  if they're close. Call the targets out. Do work.

**Support** - LRMS again. Same thing with Heavies. Take a tag, provide cover for advancing forces. It's a tough, thankless job because if you're good at it, no one will notice. They'll just think you rolled them without any effort, but really it was your ass providing all the cover and support they needed. 

**Brawling Tank** - I'm awful at this, but when a pair of assaults wander around with SRM's, Medium pulse lasers, and AC20's I know I'm about to see a fucking show. It's high energy, high kills, high damage, and die in a blaze of glory. They've become somewhat less known since the release of the bigger maps, but they still have their uses for sure. 

**DO NOT**

**Be afraid to take damage** - You're a giant sponge. Take the damage and move from cover to cover. 

**Know your role and strengths** - Long range support, short range brawler. Know it and stick to it. 

**Go Alone** - You will always be the center of attention in a match, but never ever ever act like a light and go to cap. I've seen it, don't say you haven't seen it, because you know you raged at seeing that stupid shit. Stick with your team, be a damage sponge.  

-------------------------

**Words of Advice**
When building a mech, keep in mind what kind of range you want to work with. Sub 500 or +500. The maps are only going to get bigger so brawling is going to become less and less viable, but for now it's a pretty good bet there's going to be a close brawl. Don't put LRMS with medium lasers. Dont mix SRMs with PPCs. (Streaks are better if you're worried about getting caught off guard up close)

Communication is key for this game and although PGI has their thumbs up their ass on how to communicate effectively with team mates it still has to be done. Once you're in a clan or organization that has a TS, Mumble, etc. you'll see the benefits of what  verbal communications can do. But when Pugging, communicate. Lead if you have to. Most are clueless on what to do, and if you suggest a strategy, most will follow. 

You know what, just join up with a crew soon. Pugging has it's place certainly, but god is it awful to do right now. Not because of the players, but the inability communication effectively right now kills any type of momentum you'll have. Most PUG groups that win have a team of 4 who are communicating, so join one and start having a better time. (If you haven't already)

1374689687.0,35,self.mwo,1iyyzt,How could PGI incentivise non-combat roles on the battlefield?,ataraxic89,42,7,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1iyyzt/how_could_pgi_incentivise_noncombat_roles_on_the/,"IMO this is a gigantic problem with the game. There is no serious benefit to anything but shooting the enemy. 

I am mostly talking about assault here but conquest is actually far more affected by the lack of incentive to capture and defend. PGI mistakenly thought the concept of capping = more resource points would make people want to cap. This is obviously not true to anyone who has ever played a video game. 

The role of the information warrior is entirely non existent. We can get a very minor bonus for spotting an enemy that is then damaged by a team mate within some time (I think). However, this bonus is not very high for what is being asked. The fact of the matter is that if you try to scout without ECM (or even with it) you are exposing yourself to extreme danger by venturing out to look for the enemy. Just a few PPCs or gauss can leg most lights before you even have time to run away. 

Sometime I will run out to scout in my spider and have my leg 1-shot off upon first contact. On top of that my team will probably not shoot the enemy anytime soon so I wont even get a bonus for finding out where the enemy is. 

Some ideas for information warefare rewards: 

* Cbills = number of friendlies under your ECM * time. This would be a small number but would be continuous (next to nothing for just 1 person, ramping up to a decent amount for 3 under ecm (your lance) and no more pas that. Not sure people with ECM should be counted. 

* ECM kill assist bonus. Kills made by teammates under your ECM gives you a bonus. 

* Much better spotting bonus mechanics. Often when I find the enemy I quickly press R to let the friendlies know where a bunch of them are. I feel this is kind of rigged, perhaps a module or equipment that lets you spot all enemies within a circle on your hud. Only the one you actually locked onto is targetable by missiles though.

* ECM counter bonus. Extra spot bonus for countering ECM  carrying mechs then being the one to spot them. I dont think this should include PPCs because they are a weapon first, counter ecm last. Also, they dont need a bonus. This would apply to ECM counter, BAP, tag, narc. Not sure if UAV should be included as to avoid a consumable = guaranteed cbills.

Thats just some idea, Im sure you guys can think of much more.

Keep in mind that your idea should actually be possible. It cant magically give you a bonus for looking like you might be spotting.

I'm not saying the new maps couldn't use a little more tweaking (the old maps have been through several rounds of changes, like adding the boat in Forest Colony, or the holes in the crashed dropship on Frozen City) and they will definitely be better with 24 players, but in general, I have fun playing them.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CR2,True,t3_1djyz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1djyz9/just_for_contrast_i_actually_like_playing_on/,

Considering many boats are packing at least 4 PPCs, this would result in 20+ more heat per alpha. This would form a good starting point for adjusting the damage penalty induced from overheating.

Some play for fun and some play to win. In today's age of streaming, large audiences gather to watch the best players compete at the top levels of their respective games. Entire communities emerge as fans watch their favorite players compete for glory. As more people watch, more will participate. While there are always balance issues, the longevity of the game will ulitmately depend on the overall direction of the game. To accomplish this, we can utilize the greatest resource of MWO: The Community.

##Feature 1: Private Matchmaking
1. Private Lobby is created
2. 16 Players can join
3. Players are grouped into either Team 1 or Team 2
4. Map is chosen, spawns are based on Team #
5. No currency, experience, rewards, etc provided

##Feature 2: Scorecard API
1. Each match summary has unique match ID and all values stored in centralized database
2. An API is created to allow community sites to access match data
3. Community Sites can then build their own Leagues, Tournaments, and Planetary Warfare using the central database
4. PGI can track traffic trends and give their marketing department better statistics for better ad placement

##Feature 3: Replays and Internet Streaming
1. Player streams are now gaining more traction
2. Replays give them the tools to break down historic matches
3. MWO Commentators are now able to build quality coverage
4. Replays allow the community to post tutorials and guides on youtube

##Feature 4: Community Warfare
1. Everything PGI is planning with community warfare goes here
2. Understand which Galactic battle site is working the best, and build a competing system in house
3. Simultaneously work with and compete against the community sites to revolutionize the game

##Feature 5: Arena Combat
1. Can even make it Solaris themed arena type combat
2. In house ranking structure for various drop types (1v1,2v2,3v3, etc)
3. Borrow from successful community leagues/tournaments
4. Work with and compete against community driven sites",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1374797424.0,,PARA,True,t3_1j2b95,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1j2b95/thoughts_on_mwo_game_direction_from_a_competitive/,

MechWarriors.** Have you been a good or naughty pilot this year?...Trick Question! It doesn’t matter because everyone gets the same patch!

**On** the first day of Patch-mas my true love gave to me, CONQUEST MODE! Dun, Dun, DUN! That’s right a new game mode available on every map. You can explore new strategies on this mode over the holidays and let us know what you think. We will be looking to tune it in the new year based on your feedback and the data we will collect. We know you are going to want to try it right away so we added mode selection, allowing you to choose which game type you want to play.


**On the second day of Patch-mas**, a new economy! Heads up we’ve changed up the way you earn C-bills. First we have taken Repair and Rearm out of the equation. We did this to eliminate people dropping with BattleMechs that are not 100 % health, potentially harming their team. Then we redistributed the way you earn C-bills, because you no longer have to repair and rearm, you keep what you earn. BE WARNED you have to contribute to your team to earn C-bills. We also changed Trial BattleMechs to earn 100% C-Bills and Mech XP. Lastly, There is no better time to invite your friends to play, we added the Cadet bonus for the first 25 matches to accelerate a new players ability to buy their first BattleMech.


**Speaking of BattleMechs**! Get ready for the triple threat! The new, Twin Dragon Hero BattleMechs, Flame and Fang, with patterns that send fear into the heart of your enemy and a C-bill boost that will send you laughing all the way to the bank. Wait, we didn’t stop there! Introducing The Stalker. Here is what Kyle L. had to say about this Assault class BattleMech. “It’s the blimp ‘o’ death bro!... It’s like the Hindenburg except everyone else is going down in flames!”. Well put my friend...well put. You can also take a look at the latest BattleMech patterns. We have expanded the options and the Phranken is sure to please.


**Get ready to battle in River City night version**. I mentioned it earlier and we delivered! Finally a night map where night vision is effective!  I love this map and I know you will too.


**Finally**, ring in 3050 with some entertaining new cockpit customization items. The holographic displays are very cool and, for me, the Urbanmech is a must buy!
We hope you notice we have taken your feedback on pricing and offered the new year’s items at a variety of price points!


We also addressed some key performance and stability issues this patch and we are testing new networking code over the holidays that we are looking to release in January. During test some users noted much improved performance with latest graphics drivers so please if you experience performance issues ensure you are running the latest graphics drivers for your card. Also there is a suspected issue with the patcher we are continuing to investigate where performance for some users is lower when patching vs. a fresh re-install if you suffer from low fps and new drivers don't resolve the issue please try a fresh install as a workaround for now.

So have a safe and Happy Holidays and as always, MechWarriors, see you on the battlefield!

Matt Newman

P.S. This is our last planned patch this year so we will resume our “normal” patch schedule in January

**NEW GAME MODE**

**Conquest**

      With the rumblings and rumors of activity, along the Periphery of the InnerSphere, all factions have begun 
      amassing large amounts of Germanium.  Germanium is used in the jump drives of the large jump capable 
      ships that transport Mechs over long distances.  The unsettling atmosphere that has permeated throughout
       the InnerSphere has Germanium at an all time high in terms of demand.  It is now time that all 
      MechWarriors pitch in to help in this cause.

    * Conquest Mode enabled.
    * Gather resources by capturing resource extractor points.
    * 5 extractor points per map.
    * Each team starts with 1 extractor in their possession.
    * The more extractor points owned by a team, the faster resources are accumulated.
    * Once a team reaches 750 resources, they will win the match.
    * A team can still win by destroying all enemy Mechs.
    * Win or Lose, each team will receive 25 C-Bills per resource they've gathered.  (e.g. if your team gathered 
      750 resources, you will get an end of match bonus of 18,750 C-Bills).
    * Known Issue: There is a problem with Conquest resource rewards not being issued if players/groups select 
      ""ANY"" as the game mode.  If you wish to play Conquest, make sure you or your group's leader selects 
      ""Conquest"" from the game mode selector.  This will be address in the next patch.

      from the game and rebalancing how many C-Bills you will be earning.  We are also reducing the amount of 
      C-Bills you earn by default for a win/loss/tie.  Non-participation in matches will result in very low C-Bill 
      income.  That being said, your participation in matches and playing as a team will now payout at a higher rate.
	  Below is a detailed summary of the changes to the reward system:

    * All mechs will be fully repaired and rearmed after every match at no cost.
    * Trial mechs get the same rewards as normal mechs (even mech XP)
    * New Bonus called Cadet Bonus: this bonus is rewarded to new users for 25 games. The math is calculated 
      by: log10(gamesremaining) * 300,000 CBills

        * This means you will receive 424,492 C-Bills after your first match, decreasing each game until you've 
      played 25.
        * After 25 matches you will have received a total of 7,981,686 additional C-Bills.
        * If you have already played more than 25 matches, you will be given those 7,981,686 C-Bills as a lump 
      sum (Happy Holidays!) If you've played under it, you'll be given the amount equal to the games you've played.

    * Removed Capture Win/Assist CBills Bonus
    * Spotting Assists will now only be given if spotted target takes damage from allies

Assault Rewards:

    * Win/Loss/Tie = 25,000
    * Team Kill = -10,000 * how many teammates you have killed
    * Component Destroyed = 2,500 * how many components you have destroyed
    * Enemy Kill = 5,000 * how many enemies you have killed
    * Enemy Kill Assist =7,500 * how many kill assists you got in the match
    * Spotting Assist = 2,500 * how many spotting assists you got in the match
    * Damage Done = 25 * how much damage you did in the match
	
Conquest Rewards:

    * Win/Loss/Tie = 25,000
    * Team Kill = -10,000 * how many teammates you have killed
    * Component Destroyed = 1,250 * how many components you have destroyed
    * Enemy Kill = 2,500 * how many enemies you have killed
    * Enemy Kill Assist = 3,750 * how many assist you got in the game
    * Spotting Assist = 1,250 * how many spotting assist you got in the game
    * Damage Done = 25 * how much damage you did in the game
    * Resource Bonus = 25 * how many resources you have collected

**MECHLAB IMPROVEMENTS**

    * Heat sink entry in both new Mech detail panel and current Mech detail panel now shows Dbl Heat Sinks
      when double heat sinks are equipped
    * New BattleMech list now organized by class (Hero, Light, Medium, Heavy, Assault)
	
Jump Jets:

    * Removing Jump jet override (now using actual jump jet loadout restrictions)
    * Now enforcing and showing maximum number of jump jets as well as current number equipped on a Mech
      chassis.
    * Added Jump jet bar showing maximum jump distance for current configuration (if a Mech is capable of 
      using jump jets)
    * What this all boils down to is that the number of Jump Jets on a Mech will now properly affect jump 
      height/distance.
    * Players will notice a change in the overall jump trajectory. This will be tuned in future patches.
	
Modules:

    * Now showing how many modules the BattleMech is capable of in the new Mech detail panel
    * Now showing module slots available and currently equipped modules in the current Mech detail panel
    * Both of the above automatically adjust when Master status is achieved (extra slot is added)

**GAMEPLAY**


    * ECM will now fully counter only the closest enemy Mech.
    * Cockpit Camera shake intensity adjusted to be more realistic  (Shake = Damage * Impulse)
    * HUD will no longer flicker unnaturally when shot with machine gun fire and flamers beyond a certain 
      damage threshold
    * Player can now control the brightness in the cockpit using (.) period.
    * There is now a 3 second delay at the end of the match before the End of Round Screen shows.

Weapons Tunning:

    AUTOCANNON UPDATE:

    * AC/20 projectile set to 900m/s (750m/s previous)
    * AC/10 projectile set to 1100m/s (850m/s previous)

    * LBX/10 projectile set to 1100m/s (850m/s previous)

    NARC BEACON UPDATE:

    * NARC lifespan increased to 20 seconds (15 seconds previously)
	
    TAG UPDATE:

    * TAG range increased to 750m (450m previously)

    PPC UPDATE:

    * PPC projectile speed increased to 2000m/s (matches AC/2) (1200m/s previous)
    * ERPPC projectile speed matched to regular PPC (2000m/s) (1200m/s previous)
	
    ARTEMIS UPDATE:

    * Artemis now requires line of site to function.  In-direct fire will not benefit from Artemis.
	
**PERFORMANCE FIXES**

IMPORTANT: Please remember to update to the latest graphics drivers if you are having FPS issues and ensure that you are running low settings with V-Sync disabled and if that doesn't work try a fresh re-install.

    * 10% faster ray traces
    * Reduced number of client side ray traces Mechs require
    * Shadows disabled for low settings
    * Foliage swaying disabled for low and medium settings

**BUG FIXES**

    * Refresh MechTree Categories whenever mech ownership changes

    * Weapon bay door toggle SFX will no longer play when a mech does not have weapon bay doors
    * Fixes most issues with penetrating LRM’s (projectiles in general) through static meshes
    * Jump Jet effects will no longer float around unattached
    * Weapon Bay doors will no longer float unattached

Update

Greetings MechWarrior’s and welcome to Open Beta Update 4!

We have some exciting things to talk about in this patch, but first off, we want highlight the start of Banked Premium time button. The Community spoke and we listened!  It has been a while coming, but  Founder's premium time will now be reset and banked allowing you to activate it when you desire. This won’t stop you from purchasing premium time right now and activating your founders time later. Any of the bonus XP and C-bills you earned while your premium time was active are retained.

Next up we have Frozen City Night. This relight of the Frozen City map changes things up by creating long clear sightlines and some cool new effects in the sky. It may not be a night map that requires Night vision but that will be in another patch. ;)

I can’t talk about Visual Customization without giving props to Mark Hayden, aka Hayden on the forums. Mark has been customizing Mech patterns on our concept art since the beginning and now he works on the game!  So if you want an idea of the kinds of skins are going to be in your future take a look at this thread. http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/315-repainted-concept-art/  We are extremely proud that Mark has decided to join our team to give you guys the best options for customization.

It doesn’t stop there either, you have all seen the Coconut Monkey and the nVidia Dawn bobbleheads right? I now present to you HULA GIRL!  Along with a bunch of other cockpit customization items and more is in the works! 

Last but not least BITCHIN’ BETTY is in the game! Yes that is Carrol Ruggier’s voice, of MechWarrior 2 fame, in the game! We still have more audio to add (*cough*, start-up sequence, *cough*), and some more system refinement, but we just couldn’t make you wait any longer!

Lastly, I want to let everyone know we are working on networking, performance, and bug fixes. This is the heart of any great game and we are committed to getting the best experience we can for our players. Some things take longer to turn around.

See you on the Battlefield!

- Matt Newman


VISUAL CUSTOMIZATION

Players will now be able to customize the outer visual looks of their BattleMechs.  This includes applying patterns and adjusting the colors that make up those patterns.

    * Patterns - Patterns are made up of color elements which give them a unique look when applied to a BattleMech.  Not all Mechs have skins available to them.  Check out the matrix in the link below to see what is currently customizable.
    * Paint Colors - The colors that can be applied to a Pattern are broken down into channels.  Each pattern has from 1 to 3 channels.  Colors can be changed on any channel that is available for the chosen Pattern.
    * Cockpit Items - Items can now be purchased for the player's BattleMech cockpits.  More items are being implemented and they will be coming out soon.
	
For more in-depth detail on Visual Customization, follow this link: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/76666-battlemech-visual-customization-phase-1/

With this, we found a rendering issue that would cause colors to not show up properly.  This was fixed and now Mech colors are properly reproduced in the game.  You will notice a slight shift in colors for your Mechs including Founder's Mechs and Yen-Lo-Wang.

LEVEL

    * Frozen City Night
      Dropped into what once was the city centre of a thriving metropolis, expect unpredictable terrain in this now lifeless wasteland. After dropping into the new frozen city environment, you will find challenges the original map did not have. From the gorgeous borealis in the background, to the moonlit night effects, you will have to be much more careful about checking for enemies; the fog has dissipated however.

As with normal frozen city, this map is very cold, and it will affect the way your mech produces heat. Heat will take much longer to buildup allowing for lengthier, more intense battles with less chance of overheating your mech.

GENERAL

    * An “Activate” button has been added to the main screen allowing Founders to activate their banked premium time.
    * The following applies to Founder's Accounts ONLY:
        * Your premium time is now zeroed out.
        * If you have purchased premium time with MC during Open Beta, that time will remain in tact.
        * Once the ""Activate"" button is clicked, the amount of premium time that came with your Founder's package is injected into your account.
        * Again, if you purchased premium time with MC during Open Beta, and you click the Activate button, your remaining purchase time and your Founder's time will be combined.  (i.e. you will not lose any Premium Time).

WEAPONS

    * LRM damage has been increased from 1.7 to 1.8 per missile.
	
GAMEPLAY

    * Bitching Betty v 1.0
        * Your Mech's onboard computer will speak to tell you of the following events:
            * a location on your Mech is critically damaged
            * a location on your Mech has been destroyed
            * a weapon has been destroyed
            * a weapon's ammo is at 25%
            * a weapon's ammo is depleted
            * a weapon's ammo is destroyed
            * a heat sink has been destroyed
            * jump jet fuel is at 25%
            * jump jet fuel is empty
            * your Mech is out of bounds
            * your heat level is critical
            * your Mech has shutdown
            * you have overridden shutdown
            * your base is being captured
            * the enemy base is being captured
            * your target an enemy Mech
            * you switch to target a different enemy Mech
        * The volume of these messages is controlled by the Dialog Volume slider in the options menu
        * Some weapons/ammunition announcements are not in yet but they will be added with subsequent patches.
		
MECHS

    * Decreased the horizontal arm movement on the Cataphract's, to avoid clipping the torso cannon
    * Added Cataphract's walking backward animation.
    * Mechs with jump jets have their take-off animations adjusted to 40 frames. 
    * The number of weapons seen on the Ravens' right arms changes to properly reflect the number of weapons equipped
    * Cockpit/head hit area tweaks: reduced for Cataphract, Cicada and the Awesome
	
BUG FIXES

    * Fixed a desync that could occur when a Mech had a destroyed leg.
    * Users will no longer have a blurry screen after they die.  This was caused when a user would die from a missile.
    * Users will only be able to launch one game client now.
    * Fixed Lock-on reticule not showing up for spectators.
    * Cool-down bar stutter fix.
    * User can no longer change weapon groups while shut down.
    * Numerous text updates/corrections.
    * Fixed LOD rotation issue on certain buildings in River City
    * Minor visual improvements to some rock materials in Forest Colony
    * Minor visual improvements to some materials in the Mech Lab
    * First art pass of adding buildings to crevasse in Frozen City
    * Target bones updated for all Mechs to ensure that S-SRMs will hit the proper enemy locations.
    * Jenner/Founder's cockpit materials fixed
    * Rear torso hit-unregistered-bug fixes: Dragon

KNOWN ISSUES

  MechLab:

    * Newly bought Cockpit Items are not always automatically equipped on Mechs.
        * You need to re-access the cockpit and re-equip the items manually.
    * Colors cannot be changed on default patterns of the Commando, Hunchback, Dragon and Awesome for the moment. 
    * After purchasing MC, you may receive a ‘Not enough MC’ message if trying to buy a Camo Spec or Cockpit Item without a previous logout/login.
        * Restart your game client after Purchasing MCs.
    * Rarely, purchasing a Cockpit Item right after exiting a match will cause the game to lock.
    * Camo Spec color palette may incorrectly display previous colors after changing patterns and coming back to re-change colors.
    * Selecting Cockpit Tab too quickly after saving Cockpit settings may lock the camera outside of the Mech.
    * The two first Mech Bays you purchase will not immediately accept new Mechs.
        * Select another working Mech Bay and then your newly purchased Mech Bay will function normally. 

  Ingame:

    * Bitching Betty is missing certain prompts and repeats “AMS ammo at 25%”.
        * Targeted by enemy, Locked by LRMs or Streaks, Flamer Destroyed and Start Up Sequence are missing.
    * Frozen City Night can have red/green sky textures in low settings with certain system specs.

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

A few minutes ago, before I got home, I'm sitting at a light in traffic listening to my podcasts. Up the distance, I could see an ambulance with lights on apparently not moving at a distant intersection on a hill. Curious as to why it's not moving, I start to engage my zoom out to 1.5x or even 3.0x if necessary...when I realized I wasn't sitting in my 'Mech cockpit. 

Equal amounts of disappointment and bemusement.

I think the most I had was around 150-160k. Considering a properly equipped mech is around 15mil+ that's 100+ games with premium to get a new chassis. Ugh. I've seen as little as 10k cbills as salvage bonus for wiping pretty much a team of 12 heavies/assaults. Before that it was 30-40k for 8.

Well, yesterday in my Gauss and 2 PPC K2 during the 12v12 testing, a seemingly inexperienced Commando pilot ran right in front of me during the first two minutes of the match and stopped. I clicked one button and he died. Is this how new players should feel? Obviously the guy made a big mistake, but the thing is, that build can deal the same amount of damage out to 540 m. And it won't be affected in the slightest by the new system. Neither will dual Gauss builds. While this system will reduce PPC boating stalkers, the root cause isn't bring addressed.

The current ""meta"" is really, REALLY boring.  Everyone packs long range weapons, and turtles for the first few minutes...peeking here and there for a lucky shot.  Everyone ends up sitting there, waiting for someone to initiate/advance...which rarely happens, since long range weapons quickly kill anyone trying to close the gap.

My suggestion?  

Smoke bombs!  Possibly as a ballistic or missile load, add the ability to drop a smoke screen which will blanket an area with smoke.  This will provide cover for approaching close-range mechs, and should add some intensity to encounters.

Ground rules:

* Unseen aren't happening. It's a foregone conclusion that if they were possible, they would be added to the game as quickly as possible. There's really nothing to say about that other than complaining about it not happening or wishful thinking. Go whine about it on the official forums or something.
* Quad Battlemechs and LAMs are out. Since they're all Unseen at this point, it's not a big deal.
* Nothing introduced after 3052. Again, you can whine about the timeline, but this much isn't changing given how many time-appropriate options there are.
* Current tech only. This is all IS mechs, and anything that would need a special exception to the current real-world or in-game technology (speeds over 150, MASC, a LAA on one arm, splitting weapons between components) is possible but much less likely.
* I've skipped all of the TRO 3058 and 3075 mechs that are described as extinct in 3050, like the Lynx, Talon, Hammerhands, and Helepolis. There's a bunch of them, they're all goofy-looking, and nobody much likes them. It's possible that PGI could put them into MWO, but very unlikely.

Those limitations in mind, what mechs might we see?

Greetings MechWarriors.

Hard to believe it's March already! Especially since I am writing this in February.

March is going to be a big month for us and we are starting things off with a guaranteed new favourite hero Mech, the Cicada X-5. No, those aren't head headlights. They are in fact missile tubes, you know for shooting missiles and stuff. With superb piloting skills this thing is going to pwn. Just check out those hardpoints and start your scheming. A Hero Mech so good I didn't feel the need to mention the 30% C-bill boost? WOW

Speaking of hardpoints, the MechLab continues to up its game by providing location based graphics for Mech hardpoints, engine, heatsinks, equipment and available slots. Now if you could just remember where you put that XL 320 engine you bought.

Since you just spent 20 minutes tweaking your build, why not take it for a spin in testing grounds? Testing grounds is a new mode that allows new and old players the chance to practice your pilot skills and test your loadout on each map populated with static targets that won't shoot back.

Hey you!... Yeah you! You don't have enough stuff in your cockpit! But you are in luck because we have NEW hanging cockpit items using the ""Real Hula Girl PhysicsTM"" engine. Repeatedly alpha striking and shutting down is sweaty work but my cockpits smells 75% better now that I bought and equipped an ""Air freshener"" in all my Mechs. You should too!

**Gameplay**

**Cicada Variant Quirks**

    - CDA-2A:  Received an additional module slot (this gives it 2 now, like the other variants).  
       Torso twist angle increased by 5 degrees to each side.  
       Torso movement speed increased by 10%.  
       Turning rate increased by 5%.
    - CDA-2B:  Torso twist angle increased by 5 degrees to each side.
       Arm movement speed increased by 22%.

       line of sight to the target), they travel through the air in a distinct formation. 

**Dynamic Capture Points**

    - Assault : When a mech from the opposing team is in the capture area the beams turn red. When
       mechs from both teams are in the capture area the beams will flash yellow. When the capture area
       is idle the beams are green.
    - Conquest : When a mech is in a capture area the beams will turn red. When a mech from both teams
       is in the capture area the beams flash yellow. When no one is in the capture area the beams are green.

______

**Front End**

    - Added Roll-overs for all relevant items in the New Mech Details panel and Current Mech Details panel.
        - When rolled-over, icons show up over the Mech image showing distribution of the item.
        - Added Free Slots entry (when dynamic slots are present, info on the number of dynamic slots is
           shown in addition to empty slots).
    - Moved the Sell Mech, Select Mech (for ready list) and Buy New Mech buttons into the bay icons.

**Performance**

    - Host state rewinding is now implemented for instant fire weapons (i.e. lasers, machine guns, flamers);

**Edit:** https://github.com/galorin/MWO_Randomizer/releases/tag/0.01B-alpha1 - this one works on Win7

This is an alpha release of my Randomizer.  Go on, you know you want to create a crazy Mech and take it into battle, anything to get past the FotM builds.

Not for the faint of heart, I have seen it create mad, stupid builds.  The kinds of builds that will leave your enemy scratching their heads and your team cursing your ability to build a Mech. Want a slow Spider with a gauss rifle?  This might just build one for you and forget to put in the ammo.  Maybe you will get an Atlas outfitted with an XL engine and a couple small lasers.

What can I say, it's **random**.

Upcoming versions will have more stuff, saving mechs, making more than one ata a time, making mechs out of stuff that you already own... Lots of stuff.  This is just a taste.

Oh, two warnings... For some reason there are more than one listing for some mechs.  Known issue and I am working on it.

Also, it doesn't do Endo Steel weight reduction.  Takes away the slots, but gives you no benefit.

1373432973.0,29,self.mwo,1hzmb2,Guide to using a Flight Stick,TheTucsonTarmac,34,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1hzmb2/guide_to_using_a_flight_stick/,"Shortly after discovering MWO, I dusted off my old flight stick and, attempted to play using it instead of a mouse.  The results were less than spectacular.

Recently, while looking at Loc-Nar's battle station, I saw that some people were using a stick left handed.  Since my flight stick can be be set up for ether hand, I decided to give it another try.  

The Stick:  I'm using a 10 year old Saitek Cyborg Evo.  This stick features a hand rest that can be moved from side to side, so that it can be used with ether hand.  The buttons on the crown of the stick can also be tilted, and turned, so that you can place then in a natural position.  If your stick is a right hand only model (like the ThrustMaster Loc-Nar showed in his cockpit), it will not work.  I do not know if Saitek still makes this model, but a quick check of Ebay showed them going for $10-20.

Previously, when I used this stick in flight sims, I just placed it between my legs and under my thighs.  This gave it me the ""I'm in a plane"" feeling that I was looking for.  I didn't think this was going to work while using a mouse in my right hand, so I secured the stick to my desk top with some scrap wood and clamps.  I added a armrest, made out of packing foam and gaffers tape, for comfort.  I hope to come up with a cleaner mount later, but this works fine.

I then spent a couple hours in the testing grounds trying to set it up, and get a feel for driving with it.  I should point out that you are still aiming you mechs weapons and upper body with the mouse, the stick is used to drive the mechs legs, in place of the WASD buttons.  Pushing the stick forward accelerates the mech, pulling back puts it in reverse, and just letting stops you.  You don't need to use the ""full stop"" button with the stick.
I am not using the ""torso twist"" option, that is still controlled by the mouse.
 My goal was to make it so that the only reason I had to take my hand off the stick was to type in the chat.  After much trial and error, here is the control layout I've settled on. 

* Trigger:  AKA button 0 toggle zoom
* Center bottom thumb:  AKA button 1:  Strategic overlay (show names)
* Left bottom thumb: AKA button 2:  Toggle weapon chain fire (normally backspace)
* Right bottom button: AKA button 3:  Next Target
* Left top button:  Center Torso
* Right top button:  Jump jets
* Analog throttle:  Axis Y
* Analog turn: Axis X

The center top of the stick has a 8 position ""D-pad"", similar to a X-box controller.  So far I am only using the 4 points of the compass.

* D-pad up: Override
* D-pad down: Show scoreboard
* D-pad right: Map
* D-pad left: Center legs

IMPORTANT!  I never used the ""center legs"" button when playing with a keyboard, but I have found that it is great when using the stick.  I normally play with my thumb on the right side of the stick, pressing next target, and (if I'm in a mech with them) jump jets.  This lets me push the center legs button quickly, with a tap of my thumb, and gets my legs aimed where I am looking.   Great for fast escapes, or just going across that bridge without falling off.

The stick has 6 buttons on it's base, I've used the for toggle ECM, shutdown, arm lock, etc.   Flavor to taste.  The throttle, which I can't use due to my ghetto mount,  should be used for weapon group 5/TAG.  The stick twist, normally used for rudders, is not used.

I put together a little demo video to show you what it's like.  I used one of the fastest, jumpiest, mechs I owned, figuring that if it worked with that, it would work with an Atlas, and everything in between.

http://youtu.be/naJHfXQskOc

Conclusion:  When I started this, I said to myself, ""if this doesn't work as good as a keyboard, I wont use it.""  I'm happy to report that it works just as good as the WASD, and in some respects, notably the ability to make turns at less then 100%, it's better.

Comments and feedback (except from CeaseToHope ;p) are welcome.  Enjoy.

Hello cadets!

TheMightyWashburn here to give you some helpful tips. (Credentials: playing since closed beta, non founder)

First off Ill address your questions directly then add what I think you should know.


* Good starter mech: I strongly suggest that you choose a weight class based on how you *want* to play and not on what is easiest. Whether you choose an atlas or a spider you will probably suck for about the same length of time. That said, heavier mechs are usually slower and thus usually better suited for longer range and lighter for shorter though there are MANY exceptions. Lights harass and cap. Mediums brawl, support, and stragglers. Heavies and assaults play similar overall and are the primary core of a team as far as both damage output and absorption. Dont get me wrong, lights and mediums often do as much damage, but cant stand toe to toe like assaults do. 
* Close and medium range is, IMHO the most fulfilling way to play the game. It is called brawling and is where mediums shine brightest. Long range can be fun too but frustrating as hell when you get caught alone against a fast mover. 
* Sweet spots: The head is the weakest target, all mechs have 18 max armor and 15 internal structure meaning as little as a 33 damage alpha(all weapons firing at once) can kill a mech. However, the hitbox is VERY small on most mechs and hard to hit on any decent player as they turn a lot. The Center torso (CT) hold a standard engine and the right and left torso (RT &amp; LT) hold part of the engine in XL engines. To kill a mech you must destroy either the cockpit (head), engine (CT with std, CT, RT, or LT in XL engines) or destroy both legs. Almost all mechs carry far less armor on their back than on their front making this the optimal target. Note: there is no way to see if someone has an XL engine visually. However, many pilots choose them for the weight reduction. Virtually all Centurions have them, along with many lights.
* Balancing: This depends so much on the specific mech and what range you are going for on this build. I personally try to set it up so that all my weapons work well at a certain distance I plan to use the mech at. So I wouldn't equip LRMs (long range missiles) to a brawler. or conversely small lasers on a ER PPC boat arent even worth having as every weapon reduced heat efficiency even when not being fired. This actually brings me to a critical point about making an effective mech. *You do not need to use every single hardpoint to make an effective mech.* Double heat sinks are pretty much a mandatory upgrade in this game, especially with any kind of energy weapons. Making a mech is often more about good heat management as opposed to pure alpha damage. Some mechs are manageable with high heat weapons but as you are new you will have difficulty remembering to be patient and not shoot as soon as you power back up after an overheat shutdown its important that you have very manageable heat builds at first till you get the hang of it.
* Finally Id like to add some important skills to focus on: *Fire Discipline* This is the ability to stay calm and wait to shoot when your shots will do the most. This includes not shooting when you are brawling and would overheat upon firing. Also it means taking your time to get all of a weapons damage into the same exact place shot after shot. **THIS IS CRITICAL TO KILLING ENEMIES** Lasers shoot for 1 whole second and sweeping it wildly across them does next to nothing. You must hit the same hitbox every time even if that means taking shots waiting for the perfect time to fire. *Torso twisting* This is the habit of turning your upper body often so that each shot of your enemy hits a different area spreading the damage out. This is the counter to fire discipline. *Teamwork* Even if you are always with PUGs (pick up groups) you can work together simply by stay close to a mass of friendlies and picking a teammate and shooting what he is shooting, even if you are being hit by other enemies. I also strongly suggest you get on Team speak 3 and play with voice chat in premade groups. No commitment necessary. They will help you out if you ask (usually). And the last thing Ill cover for now is *Do not chase an enemy if they no longer pose a threat.* This is a common tactic that most new players fall for. They see their first enemy of the match, a raven, running beind their ""front line"" and try to chase it down even if they could never catch it. All the while the enemies atlases are now focusing firing on 1 friendly at a time and ripping your team to shreds. Dont do it, whether they are in a light or an atlas. Exception, if you are fast enough, try to stop a cap on your base, just stand in the square and try not to get shot till you get reinforcements. 

This was a very long PSA by your friendly medium mech master TheMightyWashburn :p

I see a lot of complaining about the size and what it means for capping issues. What I don't think that people are getting is that it seems this way because we are all used to playing an imbalanced game. 

Think about how many medium mechs you have seen in the last 2 months, really think about it. The intro of the Cataphract and Stalker, coupled with net code issues,  have gradually shifted the gameplay to the point where harder hitting and slower moving mechs, and speed of light ECM mechs were all that was viable. 

Enter the resurgence of the mediums: 

You can tell PGI knew what they were doing by introducing this map by looking at the other changes they prioritized to be implemented at the same time. Increased engine capacity and quirks/tweaks for existing mediums, and introduction of a medium that can do 127 before speed tweak. I'm half surprised they didn't up the engine on one of the Hunchbacks and/or Spiders (possible hero variants incoming?). 

We will all readjust. Medium mechs will be more fun to play now and so more people will drop with them. People will learn they have to coordinate in Alpine, even in PUG's.  I hope that we see a few more maps this size and maybe a few in between size maps as well. 

 The demands of the maps themselves play a large part in the meta game and balancing the game will depend on knowing this fact. 

tl;dr The map will help rebalance the game by making Mediums useful again.

back around the time of MWO launch i had a fried mobo and couldnt play. i got my rig up and going and have since been playing planetside 2. but...soe is soe. ps2 is so buggy, full of hackers right now. poorly optimized, its so close to bordering on pay to win. im getting kind of sick of it, and considering seeing what else is out there. 

so, tell me about MWO. you dont have to sell me on the features. i allready like mechwarrior, and i can read the website, thats not what im asking for and ill just ignore posts that talk about the obvious. 

i want you to level with me and tell me the nitty gritty. are people hacking in this game? how buggy is it? is it a cash grab? tell me what you really HATE about it (even though you still play) so i can know what i might be in for if i bother with the download.

I found some nifty UAV related data (some of it was already there in the prior patch, some of it was tweaked with new values/names/descriptions), some new purchasable items, and the Canyon Networks minimap.
____
**Meet the Lightning G15, our new(ly modeled) friend in the skies**

[Adridos on the MWO forums](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/116901-new-airstrike-bomber-model-anyone-seen-it/page__view__findpost__p__2330550) took [this nice screenshot of the Airstrike fighter model](http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/9158/beznzvulo.jpg).  Turns out that it's a [Lightning G15](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Lightning_(Aerospace_Fighter\)), at least according to the filenames.  This is the plane that shows up when you call in an Airstrike now.

**UAV Data**

I have a full dump of my observations [in this pastebin](http://pastebin.com/HAnvDzmq).  The TL;DR is, that currently:

* The UAV is a consumable which lasts for 45 seconds and has a 240m sensor range by default.  It can be targetted at 180m, and has 10 health.  It has a damage value of 5 as well, we might be able to use it offensively?
* It is able to use up to 3 waypoints (only if you upgrade it? this might be outdated text)
* Advanced UAVs (MC perhaps?) will last for 60 seconds and have a 240m Range.  There are references to it having a 2minute duration, not sure if that's an inconsistency or me not factoring in some module/talent.
* Pilot Talents grant the UAV 25% increase in sensor range (15000gxp), and a 33% increase in duration (15000gxp)
* Three overall UAV types, UAV-S (short), UAV-I (improved), UAV-A (Advanced, MC?)

**Squirrel Cockpit Item**

As mentioned in the [PAX East thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1b222o/my_unanswered_question_from_pax_east_and_a_bonus/), there is a [Squirrel Cockpit Item](http://i.imgur.com/YFUtZMH.jpg) headed into the game.  This last patch added it as a purchasable item in the itemstats.xml, so I would expect to see this at some point in May.

**Cobra Skin**

Looks like we're getting a skin named Cobra!  Just some [placeholder localization data for it at the moment](http://pastebin.com/qj3QC8Em).

**Canyon Networks Minimap**

Looks like this was added in the last April patch, but I haven't seen it around /r/mwo yet.  [Here you go!](http://hinome.net/mwo/rips/mwo_dds_canyonnetwork.png).

I've come to some conclusions and have a bit of advice to offer any other newcomers:

Overall conclusion: yes, it is possible to be competitive, but it will take you a LOT longer to get the next mech/weapon/whatever. 

I've been grinding for a LONG time since my cadet bonus expired and I've only got a hunchback and 3 million C-bills to show for it. It's currently kitted out with 1x L-laser 4 x M-laser 2 x SSRM2, AMS, BAP 250 engine and double heat sinks. I think I'm running endo steel as well. I have also upgraded to artemis tracking, but am not currently using artemis missiles. With this build, my hunchback hits 81kph and I was able to rinse 4 heavies when  I was the last one left on my team, before getting owned in the face by an atlas. Still, took the score from 3-7 against to 7-8 before the match was over. 

General tips for noobs:

* Don't bother spending c-bills to experiment with builds and such, because you will have zero c-bills left after your cadet bonus runs out and only 1 mech to show for it. Save your money and spend the time finding a build online that is known to be effective. 

* F-F armour is a waste of money and space. I switched back to normal armour and went for endo steel internals instead, this cost me a lot of C-bills in the process. 

* Learn to play with a light or a medium mech first, keep moving and learn to use the advantage of speed. 

* Without using real money, you will hit the xp cap for mech efficiencies before you can afford another variant of that mech. This is very annoying, but at least you will have some XP saved up for when you can finally unlock the elite efficiencies. 

* Group weapons in terms of arms and torso, this way you won't have to waste heat firing off lasers in your torso when you can only hit that target with arm weapons. 

* Upgrade your engine and double heatsinks before you do anything else to your mech. 

* You can take down assaults with a medium, just learn to orbit within the minimum LRM range and focus fire on the face. A lot of assaults can't turn fast enough to keep up with you. This is also a good reason for you to upgrade your engine as a priority, you will get owned otherwise. Also, this is only really possible if you can find an assault in relative isolation. Pick your fights wisely, again, speed is your ally. Don't be afraid to break off and pick a better fight.

* SSRM's are your friend if you want to face off light mechs. 

* You can't paint your mechs, but as the game doesn't allow you to have a 3rd person view of your mech (as far as I'm aware), this is useless anyway. 

* Winning a match with a few kill assists and kills will get you about 100,000 C-bills. You are looking at about 36 wins before you can afford another hunchback in stock form. 

* Don't sell weapons you have decided you don't like, just remove them and use them on another mech when you get the chance. 

* Pulse lasers have a stupidly short range

* PUG's (pick up groups) are usually useless unless you communicate. Use the chat box. My only other advice would be to stick together with the main force for straight fight maps, if you want to run around and cap, I'd pick a light and make sure you have an ECM. 

Paying players are at a clear advantage in terms of equipment advancement, though this is obviously going to happen with this kind of system. I hope that at some point it becomes possible for c-bills (or gxp perhaps) to be converted into other in game currencies, to allow non paying players to buy some of the hero kit. 

If anyone has any tips on getting more c-bills quickly then I'd love to hear it, I'm getting a bit bored of grinding out matches just for 100,000 c-bills if it goes well.

The camera angle is actually fine, it doesn't allow you to peek very far behind corners, but still allows you to aim (though personally I still prefer aiming from 1st person)

The camera is kind of glitchy right now, it tends to get ""stuck"" a lot on other mechs.

~~I was only getting around 30fps during this test, I normally get 60.~~ I'm an idiot, was looking while I had FRAPS on

Will edit as I play more.

It appears arm lock is permanently on for 3pv, however you feel about that.

I'm not sure how tweaking the FOV affects the 3pv camera, as I cannot get my user.cfg file to agree with the test server version.

The reticle jumps up and down with your mech's steps, making it more difficult to aim.

Side note: Capping take much longer in 12v12 now, to the point where its not worth it to attempt a cap alone.

Just watched a lovely argument between Bryan Ekman and one of those ""why don't you have the whole team working on HSR?"" idiots. 

IDEA: Make transition time from 3pv to 1pv longer to avoid abusing it for corner peeking. That way by the time you're back in shooting mode, the enemy has moved.

The legs on most assault mechs are not visible, which defeats the reason they put the feature in game in the first place. I would be in favor of a low-slung camera a-la MW3.

Drone Positioning:

POPTARTING:
just tried it in third person. It actually doesn't work too well, the mech accelerates into the drone's FOV for the first half second or so of the jetting. It pretty much blocks anything you're targeting, rendering any pre-aim you had useless (if your opponent wasn't stationary).
http://oi43.tinypic.com/1sfx3b.jpg

Edit to poptarting: While it may not be useful for aiming, 3pv allows you to see enemies too easily. Whether you're a poptart or just a regular ridge-peeker, this still gives another edge over brawlers. Yes, they know you're there too because of the drone, but that just means brawlers have to avoid that area.


Final impression:
In its current implementation, third person is not powerful as a combat tool, but provides too much battlefield awareness. It would be fine for a casual game mode but when competitive modes get here, 3rd person cannot be included in them (Hardcore mode is already listed in the game types on the test server). Yes, this will split the player base, but it seems like we have enough players to handle that. Counter-Strike seems to do fine with a heavily split playerbase.

Potential fix:
Use a system similar to mechwarrior 3's camera:

Jumping back into the mechlab, I realised that the SRM2 and the SRM4 kept switching orders, the SRM2 will always move itself above the SRM4 and use the 4 tube port, forcing the SRM4 to use the 2 tube port. Same thing happens with or without Artemis.

After fiddling around a bit more I realise that no matter what order I put the missiles in 2-4-6. 4-2-6
It will always rearrange itself to 6-2-4 even if visually the ports show other orders, and bringing it out into the field will still fire a 10 then 2 cluster, going back to the mechlab after that the visual ports will then change to 6-2-2.

After some experimentation, it looks like the # of missile tubes in the Dragon Slayers LT is dynamic and can range from 2 to 15 total. Specifically for the two launcher hardpoints:

1st hardpoint: 2-10 (with 5 more tubes added above the torso)

2nd hardpoint: 2-5 (located below tubes for first hardpoint


I'm pretty pumped about what this means for flexibility of builds for this awesome platform! Worth the MC :)


Update: There seems to be some smarts behind the scenes so that order that you put the missiles in doesn't make a difference (it optimizes somewhat for you).

___
###Victor Models###
I haven't seen these confirmed anywhere, and the Victor isn't even on the MWO official website.  However, digging into ItemStats.xml, I found:

* VTR-9K
* VTR-9B
* VTR-9S

http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Victor

Additionally, the hardpoint data for these models is in the game, so expect Smurfys to show them when it gets updated!

PS. The Dragonslayer is called [""Sortek""](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Ardan_Sortek) in the files.

___

###Sounds###
The TAG Laser has a new sound, now seperate from the small laser sound.

___

###Cockpit Items###
As reported before, there are several items that aren't live in the game yet (Dev Kill Medallion, New Cadet Medallion), but they added another new one this time around.  The name of the file is ""medallionoperation24"", so I imagine it is related to the [NGNG 24hour event](http://www.nogutsnogalaxy.net/forum/index.php/topic,516.0.html).

___

###Textures###
It looks like the damage decals for the AC20, AC2-10, Lasers, and LRMs got new imact textures.  I imagine this affect the weapons impacting terrain.

1371016786.0,30,self.mwo,1g6hn5,Extreme alpha is the problem. NOT boating.,Decaysa,53,23,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1g6hn5/extreme_alpha_is_the_problem_not_boating/,"The fix proposed by PGI in the latest development update will be ridiculously easy to game. Hell the current 3 PPC + 1 gauss builds already avoids it. My favorite build on the 4P already dodges it with 3 large lasers and 6 mediums. Once it's in place we'll quickly find other ways of doing abusive alpha. 

I propose a different solution:

Simply calculate the alpha base damage D;

if D &gt; 30 

calculate the excessive damage E = (D - 30);

Calculate heat penalty P = (1 + c*E) where c is a balance constant.

Now the heat generated by the alpha is multiplied by P.

--------------------
An example with (c = 0.03): 

3 ppc +  gauss firing is 45 damage;

So E = (45-30) = 15;
thus P = (1 + 15*0.03) =  1.45.

The heat generated by the alpha currently would be (3*8) + 1;
which is 25.

With the penalty it becomes (25*P) = 36.25.

-----------------------

This system would be both impossible to game and so much easier to understand. A simple new game tip can say:
Firing weapons with more than 30 damage total in less than 0.5 seconds will inflict heat penalties.

Patch Date - Thursday Oct. 25th @ 10AM – 1:30PM PDT
 
UPDATE
 
Another push towards Open Beta and we’ve been very busy.
 
Not only are there numerous fixes and improvements on existing systems, we’ve also added the Cicada (CDA) to the BattleMech lineup as well as 3 more variants of existing Mechs.  On top of all of that, we’ve added new upgrades.  Ferro Fibrous armor, Endo-Steel Internal Structure and Double Heat Sinks are now in the game!
 
Ferro Fibrous armor is going to give you a bit more survivability on the battlefield; it is a little lighter, but at the cost of critical space.  Endo-Steel Internal Structure frees up tonnage on your Mech at the cost of critical space.  This is an advantage for the heavier Mechs in the Mech line-up.  Double Heat Sinks will double the heat dissipation at the same tonnage cost, but take up 3 times the amount of critical space.
 
To accommodate these new additions in MechLab, there is a new flow that has been introduced in terms of interface.  Check out the new tabs just under the MechLab tab when you enter.  While you’re here, you may also want to check in on your PilotLab Modules.  There’s a new module there that will give you a new aiming system to play with.  Just remember, you press “V” to activate it.
 
We've also made changes to the economy of the game.  Firstly, we standardized MC to C-Bill pricing. Secondly, we've lowered engine prices and item prices have been increased. This all adds up to, Mech costs being the sum of it's parts.  While it doesn't follow the canon pricing, it is close.
 
Pretty Graph
 
Graph of Mech Prices, from Light to Assault
 
As you can see, the average MC cost now (green line), is much lower than previous (dashed red line).  Now, you get more value for your MC, as an Atlas AS7-D, for example, is not the same cost as an Atlas AS7-K. This helps reflect the fact that many variants have more sophisticated equipment, and thus are worth more. So to sum up: Average MC cost for Mechs is much lower, and there are spikes in MC cost for Mechs with advanced equipment.
 
The rest of the changes are in the patch notes below and we hope to see you take advantage of the new features in combat.  Now get out there and pop a Jenner!
 
P.S. Those of you who have purchased the December issue of PC Gamer will now have your Mech Skin and Coconut Monkey Bobblehead!

    Engines with a rating of 275 or greater can contain one or more heat sinks inside of them without taking up critical slots.
    There is now a mechanism to add/remove these heat sinks (previously these heat sinks were fixed within the engine). The number of spots available and the number of spots taken are shown in the equipped engine
    When removing an engine, any heat sinks within the engine are also removed
    The number of heat sinks the engine is capable of holding is the same regardless of whether the ‘Mech uses single or double heat sinks

New Upgrades tab - upgrades are options that affect the ‘Mech as a whole, there are currently three upgrade types to choose from:
 

    Armor (currently selectable are Standard and Ferro-Fibrous)
    Changing your armor type automatically replaces all of your armor with the new type
    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price for the conversion (based on max tonnage of the ‘Mech) plus the cost of whatever armor of the new type you need to buy. Having an amount of armor of the proper type in your inventory will therefore reduce the cost of the upgrade
    Armor types other than Standard take up critical slots (14 for Ferro-Fibrous). These slots will be floating (see below)

Structure (currently selectable are Standard and Endo-Steel)
 

    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price based on max tonnage of the ‘Mech
    Structure affects tonnage of the ‘Mech (Endo-Steel is lighter)
    Armor types other than Standard take up critical slots (14 for Endo-Steel). These slots will be floating (see below)

Heat sinks (select between single and double)

    Selects whether your ‘Mech may use single or double heat sinks. Only one type of heat sink may be used on a ‘Mech at a time
    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price
    Engines are also automatically upgraded to double the heat sink capability
    When heat sink type is changed, all heat sinks are removed from the ‘Mech and new heat sinks of the proper type must be installed (and bought if necessary)

Floating slots

    Some upgrades take up critical slots. These slots are auto-flowed into available empty slots
    If a floating slot appears in white, other items can be dragged on to it and it will be moved to an available slot somewhere else on the ‘Mech
    If a floating slot appears in yellow, then there is no open empty slot that it can be moved to and so can not be used for other items
    Floating slots are ignored in the critical hit system

GAMEPLAY

    Running into another Mech will no longer knock it down.
    Line of sight check now higher on Mech so targeting can occur when only 25% of the mech is visible over a hill instead of 50% 
    Explosions explode on the surface of the water and spawn water explosion effects 
    AC/Gauss/PPC type weapons now pass through water and deal a reduced amount of damage depending on depth of the hit 
    Laser water hit effects spawn at the correct location on the surface of the water and deal a reduced amount of damage depending on depth of the hit
    Added Picture in Picture Zoom module. (Default mapped key for advanced zoom is 'V')
    Added Current active Vision mode status in HUD
    Extend range finder to 2500m( was 1500m )
    Cockpit light will now flicker after taking hard hits

MOVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS:

    Animation shaking under various circumstances
    ‘smoother’ jump jetting behavior
    Weapon hit detection more in-line with where you see the mech on your screen (don’t have to shoot infront of your mech so much) especially at lower frame rates were the problem was the worst.

BUG FIXES

    Two AMS on a Mech (AS7-K) now correctly destroy double the missiles
    PPC’s will no longer cross at extreme ranges
    Players are no longer able to zoom or change vision modes when a Mech is shut down  
    Zoom and Vision modes are tuned off when a Mech shuts down
    Target hit indication for missiles now correctly only goes off when explosion damage is dealt 
    Users can no longer specify an FOV less than 60.0 degrees in the user.cfg

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

How it would work:

This game mode or ladder would be separate from the mainstream MWO game modes and CW.  You would not need to modify any of the mechs you own.  You would simply choose one, and it would load its ""stock"" config.

What I like about this is how it would create a unique playing experience which would reward piloting skills over the variety of custom builds.  It would act as a level playing field between everyone using stock mechs.

Praise Summary: Great deal, especially for those who missed Founder's packages, support for MWO, and some people like the old mechs.

Hate Summary: Cash grab by the company for more money, they don't fix bugs, they squandered the founders' money or it went to the publisher for other projects and not the developers for MWO.

I've been playing for the past few months and do enjoy blowing up other mechs (even purchased a Flame and Ilya), but am dismayed at the potential cost associated with playing (yes I realize you can play for free).  At the moment the game is little more than Team Deathmatch/Capture and Hold, but its price can far exceed $60 games of comparable value.  Coupled with rumors that this game may not survive, I'm a little hesitant about whether I should continue or not.

I do believe in paying for games, but the amount of content you get for $60 in MWO is nowhere near the amount of content you get from $60 in something like Guild Wars 2...

**Edit:** I meant to evoke thoughtful (and hopefully civilized!) discussion about the virtues vs vices of MWO, not whine or complain about prices.  I haven't been around since the game started, so have developers been listening to players?  Are they good stewards of the money the founders have given them?

&gt;So as most of you are aware yesterday’s rollout of Matchmaking Phase 3 ran into a couple of issues:

&gt;* The lone wolf queue time was too long
* 8 man groups were incorrectly mixing with lone wolf players

&gt;These have both been confirmed to be bugs, both have now been found and addressed. We were using the right scale of internal data to test the match maker but the pattern encountered on live was not anticipated, with the telemetry from the time ELO was enabled yesterday on production both issues were reproduced and solved. These issues had nothing to do with player pool size.

&gt;This confirms a well-known maxim that there is no perfect substitute for live data, we have been working internally towards addressing this by opening up public tests during our staging process and we will likely accelerate these plans to ensure we’re getting better scale testing for future patches.

&gt;For those of you that experienced ELO briefly yesterday we know you had a great time, the changes are now back in test and we hope to have ELO back up and running sometime later today if both issues clear testing, to get everyone experiencing the quality of matches we had for a while yesterday.

&gt;Thanks for your patience while we work to resolve these issues.

&gt;Testing confirms both issues are resolved servers are coming down at 2:30pm PST to turn ELO back on. ",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,EXP,True,t3_18wy08,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/18wy08/elo_being_reintroduced_to_the_game/,

I'm running a K2 with four Small lasers and twin AC/10s. My entire team is dead, and I'm facing down two Dragons and a Jenner. I had been firing deadly accurate all round, but my side torsos are nearly stripped of armor, threatening to expose the fragile XL 300 powering my 'mech. Plunging south into the river and under the central bridge, I spot one of the Dragons to my left from about 400-500m away. In Heat Vision Mode, he is lit up like a Christmas tree. Unseen, I open fire as I cut toward him at a diagonal angle, throttle wide open. His torso can't withstand eight AC/10-class HEAP rounds.

I turn around and head northwest down the river toward Gamma Point. A lone Jenner rushes into view, heat signature barely visible above the water's surface. I calmly deposit four slugs into its torso before running past, leaving the pilot to drown.

My HUD indicators begin to flash. Gamma is being captured, but I am already on course. I ascend the riverbank and round a corner. The last Flame stands on the capture point, facing away from me. I open fire. He runs down an alley between a concrete wall and a row of shipping containers, but a tower blocks the other end. He is trapped, and I block his only exit. It takes only two Alpha Strikes to extinguish the Flame.

The round ends, leaving me with five kills, two assists, 1,175 XP, and a pounding heart.

I'll spare you guys the snarky tone, but here is something I whipped up after cracking and seeing one too many 'OMG I DIED IN 1 SHOT, HAX!' threads on the forums, as well as in game.  AC20 cats and multi-PPC builds are dirt common in this game now, and there are TONS of ways to die in 40 damage or less.

here's the list:

Key: 

* Dual Gauss, Dual AC20 or Triple/Quad/Hex-PPC (xxx) 
* Dual AC20 or Quad-PPC (xx) 
* Hex-PPC only (x)

NOTE: this list doesnt include lasers or missiles as they are not 'instant kill' in the case of lasers, and are not consistently single-component targetable in the case of missiles, even though its perfectly normal to kill in a single salvo while using them (4P, A1, etc)

ANY MECH IN THE GAME: Headshot (xx) (~33 HP)

Commando: 

* CT front - 24 armour, 16 structure - 40HP total (xx) 
* CT rear - 8 armour, 16 structure - 24HP total (xxx) 
* ST front (XL) - 16 armour, 12 structure - 28HP total (xxx) 
* ST rear (XL) - 8 armour, 12 structure - 24HP total (xxx)

Spider: 

* CT front - 30 armour, 20 structure - 50HP total (x) 
* CT rear - 10 armour, 20 structure - 30HP total (xx) 
* ST front (XL) - 21 armour, 14 structure - 35HP total (xx) 
* ST rear (XL) - 7 armour, 14 structure - 21 HP total (xxx)

Jenner/Raven: 

* CT front - 33 armour, 22 structure - 55HP total (x) 
* CT rear - 11 armour, 22 structure - 33HP total (xx) 
* ST front (XL) - 24 armour, 16 structure - 40HP total (xx) 
* ST rear (XL) - 8 armour, 16 structure - 24HP total (xxx)

Cicada: 

* CT front - 36 armour, 24 structure - 60HP total (x) 
* CT rear - 12 armour, 24 structure - 36HP total (xx) 
* ST front (XL) - 30 armour, 20 structure - 50HP total (x) 
* ST rear (XL) - 10 armour, 20 structure - 30HP total (xxx)

Centurion/Hunchback: 

* CT front - 48 armour, 32 structure - 80HP total - None. (i.e, you must generally be this heavy to not be CT front one-shottable) 
* CT rear - 16 armour, 32 structure - 48HP total (x) 
* ST front (XL) - 36 armour, 24 structure - 60 total (x) 
* ST rear (XL) - 12 armour, 24 structure - 36 total (xx)

Dragon: 

* CT rear - 20 armour, 40 structure - 60HP total (x) 
* ST front (XL) - 42 armour, 28 structure - 70HP total - None (this is the size where a single-shot front side kill stops happening) 
* ST rear (XL) - 14 armour, 28 structure - 42HP total (x)

Catapult: 

* CT rear - 21 armour, 42 structure - 63HP total - None (no more single rear CT deaths)
* ST rear (XL) - 15 armour, 30 structure - 45HP total (x)

This assumes 3:1 armour, and structure at 50% of max armour HP, which may be slightly innaccurate, so some of the 30HP and 40HP killshots may not work, but the message is the same.  Once the netcode/hit detection more accurately represents people's aim, light and medium mechs are going to be getting one-shotted - A LOT.

What a huge improvement!,qwortec,31,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1i7sgo/finally_played_with_the_new_terrain_mechanics/,"I played two or three games when the last patch went live but haven't really touched it since then.  Last night me and a friend hopped on and went tanking around in Stalkers.  I didn't see many people talking about the changes on here in any significant way so I just assumed it was a minor thing.  I have to say that I was surprised by how much of an improvement the terrain mechanics have made in gameplay.

In some places it's subtle but the games we played last night (~8-10) were all much more dynamic than prior to the changes.  We had to put much more thought into how to move, where the enemy was and their lines of approach, where our teamates were set up, etc. This led to some great ambushes (seismic is still a problem though) and some awesome use of drawing people into tunnels and off of high terrain (the river and bridge in Forest colony is actually tactical now).  

I can't wait to see how this gets evolved as they tweak it and when brawlers/mediums/lights finally make a comeback.

&gt; `Mech of the Month - Quickdraw (18th)

The [Quickdraw is a 60 tonner](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Quickdraw), which focuses on Lasers and Missiles.  Canon variants (shamelessly stolen from sarna):

* QKD-4G - The only long-range weapon carried onboard the Quickdraw is a Delta Dart LRM-10 launcher, giving the 'Mech some long range damage capabilities. For close range combat, the Quickdraw carries four Omicron 4000 Medium Lasers, two of which are rear-mounted and the other two (in the arms) giving it respectable close range firepower. Additionally, to capitalize on any weak points in an enemy's armor, the Quickdraw carries a Hovertec Quad SRM-4 launcher.

* QKD-C - The C is a modified version of the 5K Quickdraw. The 'Mech has had a Medium Laser removed and replaced with a C3 slave unit, to allow it to work in C3 lances. BV (1.0) = 1,124[7], BV (2.0) = 1,225

* QKD-4H - In an attempt to bring more direct firepower to the 'Mech, the 4H moves the SRM-4 launcher into the rear arc and moves the two rear-facing Medium Lasers into forward firing mounts. Otherwise, the 4H is identical to the 4G model. BV (1.0) = 1,006, BV (2.0) = 1,242[9]

* QKD-5A - The 5A makes the Quickdraw a more effective close combat 'Mech. The LRM-10 launcher has been removed and in its place two more forward-firing Medium Lasers have been added, as well as extra heat sinks to help compensate for the increased heat load. BV (1.0) = 1,070, BV (2.0) = 1,196

* QKD-5K - The 5K Quickdraw is upgraded using Star League technology. The 'Mech carries the same weaponry as the 5A model. The heat sinks have been upgraded to double heat sinks and the armor carried is Ferro-Fibrous armor, giving the 5K superior armor protection to the 5A model, with no added weight. BV (1.0) = 1,170, BV (2.0) = 1,265

* QKD-5M - Another basic upgrade of the Quickdraw utilizing Star League technology, the 5M replaces the SRM-4 launcher with a one-shot Hovertec SRM-4 Launcher. The armor has been upgraded to Kallon FWL Special Ferro-Fibrous and the 'Mech uses double heat sinks for better heat dissipation capabilities. The 'Mech has also had CASE added to protect against ammunition explosions. BV (1.0) = 1,142, BV (2.0) = 1,237

* QKD-5Mr - This version uses ER Medium Lasers in the arms, adds a Guardian ECM Suite, a Targeting Computer, and an Artemis IV FCS. To make room for this new equipment, engineers removed a heat sink and the one-shot missile launcher.[12] BV (2.0) = 1,465

* QKD-8K - The 8K variant of the Quickdraw brings it up to 3062 weapons standards. The 'Mech is built using an Endo Steel chassis and is armored with eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The 'Mech's arsenal has been stripped and upgraded. The 8K Quickdraw has four forward mounted ER Medium Lasers and also carries an MRM-30 launcher, as a compromise between the LRMs and SRMs of past models.[14][15][16] BV (1.0) = 1,375[17], BV (2.0) = 1,583

* QKD-8P - The -8P is based on the experimental -8X. The major differences are the removal of the Stealth Armor and the Head Turret. This reduces production costs considerably, but leaves the head mounted PPC unable to cover the Quickdraw's retreat. The other advanced systems, including the Torso Mounted Cockpit, remain. The 8P also uses the same handheld weapons as the 8X. BV (2.0) = 1,598

I hope that we see the QKD-C as our first Heavy mech to implement ECM.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1370372136.0,,EXP,True,t3_1fo0e6,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1fo0e6/new_mech_announced_quickdraw/,

Basically its a big pod full of coolant (no kidding!).  One of the draw backs is that it is fragile.

I'm fine with the MC cost, but it's reasonable to expect that they would require space on a mech, and would be very fragile.

It would be fun if you could damage a coolant pod, see the coolant coming off a mech because you damaged the tank.  Then when used, they get a reduced bonus.

I was delighted to discover them myself, and thought you all would like to know.

I will also start by saying, despite the fact that I've found advantages for the other four Stalker variants, I cannot find any quirk or advantage to using the 4N. I also don't want to spend 7.5million on finding out, so if anyone has one or knows what the advantage is, please do post it and I'll edit to include it.

**Stalker 3F:** Highest torso twist of any Stalker(85 degrees, all others have 60). Best brawler.

**Stalker 3H:** The arm-mounted missile hardpoints have 20 tubes, all other stalkers have 10. This gives it an advantage when trying to front-load LRM damage, because you can fire up to 52 LRMs as a single burst. Other variants can fire at most 32 in a single burst. Arguably the best LRM-boat, depending on style.

**Stalker 4N:** ?

**Stalker 5M:** 5 missile slots, more than any other variant, but one is a NARC launcher. This means missiles come out one at a time. Hilarious to put an LRM 20 in(runs down AMS ammo and keeps ""INCOMING MISSILE"" warning up for longer than otherwise), or good pinpoint accuracy with a single SRM6, but mostly only useful for an SSRM2 or NARC. The 5th energy slot is in the CT, meaning no PPC's, but it lets you have a backup weapon when you've lost both your side torsos.

And I would appreciate your help! Right now, I am currently testing the Heat Generation mechanic in MWO. Not just one weapon. ALL weapons! You can see why I might need a little help here. Here's what I need from you:

* Number of Heat Sinks (total number of Singles, or number of Engine HS plus added HS for Doubles. Note: For engines larger than 275, you can put Heat Sinks into the engine. These count as ""Added"" Heat Sinks, as they will be 1.4x cooling, opposed to the 2x cooling found in the 10 HS built into the engine)

* If you are running ""Cool Run"" or ""Heat Containment"" Efficiencies, as well as if you have Elite or Master bonus as well (all of Elite or Master unlocked for that mech)

Now, it would be easier for you if you just sent a video of yourself testing the following:

* Firing a Single Weapon, multiple times, waiting a couple seconds after returning to 0% (or lowest percentile in Caustic) between shots. Single Fire weapons are the most effective in determining how heat generation works (e.g. All Ballistic weapons, All Missile Weapons, PPC or ERPPC. All Lasers generate and dissipate heat at the same time, so someone with 10 Heat Sinks will see a different percentage after firing a Medium Laser compared with someone with 20 Heat Sinks, or 10 Heat Sinks with Cool Run, or 10 Heat Sinks with Heat Containment....)

* Running at full throttle, without firing any weapons

I will post a youtube video demonstrating exactly what I'm looking for shortly, but the more data that I can gather, the better! For those who don't have any video capture software (Fraps for free can collect 30 seconds of footage, but I don't know if the quality is such that you can distinguish what weapons you're firing/ what percentage the heat scale rises to) you can just tell me what set up you're running (Heat sink numbers, efficiencies), What percentage you see when running without firing weapons, and what map you are on (be sure to tell me the base-line number as well for Caustic).

If all goes well, I can make conclusive statements on the Heat Generation of Lasers, as well as the efficiencies of maps as well. Not only that, but I will be able to give a calculation of how the game treats the ""Idle Heat"" of your engine. Unlike CBT, engines in MWO generate a nominal value of heat (which is why you see a non-zero percentage in Caustic valley, or in the crater).

Thanks for all of your help! See you on the Battlefield!

1375888663.0,25,self.mwo,1jvyi9,A PUGer's thoughts on 12v12 so far.,Mikae1300,31,6,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1jvyi9/a_pugers_thoughts_on_12v12_so_far/,"I'm a PUG player that usually keeps her thoughts to herself so far about this game in general. I try to keep level headed about whatever updates PGI makes, and I'll try to do so for this post that I make. I kind of wanted to jump in on this topic because a) it's early and I think everyone is still in shock with 12v12 being implemented, and b) I find the 12v12 update game-changing enough for me to actually get involved in discussing it. I spent about 5 hours playing last night, so I think I've got a feel for PUG matches with 12v12 thus far.

1. Lance drops need to spread out. I've seen a lot of other users mention this as well. It's really bothersome to have a bunch of medium mechs surrounding me and making it difficult for my big-ass Quickdraw to move around properly. Also, the moving blob of death just kills any sense of strategy in a PUG match. I would say this is my only true complaint about 12v12 thus far, and probably the most pressing issue that needs to be dealt with.

2. A snipping or brawling match seems to be determined by map size. It took me a little bit to figure out why some matches I played last night evolved into sniping/lrm battles, while others got down to decent brawls. Smaller maps, such as Forest Colony, Frozen City, and River City tended to turn into brawling matches. Obviously, this seems to be because there's so many mechs on the map now that you have to fight in close quarters on these small maps. Whereas big maps like Alpine and Mordor (Tera Therma) turned into sniping/lrm matches due to the distance between mechs. Canyon and Tourmaline seem to be a mixture of the two types of maps, especially Canyon. On those two maps, there seemed to balanced brawling and long-range combat. The question now is how PGI will balance out these maps--or if they will balance out these maps. Personally, as a brawler, I'm biased towards maps allowing for more brawling opportunities.

3. LRM have become popular due to quantity, not quality. I noticed way more lrm boats in the game now. I wouldn't put things on par with the lrmpocalypse, but lrm has become an interesting conundrum I feel. LRMs haven't become more powerful or need to be nerfed or anything like that, rather you're getting 4,5, maybe even 6 lrm boats in a team now. So, all of a sudden, you're getting a constant stream of lrm that the targeted mech simply has no way of escape from. A particular example was a match I had last night on Alpine. I was piloting my Quickdraw and peeked my head above the ridge, and then I was punished for almost nearly 20 seconds worth of an lrm barrage that I couldn't get away from--stripping me of my armor before the match had really begun. I think this is an issue PGI didn't think of for 12v12, or perhaps ghost heat was an early way to address an lrm boat army. I'll suggest another possible solution in the next point.

4. Armor or internals should maybe made stronger now. Along with lrm barrages, there's the issue of 5 or 6 mechs alpha striking at a targeted mech at once, which pretty much guarantees at least a 2-3 hit KO on any but the most heavily armored mechs. There's a lot of peeking and shooting happening on the large maps, and I think a lot of it is due to no one being able to move out from under cover because they'll be blown to pieces in a few seconds. Increased armor damage could be a solution for this if players know they can survive more hits to flank around sniping mechs and brawl them. I know this is something that has been talked about for awhile, and it may be time for it to actually happen.

Anyways, that's my 2 cents worth on the topic. I'll shut up now, lol.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,,True,t3_1jvyi9,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1jvyi9/a_pugers_thoughts_on_12v12_so_far/,

He gave his input regarding the Town Hall Event and then noted comments made by many about the lack of competitive support for MechWarrior Online.

Which brings me to the subject of this thread. Here, I want us to collectively (as a community) put all competitive information (well, info about competitive support) released by PGI. I think it would clear a lot up if we could get statements from Ask the Devs, Podcasts, Streams, Command Chair Posts, Creative Director Updates, etc.

Even if it isn't much, I'm sure we could all benefit from some sort of clarity. Here are a few thoughts of mine:

1. To the competitive players leaving the game because of a lack of competitive support, I disagree with you. This game is still in UI 1.0., and PGI has said the current UI doesn't support team play/tournaments but UI 2.0 will. I am also pretty sure UI 2.0 will support pregame lobbies and spectating. Which brings me to #2

2. The end game is definitely player/community run tournaments and leagues at the moment. These exist in majority of competitive games because the developers of the game did not organize the competitive play. They might have allowed in game features (lobbies, private servers, etc) to support competitor play, but in many games these things have been player-run and organized.

This is where I think PGI will differ. If I remember correctly, they've stated somewhere that they can't/won't offer too much support to external tournaments because they plan to do the same things with UI 2.0. Will it be satisfactory? We don't know yet. We also don't have private servers or lobbies at the moment, so hopefully whatever they provide us with is sufficient.

3. Regarding competitive player input, I do feel its important to keep in touch with a competitive player-base. While the impatient, more-entitled-feeling ones might complain about the lack of lobbies (when MWO is a f2p, beta game that still has features like a lobby in development) competitive players do have great input regarding weapon balance and gameplay. This however, does not mean PGI should only take input from competitive players. Casual players matter as well.

So, that being said, lets centralize and discuss all the competitive info released by PGI. I don't personally think this game is in as bad a state as the mittani.com/word of Lowtax has made it seem lately, but that does not mean the game is perfect, either. While PPCs and SRMs are being adjusted, other weapons such as the Large Pulse lasers and Streaks need to be reviewed again. 

**edit:** just got home from work, I'm going to begin putting everything said by PGI regarding competitive play below this line. If you read it, make sure to post it and I'll add! Also, I am really excited about all the feedback this thread got. There are a lot of detailed discussions going on and I'm glad important information can be spread without a hostile argument.

======================

1. Regarding tournaments and leagues: Ask the Devs 034 - March 22, 2013[1]

grayson marik: You said, ""Private matches will be implemented, but not in a way players are probably thinking. We are still working out ways to make this feasible. No ETA."" Have we ( the other league/tournament creators and me) wasted our time creating the stuff we created?

A: We plan to create and host a variety of tournaments, challenges, and official MWO league. At this time we are not sanctioning or encouraging players to create independent leagues.

So let's do this again.

Here's a list of the mechs PGI has to choose from. All of these mechs are timeline-appropriate, not tied up with Harmony Gold IP, and don't use any technology that isn't planned to be added to MWO (like quads, LAMs, etc.) I've added a bunch of stuff I've unearthed since last month, plus some of the new ex-Unseen (even though we won't see those until 2014).

Why isn't your favorite mech listed?

* It's based on concept art now owned by Harmony Gold in North America. A number of mechs are based on designs that were later used in Macross, so any mech that looks like a VF, Destroid, or Zentraedi Battle Pod is out. No Wasp, Crusader, Warhammer, Marauder, and so on.
* It's a four-legged mech. PGI has said that they don't want to add these to MWO.
* It is introduced after 3052. In particular, Mechwarrior 3, Mechwarrior 4, and both Mechassault games are set well after the current period, and include many mechs that were invented as a response to the Clans, or to fight in later wars like the Fedcom Civil War or the Word of Blake Jihad. So no Owens, Templar, Fafnir, Bushwacker, etc.
* It's a Clan mech. PGI has enough on their plates right now without springing the Clans on us unexpected next month, a month before launch.
* I've skipped all of the TRO 3058 and 3075 mechs that are described as extinct in 3050, like the Lynx, Talon, Hammerhands, and Helepolis. There's a bunch of them, they're all goofy-looking, and nobody much likes most of them. It's possible that PGI could put them into MWO, but very unlikely.

    * Stacks with TAG but not Artemis.
    * Works through ECM.
    * Allows all friendly mechs to target enemy regardless of Line of Sight.

* **Artemis** - Adding Artemis will apply the following benefits.
    * Requires 1 slot and 1 ton per LRM or SRM launcher.
    * Does not apply to Streak launchers. (Bug: Currently targeting speed will improve on streaks if an Artemis enabled launcher of another type is present)
    * Enables new Missile cluster pattern (75% tighter?).
    * 25% bonus to LRM targeting speed.
    * Requires Line of Sight to target for LRM benefits to apply.

    * 25% bonus to acquiring target information details
    * Will cancel enemy ECM within 150m

* **ECM** - ECM provides the following benefits;
    * Prevents enemies from targeting ECM protected friendlies outside 200m.
    * Disrupts enemy targeting within 180m with partial / flickering display.
    * Prevents enemy sharing targeting data if enemy is under ECM.
    * Prevents all enemy missile lock acquisition under 180m.
    * Each ECM can counter any other one enemy ECM instead of providing bonuses.
    * Friendly ECM will be negated on an enemy PPC hit for 4 seconds.
    If the ECM carrier is hit, all ECM benefits are disabled for 4 seconds.
    Another hit will refresh this timer.

* **Command Console** - No current functionality.

* **AMS** - Equipped AMS will provide the following benefits;
    * AMS range is 200m.
    * AMS will prioritise on missiles aimed at you but will actively target enemy missiles passing within 90m.
    * AMS will only function as long as AMS ammo is available.
    * AMS does 2 damage per second, equating to roughly 4 LRM missiles shot down from each volley. Or 1-2 missiles per SRM volley at max range. 
    * Nearly ineffective on SRM's under 90m.

* **C.A.S.E** - CASE when equipped provides the following benefits;
    * CASE will prevent explosion damage from propagating to adjacent sections of your Mech.
    * CASE is only used after all other Hitpoints in that section have been destroyed. Therefore it does not prevent item or component destruction. 
    * For this reason, CASE does not assist with preventing XL engine destruction.
    * CASE itself has zero HP when determining item destruction and is therefore not a target itself for Critical hits.
    * Explosion damage prevented is from all internal sources such as Gauss and Ammo explosions. 
    * It does not prevent external sources such as splash or direct missile damage.
    * Currently, CASE can only be mounted in either side Torso.

* **Heat Sinks** - Heat sinks provide two functions. The first is to assist in dissipating the heat generated from weapons, movement and the environment. The third is to increase the total heat capacity available. 

    * Engine Heat Sinks
        * All engines are required to contain a minimum of 10 Heat Sinks to function. 
        * Engines below rating 250 are too small to contain all 10 Heat Sinks inside the engine, requiring the additional Heat Sinks to be installed elsewhere in the Mech.
        * The first 10 equipped of either type, no matter the location, count as Engine Heat Sinks.
        * A valid load out of 10 SHS starts with a base of 40 heat capacity, and 1 dissipation.
        * A valid load out of 10 DHS starts with a base of 50 heat capacity, and 2 dissipation.

    * Single Heat Sinks (in addition to the 10 Engine Heat Sinks)
        * Reduce heat at a rate of .1 per second
        * Cost 1T and 1 critical slot
        * Increase heat capacity by 1 point per Heat sink
    * Double Heat Sinks (in addition to the 10 Engine Heat Sinks)
        * Reduce heat at a rate of .14 per second
        * Cost 1T and 3 critical slots
        * Increase heat capacity by 1.4 points per Heat Sink

So that's what I've got so far, being aware that some items do reflect announced changes that are due in game over next few weeks (like NARC going through ECM). Please review as this is a Work in progress and help fill in the blanks! Thanks for your assistance.

**Change Log:** Updated Artemis to reflect NARC overwrite. Added C-Bill and XP rewards for most items. Changed format slightly to make rewards more obvious (swapped Italic to Bold, moved rewards to indent under descriptions etc). Changed Cap rewards to reflect lack of Conquest XP, and clarified they are rewarded only on capture related victories. Added Heat Sinks information.

**Still required:** Clarification on how Kills are computed. If you damage and kill an enemy, does the rewards for The Kill equal the total of the Kill Assist + Kill Bonus? Or does it award the separate Kill Bonus only, dropping your Assist total for that Mech? Also, values for Capture / Capture Assists. Also,  confirmation on maximum stacking values of TAG / NARC  / Artemis. Patch notes say 75%, however this can't be right as some systems provide this alone, even without stacking.

I was looking at the size and weight of 'Mechs and decided to do some calculations.  I thought the following was funny.

&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I think the current armor system is fine and I am not suggesting radical tweaks to it. I'm just a numbers guy and found the following pretty entertaining:
&gt;
&gt;Something a lot of people don't realize is that when you double the edge length of a 3D cube, you actually multiply its internal volume by 8 and its surface area by 4. It's actually, in a sense, eight times larger. There were a couple threads about this topic, but I didn't see any numbers. I wanted to apply this concept to the Atlas and Commando to see what this did to the 'Mech's armor thickness.
&gt;
&gt;Let's start with a human being, which is easily comparable to the Commando and Atlas since they both have the same profile. I used Wolfram Alpha for the median height and weight of a human:
&gt;
&gt;H = 1.74m
&gt;W= 79kg
&gt;
&gt;There are formulae out there for calculating volume and surface area of humans. These formulae should also apply to the Atlas and Commando since they have the same approximate shape. I applied them and got the following:
&gt;
&gt;V = 75.2L
&gt;SA = 1.94m^2
&gt;Density = 1.05kg/L (approximately as dense as water)
&gt;
&gt;So we have a baseline. 'Mechs, ideally, shouldn't be much more dense than humans, since they have a similar form of locomotion. Unlike tank treads, which spread out the weight of a tank, 'Mechs and humans apply all of their weight to a small area beneath their feet. If they were significantly more dense than humans they'd sink into soft ground much too easily to be effective war machines.
&gt;
&gt;The Atlas:
&gt;
&gt;W = 100 short tons ≈ 90700kg.
&gt;H ≈ 16m (from the sources I could find)
&gt;Therefore:
&gt;V ≈ 92000L
&gt;SA ≈ 193m^2
&gt;Density ≈ .98kg/L
&gt;
&gt;So the density is right on! An Atlas really is what you would get if you scaled a human up to 16m tall!
&gt;
&gt;So the Commando:
&gt;
&gt;W = 25 short tons ≈ 22700kg
&gt;H = 9m (official number)
&gt;V ≈ 23000L
&gt;SA ≈ 71m^2
&gt;Density ≈ .99kg/L
&gt;
&gt;Again, dead on. A commando is effectively a 9m tall human being, but made of metal, fusion reactor, and Streak SRMs.
&gt;
&gt;But hold on, let's talk about surface area and armor. After all, if you have more surface area, you need more armor to cover it, right? If you keep the same amount of armor and spread it out over more surface area, it gets thinner and easier to penetrate. Let's see if an Atlas really is that much tougher than a Commando.
&gt;
&gt;From looking at the game, we find that an Atlas can have up to 19 tons of armor. That's 19% of its weight. A Commando can have 5.5 tons of armor, which is 22% of its weight.
&gt;
&gt;So the Commando has 70.85kg of Armor per square meter.
&gt;The Atlas has 89.14kg of Armor per square meter.
&gt;
&gt;So even though it has 244% more armor by weight, the Atlas's armor is only 26% thicker!
&gt;
&gt;tl;dr Not much of the physics in this game make sense, so please don't ever use realism in your arguments about balance and the direction of the game.

http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/63434-dhs-were-looking-into-it/
&gt;You will hear back from us tomorrow. Everyone take a deep breath. 


A lot of people are doing great work in analysis of it.  
This post in particular intrigues me:  
http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/63408-we-have-derived-why-heat-sinks-are-not-working-as-ostensibly-intended/

&gt;After doing a lot of math and experimentation in the MechLab a team of friends and I have determined that heat sink efficiency degrades with a power law of SQRT[1/(16*x)] where x is the number of heat sinks. This is a very exact equation—meaning it must be completely intentional—that tests perfectly in practice. It means that each successive heat sinks adds less cooling power than the one before it.  

&gt;Because we figured out this relationship we realized that doubling the cooling power available increases heat bleed by 41.4% (or multiplying the cooling power by SQRT[2]). Therefore, switching from single heat sinks to double heat sinks offers only a 41.4% benefit rather than the 100% (i.e., doubling) benefit users expected. As a result, we are missing out on almost 60% of the expected cooling power.  

&gt;Furthermore, having charted this efficiency degradation, we determined that cooling abilities of greater than 20 are almost completely worthless compared with the ones before them. Each single heat sink after the 20th (or 10th, if you are using doubles) offers less than a 2.5% benefit to cooling. The diminishing returns mean that boating heat sinks is effectively useless.  

&gt;We imagine this implementation was derived in order to mitigate the effects of laserboats (which also tend to be heat sink boats). However, it has also broken a very important (and, in the case of double heat sinks, very expensive) part of the game: Generalized heat efficiency. It is nearly impossible to manage a 'Mech's expected heat capabilities when the cooling system is so unintuitive.  

&gt;It is our vehement suggestion that this system be thoroughly reexamined and revamped to more closely match a more rational heat system in which each additional heat sink is exactly as beneficial as the one before it.  

&gt;Please make sure the devs see this; I have also submitted a support ticket about this. My preliminary spreadsheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwW5mNHnakM8cFFOWVFOMzdqaUk/edit). I will expand the spreadsheet (and add labels and such) as well as elaborate on these hard data tomorrow as I really need to get to sleep.

It's bad when you need to make quick reactions for short cursor distance as the faster you move, the further you travel.

ie. You need to move half an inch really fast, but if you move too fast the mouse enhancement will try to adjust and you fly like 3 inches too far.

You will get used to it pretty fast if you have not changed your settings yet.


You need stability. The ratio from your hand movement to you cursor movement must always be the same regardless of the speed you move your hand. Well that's if you want consistent accuracy. Enhanced precision basically makes it so the faster you move, the faster the cursor accelerates. It's best to keep this accel speed constant no matter how fast you move the mouse.

Test it. With it on move your mouse 3 inches on the desk quickly then slowly. The distances traveled between the two will be different. With precision off it wlll remain the same distance no matter the speed the mouse is moved.



P.S. By the way MWO is so much more fun now with 12 people! Thanks paul for the awesome patch, but don't get lazy now, lots of work ahead! (We litteraly need an Awesome patch for the Awesome :p...

So I read some forum posts, watched some youtube videos, and all my rookie matches ended with me at the bottom of the score sheet after getting smashed almost immediately. 

The rookie videos emphasize the mechanics of the crosshair and turning your torso separately from your feet, which is important to understand, but it seems like positioning (behind cover, with a group) is much more important than circle strafing. Am I wrong?

It also seems like coordinating as a group is incredibly important... but there's no in game voice chat and I only occasionally see people type any text. So is there some general strategy that everyone else is sticking to that I should know? Are successful pub players playing in a group they can voice chat with through another app?

Here is what it says (continued in comments due to post-size limits)

----

## 3PV ##

Vasces Diablo: Is it possible to rename the view modes? Specifically ""Training"" for 3PV and ""Normal"" for 1PV. It's semantics, true, but a portion of the community feels it's an important distinction. 1st person has been the ""normal"" view in earlier titles and it would create an indication to new players to that effect.

A: If you are referring to Normal and Hardcore descriptors for the matchmaking buckets, these are not final yet.  Training and Normal would not work as this would imply an offline mode for 3PV which is not the case.  3PV is not only a great way for new players to learn to play the game, it&amp;#8217;s actually a really fun way to play the game!  Our early play tests have resulted in some interesting observations as hardcore 1PV proponents have taken a step back and seen the value and fun in 3PV.  I expect once the 3PV view mode hits the Test Servers in the next 30 days, players will find it not as powerful as feared or as intrusive into the existing experience, rather accept it as an extension.  Of course as promised out of the gates players will be able to choose 1PV and 3PV mixed or just 1PV.

 

## Community Warfare/Clans ##

 

I&amp;#8217;m holding off answering questions for now, as we near a more official post.

 

## UI 2.0  ##

Seth: Will the reticule get an update with UI2.0? At close range, it's perfectly fine, but when you zoom in, the reticle stays the same size and is quite large compared to a long range target. I'm hoping for a target reticle that gets smaller the more you zoom in.

A: UI 2.0 addresses the Front End experience (FE), so all the menus up to the and including the launch menu.  After launch we plan to work on a new HUD experience.

 

Crimson Fenris: When could we expect to finally see more user-friendly communication systems, like integrated VoIP, or a command wheel (like the one in the Battlefield series) ?

A: No firm dates, we have a concept ready when the team has some free time after launch.

 

Flying Fox 333: Previously you mentioned that this was under consideration still, has there been any decision regarding storing Mech builds for each chassis in UI 2.0?

A: Yes, no decisions have been made either way yet.

 

## `Mech's and Mechlab ##

Adridos: A question for Alex and the art team: How do you determine the proportions of certain mechs which don't have any canonical references to such traits?

A: Dennis (Art Director) works to set the appropriate scales.  We have min-max heights for most weight classes, with some exceptions as canon dictate.

 

hawk819: With the Clan Weapons just announced in the last Ask the Devs, I (and maybe a thousand others) want to know: What will become of the OmniMechs? Mad Cat? Vulture? etc.

A: They will show up in the future at some point.

 

Littlelifter: Dear devs, here is my question: Why some mechs have true size of cockpit hitbox (all cockpit windows counts like a cockpit hitbox), and some mechs have false size of cockpit hitbox (only few or one window counts like a cockpit hitbox, rest windows counts like center torso hitbox)?

A: We&amp;#8217;re working on an art pass right now to correct any oddities.

 

mailin: Is there any way to add a feature to the in game friends list so that we can see when the last time our friends logged on? My list is huge, and I would like to possibly delete some inactive players, but I don't know necessarily who they are

A: It&amp;#8217;s a feature you can expect to see once UI 2.0 is out.

 

Strum Wealh: What are the plans and attitudes of PGI with regard to the in-game availability (or lack thereof) of certain BattleMechs (or individual variants thereof) that, in BattleTech, are generally or wholly restricted to specific organizations/units (such as the Hoplite not being produced at all in the Inner Sphere, and neither it nor the Annihilator not being available outside of the Wolf's Dragoons)?

A: You will however see some of this come into player through price adjustments based on faction availability in a future game update.

 

Gallowglas: I know this is getting WAY ahead of things, but it's an idle curiosity. If, at some point, you guys manage to get all the mechs into the game, would you consider adding your own designs to the existing canon? Are you allowed to do that with your license agreement? Would that be heresy? I know there's a certain group which would want to stone me for even suggesting this, but let's face it...a LOT of the designs beyond the Unseen were pretty hideous. Alex just happens to have a knack for pimping uncool mechs into something cool. I'd love to see what he could come up with unfettered by design constraints.

A: Yes.  We have plans to make our own designs at some point, however as you mentioned, we have a ways to go yet before the best mechs have been released.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CR2,True,t3_1h9tpt,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1h9tpt/ask_the_devs_41_answers/,

They are considering increasing internals health in such a way that just having armor removes doesn't mean that that part is as good as gone. Unless you are using high crit weapons (by way of the crit mechanic) In other words this should help slow down the fights and make torso twisting when armor is stripped much more important. It will also boost the usefulness if multi-strike weapons like lasers, shotguns, srms, and machine guns!

I think if done right this could be a very good idea coupled with high alpha reductions and weight caps (other changes incoming). IMO the game currently allows a fight to end WAY too fast.

Greetings MechWarriors!

And… we’re back!  We hope everyone had a safe and fun holiday season full of BattleMech Combat. The content of this patch was work that was started shortly before the holiday break and there was a focus on getting some quality fixes and improvements. We wanted to start the New Year on the right - giant metallic stomping - foot so to speak!

Included in the patch are movement fixes, animation fixes, and some rewards for using equipment Like NARC, because everybody loves NARC right? There are more fixes in there as well so read on.

Most importantly we want you guys to know how excited we are.  We have been plotting out this year’s content and feature schedule and it’s going to be a big year.  Stick with us and you will be able to say “I remember when…”.   So strap in, initiate your start up sequence, and get ready to drop.

3050 is the year of MechWarrior Online.

 - Matt Newman


Conquest:

    - Changed it so you now get a resource every 1.7 seconds instead of 2 seconds.
    - Increased the reward for collected resources from 25 per resource to 50 per resource.

Performance:

    - More FPS improvements
      We have seen an increase in performance for the majority for all specs, however there maybe a handful of

     performance for all specs.

Gameplay:

    - XP and C-Bills Rewards for using TAG and NARC 
      This reward is given to pilots that are TAG/NARC'ing a hostile and that hostile takes damage from other 
     friendlies. Given once per hostile mech per match.  

Movement:

    - Reduced/improved snapping when jump jetting
    - Reduced/improved movement snapping in general
    - You should no longer need to fire ahead of where a mech powers down or shuts down in order to hit them

I disagreed with his premise and the vitriolic rhetoric contained in many of his responses, but as I was writing a reply I realized what my personal problems were with capping: it doesn't feel like it has any meaning whatsoever. It feels like you stand around and then you win the match for standing around the *fastest* somehow. What does my standing there have to do with the EPIC war happening in the galaxy? I don't know, and neither does anyone else. 

I understand that the mechanism to end a game aside from chasing a lone spider around the map while piloting an Atlas needs to exist, and I thought that we should share some ideas on what could be done to make capping **feel** more meaningful. 

Here are my initial ideas: 

* Make a destructible base that has a major consequence for the battlemechs on the field. It could be the LZ for the dropship that they need to get offworld, and with that destroyed those mechs are effectively stranded on the planet and taken out of the war. This would be a lot more fun than sitting around, and would actually make high DPS builds better at SOMETHING than pinpoint alphas (assuming the base has a lot of HP).

* Have the mechs ""capping"" actually be performing some function like hacking the station's computers. Maybe when you ""cap"" the base, the location data for all remaining enemy mechs is available to your team for some duration? What if it is a command tower, and when it is ""hacked"" the enemy mechs lose certain communication functions like minimap or shared targeting? These wouldn't end the match, but they would make for a nice tactical advantage and give capping a true purpose aside from ending the match quickly. 

These ideas are admittedly lacking in some respects because it is 2 AM, but I would love to hear what everyone else thinks are some simple-to-implement but **meaningful** tweaks to the capping mechanic that could change the way the game feels.

[For full disclosure: In ""Assault"" mode, I will cap the shit out of mofos who wander across the map in a lance of Highlanders and don't expect that to happen. I feel like the people I play with are good enough to know better.] ",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,default,True,t3_1jjtns,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1jjtns/making_capping_more_meaningful/,

It hasn't really done what it was intended to do, which is slow down time to kill (TTK) or make massive pinpoint damage less of a problem. Builds that were the biggest offenders of massive pinpoint damage (here's looking at you, 2 ERPPC 1 Gauss phract) get away scot free while many builds that were struggling to remain relevant are now banished to the parts heap in any sort of competitive play. I'd like to start a constructive conversation about how changes could be implemented to help reverse this stagnation of builds and obsolesce of many canonical and reasonable builds.

So my questions are: 

* Is there any sort of salvageable component to ghost heat?

* What are other possible means that have not been discussed in depth (so no reticule bloom unless it's a new and novel idea) to prevent massive pinpoint damage?

* Which weapons are being over-nerfed and which ones are under-nerfed?

* What is YOUR idea of a perfect solution to pinpoint damage weapon balancing?

What is a good beginner mech to choose from, and what's a decent kit? I like rockets and the lasers, haven't played with any AutoCannons yet. Thanks a bunch guys!


Edit: I looked at some mechs in the store and the Hunchback 4sp looks good. I don't know shit about it but the Shortrange+Laser combo looks like it fits my play style well. Would this be a decent beginner mech, and how would I go about getting it kitted up?

Nothing unusual, but I always like to take a stroll through the tunnel just in case.

I came across an ECM Raven followed by 5 other heavies/assaults.
Obviously, I ran like hell and alerted my team they were cave rushing.

My team all go in the cave and make pretty good work of them.

Then the remaining 2 mechs, a Cata and a Stalker, come in the cave from behind.  I get a couple shots in but die, then alerting my team that we were being flanked by 2 more mechs.

They then turn around and kill them, we win the match.

We would have been decimated if it wasn't for my tiny little TDK doing what a 149kps paper-thin mech does best, scouting.

What do I get when the match is over?  300xp for win, 30xp for damage.

No spotting bonuses, nothing else.

There has got to be a way to credit players who focus mostly on strategic placement/locating/scouting than damage/kills.

I thought spotting bonuses were supposed to help some, but I didn't even get that, so I'm guessing that mechanism isn't working correctly.

What do you guys think?  Is there a similar way to award strategy similar to that of NARCing/TAGging?

I hide behind a ridge for a few moments, while the two main forces get entangled in a proper battle, and then I run for the base again - still no good, a Cataphract-4X sees me and starts making for the base as well. I get there first and cap a few percent, and then we're in each others faces in the tight space of the northwestern base. I think he was a relatively new player, I don't think he even saw me after that, as I was able to stay behind him for the entire brawl - towards the end, he tries to run back to the main fight to get some assistance, and I take him down.

Back to the base, cap a fair bit more, and now two assaults are on me, a Stalker-5S and an Atlas-D-DC. I engage them for a few short blasts, they are pretty coordinated, and I figure I've tied up two assaults for a few minutes at the base, so I run to the main battle and join in - it's mostly over, our guys were getting wiped up, and by the time I get there, it's a Catapult-K2 versus my last remaining teammate, an one-armed Atlas - don't remember which one. I try to draw a few shots and get in the line of fire to soak up some damage, we end up taking it down. 

Now, head back to the base, still two assaults there - Stalker sitting on the base, Atlas coming out to meet us - I don't know if I made the right decision here, but I ran to the base, and tried to get a bit more capping in, while drawing fire from the Stalker. I end up playing ring-around the posy around the base/derrick thing with him, trying to stay behind him as much as I can. He starts to try and focus on my Atlas buddy, I sit behind him and blast away at his rear torso ... moments pass, my buddy goes down, and the match is all on me (adrenaline engaged!) I circle the stalker one more time, fire my piddly 10 damage alpha at his rear-quarters and BOOM! down he goes. By the time the Atlas gets to base, there is like, the tiniest bit left to be capped (if it was gasoline, there wouldn't be enough to fuel an ant's motorcycle to go around the inside of a cheerio). 

He is a yellow-armor-only Atlas, and I'm in a 37% health remaining Spider.  I circle around him as much as I can, there is about three minutes left, I'm taking damage, I see if I can draw him off, I go and hide for a moment. No dice, he sits on his base. Two minutes left now. I run back in, I'm circling him, jumping as much as I can, backing up to stay behind him, whatever I can do to bring down the behemoth. He has no back armor left, his CT is orange, and I'm down one arm, a side torso, and everything is yellow. The only armor I have left is on my RCT. So, I see his CT go red, and I maneuver in behind him again with my JJ, I swear this thing flies better than a UAV. I unleash my sling mid-flight, hit him full in the RCT - and land in some water-tower looking thing and become immediately stuck! FFFFUUUUU! I'm trying to get out frantically, steering this way and that, JJ'ing, nothing! He bears down on me, I face away, BLAM! there goes my last remaining armor, side torso, and arm - but I'm somehow blasted free! I'm sprinting at a forty-five degree angle to his approach, trying to get behind him and ... he lances my torso one more time with his LL's, and I go down. kerplut.

Teamates are crying in chat, I'm shaking from adrenaline. One teammate says ""fuckin' noob"". 

""GG guys!"", match ends, and I look at the screen. Then I jump up, cheering, and run around the house for a minute, dancing with my cats. **This game is frickin' fun!**

Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death. Stats are recorded.

Over 90% of the time we match up, when we don't we have a blast taking arena mechs against 8 mans. Once in a while we do homogenous drops. i.e. all PPC spiders or CN9-A zombies etc... One of the funniest ""missed-sync"" drops was all trial spiders! (we went 4-8)

So basically leave it up to the Hosts to manage the matches and rankings and you get to provide the carnage.

According to the recent Dev Answer post they are still on track for creating a set of seperate EU servers and making you make a one off decision as to which one you will play on. The EU server farm and the NA server farm will be isolated from each other and we will no longer be able to play with each other casually, in CW or in any future competitions such as RHOD.

It will have a massive strain on any unit and is the biggest threat to any units survival especially when you consider the move to 12 man matches. I had it in the back of my head I would maintain a second account but it's just not feasable and I also cannot commit to CW / tornie matchers based on NA time's from over in the UK. I can't believe they are doing it tbh it's a stupid idea.

Forget OP ECM, or weapon tweaks, SRM nerfs . . this is a real game breaker and we are going to have to make them reverse this decision.

I want to see them go back to the drawing board and wait until they can feasably deliver a cross continent game, building on what they have now rather than splitting the NA / EU communities.

I'm a harrier. A skirmisher.  A scout.  My job in an assault mode match boils down to three things.

1. Find the enemy, and tell my team.

2. Hit their home base and try to pull some of their mechs out of the fight, so our team has number superiority.

3. Fly through the enemy team at break neck speeds, and light them up--making them think I'm the threat, so they turn their focus away from the heavies/assaults for a moment, and give my team a chance to fire.

But here's the deal: The XP I get for spotting bonuses and assists on kill is paltry.

In a match where I get 8 assists, and a couple spot bonuses, I get around 500 xp.

Conversely, on my Cataphract,  who lands 4 killing blows. I get 700-800 XP.

Lights are penalized XP *for doing their job instead of trying to get killing blows* and it nerfs their XP gain.


XP gain either needs to be weighted to role (Like a Light Mech getting MORE xp per assist, or spot--because that's their job.) or we need another solution that allows Lights to progress as reasonably as other mechs while doing what they're suppose to.


Edit:

I just wanted to add that one XP bonus we *really* need to see in game is:  Getting points in for halting the enemy capturing  your base or node.  It should have a cap so it cannot be abused in matches...but to that little mech that launches himself at 4 mechs standing in his home base--delaying the count down so his teammates can get back and hopefully pull out a victory.

Not too long ago I went ahead and started messing with mediums, the Hunchback in particular.  At first I almost rage-quit playing the Mech, but after some careful reconsideration I've found it to be one of my most favorite Mechs.  

I started with the 4P, then the 4H, and finally the 4SP is what I'm on now, and unlike the other Chassis's I've mastered (Awesome, Stalker, Highlander) I've come to find that I think I'm going to have to keep all three of these Mechs around, when otherwise I normally only keep one variant that I get the master perk's for.  

Crazily enough I've managed more than a few games where I've had highest damage done for our team.  Playing the HBK I've had to completely re-learn how to play the game.  I have a Raven with the max engine, but I'm not too big a fan of the Light playstyle.  However I've really warmed up to running around in a Medium and learning how to strike. 

I think my favorite by far has to be the 4H with 3ML and an AC20.  It's not as fast as the other two, but that AC20 just makes it a blast to play.  Getting kills with it is always satisfying and I find the scrappy/brawler playstyle to be a lot of fun.

After I'm done the HBK I'm trying to think of what to go with Next. Ironically I've been tempted towards a Victor since I've already got a massive XL from my AWS-9M, which means I should go about as fast as my HBK but with a lot more weight/guns/armor - but I'm also a little tempted to try out another medium.

&gt; Updated [rules list] to include giving coordinates for AFK players as falling under Team Treason

&gt; Team Treason

&gt; Treasonous provision of information to enemy combatants, also known as ""bird-doging"" is forbidden. This involves a player using the in-game chat to provide the enemy team with the locations of their own team mates. While we appreciate that some players may wish to have a round end early by calling out the location of an AFK team-mate, the risk that this could be used against an active participant of the match to deny them the use of cover and movement makes this a form of a griefing. You may declare a teammate AFK but not their coordinates or position.

Does that seem a bit heavy-handed? In the over 3,000 matches logged since stat tracking began, I've only once seen someone actually commit something worthy of being called ""Team Treason"", namely giving the enemy information on a still-living teammate that was still playing. Yet there have been dozens of times where it's been helpful for the enemy team to provide the grid where their last teammate is AFK but didn't have the courtesy to disconnect or is hiding like a pussy to try to avoid a death stat, wasting everyone's time instead of playing the match.

Everyone hates that on both sides of the match, and is grateful for the assistance in ending the already-won match more quickly.

Any idea why they would add a common courtesy practice to the policy's forbidden list? They are specifically adding giving coordinates for AFK players to the existing griefing policy which already covered the actual problem scenarios, and that's just silly.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1372705559.0,,,True,t3_1hfaa5,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1hfaa5/providing_coordinates_for_afk_teammates_now/,

The motivation seems to be that cap wins are cheap or boring, and the game would be better without them. I can see where they are coming from, but here's the thing: The game would be worse without the possibility of capture wins.

Most games that have TDM modes also have respawns. Games which don't have respawns generally have some other victory condition besides ""kill everyone."" This is because trying to kill someone is risky - they'll try to kill you right back. If you are playing Quake 3, getting killed isn't really a big deal, you just spawn back in and look for someone else to fight. Yes, the enemy team is one point closer to victory, but that's only one point out of dozens or even hundreds.

If you are playing MWO, getting killed *is* a big deal. The enemy team is a whole 12.5% closer to victory, and more importantly, your game is over until the next round. So, in a mode where the only objective was to eliminate the enemy team, what is your incentive to go out and look for kills? The smart thing to do is to move to the most defensible position on the map, and camp there. Your aim is to maximise the number of kills you get, and minimise your own chance of being killed, which does not favour aggressive or risky play. 

Games which don't have respawns almost always need some objective other than killing the other team to prevent this problem. It's why counterstrike has hostages and bombs (there are server mods which remove these, but guess what they add instead? Respawns.) Adding an objective gives you a positive incentive to go out and achieve that, bringing you into contact with the enemy. You could just camp your own base, but since the bases are *not* the most defensible positions, this is usually a suboptimal strategy. So you need to head out towards the enemy base, and they will be heading towards yours, resulting in epic massive-robot-battles in the middle. 

So, why doesn't MWO have respawns? Well, would it really be fun if it did? Right now, killing an Atlas, or any 'mech for that matter, feels like a great accomplishment, striking a real blow for your team. Chances are, that kill cost you dearly in armour, ammo, or components. You might have barely limped away from the fight, but you won it, and the other team is down a 'mech. If that Atlas could just respawn at full health, then come find you and finish you off with a quick gauss volley, it would hardly even matter who'd won - you'd both have gained precisely one kill and one death.

Games with respawns don't normally have a high time-to-kill. Engagements are over in seconds, and the winner probably either took no damage, or is able to heal back to full health. A good kill is satisfying in Battlefield or COD, but it's really all about quantity, not quality. That's why we used to relish the announcer telling us we were **DOMINATING** or had a **MMMMMONSTER KILL**, but barely noticed the individual kill messages scroll past. The equivalent thrill in MWO is killing an enemy 'mech, watching it explode and collapse in a smoking heap (but we could really do with a word from Betty to go with it...)",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CR2,True,t3_1h7bip,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1h7bip/why_true_team_deathmatch_would_probably_suck/,

Besides the few house sponsored units (i think there was an all atlas unit from house davion?), I thought that the vast majority of mechs being fielded were mediums, with the rest being lights, heavies and then assaults (in order of increasing rarity).

And (this will be unpopular) if there was some kind of system to cut down on the ""let's all bring the biggest mech we can"" viewpoint that I've seen in a lot of games, this would actually cut down on boating.

Maybe they should reconsider implementing some kind of battle value system?  Or significant bonuses for an underweight/underBV team that wins?

&gt; Multiple tag lasers do not confer any additional benefit

**\*EYES SIRLAGSALOT***

Edit: Here's a full dump of quotes, I believe:

* Press '&amp;m_next_target*' to target an enemy when the red triangle is in view.
* Press '&amp;start_team_chat*' to chat with your team.
* Press '&amp;toggle_Weapon_Group*' to assign a weapon to a group.  Use the Arrow Keys to change selected weapon or group.
* &amp;attack1* is mapped to fire the currently selected weapons group.  Be mindful of which group you have selected when you finish editing your setup.
* Mastering control of your 'Mech is challenging at first.  Every MechWarrior must learn to control their torso and legs separately in order to succeed.
* Press TAB to see the current scores and other useful information.
* Press '&amp;m_toggle_night_vision*' to enable Night Vision.
* Press '&amp;m_toggle_thermal_vision*' to enable Thermal Vision.

* The Cadet bonus awards extra C-Bills and is awarded to new recruits and lasts for your first 25 games.
* Premium Time awards a 50% bonus to XP and C-Bills earned.
* Your match earnings are based on your performance. Be a valuable asset to your team to reap the highest rewards.

* Premium time grants a 50% bonus to both XP and C-Bills. Premium time can be bought with MC in the Mech Lab.
* Not sure which 'Mech is best for you? Trial 'Mechs are free and change regularly.
* A 'Mech cannot survive without both legs, the centre torso or its head.  A 'Mech equipped with an XL engine will also die if either side torso is destroyed.
* All weapons generate heat when fired.  When a 'Mech is too hot, it will automatically shut down to avoid damaging its internal structure whilst the 'Mech cools off.  A shutdown 'Mech is incredibly vulnerable.
* If you are targeted by incoming missiles, be sure to take cover. Hide behind terrain or buildings as fast as you can.
* Working as a team increases your chance of survival overwhelmingly.
* Remember that your legs and torso can face in different directions. Use the mini-map arrow to orient your movement in relation to your torso’s field of view. You can press '&amp;m_torso_centre*' to re-center your view.
* Be careful when using jump jets. Falling long distances can cause damage.
* If you find that you’re overheating in battle, consider adding more heat sinks, upgrading to double heat sinks or slowing your rate of fire.

* Press '&amp;start_chat*' to chat with all players on the battlefield.
* Recruit friends and form a group. Teamwork = Victory

* Press '&amp;show_battlegrid*' to see the Battlegrid.  From here, the commander can issue orders to the team.  Take command yourself if you're up for the challenge.
* If you want to disappear from the enemy's radar - press '&amp;powerToggle*' to power down.
* Press '&amp;m_show_target_overlay*' to see all available information of `Mechs in the battlefield.
* Press and Hold '&amp;m_freelook*' to look around the cockpit
* Press '&amp;m_toggle_zoom_mode*' to zoom in to provide improved precision for long range weapons.

* A hollow triangle represents a 'Mech that is not targeted by any teammates.  A filled triangle means someone is targeting that 'Mech.  Target 'Mechs that are already targeted by your team.
* Grouping arm weapons separately from torso weapons allows for greater flexibility when engaging enemies of varying speed.
* The % health is a total of all parts that make up a 'Mech.  Each component of a 'Mech has its own health and may be critical to the survival of that 'Mech.
* An assault 'Mech attacked head on as a scout can be suicide.  Try to flank and get behind.
* A 'legged' 'Mech can only move at 50% normal speed.  
* Your 'Mech is locked once it has been launched.  It can only be reused once that mission is over.
* Be sure to check for your target's weak points.  Damage already sustained is shown; your target may already be close to its demise…
* Running into your teammates or enemies will result in damage to both you and the other 'Mech.
* Long Range Missiles (LRM) have a minimum arming range.  When fired at a target within that range, they will do 0 damage.
* Short Range Missiles arm immediately when fired.  
* Range indicated for LRM's indicates the maximum travel distance of each missile.  Take into account the likely trajectory when firing at a target close to maximum range.
* Heat sinks in the legs are more effective when submerged in water.  
* Ambient temperature affects the effectiveness of all heat sinks on your 'Mech.  
* Weapons, ammo and equipped items are destroyed independently.  However, a destroyed arm will lose all heat sinks, ammo, weapons and other items contained within.
* Continued, sustained damage will transfer from a destroyed location to the next adjacent part.
* The more jump jets you have, the higher you can fly.
* The Artemis IV Fire Control System improves the accuracy of your missiles
* A ‘Mech affected by an enemy ECM is unable to transmit or receive information.
* The TAG laser can be used to make an ECM shielded enemy targetable if it’s used from outside the 180m cover range of the ECM.
* An allied ECM in Counter-mode will disable the nearest enemy ECM in Disrupt-mode.
* For the TAG laser to be effective, it should constantly remain on the target.
* Enemy ‘Mechs affected by a NARC will cause allies to acquire missile locks 75% faster.
* Locked-on missiles fired at a target affected by a Narc will receive a 100% increase to their tracking strength.
* If you experience instability, try using the Repair tool in the patcher - click the cog icon.
* XL engines allow for tremendous speeds and lower weight, but at the cost of increased vulnerability and slots used in both side torsi.
* Armor on the torso and side torso is shared between the front and the back.  Choose for your situation and playstyle where you need the most.
* Many 'Mechs do not have full armor by default.
* Use XP earned in the Pilot Lab unlock efficiencies in your owned 'Mechs.
* Only some 'Mech variants can equip an ECM.
* Each 'Mech has a maximum weight it can carry.  Be sure to balance your 'Mech as effectively as possible between your needs for ammunition, weaponry, heat management, armor and support items.
* Don’t forget to equip appropriate ammo when mounting a new weapon that requires it.
* LRM - Long Range Missile.  SRM - Short Range Missile.  SSRM - Streak Short Range Missile.
* Cockpit items and modules have no weight.
* Be nice to novice pilots. Remember: we all started as new players at some point.
* Using chainfire '&amp;m_toggleChainfireGroup*' can help manage heat generated over time.
* Press '&amp;ToggleInfoVis* ' to see health and names of your teammates when you have your battlegrid open
* ""Press '&amp;shutdownOverride*' to override the heat shutdown. The BattleMech manufacturer, Mech Bay engineers and House Military Operations 
* ""You are not responsible for damage sustained from excessive heat whilst override shutdown is engaged.""
* Weapon ranges indicated show the maximum distance for optimal damage.  Damage can be dealt beyond that range for some weapons, but at a reduced rate. 
* ""The Anti-Missile System (AMS) will destroy missiles passing within 90m of your 'Mech, prioritizing those targeted on you.""
* When a component has no armor, there is 25% chance to crit one slot, 14% to crit two slots, and 3% to crit three slots with each additional hit.
* Where your armor is destroyed, your weapons and equipped items are vulnerable to critical hits.
* Gauss rifles are more likely to be critted than other weapon types and will explode when destroyed.
* Unlike other ammo types, Gauss ammo does not explode. 
* A ‘Mech shielded by an allied ECM cannot be targeted by any other ‘Mech standing more than 200m away.
* NARCs attached to ‘Mechs shielded by an allied ECM cannot broadcast but remain active.
* Being protected by an ECM prevents an enemy Beagle Active Probe from providing bonuses.
* Shooting an enemy ‘Mech with a Tag will cause allies to acquire missile locks 50% faster and allied locked-on missiles to receive a 50% bonus on their tracking strength.
* Multiple Tag lasers do not stack bonuses together.
* Narc and Tag stack together for bigger bonuses.
* The Beagle Active Probe increases the range at which you can detect 'Mechs by 25%.
* The Beagle Active Probe allows you to detect powered down 'Mechs if they are within 120m of you.
* The Beagle Active Probe allows you to receive information about enemy 'Mechs 25% faster.
* The Hula Girl is not a lie.
* Animals were not harmed in the development of MechWarrior Online.  Only humans were harmed.
* Completing the BASIC efficiency trees of 3 chassis variants of the same type will bring greater rewards.
* Modules can offer interesting abilities once unlocked to aid you in the heat of battle.
* Double heat sinks occupy 3 slots and increase normal heat dissipation over a regular heat sink by 1.4x.
* Endosteel and Ferro Fibrous armor are two ways to free up additional weight for more flexiblity in the 'Mech loadout.  Each comes at a cost of 14 internal slots.  
* Unlock modules for all 'Mechs within the Pilot Tree menu using Global XP (GXP).  Once unlocked, they can then be purchased and equipped on your 'Mechs.
* Global XP (GXP) can be used to unlock modules or unlock efficiencies across all 'Mechs.
* Larger engines will allow your 'Mech to move faster.  XL engines cost more, occupy more slots but weigh less.  
* Mounting ammo into a easily destructable area is risky as unspent ammo can explode.  Mitigate this risk with C.A.S.E. 
* Unlock all Elite efficiencies for 3 variants of one weight class to get one extra Module slot for your 'Mechs",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1366142830.0,,EXP,True,t3_1chcop,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1chcop/anyone_else_like_the_new_tips_screen/,

I do mechlab shenanigans before I group.  I understand often people are tight on CBills and need to keep tweaking but please try to keep mechlab time when grouped to a minimum (or better yet zero).  We already have enough time problems such as crashes, bugs, and damn you guys always getting a beer (I'm joking about the last one).  At times I feel like I'm waiting for others as much as I'm playing.

We've been able to coordinate 3 or 4 8mans, doing synchronized drops, and having it out in 1v1 combat to the death.  

The rules are simple:

* Two mechs enter, one mech leaves (within an appropriate time constraint)
* 4 grid squares are your boundaries, should you pass them, you will be kill-ified by all.
* No streak-boating
* ECM must be turned to Counter, rendering it useless

Last night,  we were able to get 4 groups to sync-drop, and it was TONS o' fun.  Have a look-see at some recordings (identified by team leader):

* SSRMs need a damage bump. And maybe a slight re-distribution of component hit chance. But whatever; it's better than the instant-win button for light wars they were.

I mostly brawled in my Pretty Baby, and it was terrific. Honestly, the SRM damage increase was more helpful to the metagame than the entire heat penalty system. I did also take each of my cheese builds out for a test spin to see how they were affected; needless to say, I'm not impressed.

I don't even think the issue is pinpoint accuracy. I think all of those, and other issues are symptoms of one major flaw in MWO....

The major issue is lack of weight balancing/limiting. You shouldn't see more than 2 assault battlemechs on the field in 12v12 let alone 8v8, hell I would argue no more than 1. You are supposed to have mostly mediums, a couple heavies... and maybe an assault. And you and your team should be scared to death of that one assault chassis.

So, PGI needs to scrap this idea of just extra incentives to run a balanced team, they need a hard limit put in place by either:
- Make it so you still have to have 12 mechs, but they can't go over a certain limit as a team.
- Make it so you can bring whatever you want, but you might be bringing a smaller team to stay under the limit.

Jump into a few matches and it does OK, not as good as I hoped but i've not upgraded the heck out of it yet other than DHS.

So the match starts in Forest Colony and the battle rages on. I'm struggling to get into close range due to the sniper fire going on but I notice a light mech circling behind us, he gets engaged with one of our lights and we take him down I got the kill but it was team work.

I decide to try and flank around a bit to get to some of the snipers to at least shake up the match a bit to prevent it become a snipe fest and manage to take the long route around. People are dying and I take a few pot shots here and there but nothing major, I'm yellow/orange armour or so.

Then I notice someone from the opposite team say ""GG :)"" and hit tab to check the scores. We're 5-2 down. Just me and the Commando I helped out before. 'Bugger! Oh well, might as well go down fighting' I thought and turned a corner to see an Atlas and something else (can't remember). I notice the Atlas torso is stripped down to Orange internals and I decide to try and get a kill before I'm brought down, a few blasts of laser fire and my SRM's and he goes down, I then get a lucky shot (either a head or an internal toro crit on an XL) and take the other mech down.

By this time the Commando has gone off my mini map, no idea where he is but I trust him to pickup the other mechs. Someone from our team says ""C'mon guys! I know you can do this!!"". It's 3-2 to them as I spot an enemy Catapult. We start the dance of death and as he blows off an arm removing one SRM block I get breach his central torso and take him down. 

Smoking and with some warning lights going off I pickup the signal from another mech (can't remember, think a medium) and close to engage. A swift fight ensues and thankfully his already damaged torso lets me get a few shots on him and despite being more damaged it's now two versus one.

I move on and see the last target... A Stalker. It's taken damage but weapons are full and no internals are exposed. Damn... Then my little Commando buddy pops up behind him and I decide that if I have to go down, I'll try and strip as much armour away from him as possible and let the Commando tear down his rear armour.

My mech rocks with laser fire and short range missiles, almost everything is now down to the internals as I reverse to the tunnel, constantly moving and  changing direction while trying to stay alive as long as possible to strip the armour down. The weapon cooldowns seem to take en eternity to end as I slowly break down his armour. Smoke pours out the side of my mech and I notice my centre torse is now on red internals.. Oh well, one last shot as I look at his now exposed torse... Click my medium lasers then one remaining SRM and...

BOOM!

Victory.

Huge thanks to the team (not a premade) on that win, they did enough to weaken down the enemy allowing me to mop them up at the end and huge thanks to a player known as Cypherpunk that was my Commando buddy at the end and who did a lot more than I noticed him doing (can guarantee he was engaging the enemy while I wasn't aware of where he was exactly).

I actually stopped playing after that match for the night. No way I could top it so decided to go out on a high.

I also frequent /r/gaming and /r/games a lot and have noticed that every time MWO is brought up, there are many comments that really despise it. Why is that? Is this game unfaithful to the MechWarrior IP? With the recent close of MW:Living Legends development there is also a lot of PGI hate from people claiming MWLL was more true to the MechWarrior IP than MWO. Is  MWO so unMechWarriory that it makes it less appealing to people who know a lot about the MW IP? 

I've tried to rationalize the MWO hate by just saying ""well its all just standard F2P hate"" but then I don't understand how other F2P games with huge grinds (similar to what MWO used to have) like Planetside 2 have tons of followers (/r/planetside has 10x the number of subs as /r/mwo). Ive tried PS2 and have found it pretty enjoyable in its own regard, but not amazing enough to say it is a massively better game than MWO.

I tend to agree with the reddit community's stance on what is a quality game but not this time.

So that nobody has to guess anymore, here is the detailed explanation, linked from another thread on here a few days ago, via the forums straight from David and Bryan:

_____


Each time the internal structure of a Mech takes damage, there is a chance that the hit will cause at least 1 critical hit. There is a 25% chance of causing 1 critical hit, a 14% chance of causing 2 critical hits, and a 3% chance of causing 3 critical hits (for a total of a 42% chance of any sort of critical hit). Each critical hit will randomly hit a weapon or piece of equipment in that location; the chance of a particular piece of equipment being hit is proportional to how many critical slots it occupies. Each critical hit damages the weapon/equipment an amount equal to the damage that caused the critical hit.

For example, an Atlas AS7-D is hit with an AC/5, for 5 damage to its left torso’s internal structure. The attacker gets lucky and this results in 3 critical hits. Two of the crits hit the LRM 20 and 1 hits the heat sink. The heat sink will take 5 damage and the LRM 20 will take 10 (5 x 2 = 10).

Currently, all engines have 15 points of health while all other items have 10. One of the changes going through QA right now, and that will be applied to an upcoming patch, is lowering the health of the Gauss rifle to 3 points. And, sometime soon, we plan on doing a full pass on the health of all the items.

Critical damage to the side torso hit boxes of XL engines deals damage to the engine as a whole. However, it should be noted that, currently, critical damage to your engine will not disable it, but simply add to your repair bill. This is likely to change when we do the pass on the health values.

While I can simply blow up some who instantly show their faces, others just repeatedly circle around me and any hits I get on them never seem to do that much damage.  The end result is that they blow away my arm, severely hurting my damage output.  What's more, it's not uncommon for me to see three or more shoot away on one and have them still run off like nothing happened.

I ideally aim for the legs while in a constant turn so as to only have my left arm (aka shield arm) showing to them, but they can still get a better position on me so I can't really see them.  As a result, unless they're kind of enough to stop for me I just sorta run away and hope my team mates help me out.


So how am I supposed to deal with these guys?


P.S. I'm running a Centurion CN9-AL with four medium pulse lasers, two streak SRMS, and one AMS.  There's no XL engine or armour changes.

One in particular that I have been thinking about a lot would be an escort mission in which you would need to protect or assault a cargo train/convoy (optional win might be to destroy the other side's mechs) . Imagine a large with terrain that would help conceal/provide cover along the path. The convoy would take a certain amount of time (example: 7 min) to reach its destination which would be a win for the escorting team and the sides are switched. Destroying the convoy before the time limit is reached, lets say it was destroyed in only 4 out of the 7 min given, the escort side would then be switched to the assaulting team and would then only have 4 min or less to destroy it. Similar to the WoW battleground where one side breaks into the fortress, except the fortress is mobile and not always taking the same path in this case. 
 This might encourage more medium or fast heavy mech being played (these types are less frequently used then say assaults or lights it seems) as you would need to keep up with it and still have fire power to destroy or defend it. Scouting would still be important since there could be more than one path that the convoy could take either randomly or somehow a selected option from the escorting team. Scouts could fan out, find out which route is being taken and let the slower mechs know where they need to setup to intercept.
 
 I think this would be a nice change of pace from the usual standoffs or cheesy base capping that most of the time just leaves one or both teams angry. This idea is probably out there on the forums somewhere but I am at work on a slow day and can't read them... ftl

I fully support any build you want to create but a key tenet of MW has always been that there are trade-offs.  PPCs (should) run hot, which is why in the original lore it was rare to see more than 3 PPCs on a mech, and even then only a handful of mechs could pull that off.  
The rest of this post will not focus on game balance.  I will accept (for the moment) that PPC builds rule the battlefield and, if it's in the game, you should be allowed to do it.  This post focuses on how to counter the PPC snipers.

On to my tale:  My friends and I were getting to the point where we didn't want to play the game due to the PPC balance issues.  Losing is one thing, but losing to the same PPC alpha strike sniper battles again and again gets frustrating.  It was becoming common to see virtually entire teams of PPC boats that would hide behind hills, alpha strike, overheat/shutdown, rinse and repeat.  (Props to some of the highly skilled snipers out there - you deserve credit for maximizing the PPC build.)  There seemed to be few counters to a pinpoint accurate 50 point alpha strike.  So we stopped worrying about winning and just started having fun with various builds. In time, we started messing around with lights (again), and we ""discovered"" something rather obvious - mobility rules the battlefield. 
We all started running lights and we developed our own lance tactics that took advantage of our light mech mobility:
- begin to cap a flag on an assault map as a distraction to pull off any defenders, and once isolated, kill them
- hunt the other team's lights (obviously), focusing on the ECM mechs, any attacking our heavies, and base cappers
- wolfpack heavies that stray from their group &lt;-- our specialty

All of these tactics are obvious so I don't expect any surprised reactions.  But what really worked was communication (we use vent) when combined with our speed and mobility.  A call of ""isolated Stalker at E5"" would bring us all in a swarm.  Easy prey when they have no streaks, SRMs, or lasers for defense against light mechs.

But the best part of all this is that we began winning, a lot more than with any other build.  My avg win/loss ratio was roughly .9, but in light mechs it's over 1.3.  PPCs have become a minor annoyance, rather than a threat, since we can zig-zag faster than they can aim - besides, they're usually target fixated on the PPC sniper from the other team.  When we find them hiding behind a hill (usually alone in the backfield, in their sniper positions) we nibble at their ankles until they die a 'death from a thousand cuts.'

So that's my story.  The tactics we developed aren't terribly original but they work for us against the current flavor of the month. And when that flavor changes, we will change, because we're lights - we flow with the battle, decide when and where to engage, and we kill your PPC cheese builds!

How it works: We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death. Stats are recorded.

Over 90% of the time we match up, when we don't we have a blast taking arena mechs against 8 mans. Once in a while we do homogenous drops. i.e. all PPC spiders or CN9-A zombies etc... One of the funniest ""missed-sync"" drops was all trial spiders! (we went 4-8)

So basically leave it up to the Hosts to manage the matches and rankings and you get to provide the carnage.

If you take a look at the mechs' hitboxes (http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/96395-guide-hit-box-localisation/), you'll see that a lot of the mechs have wide pelvis sections, and more importantly that said big pelvis falls under the heading CT.

So if you've stripped armor off the CT of a mech and they are playing keep away with torso twisting, just put an Alpha where the sun don't shine.

I see a lot of people chase mechs with open rear CTs to try and get that last shot, when they all they need to do is shoot them in a bit more personal of an area.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1370805160.0,,EXP,True,t3_1fzu6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1fzu6o/psa_enemy_torso_twisting_to_protect_that_cored_ct/,

1370595298.0,22,self.mwo,1fuojk,My main gripes with MWO at the moment.,Assupoika,35,13,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1fuojk/my_main_gripes_with_mwo_at_the_moment/,"Hello. First of all, I've been playing MWO since the closed beta year ago and I am huge fan of it. But lately there's been few things to drive me away from it and I want to rant about them a bit and maybe even give some suggestions how to change them.

- Seismic sensor: Flanking has always been part of victory tactics and getting surprised from behind was your own stupidity. Now, I dont mind having something like Seismic sensor but it's current state is way too powerful and makes it pretty much must have module. For this I dont have my own suggestion but I really liked the idea that it only works when you are stationary and it's range would be shortened to something like 100/200m on rank 1 and 2.

- PPCs: Ah, the boating issue. Ever since the closed beta there has been different weapons that has been boated and they seemed overpowered but usually there was some counter to them: SRM cats a.k.a bumblebees, streakpults, LRMpocalypses, Boomcat. But unlike PPCs/ERPPCs these things had weakness: Range. You could keep your distance to boomcats and srm cats and you could sneak up on LRM boats and hug them.
Now PPC boating is a whole new story. Sure, normal PPCs have min range of 90m but most boats are often paired with ERPPCs and the 90m gap aint that hard to keep either way.
Best suggestion I've read so far is that slower the projectile speed a bit and change the PPC damage to 6+4 meaning that 6 damage will be delivered directly where the ppc hits and rest 4 damage is spread to adjacent components.

- Useless weapons: Ah, Flamers, machineguns, SPLaser, Narc. I do understand that flamers and MGs were mainly anti infantry weapons but MWO does not have infantry so why not make the viable againts mechs? Machine gun is even more waste of tonnage for small mech than small pulse is weighing at least 1,5 tons. Sure, the crit seeking could be nice feature except there's nothing useful to crit! And once the armor is gone there's really no point in seeking to destroy those components because the internals will be gone soon anyways.
Flamers have been made a bit more viable but I think they could do a little damage aswell.
Now NARC, they have been made better but they could still last longer. MWLL did this well in my opinion that it lasted long enough and was only prematurely disabled by PPC (because of the EMP effect and all).
For small pulse there aint much more to say than just tweak the numbers. It doesn't really work as alternative to medium lasers nor does it perform better than small lasers.

So, there's my little rant. As much I love MWO I still hope that PGI gets their shit together, starts making proper changes for weapon numbers and ditches the TT spreadsheet wich doesnt work for real time environment as well. 

TL;DR: I really hope that PGI achieves balance one day because I love playing MWO.

1354649721.0,19,self.mwo,149ymi,Matthew Craig (dev) comments on performance optimization,Fireye,19,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/149ymi/matthew_craig_dev_comments_on_performance/,"Taken from here: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/80476-performance-update/

&gt;Performance Update

&gt;We know that performance slowly declined for a number of users to the point of becoming unplayable in recent patches, obviously we’ve been progressively adding content and features to the game and we’ve also been trying to keep performance in a playable state but clearly we haven’t done enough and need to do better. We’ve been going over all the games systems in detail and building a complete picture of where the key costs for MWO lie and how we can work to improve them and I wanted to share our findings so far with you.

&gt;HUD

&gt;As I’ve mentioned in other posts MWO does not have a cheap HUD it contains a lot of detail and we always planned to have Scaleform 4.0 as part of the CryEngine 3.4 update which is much more optimal than the version currently in MWO. Sadly this integration did not come as part of the 3.4 update, so we are now taking the time to make the HUD more optimal until such time as we can upgrade MWO to the latest version. A minor improvement goes out today which was a bug fix for an issue that was causing the cockpit monitors to use more draw calls than necessary.

&gt;Levels

&gt;The levels were created with performance in mind but not as the primary goal and visual quality was more important to us initially. Each level is now getting a cleanup pass and the changes will roll out in upcoming patches all of them should be done by early in the New Year. This work has already been making its way to production Forest Colony and Frozen City are already done and other maps are coming down the pipe, part of the reason the full impact hasn’t been felt yet is the costs in the HUD and in the Terrain.

&gt;Terrain

&gt;We’ve been looking more closely at the Terrain code in 3.4 and noticing that it is generally responsible for much of the streaming/hitching happening in game. We are working to tune it for min spec machines; this work should help all platforms feel generally ‘smoother’ in terms of performance. There were also a few regressions caused by a cleanup pass that happened a few weeks ago which have been caught and re-exported correctly that go out on production today.

&gt;Ray Traces

&gt;Mechs sure can fire a lot of lasers and also use ray traces for range finding, tagging etc. These can add up fast especially on a Swayback, we’ve recently done some work to reduce the amount used where possible and to optimize the underlying system to make it faster which should be making its way to production in the next couple of weeks.

&gt;Audio

&gt;We’ve also recently done some audio cleanup passes that should help performance that go out in today’s patch.

&gt;Engine

&gt;CryEngine 3.4 was a great update for us and lays the groundwork for many good things to come, but it also set back some earlier optimization work. There are no more planned updates in the foreseeable future so the community should feel reassured that stability and performance will both continue to improve from here forwards and remain a high priority for us here at PGI.


&gt;We’ve also significantly tightened up on our process for internal performance testing of upcoming builds to ensure builds don’t go out with any significant performance regressions. We appreciate that there are some outstanding performance issues awaiting fixes on production 4fps bug and degradation over time, we continue to actively track these and work with the community to help resolve them.

&gt;Starting today we hope you will experience some improvement in today’s build with a much more significant improvement in the following build that we hope will bring us much more in line with where performance was earlier in closed beta and then only ever the same or better from there.


&gt;As always we thank you for your support and patience and hope to see you on the Battlefield. ",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,EXP,True,t3_149ymi,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/149ymi/matthew_craig_dev_comments_on_performance/,

* Dark atmosphere

* 'Mechs leave footprints of exposed magma 

* A bright orange glow ""rotates"" around 'Mechs as they walk past the bright magma

* It reminds me of an Alpine on fire, with no snow, so there are deeper valleys.

* Hot temperature

* Bridges. I *love* bridges

* Brawling and long-range spaces

* Open areas and areas with cover

I am really enjoying the size, diversity, and color palette of the map. PGI has really been improving the quality of their content with Terra Therma and Canyon Network (not to mention the improvements to Caustic).

I was thinking about the problem, that of in idea that would solve that problem and, while i'm not on the development team of MWO, I would think would be pretty easy to code is, as the system is already in place.

Since Mechwarrior is true to life to 'Mechs as one can be without they really existing yet (well not yet at least :P), when you fire a weapon, the heat is dispersed across heatsinks so that they all can can take their ""share"" of heat and start working off the heat generated. Shooting a few weapons across time isn't a big issue as heat is gradually built up, and the heatsinks aren't going from a ""cold-turkey' state to high heat instantly.

However, in high alpha strikes, you are going for a very low heat state to a very high heat state amongst your heatsinks in an instant.

To keep within the MWO universe, I would think that this sudden stress of heat influx would probably blow out one of your heat sinks. So my proposal would be that if you do a high alpha, the game would calculate a chance for you to blow out a heat sink(s) (maybe more then one due to to balancing needs). That way you, the pilot, are faced with the decision of a short term strong punch, vs a potentially long term damage to yourself, and making you less viable for the match. 

Additionally, they could play with the idea, that the more heatsinks you have in your mech, the slimmer the chance that your high alpha will blow out a heat sink. Or, they can say the more heat sinks you have, the higher the threshold your mech has before the game determines if a heatsink should be lost.

Heatsink destruction is already in the game, so i feel, that while some coding is obviously necessary, they would not have to code a whole engine to fix a problem, people can still do high alphas if they want but with some downsides.

Just my humble idea, but I haven't thought of a scenario where this would be a bad idea. what do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,BL,True,t3_1gzjyf,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1gzjyf/my_humble_solution_to_pinpoint_alpha_boating/,

1. Less Ammo. Most weapons will be fine with 2 Tons.  
2. Less back armor. In most divisions you will be better off with more front armor since you are only fighting one enemy.  
3. If possible optimize your DPS for 30-45 seconds without overheating.  

**Dueling**  
1. Torso Twist. Spread that damage.  
2. Never Overheat. This will get you killed... quick.  
3. Clear any preconceived notions of ""good"" v.s. ""Bad"" mechs. Some ""useless"" chassis excel at dueling.  
4. Watch and learn. We have some great pilots, look for their strengths and note their weaknesses.  
5. Be quick on the draw. Get the first hit in and you're ahead from the beginning.

Problem is, since I knew that ammo explosion could very well get me killed I didnt want to put ammo in my side torso after legs were filled so I placed the extra ton of ammo to right ARM thinking that IF there's ammo explosion it will take my arm with it and maybe side torso. Turns out that one ton of AC/2 ammo that exploded in my arm took out the side torso and soon CT.

So in the end I ended up dying with full armour everywhere and cored because of that one ton of AC/2 ammo in my arm and this made me wonder.

I previously played a lot of competitive WoT and MW4.  In both of those games, like MWO, I've found ranged direct fire to be the most competitive way to play.  Winning is determined by the team with the best scouting, map position and team movement.  This is how I see MWO at the moment and I absolutely love this style of play.

I'm not sure what other method of play people are pushing for.  It's as if they prefer all mechs meet in an open field, stand still and spam shots at each other until one team wins.  In my opinion, this style is too random to make for any sort of competitive play.

I started playing MWO a few weeks ago, just solo pugging mostly and got on the comstar ts too. These are my impressions.

Thigs MWO is doing right:

The mechs look amazing. Seriously some of the best looking mecha ever.

Things MWO is failing at:

Pretty much everything else at this point. i'll just make it short and sweer: the weapons make no sense, the game is fundamentally flawed from a balance perspective, the matchmaking is pretty much broken, the grind is so so bad, everything is absurdly expensive, too many bugs, uber repetative gameplay, boring game modes, some really terrible maps, super-ultra-mega defensive community who thinks nothing is wrong at all, bad dev communication on what the hell this game is actually supposed to play like when it's ""finished"", huge sweeping changed to the meta that make no sense and just exaust my patience, tournaments that are just like slot machines basically and a grind fest to get to the top with really dumb rewards like for ONLY 1st place (seriously, why the hell would I even bother since I know I can't get 1st anyway), and the worst performance of any game i own on my hardware which is all current gen.

that Said, i really like the principles of the game, but right now i think they need to go closed beta again until they figure out what the hell this game is supposed to be like and give everyone a reset when they figure it out.

I might try the game out again when the so called community war part is in, but as a fresh player to the game, right now there's no reason to keep playing and every reason to move on to something better, which isn't hard.

having been watching this subreddit alot, i know this will probably get downvoted to hell (like anything critical because people here seem uber defensive for no reason), but i'm just putting that out there so you know what it's like from a new player who is moving on and why. hopefully it helps to know where the game should go for new people.

How it works: 

We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death.  

Stats are recorded.  

Over 90% of the time we match up, when we don't we have a blast taking arena mechs against 8 mans. Once in a while we do homogenous drops. i.e. all PPC spiders or CN9-A zombies etc...
One of the funniest ""missed-sync"" drops was all trial spiders! (we went 4-8)  

So basically we leave it up to the Hosts to manage and you to provide the carnage.

PS: We also try to record all matches and post them on our youtube channel.

For that reason, I took note of a couple undocumented/unintended changes that were made in the last patch, as well as some nifty images and Interfaces hiding out in the game files:

* Windowed Fullscreen mode works again, woohoo!  It's still limited to 60fps (at least, on my 60hz LCD), but it's a great feature that's been broken the last few patches.
* 7.1 audio was ""fixed"", but I've had some odd audio blips pop up.  I've had the characteristic buzz/fart sound once or twice, but not consistently.  I've also noted that the MPLAS recharge sound appears to be slower and lower pitched than before.
* [The Commando, Hunchback, Dragon, and Awesome received new textures this patch. They can also be taken into Camo Spec now.](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/85159-the-new-looks/page__p__1627626#entry1627626) (appears to be higher resolution/color tweaked)
* Speed Tweak was fixed.  Now grants 10% increase in speed, versus the 7.5% it was giving before.

Anyone else notice any undocumented changes in mechanics, maps, sounds, or textures?

__________________________

On the ""hidden goodies"" side, someone asked me to send them the itemstats.xml file, which describes the raw data behind weapons.  I figured, why stop there, why not see what else is lurking around in the game files?  I found a _LOT_ of interesting graphics and UI work in there, some hilariously outdated, though some of these are clearly early prototypes.  Here are some highlights:

* [Alpine Peaks Minimap](http://imgur.com/a/Zcrih#0)
* [Tourmaline Desert Minimap](http://imgur.com/a/Zcrih#5)
* [Possible Store UI](http://imgur.com/a/Zcrih#6)
* [Very nifty (but slightly dated) 12v12 drop interface](http://imgur.com/a/Zcrih#11)

~~I also found a number of references to User Messages in various XML files.  That, combined with [this interesting New Issue](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/84750-it-is-not-indicated-properly-which-friend-is-sending-a-message/) on the MWO forumsleads me to indicate that user to user messaging happening in the near future.~~

Apparently user messaging is in the game already.  I had no idea, and I couldn't find it documented in any PGI material.  Supposedly you just have to doubleclick on any friend, who is currently out of game, in your friends list.  Today I Learned...

1352953857.0,20,self.mwo,13827e,I'm conflicted and frustrated by PGI's development and communications strategy. Let's discuss.,qwortec,38,18,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/13827e/im_conflicted_and_frustrated_by_pgis_development/,"Like most people here I have a fond love of Mechwarrior games.  I played the shit out of the original Mechwarrior on PC back on my dad's 286. When I first heard that someone was making a new MW game I was sold instantly.  This series has a long history and a huge, dedicated fan base that feels the same way.  PGI has all of this built in support that should be leading to a great product, but it feels like they're squandering it.

First, I want to say that it feels like the devs really are MW and BT fans.  It feels like their hearts are in the right place.  The core game mechanic is great.  This game feels like what a modern MW should feel like.  Piloting feels good, the combat feels good, the tactics feel good.  All of this should be the base of a great game.

Here's where I get confused.  It feels like there is a severe disconnect between the devs and those who really enjoy the core game and want to see it made great.  What it comes down to is a lack of dialogue and an opaqueness and generally patronizing attitude coming from the devs.  It's like they won't acknowledge the community that is smart and *wants to help them*.

Some examples:

First that comes to mind is the lack of complete patch notes.  I cannot fathom the reasoning behind not including major changes to the patch notes of a game that the devs keep reiterating is IN BETA.  When changes are made to the game and you want people to test them out, why just give partial patch notes?  Why treat the community like they can't handle a full set of notes?

Then there's the ""ask the devs"" and other sources of info which are ridiculously patronizing.  There is never any serious discussion of plans, and rarely is there ever serious feedback to the reasonable and obvious issues that get raised by the community.  The problems with MGs, Flamers, PPCs, etc. are all brushed aside.  There was little to no discussion about the matchmaking issues until the devs decided to lay out their 3 phased matchmaking plan (which is still not fully fleshed out) without any consultation whatsoever. 

Take the problems they had with double heat sinks and the incorrect heat values for pulse lasers.  These are issues that were discovered by members of the beta testing group who noticed that what they were being told about the mechanics were not lining up with their experience.  They then did some pretty rigorous testing and found the problems.  It's obvious that the devs read this and realized that they were right.  But instead of acknowledging their work, commending them, and asking others to do the same, they just pretended as though it was a bug that they found internally and then fixed (a fix that was flawed).  

Another obvious one is the move to open beta.  Instead of talking to the community and having a reasonable discussion with the people that are the most intimately familiar with the game as it exists about some ideas for moving to open beta, the devs just told everyone suddenly that it would open next week, citing ridiculous rationale that nobody can take seriously (beta tester fatigue?) and they got called on it immediately and harshly.  They ended up back-pedaling for a week and then pushed the game out with no tutorials and a broken matchmaking system, forever losing a portion of potential players for whom the game was far too newb-unfriendly. 

The latest thing that's got me is this move to 3rd person.  So this gets announced in an unclear way on some quasi-sponsored podcast where the hosts just acquiesce and don't ask any meaningful questions.  Understandably the community erupts because first of all this was never supposed to be in the game (by the dev's own plans), and secondly it is possibly a terrible move for the game itself.  So the forums setup a poll, which gets a predictably unanimous call of bullshit on this and then, *THEN*, the devs setup a feedback [thread](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/73172-the-official-3rd-person-view-feedback-thread/).  Why didn't they just ask for feedback before this announcement?  Anybody could have told you that this would be howled at.  This strategy (and it is a strategy as evidenced by its continuous pattern) creates a terrible relationship between the devs, who obviously need help from the community, and that same community who see themselves constantly ignored, blown off, or treated as idiotic entitled whiners.

I just don't understand what's going on.  On one hand the devs do seem committed to communication, as evidenced by some of their forum presences.  But on the other hand they seem to constantly poison any real relationship that they could be building with the hugely dedicated fanbase that they have.  I've seen so many people become disillusioned with the devs over time.  I try not to, but honestly every decision they make, every spontaneous new announcement, every back-pedal, every show of incompetence that gets followed up with PR bullshit instead of honest talk... it makes me wonder.

**TL;DR:**  PGI has been patronizing to their testers and fans for a while now and it seems like a poor strategy.
 
**Edit:**  Part of the problem /r/mwo is that anybody who is critical of the management of this game gets downvoted to hell.  Even if it's a realistic and non-vitriolic critique.  Why can't we have a discussion instead of people getting into camps of either ""the devs are retarded"" or ""devs are awesome, community is retarded""?

**Second Edit:**  http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/73536-weapon-balancing/page__pid__1429445#entry1429445 makes me happy.  I may have come across are overly negative.

Open Beta - Update #1 - Patch 1.0.142

Upcoming Patch - Tuesday Nov. 6th @ 10AM – 1PM PDT


Change Log
________________________________________
Update


Hello Folks,
It’s been another big push for content and gameplay this patch. There are several new things for you to take a look at and test out. In summary, there’s a new map, a new Mech variant, a new piece of information warfare equipment and some tuning to existing systems. Also included with this patch is the first phase of the Match Maker system.
Forest Colony Snow is a new take on the original Forest Colony. There have been a few changes to some of the gameplay spaces which change the tide and tactics of how battles on this map will play out.
The Centurion CN9-D has been added to round out the Centurion family.
The Artemis IV FCS Upgrade system has been added to the game. Artemis IV is an enhanced targeting system that increases the accuracy of LRMs and SRMs. This means that more missiles will be hitting on target than previous. This does not mean that SRMs become guided, they just tighten up their spread.
A very big improvement in Mech hit-box detection was also included in this patch. You should notice much greater accuracy in weapon hit detection than previously.
While not 100% eliminated, the black screen lock at the start of a match has been drastically reduced. We are continuing to monitor this problem and will be addressing as soon we find the exact cause.
That being said, here are your patch notes:


**GENERAL**

MATCHMAKING Phase 1

This patch, we introduce the 4-player limit to group sizes. The match maker works the same as usual with this single exception that groups can no longer be larger than 4-players.

This is phase 1 of a 3 phase Match Making upgrade and will eventually evolve into a skill based matching system.


Match Making – Phase 1

Players can launch into a match as a solo player.

Players can launch into a match as a group.

Player groups cannot be larger than 4 players.

Player groups can be 2, 3, or 4 players in size.

The Match Maker still checks to make sure there are even Mech weight classes on both teams.

Example: A player group of 4 players launches. The match maker then tries to find more players to fill an 8 player team. The additional players can be another group of 4, or a smaller group of 3 or 2 players and the rest will be filled with solo players.


**New BattleMech:**

Centurion CN9-D

Tonnage: 50

Top Speed: 97.2 kph

Armor: 8.5 tons

Weapons: 2 Medium Lasers, 1 LB 10-X AC, 1 LRM 10 w/ Artemis IV FCS

Hardpoints: 2 Energy, 2 Ballistic, 2 Missile, 1 AMS


**Artemis IV FCS Upgrade**

Artemis improves the grouping size of LRM and SRM volleys.

Artemis improves the lock on time and tracking strength of LRMs

Artemis does NOT add guidance to SRMs.

Upgrade panel has an Artemis category with two options – Artemis and Remove Artemis

The Artemis category will not show up if the ‘Mech does not have Missile hardpoints.

Changing options will automatically upgrade/downgrade any existing eligible missile weapons and swap any eligible missile ammo to the proper type

The Artemis upgrade can be applied to all standard LRM and SRM launchers, but not Streak SRMs or Narc Beacon launchers

Price of the upgrade includes cost of the upgrade itself plus cost of the ammo if there was not enough in the inventory

Ability to select the Artemis upgrade will depend on availability of sufficient slots and tonnage

When viewed in “Loadout”, all Artemis capable weapons will take up one extra slot and weigh one more ton than usual when Artemis is selected

For any weapons that are Artemis eligible, only the Artemis version will show in the equip list

Similarly, only Artemis ammo will appear for the ammo for those weapons


**GAMEPLAY**

Double heat sinks are now 1.4 times as effective as standard heat sinks. This includes DHS's that you place on your Mech as well as those integrated into the engine.

Trial Mechs now get locked when taken into gameplay.

If you leave early, the Trial Mech you were using is locked into the game until it finishes.

Mechs with Weapon Bay Doors can toggle the doors open/closed with ‘/’ slash

Catapult and Centurion now have weapon bay door indicator lights in the cockpit. Green for Open, Yellow for Closed, Red for Destroyed.

Fixed a source of de-synchronization issues (result should be better hit-box detection)

**WEAPONS**

AC/20 heat reduced from 7 to 6

Small Pulse Lasers were only generating 50% of the amount of heat they should have been. This is now fixed.

Small Lasers, Medium Pulse Lasers, and Large Pulse Lasers were only generating 75% of the amount of heat they should have been. This is now fixed.


**MAPS**

Forest Colony

There is now a beached ship splitting the large water expanse. This provides a new area of cover for people engaging long-range enemies.

NEW: Forest Colony Snow

Forest Colony Snow is now part of the random map rotation. During the winter, temperatures drop to (-25°C), making quite a frosty glow around this familiar area - turning this map we know and love into a winter wonderland of low temperatures, frozen ground, with an icy chill in the air.


**BUG FIXES**

Heat value will no longer desync for clients when a Mech does not contain any external heat sinks
The Catapult K2 now has correct geometry/textures when swapping out PPCs.

New equipment on Mechs will default to weapon group 1 instead of not being set
Missiles will now correctly explode at their max range

Locking animation will no longer play when firing SRM if LRM/SSRM ran out of ammo
Machine gun will no longer fire when Mech has been destroyed

Catapult arms will once again blow off correctly when side torso has been destroyed
Greatly reduced Mech ragdoll jittering

Fix an issue where the cockpit and/or arms will randomly jitter

LRM’s will no longer behave incorrectly (spin wildly) when fired at corners of objects at close range
Ammo counter will update with each volley fired

Damage glow amount and size reduced


We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

**********

Since I had so much fun with my [speed optimization calculations last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1hq63g/the_math_behind_optimal_speed_of_your_mech_or_why/), I've spent far more time than I would care to admit to thinking about other ways that math could answer the important mech-questions out there.

I've found a way to mathematically express another one of the big problems we continually debate...and here's the part that will really get the physics/math types out there wet:  I figured out how to map that problem onto another type of problem that was already solved around a hundred years ago.  This means that all the hard work has already been done by people who are long dead (so we get their share of the credit :-) ).

Now, I've found the method to solve the problem, but I haven't actually implemented yet, and there's a big parameter space out there, so I would like to get a working group of similarly minded people together to solve this stuff and put it out there.  Nor do I know the actual answer is going to be.  That's the most exciting part.

Believe me, there is nothing more fun than rubbing your big math wang in the faces of the less mathematically endowed.  It's like how science must have been 100 years ago, you can still make huge leaps forward with only small amounts of work.

So if you are interested in working on some math stuff, and you have some competency in upper division physics/math, please send me a message by this Saturday (include a gmail address), and I will make you part of this new working group.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1373481819.0,,,True,t3_1i00ib,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1i00ib/collaborators_sought_for_future_mechmath_projects/,

I'm not sure what the exact threshold for hearing a round hit is currently, but I know even at 500 M we don't hear an impact.

Thoughts?

How it works:

We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death.

Stats are recorded.

Over 90% of the time we match up, when we don't we have a blast taking arena mechs against 8 mans. Once in a while we do homogenous drops. i.e. all PPC spiders or CN9-A zombies etc... One of the funniest ""missed-sync"" drops was all trial spiders! (we went 4-8)

So basically we leave it up to the Hosts to manage and you to provide the carnage.

PS: We also try to record all matches and post them on our youtube channel.

Missiles which is a whole topic unto themselves and worthy of it, and Heat. 

Currently there is a slight penalty for overheating, you loose control of your mech for a period of time. You can override the automatic shutdown and also engage a quick startup so you loose as little time as possible but both have some risk. If you override the automatic shutdown you take some damage every second your over 100% heat. If you quick startup you also take damage if your over 100% but most of the time a quickstart is not over this threshold anyway making it safe. 

My proposal is to implement a more punishing heat system. You can have a threshold of 100% for the automatic shutdown but heat is still tracked and accrued above this point. A threshold of 105% would serve as a point where you take damage EVEN IF you have shutdown. 

This would make overheating at all a very dangerous proposition without having to enter into the messy business of tweaking weapon stats and altering convergence values.

1361223123.0,15,self.mwo,18rweq,"No amazing K/D ratios or anything, but I had my best match ever in MWO last night, and wanted to share...",BearBryant,21,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/18rweq/no_amazing_kd_ratios_or_anything_but_i_had_my/,"I loaded in on River City Night in my Raven-3L, and the match proceeded like any other River City fight, with the battle quickly moving to upper city for close quarters street fights.  After bobbing and weaving through the upper city streets and harassing their assaults and heavies, I ended up giving chase to an ECM mech and another light out over open water with a friendly Cicada and leaving the main fray in the hands of our heavies and assaults in upper city.

Unfortunately, our D-DC on upper city that was the lynchpin of our attack force in that sector was destroyed with some excellently coordinated fire to its center torso, our lines broke soon after.  Our side was routed, and destroyed piecemeal on its retreat back down the hill towards our base, but not after managing to destroy all remaining heavies.  The successful party scraped by with a Centurion at about 70%, an Atlas at 46% with minimal center torso armor and no right arm as well as a stalker at 62% which was banged up in all armor slots.

Meanwhile, me and Cicadabro managed to mop up the two lights out in open water beneath upper city and, noticing our line had been routed and the constitution of the remaining enemy force, we hightailed it to the enemy base to attempt a Cap (pick your battles...) at their dropship base.  Cicadabro was at about 65%, with myself sustaining heavy damage to the right leg and left torso and completely out of Streak SRMs.  A well placed shot on either of those by the armament the remaining enemy mechs had at their disposal would leave me dead or immobilized.  After getting the cap bar down to about 1/3, Mr. Centurion arrived to stall the cap.  And he served that purpose admirably, holding us off long enough to allow the Atlas/Stalker to arrive before succumbing to our en masse medium laser strafing.  Not 5 seconds after dispatching the Cent, the one armed Atlas lumbers up the front slope with the Stalker close behind.

While the Atlas was weak, an Atlas is still an Atlas, and this one had some pretty heavy firepower in its arsenal.  I initiated a textbook circle strafe around the Atlas on the cap pad, beacause that Stalker was still out there, and I didnt want to be caught standing still behind the Atlas. The slightly slower Cicadabro opted for a ""shooting gallery"" approach, with a wide arc around the obstructions to minimize running into something.  Meanwhile, the Stalker lumbered up and around the battle on the pad, all the while chain firing his weaponry of ER PPC's at the quick mechs that were assaulting his lancemate.  His objective, which only became apparent later, was the large slope to the rear of the base.  From there he could have a better angle to shoot down on his opposition on the landing pad and secure a decisive victory for his force.

The Atlas succumbed on the pad to the combined firepower of our medium lasers, falling face first to the concrete and moving no more.  I brought my mech to bear on the Stalker, who had his torso to the hill and was tracking left to right to attempt a strike at Cicadabro as he went around for another pass.  Cicadabro had sustained substantial fire from the Atlas and was billowing smoke out of an orifice not originally in the design specifications.  As Cicadabro recognized the Stalker's play, he ducked into the structures around the pad and ran around towards the dropship, hoping the Stalker would lose interest in favor of my Raven-3L currently lazing him in the back.  However, his interest was not dissuaded as the Stalker continued turning his torso around to obtain a clear line of sight to the dropship.  As Cicadabro rounded the Dropship, at least 3 ER PPC's caught him square in the cockpit.

Cicadabro was down.  No ejection pod.

I made a couple more passes around the Stalker with my 3 Medium lasers, gambling that his heat generation for the Alpha Strike that eliminated Cicadabro was enough to keep him unable to shoot without overheating for a while.  Unbeknownst to me, he had switched back to chain fire, and the single ER PPC at close range that stripped my right leg armor alerted me to that fact.  I ducked and weaved away through the structures around their cap and retreated down the front slope that the Assault mechs had originally come from.  

This was now a cat and mouse game.  My speed and maneuverability vs. his sheer firepower and durability. He could kill me with one shot...if he could catch me.

Circling around to the left, past the tunnel entrance, I popped my head around the corner and shot lasers at the Stalker, who was still watching his territory like a hawk. His return fire was swift, but not quite swift enough, as I was able to back off around the corner *just* as an ER PPC splashed home on the corner where I was standing moments before.  At this point I ran through the tunnel to the other side, and drove out to be greeted by an alpha strike that hit the wall of the tunnel from his perch, he had missed, but only by a hair.  I retreated out and to the left and back down the front slope to reassess my situation.

I was getting careless. Of course I would go under the tunnel, that was my only available option.  And then I realized that he could track my movements and know when I got close by observing when his sensor package received low signal as a result of my ECM package installed on my BattleMech, and his visual identification of me as a target could be obtained through thermal vision.

I could hear the echoes of my slain lancemates (text chat...) as they gave me encouragement to continue my fight and I formulated a plan.  I put the ECM in the 'Counter' configuration and lined up to assault from the left side again, hoping against hope that he wasn't looking at that corner again and ready to blast me straight to Kerensky himself.  I turned the corner, into hardly ideal conditions...the Stalker was in the process of scanning right to left, and presumably his sensors had just picked me up as an approaching target.  I switched back over to disrupt mode on my ECM package while firing, as he sped up his traverse to meet me.  I dodged right just as an ER PPC hit the ground to my left, presumably at the limit of his torso twist, he was now rotating his mech around to obtain a target picture.  I continued up and around behind him, all the while firing medium lasers at every opportunity.  I initiated my circle strafing as I went around behind him, favoring full speed and knowing full well that on this uneven surface, every time I flew down off the hill, I was damaging my BattleMech's already damaged legs.  I repeated this circle at least 3 times, and even stopped behind him for an extra strike and reversing direction to throw him off.  At this time, I noticed that his center torso had no armor and could probably only withstand one or two more shots before I cored him and won the day...I paused in my circling and waited till I had a good shot, let him traverse to face me, but not enough to shoot me, but enough to acquire his torso as a target.  

I fired.

Enemy Destroyed.

New methods and I WAS WRONG!!!,galorin,18,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/18cbsf/follow_up_on_mech_speed_free_weight_chart_new/,"Remember the spreadsheet I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/182b1k/mech_speed_free_weight_derived_spreadsheet_now/)? Well, it was WRONG! The equations used in the source data were too general, my methodology was flawed, my numbers were wrong, and as a result I came to some perhaps incorrect conclusions. I have since altered the sheet.

[updated file here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B69AQHLDMJo6Y19ZQUpEZDVZV28/edit?usp=sharing), once open you can click on file&gt;download and get your grubby little paws on it. Not a lot of Excel wizardry going on, just don't look too closely at the equations near the top. Substitution up the wazoo and dozens of dependencies.

Some info before we get started, how I arrived at my numbers.

**Assumptions**

* Speed and free tonnage are valued equally  
* Speed tweak has not been applied  
* Maximum armor will be used, with reductions to get to a multiple of 0.5 tons. Three variables was just that bit too much.

**Methodology**

Frame weight is calculated as ten percent of max tonnage

Weight of each engine rating is defined with a minimum of ten sinks

Max armor for each chassis is added to frame weight plus engine weight, then reduced by the minimum number required to bring free weight to a usable tonnage, a multiple of 0.5 tons.

Free tonnage is then modified by endo steel weight reductions if applicable.

Speed is calculated as (Engine/Tonnage) x 16.2

Final free weight is multiplied by speed to give a Battle Value. The maximum BV is then reported as well as the engine size that offers maximum battle value. This is further summarized by inclusion of free tonnage at max armor, minimum armor points to remove, and free tonnage after armor reduction. The calculations are performed at the top of each of the first four sheets and collated for graphing on the fifth.

The sixth sheet and onward contains a graph for the BV for each chassis. Should be a lot easier to read but it doesn't have max values in it, those are on the spreadsheets.

The summary for each engine type and skeleton material is on the first four tabs in lines 24-42 for each chassis or variant with different engine specs.

**Conclusions**

Many of the engine recommendations are different from the previous sheet as every Mech is as fully armored so as to leave no tonnage unused. I haven't done any what-if analysis to see what happens when you strip percentages of tonnage. That will be even more heavy processing and I don't know if it's something that would be useful. **In my opinion, the self-imposed requirement for full armor has played a major part in knocking down engine recommendations from the previous sheet**. For example, my optimized Hunchie has sacrificed leg armor to fit a larger engine. The numbers without factoring in armor  supported the use of a heavier engine, but with max armor a smaller engine was required for optimum balance of speed and potential power.

If you want to see the effect armor has, just zero out the values in Cells H24-H42, the equations will tell you the right engine for no armor, so you can choose how best to optimize for speed, firepower and durability.

Of note are the zero and negative BV. At zero BV, the engine weight equals the free tonnage. This means that after applying armor and engine plus heat sinks, there is no tonnage available for weaponry. Armor may be reduces but this strategy is of questionable benefit at these extremeties. Negative BV indicates that the engine rating is available for that chassis, but the weight exceeds free tonnage. Worst offenders are the Centurion D and the Cicada.

FF armor is an absolute pain to calculate out, as it doesn't break down into whole numbers. Cell B44 on the first four sheets holds the constant for # of points per ton. Alter at your own risk.

If, after review you disagree with my findings or discover that I am once again **wrong**, as happens occasionally, let me know what I did wrong and I will amend it. I can also look at stuff that you want me to look at, getting my stats chops back in shape.

**Late edit** Doing more calculations and it's looking like XL+Endo always wins, but I know that this isn't optimal. Running a Cataphract with an XL may be bad news, but a Catapult with XL is fine, both because of how large the side torso profile is. 

Run an Atlas with an XL and Endo and you really neuter available slots, so while the free tonnage exists for really big guns, you don't have the space left to fit them. 

On bigger mechs, removing several tons of armor doesn't impact surivability as much as smaller mechs, but provides real gains to available tonnage. I am exploring how to account for this.

I am open to suggestions for dealing with these problems.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1360667231.0,,CR2,True,t3_18cbsf,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/18cbsf/follow_up_on_mech_speed_free_weight_chart_new/,

I was wondering what the community's opinion on friendly fire penalties is. Right now I think it is kind of screwy. I notice in pugs people don't mind taking risky shots right through me if I have enough armor not to be killed. It many games I take way more friendly fire damage then enemy damage. Meanwhile, a few times I have accidentally TK'd by just barely hitting an ally with a laser when they were so low.

To me it doesn't make sense to be penalized with a TK for doing less than a percent of damage when others are dealing huge amounts of friendly fire damage. Moreover, I think a lot of players don't realize how much friendly fire they are dealing and having those penalties spelled out at the end of the game would be helpful. Even if the system just told you how much friendly fire damage you dealt would be a huge improvement.

1358953709.0,16,self.mwo,174hjv,[RFC]Public API access to mechbay functionality,galorin,20,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/174hjv/rfcpublic_api_access_to_mechbay_functionality/,"I don't know if this has been discussed internally or externally on the Wasteland that is the MWO public forum, but I think providing at least some defined API for interacting with our mechs would be a boon to the community.

We should all be aware of Smurfy's excellent tools, they're on the sidebar and have saved me a fortune. Pity I didn't find out about it until *after* I had wasted the windfall on mechs that I didn't like or didn't work in combat. It is interesting to try and take a configuration from the online mechlab and re-create it in-game, with (Personally) armor reallocation being the most arduous part.

Another task that I find time consuming is taking a mech configured in the game and recreating it in the Online lab to try various tweaks. Here, armour is faster, but moving around the mech is much more time consuming and error-prone.

I would contend that providing API access would allow us to easily take a tool such as Smurfy's online mech lab, hit a button, and automatically add, import, export, edit, or remove a Mech from our mechbay. This would also allow the developer community to develop Android, iOS, etc. apps for managing our inventory. It reduces the steps required for planning and purchasing mechs.

As an added, personal/private servers (if implemented) could use these APIs to call in a player's account and mechbay so each server would not need to maintain their own copy of potentially irrelevant player data; calling in only what data was required for connected players.

I recognize this is not without risk. Even if the API did have authentication tokens for every transaction, publishing the API would leave it open to security exploits and hacking. This is not without downsides, but I would like to know if it is a possibility. 

Something of this sort would have needed to have been planned for early in the development cycle and is not easy to put in later. Maybe I just haven't been around long enough to see it. Heck, if it is out there, then I'd love to cut my teeth on Android development by writing something that makes use of the API.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CR2,True,t3_174hjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/174hjv/rfcpublic_api_access_to_mechbay_functionality/,

As I said I would keep you up to date... going into test today... possibly live next patch...

1) AutoCannon projectile speeds increasing. AC/20 ~ 900m/s. AC/LBX10 ~ 1100m/s. AC/UAC/5 ~1300m/s.
2) PPC and ERPPC projectile speeds increasing to 2000m/s (AC/2 speed).

I've also looked into doing some tweaks with the NARC and TAG systems. So far I'm planning on increasing the time that a NARC beacon lasts from 15 seconds to 20 seconds. TAG range will be boosted from 450m to 750m.

These changes will go through testing and if it feels right, you'll see them next patch.

Open Beta Update #5

Upcoming Patch - Tuesday Dec. 4th @ 10AM – 1PM PDT

UPDATE

Happy Holidays MechWarriors! Open beta update 5 is inbound!

‘Tis the season to Deck your Mech with holiday themed Items! These Items are here for a limited time and are sure to please the misses’. “Look honey I hung the Xmas lights”. For some added tactical options you can also turn your Xmas lights on and off. Oddly enough powering down your BattleMech does not affect the Xmas lights, they are powered by holiday spirit!

ECM is here and personally I can’t wait to ruin some streak cats day with this excellent piece of equipment. I am going to be honest with you ECM is a game changer so let us know how you feel about ECM on the forums because lately I think you guys have been holding back and not telling us how you really feel.

The Cataphract Hero Mech “Ilya Muromets” is in this patch with an excellent skin by our man Hayden. What can I say about this Mech? “Ilya?.. More Like Kill ya!” is how our tools programmer Kyle L put it and I have to agree.

I can’t remember but I think you guys wanted 8-player groups too right? Well those are in there too. You choose “8-Player Required” when creating a group. You will require 8-players to launch and your groups will only be matched against other 8-player groups.

Once again I want to remind you we have people 100% focused on performance and networking and we are making headway. The people making these above features are separate group of resources.

Until next patch.

-Matt Newman!

What are peoples thoughts on the Medium 'Mechs in the current 12v12 format with grouped spawning? 

I've been a lover of fast medium brawlers after mastering Hunchbacks and Trebuchets, playing them in max-speed setups and buddying up with assaults or lights to flank and/or swarm lone targets or smaller groups of players.

I haven't played a whole lot since the patch on Tuesday, but the games I have played in the Golden Boy, my HBK-4SP and TBT-7M have all been fairly unsuccessful. The lack of hard engagement, the tendency to peak and poke, and the increase in fighting in ""blobs"" as I see others referring to it as, have made brawling in a medium even more difficult that it already was in my experience.

I've had more success in 12s by fitting my TBT-7K with an XL280, ERPPC and Guass (but then what's the point in playing a Medium?) than I've had in the solid/reliable medium builds like my SRM6A/4ML 4SP. I find it difficult to ever find anyone alone or a small lance separated, and if they are, there's a good chance with the increased number of players that you'll expose yourself to multiple enemies with PPC's when you do attempt a flank on someone caught out of position.

In MechWarrior: Online, firepower, armor, and mobility work in conjunction with the size of the map/terrain.

Examples:

-Firepower has distance related traits. Brawlers aren't a preferred 'Mech for a large map such as Alpine or Tourmaline.

-Mobility obviously has a lot to do with map size. Quicker 'Mechs traverse it at a much faster rate.

-Armor increases survivability. This is actually more related to the lack of necessity to complete the objective opposed to eliminating the enemy team (which brings me to my next point).

The current map rotation changes map sizes, terrains, temperature, etc which is a UI1.0 problem. There is no pre-game lobby, so there is no organization as to which 'Mech is chosen and why. I believe this (along with only having two game modes) is why we see more assault/heavy 'Mechs on the field. Why?

Let's say we had a pre-game lobby. You see that you're about to drop on Alpine, and it is on Conquest. You choose a light 'Mech, and you notice the rest of your team does as well. Why did majority of your team choose a fast-moving light instead of an assault/heavy?

-A bunch of Assault 'Mechs on the enemy team spreading out to attempt outcapping you is not going to end well. They will be isolated and picked off one by one.

-Lights are faster, get to capture points quicker

These two things (ideally) result in a win. There is no necessity for elimination of the enemy team.

Now let's look at another scenario: You're in the pre-game lobby, and you notice that you're going to drop on River City and it is Conquest. This is a small map, so objectives are pretty accessible to any speed/size 'Mech. You pick an Assault, and so does your team. Why?

-Close quarters combat on a map where the objective isn't a priority, (can get to them easily) but your enemies are because of the small distance between you and them.

-Not big and open, flat, only slight elevation, it is a different terrain than other maps.

Now this, along with getting less C-Bills/XP for capturing, and bland game-modes, are what seem to cause the high usage of Assault and Heavy 'Mechs.

Although I understand we are still using UI1.0, and UI2.0 *should* fix these things, but this seems like a plausible explanation for the current ""Assault/Heavy"" meta. 

**ALSO:** 12v12s will make this concept I have explained even more extreme. Who will care about objectives on River City when there are 12 enemy 'Mechs 1000meters away?

**tl;dr**: Varying map sizes/terrains in rotation change how much of a priority objectives should be. When no one knows which map they are dropping on, they tend to take a 'Mech that can get them the win under the strategy of eliminating the enemy team (which is the default for both Assault and Conquest).

=====================

Any thoughts? I feel that this contributes to the current meta and there do need to be more quantitative incentives for completion of objectives such as higher cbills, XP, etc with game-mode changes. I understand new game modes/new UI will be coming out soon, so maybe these problems will be fixed, but this may be a plausible explanation for the time being.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CI,True,t3_1izspa,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1izspa/the_current_problem_with_objectives_in_mwo/,

PGI has previously stated that those with inconsistent pings seem to be affected the most by the HSR issues. Have they looked at the effect of dropped packets? 

If the userbase is being subjected to lost packets because of throttling at a tier-1 ISP level, it would be hard to detect or do anything from PGI's standpoint

Could this be the cause of our HSR woes?

We already have a pretty complicated game, in terms of the actual gameplay, both in the match and in the ""meta"" or the mechlab. Where complexity seems to be increasing is in the actual numbers, with various special cases and formulae being introduced. I'm referring to things like:

* Heat sinks - DHS are 1.4x as efficient, *except* the ones in the engine, which are 2x as efficient (but that doesn't include the optional ones mounted in the engine, only the built-in heatsinks.)
* Maximum engine size is 1.4x the stock engine for lights, 1.3x for mediums, 1.2x for heavies and assaults *except* that it also cannot exceed 8.5x the max tonnage of your mech
* The critical hits system
* The various ranges associated with ECM, which vary according to equipment and upgrades
* Diminishing returns of cadet bonus - your match rewards for your first 50 matches are determined by a *logarithm*?
* Elo (not so much of a problem, since the details are hidden)

It's understandable, with the tabletop roots, that the game is going to be complex, and a lot of that complexity is going to be in the numbers. Personally, I don't really have trouble keeping up with these rules (though mwowiki is invaluable), but I've been introduced to them gradually, and I have above-average mathematical education. For a new player, or someone not terribly numerate, is all this a bit too confusing? I don't believe in dumbing-down, but I do believe in the KISS principle: Are there not less complicated solutions to these problems? For instance, adding hardpoint sizes, or making hardpoints fall into more categories would be one way to tackle boating of high-damage weapons, which would be easier to understand than the coming heat scale. A simple hard-limit for each weight class on engine sizes would have solved the problem of superfast hunchbacks without requiring a calculator in the mechlab.

It may be that these things are really needed to maintain balance and still allow player freedom, and I don't think any single one of these rules is bad, *per se*, I am just concerned that the combined effect is to make the game's rules as clear as mud.

Please keep them somewhat realistic.

Here are mine:

* Add an MC purchase option alternative for expensive gear like Engines
* Remake the Champion (10% XP boost) concept as an MC-only purchasable module (instead of adding fake variants of mechs that many players will simply never buy)
* Additional colors (e.g., Metals: gold, silver, bronze, copper, etc)
* Additional camos (e.g., Plaid, Racing stripe variations, Spotted, a better take on Buccaneer (something more pirate-y than throwing a skull-n-bones on what otherwise looks more like a Vagabond scheme should (strips of duct tape placed haphazardly)), Battle Damaged (see the Cent's shield arm; battle scars are not just for hero mechs)
* Hero mechs for certain existing chassis that don't have them yet (for me it'd be the Atlas, Jagermech, Spider, Raven, and Hunchback. Maybe the Trebuchet) and additional heroes for the Awesome and Cataphract would likely be insta-purchase.
* Sales are always good. Chassis sales, variant sales, Premium Time sales, camo and color sales, and XP conversion sales all tend to work for me. Of course an MC sale would work as well.
* The option to buy/gift MC for a friend [daza82](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1dryou/things_that_would_get_us_to_spend_even_more_mc/c9ta33z)

&gt;We have to starve out the current matches so you'll likely notice that games are even harder to find for the next 15 minutes while the system cycles but should then be back to the same times as before this patch.

I dragged the files out into my MWO folder long ago trying to get it to work. I left it in there without clearing it out. A month on, it now does indeed work! It plays when the start-up sequence initiates.

To get it to work, you'll need to download those files again:     http://mwo.xhair.net/files/match_intro_music_feb5.7z

Place the Music folder inside MechWarrior Online/Game.

The best thing is that you can add your own music too!    

Copy the &lt;Pattern Name=""mat....&gt; to a new line within &lt;MainLayer&gt;&lt;/MainLayer&gt;. Ensure that you give it a new 'Name' as this is how it's referred to internally. Finally, point the Filename at the actual location of the new file. 

You may need to convert them to '.ogg' (use Audacity) as I haven't had much luck with mp3.

I don't promise that this will work from patch to patch as PGI do change things internally. When they reimplement music officially, you'll want to remove the files. Remove the 'Music' folder to uninstall.
