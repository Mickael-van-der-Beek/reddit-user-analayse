I spotted an Arduino kit at Radioshack last summer, and despite being pretty broke, picked it up instantly. After 8 months of tinkering, and obsessively reading this subreddit, I now have a job working for the North American headquarters of a Swiss company  that makes and installs temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors and logging equipment for the pharmaceutical, biomedical, and other industries. They ship me all over the US and Canada and promise me international travel soon. My 2nd week at work I had to take a day off to attend to some business for my (political candidate) client and my boss insisted I bill his company for my full 8 hours anyway. Next week I get another paid day off, because he says it's 'only fair' since everyone else is on salary and I'm only a month from going permanent with the firm. We have an office *sailboat*, for parties and such, and I spend my non-travel days in the calibration lab building, testing, calibrating, certifying, and custom-modding our equipment to meet customer needs. I get paid for hours of gaming while I wait for calibrations at -198C or +80%RH or whatever the build order calls for. Yesterday I submitted my reference design to the HQ for a small PCB (the first I've ever designed of any kind!) that would save 5-10 minutes of jumper soldering per alarm-bracketed datalogger, a change in our products that would save the company tens of thousands of dollars a year and could allow the US office to give pay raises to all of our technical staff.

Thanks to the people of this subreddit and the makers of the awesome Arduino for giving me an entire career out of what I thought would simply be a little hobby. Keep tinkering! And for those who are new and trying to learn, keep at it, your 'silly' or 'pointless' projects you're building 'just to see if you can' can lead you anywhere in the world, literally.",,False,,t5_2qknj,1369303838.0,,,True,t3_1ets30,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1ets30/thanks_to_the_uno_and_rarduino_my_life_is_awesome/,

1357577822.0,141,self.arduino,164kp2,As promised I have opened the source to my quad copter project,,163,22,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/164kp2/as_promised_i_have_opened_the_source_to_my_quad/,"https://github.com/mikeshub/openCopter

The long awaited opening of my project’s source is finally here. Sorry no video this time. My copilot is taking his sweet time getting me the video. But I promise there is a crash (got to give my fans what they want to see). I was taking it upside down then switching it to self-level mode. On one of the attempts my finger missed the switch and it hit the ground really hard. No major damage though, just busted all the props.

There are two versions of this software. One is the full system that with a lot of patience and effort it can be made to loiter on GPS. The light version will run in rate mode or self-leveling mode. I have been having a giant amount of trouble getting loiter to work really well. The flight test before last I thought that I was just about there. I had it staying in an about 2 square meter box.  This last time I couldn’t get close to that. As best I can determine it is because I need to take the time and do the full soft and hard iron calibration of the compass. Heading hold will work without that calibration. The full version will only work on a MEGA. With some minor changes it could be made to run on a Due. One would have to change the timer syntax as well as the macros I use for the SS lines. The GPS I am using is the UBLOX running in binary mode.

The light version could be used on an UNO or similar, but it would require a number of changes. The timers would need to be switched, the SS lines would need to be switched, the ports for the RC serial lines would need to switched, etc.

The PID loops are different than the standard PID loop. A friend of mine was nice enough to model a quad for me in MATLAB so it could be tuned more easily (and I already asked, he won’t share the model).

http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/pidcontroller.html

That is where the filter coefficient comes in. As best I can tell a lower coefficient is more like a raw derivative term and a higher coefficient term will have more filtering. Hopefully we have a controls guy who lurks around here and can either confirm or deny my assumption.
The tunings well with my DJI 450 frame that uses 30A ESCs, scorpion motors, 8045 DJI props on a 4s system.

Any RC transmitter can be used. SBUS, DMS2 or DSMx serial, and standard RC signals. The RC signal driver will auto-detect which is being used and map it to the correct values. SBUS requires an inverter to work. The transmitter should have no trims and use the default travel extents. 

My main goal of this project was to make this code easy to read and easy to understand. I think very highly of the work done by the multiWii  guys and the arduPilot guys, but I find their code to be dense and difficult to read.

If you decided to try this code I will be happy to help you with drivers for other sensors or clarification about bits and pieces. This code has no failsafe in it right now (shame on me). I cannot stress how dangerous these things can be. If you try this code, or any open source multirotor code, exercise great caution. 

Next I am going to do some PCB design (after incorporating some robust failsafe routines of course). I am going to make a breakout board for the openIMU running all the sensors on the SPI bus. I am going to make a shield for the MEGA that will work with the full version of this software. And if I get really adventurous I am going to make an all in one FC unit. And I might try to monetize that part of the project if my results are good enough. I am also going to port the code to some of the more popular AVR based flight controllers like multiWii and possibly the KK boards. I am also thinking about starting a website for this project. I’ll be happy to answer any questions and I hope this helps someone out.

He wrote an [applied thesis on Arduino](http://www.varesano.net/blog/fabio/my-mos-thesis-using-arduino-tangible-human-computer-interaction) and his projects led to the manufacturing of the [FreeIMU](http://www.varesano.net/projects/hardware/FreeIMU) sensors platform and many other solutions.

Today I learned that he’s [gone](http://www.varesano.net/blog/fabio/ciao-fabio). Suddenly, unexpectedly and too early.

It’s obvious that he had the desire and rare discipline to study, invent, make and ship; for that I admired him, and I am saddened thinking of all the things he could have done. But this beautiful world is full of talented people with brains and guts just like Fabio, and he made sure that all these people could be enabled by his work even in his absence.

He actively believed in open source, and for this reason his hardware and software projects won’t be buried with him. At the very least they will remain forever on the Internet for everyone to see. But most importantly, they will inspire other makers, potentially for generations to come, and lead them to improve on his work and his design, thus keeping his legacy alive and sparking.

Ciao Fabio.

Recently, I received a pretty rare [1983 Microsoft mouse](http://imgur.com/a/5bFq5), affectionately known as the ""green-eyed"" mouse. There are some nice pictures online. I found a bit of information regarding the protocol, but since it's a ""bus mouse,"" there isn't really a protocol, so to speak. It's just a bunch of switches with a common ground. The two rotary encoders are fed directly out along with the two buttons, so it's up to some external (or internal to the Arduino) pull-up resistors to make them work. 

I decided to use all four interrupt pins on my Leonardo to decode both encoders. I wanted the maximum responsiveness, even if it would take a hit on button clicks. I'm just polling the buttons and sending a Mouse.press() or Mouse.release() command when something changes. 

[Here](http://pastebin.com/qzdFTFSV) is the pastebin for my current working code on my Leonardo. It works great! That is, for a mouse intended for CGA 320x200 resolution! 

My next step is to be able to differentiate the mouse motion to get speed, which I can then use to apply a scaling factor to the Mouse.move() functions to get some decent acceleration. Right now, it's pretty much useless on a big monitor.

- 5V dpdt relays

- assortment of linear(NOT audio) potentiometers(1k or 10k are typically fine)

- 7 segment displays(common anode are usually better choice)

- assortment of logic gate ics (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, NOT(inverters)) 

- schmitt triggers

- light dependent resistors(change resistance with light intensity)

- photo diodes

- opto couplers

- Other transistors like tip120(darlington), c945, 2n2222, some PNP variants

- FETs(enhancement mode and depletion mode)

- shift registers(less common but have uses, ie 74hc595)

- (Possibly) dc to dc step up/down converters

Is there a certain site that would be better to buy from online or is amazon just fine? Also, they seem relatively cheap are there different types of arduinos that can do more things and are more expensive? And are there accessory thingies that I he would also need? He already has a lot of... gadgety tech... things. I hope the questions are even relevant to an ardunio.

I recently got an arduino Uno Rev3 + Arduino official WiFi shield.  The example code just would not work.  I could get a connection via WPA2 and I could even ping back and forth but clients couldnt connect, telnet would instantly close, etc. 

I went through the somewhat scary firmware update procedure for the wifi shield - no change.

Finally, I saw a reference in a single post talking about a similar issue and the ""fix"" was to use an older version of the arduino software.  Sure enough, uninstalled the latest and used arduino 1.03 software and drivers - hey presto, everything works as expected.

48h of misery and fear that I had bricked the expensive wifi shield!  Hope this helps the next poor n00b facing a similar issue.

You can get an additional 5% one-time discount by using a recommender. My reddit username works. The recommender username is entered at checkout.

So, if you are a first time customer, use a recommender for 5% off. The price of the Arduino Nano goes down to **$11.64**, which I believe is quite a deal.

While I'm at it, I might also add that BuyInCoins has some quite nice peripherals to go with the Arduino boards. You can find their complete collection by [searching the site for ""Arduino""](http://www.buyincoins.com/search--arduino----1.html) (don't try to navigate their categories, they aren't very well organised). Some examples are [a kit with an Arduino Duemillanove, a prototype shield with a mini breadboard, a large breadboard, jumper cables, 9V battery with adapter, remote control, 7 segment displays and a LOT of components, all stuffed in a nice box and sold for $44.29](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/arduino-component-basic-element-pack-set-kit-case-for-arduino-starter-beginners-product-11631.html), [a prototype shield with a mini breadboard for $6.75](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/prototype-prototyping-shield-protoshield-mini-breadboard-for-arduino-duemilanove-product-11855.html), and [a wireless transciever for $2.58](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/perfect-high-quality-new-nrf24l01-2-4ghz-wireless-transceiver-module-arduino-product-9036.html).

They also have great deals on some general stuff that might be useful, like [a mini breadboard for $1.50](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/new-240-point-solderless-pcb-breadboard-bread-board-8-5mm-syb-46-product-11094.html), [1602 LCD display for $2.99](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/new-character-lcd-module-display-lcm-1602-16x2-hd44780-blue-blacklight-product-9000.html) and a [4x4 keypad for $1.95](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/new-high-quality-4-x-4-matrix-array-16-key-membrane-switch-keypad-keyboard-product-10236.html).

By the way, there's an additional $0.1 off for buying 2 or more products, and some nice volume discounts for buying more than five pieces of a single item.

I believe that's about it about BuyInCoins. They aren't the only place for cheap Arduino stuff though. DealExtreme also has some, but they're just not quite as cheap. For example, they have an [Arduino Nano for $16.90](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/arduino-nano-v3-0-81877?r=66422016) which is still cheap, but not nearly as cheap as BuyInCoins. DX might have some accessories that BIC doesn't have though, be sure to do a search.

One thing that DX has that BIC doesn't (if you don't buy it in a kit) are jumper cables. DX has a nice set of [65 jumper cables for $3.20](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/breadboard-jumper-wires-for-electronic-diy-65-cable-pack-118826?r=66422016). Maker Shed has similar cables they call ""deluxe jumper cables"" and charge $9.

So, what's left to get? LED's! Interestingly enough, BIC charges $2.29 for a set of 50 3mm red LED's in their shop, but sell the same LED's for $1.09 on eBay (320627696437), still with free shipping.

There are two things you have to keep in mind when ordering from China:

* Shipping might take a while. 2 weeks is to be expected.
* Customs might add charges.

OK so I know I could take off the shelf code and run it to fly my quad copter. But where is the fun in that? Also, to make it really changeling I am using only a gyro and PID loops for stability. Once I get the gains on the PID loop right an experienced pilot should have no trouble flying it. This all came about because I started the project with the cypress PSOC5. I am using a Futaba SBUS receiver to control everything. The PSOC5 is going to run a 9DOF Kalman filter for the stability and heading hold that I really want out of the quad copter. Problem was all the interrupts needed for the motor signals were giving me a lot of trouble and bit banging the SBUS protocol takes a lot of processor time. Eventually, a gumstix is going to give me a full navigation solution so I can program the quad and let it fly around all on its own. So arduino to the rescue!

http://i.imgur.com/TFatx.jpg

That's the full setup sans gumstix. The arduino communicates with the cypress via a SPI link. Here is the quad copter:

http://i.imgur.com/nBQV6.jpg

It flies badly right now. I need to tweak the gains on my PID loops. Since I don't have a plant model for the quad I'm just guessing based on what my pilot tells me (I suck at flying). Not plant model means the typical stability analysis methods don't work. To make that be not just an enormous pain I decided to use an XBEE link to transmit the gains:

I just purchased an [Arduino kit](http://www.makershed.com/Ultimate_Arduino_Microcontroller_Pack_p/msump1.htm) and I'm really excited about it. I've started up building a few small projects based on tutorials I've found online.  However, I'm having a lot of trouble building my circuits.

I should mention that I have no issues programming. In fact, I'm a CS major and I program for a living. Also, while in college, I built an 8 bit processor on Circuit Maker. So I have no issues with building ""logical"" circuits either. Where my problem comes in is when I need to add a resistor next to an LED or a capacitor in parallel with a switch. I really don't understand any of that.

I've looked around the books on the side bar, but most of these seem to teach you more how to get started programming than anything else. I've also looked at some of the tutorials, but most of these tell you how to build the circuit you need rather than explaining WHY the circuit is being built the way it is being built. I want to be able to think ""I want to build X"" and then just know where to add resistors, capacitors and whatnot.

Anyway, does anyone have any recommendations on books or online resources that teach (and maybe even have some Arduino projects) more heavily on the electronics side?

[Here] (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0nOlQ9bqIadTkY4cXVYbXRzWWM/edit?usp=sharing) is a video of it (was hard to play looking through the phone camera), the code can be found [here] (http://pastebin.com/DxnynyJF).  I don't have a picture or diagram of the hardware (beyond what you can see in the video) but it is just the LCD, Wii Nunchuk through a [WiiChuk Adaoter] (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9281) and a piezo buzzer for sound.

It is a pretty simple space invader type of game played on a 16X2 LCD using a Wii Nunchuk as a controller (joystick left/right to control the gun and Z button to shoot).  I've managed to add a difficulty selection and multiple types of enemies that change as your score increases, each going a little faster.  I have also added some effects for when you shoot which I think creates a nice visual effect (almost animated).  I have some sound effects and music added, but I don't love them yet.  The code is working fine to play the notes, I just can't come up with a melody that I like (probably related to my incredible lack of musical ability).

The game is played to 10 points (score displayed upper right) at which point it displays your time to win.  You start off with 9 shots (count displayed bottom right), which only reduce on misses.  If your shots reach 0 it costs 1 point to reload, if your score falls below 0 you lose.

Anyone should feel free to download the code if you want to try and play it on your own.  If you don't have a WiiChuk Adapter I think it would be a pretty simple rewrite to make it work with either 3 push buttons, 1 to increase x2 (move right), 1 to decrease x2 (move left) and 1 to shoot.  It could also be done with a push button to shoot and map a potentiometer reading to x2 which could move the gun left/right.

I'm still pretty new to Arduino (and programing, have had this less than a month) so I'm sure there are some things in the code that may not be done in the best way, especially related to the audio parts, still trying to figure that out, but I'm pretty pleased with how it is coming along and wanted to share it.",,False,,t5_2qknj,False,,,True,t3_17t1wa,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/17t1wa/arduino_lcd_game_project_video_and_code/,

We're a small Spanish-based publishing house which is trying to get our first special dedicated to free hardware off the ground.

The magazine is 84 pages long and contains all original content, focusing on practical Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects (although we do take a look at a couple of other education-oriented boards). The magazine is professionally written, edited, laid out and produced. We have, after all, been producing magazines since 2004.

[Some examples of content](http://imgur.com/a/ed4Cc). 

As we do not have many resources anymore (the current financial crisis is all but wiping out SMEs like ours in Spain), we thought that [we would do some crowdfunding](http://www.lanzanos.com/proyectos/especial-hardware-linux-magazine/) to help us finance part of the production costs, mainly the printing. Our goal is to reach 4000 euros.

Although the campaign itself has not been a disaster, it has slowed down enough to make us worry that we may not achieve our goal. That's why I thought of appealing to you guys. Please note that the magazine is **IN SPANISH** (although we do have some interesting rewards with books and magazines in English. Some cool hardware too), so I am appealing to those who can read Spanish or know people who read Spanish and would be interested in this sort of thing. We will send copies to anywhere in the world (the crowdfunding cost for magazine + posting + packaging to the US is 6 euros)  and there is also a downloadable digital version for 2 euros.

The rasberry pi is basically acting as a complex SD shield, but with a wifi dongle it gives us the ability to do neat things like calibrate the altimeter over a SSH socket, or access the data remotely without removing the payload from the rocket.

You lose a lot of resolution in your timing, but if you need a simple ""use as little power for the next few seconds"" solution, this is it:

    #include &lt;io.h&gt;
    ...
    /*
      lpDelay(quarterSeconds) - Low Power Delay.  Drops the system clock
                                to its lowest setting and sleeps for 256*quarterSeconds milliseconds.
    */
    int lpDelay(int quarterSeconds) {
      int oldClkPr = CLKPR;  // save old system clock prescale
      CLKPR = 0x80;    // Tell the AtMega we want to change the system clock
      CLKPR = 0x08;    // 1/256 prescaler = 60KHz for a 16MHz crystal
      delay(quarterSeconds);  // since the clock is slowed way down, delay(n) now acts like delay(n*256)
      CLKPR = 0x80;    // Tell the AtMega we want to change the system clock
      CLKPR = oldClkPr;    // Restore old system clock prescale
    }

Just to repeat the comments, you don't call this function with the # of ms to wait, you call it with *the number of quarters of a second.*  If you want to sleep for 1 second, use **lpDelay(4)**, not lpDelay(1000).

The other caveat is that this probably won't work if you're reading from the serial port.  Writing to the serial port should work fine.

Anyway, I tested a simple LED blinking sketch with this - current draw on my Uno dropped from 50ma using normal delay() to 38ma with lpDelay().  For reference, the lowest I've ever managed to make my Uno consume by using various voodoo involving sleep modes and timers is 36ma, so with this you get pretty close to the minimum without resorting to any hocus pocus at all.

It can:  
- set off alarm via buzzer, but before that it sends e-mail and text message (text msg is wip)  
- support analog sound sensors (sound level over certain threshold if system is active will cause alarm)  
- support IR distance sensors (if distance sensor goes low, for example someone walking through a door with sensor next to it and the system is active it will cause alarm)  
- support window sensors (built into some windows already to change a connection inside internal wires when window goes open)  
- be switched on/off by RFID (with certain time for the system to be deactivated via RFID before alarm goes off)  
- light LEDs appropriately

1308083465.0,47,self.arduino,hzpfg,My practical application of an Arduino with a Parallax RFID reader and Processing to force my subordinates to return their master key.,voltsampslabs,51,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/hzpfg/my_practical_application_of_an_arduino_with_a/,"Originally read in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/hcsh3/rarduino_can_anyone_recommend_an_rfid_solution_to/), my problem: One building under my control has a master key that the security officers there kept forgetting to place back in the cabinet... usually bringing it home. I cannot duplicate the master key but instead wanted a method to enforce its use and annoy them if they don't put it back... additionally, they're supposed to log when they use it on the computer but are too lazy to do so.

The *proper* solution: Hire competent security guards. Out of the question.


**TL;WR:** *My* solution: A [Parallax RFID Card Reader](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/114/Default.aspx) sitting [in a key cabinet](http://imgur.com/X28FA.jpg) which is constantly [polling the presence of an RFID-Tag](http://imgur.com/rWeg6.jpg) which the master key is permanently affixed to [connected to](http://imgur.com/Hrpdf.jpg) an Arduino Duemilanove in a conduit [hidden](http://imgur.com/6qryQ.jpg) underneath the desk.

[Here is my schematic](http://imgur.com/yC5RN.jpg). (I think Pins 3/4 in the schematic are switched in terms of which one is grounded and code. Check your optoisolator for polarity.) I built my own [makeshift shield](http://imgur.com/CVNoM.jpg) (one [with flash](http://imgur.com/gazJh.jpg)) The green wire goes to a door-buzzing system which needs to be hooked up to an optoisolator since the door system also deals with the fire panel... I did not want to create a ground loop since I'm not a fire panel tech. When the anode receives signal that the door is being buzzed, Pin 4 reads HIGH for a moment. 

This triggers the arduino to serial.println the number ""4"" to the desk computer, which a simple Processing application running in the background receives. Processing then runs a VBS macro to create an ""appointment"" in Microsoft Outlook (we use a common Calendar as an event log.) The pop-up interrupts their internet surfing for a moment while they spend 4-7 seconds of their busy life to type in the name or company of the person buzzed in, then click save.

Likewise, the RFID is constantly polling if there's an RFID tag in the cabinet. If it is not found for 5 seconds, serial.println ""1"" to trigger Processing to run my keyOut.vbs file, which prompts my security guards to justify a reason for. Once this is done, if the key is returned, serial.println ""2"" to trigger processing to run my keyIn.vbs file, which silently (but appropriately) appends ""key returned"" to the Event Log in Outlook.

If the key is not returned, *awol* and *minsawol* are ticking. When *awol* &gt; 550 (about 1 minute) it +1's minsawol and triggers Digital Pin 5 high for 100ms which makes a small speaker beep, reminding and annoying my security guard to return the key (assuming he's in the office. He may very well be busy elsewhere, but the beep ain't botherin him!) When minsawol reaches 120 (roughly 2 hours) it triggers serial.println ""3"" which signals Processing to execute keyAWOL.vbs...

keyAWOL.vbs silently sends an e-mail to my cell-phone-carriers' email-to-text-message address (##########@txt.att.net) where I have notification that the keys have been missing for 2 hours. At the point, they've probably already left for the day and heads are going to roll but until I can make a small enough keyfob to electrocute them where they stand, this will have to suffice.",,False,,t5_2qknj,True,,,True,t3_hzpfg,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/hzpfg/my_practical_application_of_an_arduino_with_a/,
1294798883.0,46,self.arduino,f0md2,How does /r/Arduino feel about a subreddit wide contest with awesome prizes?,sptrks,59,13,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/f0md2/how_does_rarduino_feel_about_a_subreddit_wide/,"I got this idea to start a contest for all /r/Arduino members. I really think a fun and involved contest would be really good for this subreddit. First of all it would be fun to see what everyone makes. Secondly I have some awesome prizes that I can put up for grabs. Third(ly?) something like this will help this subreddit in a number of ways:


* It will get lurkers actively involved in creating and learning
* Promote user contributed projects and documentation
* Possibly expand the member base of our little community
* And most importantly show that anyone is capable of making interesting projects


My hidden agenda also includes using this contest to catapult my earlier idea of a community run repository of knowledge that would include fully documented projects, tutorials and possibly an **actual** FAQ page ;)


So what does everyone think? If only a few people are interested I am not going to waste the energy. However, if a good number of members are enthused about something like this then I would love to get everything rolling. 

So **if** you are in fact interested this is what I had planned. Register a blog with Blogger or some other blogging service. Keep it and this subreddit updated with projects and competition deadline statuses. We can treat the website as our temporary repository of projects and we can go from there. 

Contest wise this is what I had envisioned: 

* The contest will consist of making something awesome/crazy/original with the Arduino. 

* Submissions **MUST** include full documentation. 

* Opening up different ways of winning. This would allow other users besides the EE graduate to win something fun. 

* Have all the projects in by a deadline. Projects will full documentation will be posed in this subreddit and the top  voted projects in the different categories will win.

* Profit??



So in conclusion, I need your opinions and ideas. I want to make this happen. If you want this to happen to then post your ideas and suggestions. This contest is more than winning, it is about learning and creating creative and unique solutions to strange or even mundane problems. 

**EDIT 1** What kind of categories do you want to win prizes? For the grand prize I am willing to give away an unopened [TI eZ430 Chronos Watch Development Kit](http://focus.ti.com/docs/toolsw/folders/print/ez430-chronos.html?DCMP=Chronos&amp;HQS=Other+OT+chronos). The other prize that I had in mind was an unopened TI LaunchPad. If others want to put forth other rewards we can have more categories / more prizes.

* Highest vote project
* Best documentation
* Most original

**EDIT 2** Alright I have class shortly. After school and work I will get the website set up and work on some technical details of the contest. Still looking for other members who would like to donate prizes.

Explanations are mostly in the source code, but basically, this is running on an arduino mega clone, using two continuous rotation servos, an accelerometer, and a gyro. A PID control algorithm is utilized, and each of the three controlling constants (proportional, derivative, integral) can be tuned with the side mounted potentiometers.

This is really limited by the wimpy servo motors, but I may try tethering it to a Wii nunchuck for movement control. Seeing as it can't tilt more than a few degrees before the motors can't save it, this will be challenging or impossible.

The robot works better on carpet than hardwood floor, probably because of the stiff wheels. If you look/listen closely, you can see it has relatively high frequency oscillations on hard surfaces. The derivative control is supposed to dampen this, but I haven't been able to achieve this.

I added a DS1307 real time clock and a daylight savings mode as well as tidying up the code and making it display a more proper ""a quarter to/past"" instead of just ""quarter to/past"".

Ive always hated having to reset the time every time the clocks go forward or backward an hour so I added a daylight savings mode which when activated adds one hour. 

I first made this clock without the DS1307 but it was off by a minute or two each hour and well thats not great for a clock. the DS1307 only drifts a few minutes a month so I dont mind that so much, plus it even works with the power unplugged. Perfect.

a parts list is below

 * ds1307 rtc + crystal + 3v battery
 * atmga328 plus related hardware
 * 3 HCF4094 shift registers
 * 3 ULN2003A transistor arrays 
 * 3 buttons
 * A 5v regulator circuit E.G. 5v reg + diode 1n4001 + 10uf cap + 100uf
 * 98 LEDs and 98 1K resistors
 * some 9 way ribbon cable

For my Bachelor's thesis I worked on a project which would allow the use of an Arduino board as a data acquisition device along with integration with MATLAB's Data Acquisition Toolbox. What this means is that, using this project it is possible to use an Arduino board in the exact same way as an MCC or National Instruments (or any other pre-supported manufacturer's) device for data acquisition tasks.

As an example, it is possible to do the following in MATLAB:

    ai = analoginput('etfarduino', 0);
    addchannel(ai, 0);
    start(ai);
    wait(ai, 2);
    [data, t] = getdata(ai, ai.SamplesAcquired);
    plot(t, data)

I have achieved a single-channel sample rate of 12.5 kHz which is also a pretty good result for a ~$30 device. Analog output and digital output are also supported in this version. For now, they're all only implemented for a single channel, but adding multiple channel support is only a small amount of work away.

For now, I have only tested it on an Arduino Uno, but it should work on any 16 MHz board.

I believe this project could be useful to a lot of people, especially students and faculties who would like to use a cheap data acquisition module.

I have published it under the MIT licence on [github](https://github.com/mlalic/etfarduino). For any feedback regarding anything at all -- bugs, code style, etc. -- you may contact me via github or here on reddit. Also, as it is licensed under MIT, feel free to contribute to the project or use it anyway you wish, providing the appropriate copyright text.

So, what do you think about the project? Any feedback or questions? I'd be glad to hear anything. :)

Say I go with arduino to create my device.  Once I have something working the way I want, how then would I go about mass producing the device?

I can easily use all of the same components in my product, like the display, but what about the main arduino unit?  Since the idea of arduino is prototyping isn't the idea to progress to something else? (and not put arduino boards in the final product?)

What's the natural progression here for something that I just need to handle some basic logic?

The target number of devices that I would look to produce would be a couple hundred to a couple thousand at most.

The first task after initial modeling and design work was to gather a lot of data for more specific design, but I also wanted to learn some about PCBs and electronics in general (MechE by schooling).  I decided to try to build a generic data acquisition shield and learn Eagle and a few other things in the process.

Here's what came out of it so far:

Basically it is just a shield that hard wires in a microSD card slot, 2 LEDs and a button.  All of the remaining I/O pins and the power/ground pins are broken out into screw terminals for quick and solid attachment.  The analog pins have 10k pull-down resistors integrated in.  I think next time I am going to try to include a logic level converter so that it can be safely used with the Uno, as is it needs to be a 3.3v board. 

Also threw together a python script to log whatever gets sent over serial when the board is plugged in, which in my case is a .csv, which is occasionally convenient.


I am logging a 3 axis accelerometer on the lower fork legs, as well as independent wheel speeds for the ABS.  So far I've managed to use the LEDs to indicate various estimated suspension states/characteristics, which is actually working, so active suspension may be possible soon.

It recently snowed and I was getting tired of pulling my kids around on their sleds. So I bodged together a tow vehicle from some old shoprider parts I had along with an ESC (electronic speed controller), the Arduino and some SLA (sealed lead acid) batteries. The gallery is at [http://imgur.com/a/v03jx](http://imgur.com/a/v03jx).

Started last Saturday afternoon. Managed to get it all working sometime after midnight on Sunday. Monday afternoon we put it into production with GREAT success. My kids loved it! Everything worked really well. Had to tweak the acceleration/deceleration values so it didn't wheelie so easily, but it was a great success. There is lots of power and torque from this setup, we linked two sleds together with one kid on each. The kart didn't seem to care about the extra weight.

I'm using the Arduino to interface with the ESC and monitoring the dead man switch, forward and reverse buttons. With no input from forward/reverse, it simply stays at idle. Upon pressing either forward or reverse it will slowly ramp up the PWM signal to the ESC. Upon release of said buttons, it will ramp back down to idle. If any time the dead man switch goes open, the throttle goes back to idle and the program won't continue until it is closed again.

Source is available at [http://pastebin.com/VFWS3h51](http://pastebin.com/VFWS3h51)

Sadly something happened and I blew up the ESC tonight. I knew something was wrong when I hit the forward button, we started to jerkily move forward, then flames started shooting out of the speed controller. However another one is already on it's way.

Obviously these locks are low to no security (just keep the honest people honest), but I wanted to do this as a proof of concept and just because.

The prototype is extremely crude since I am in the beginning stages of testing.

So far is works pretty well.

This consists of the following:
Arduino clone Mega2560
L298 based dual channel motor controller
Stepper motor (9 degree steps)
20x2 LCD
3 momentary push-buttons (reset, scroll and enter)
4049 bounceless switch circuit
Linear actuator (designed for automotive locks)
Cherry switch with hisker 

Upon startup, the LCD instructs the user to do a couple of tests on the lock to determine the best starting point. The user presses the enter button. The LCD then gives a list of options based on the results of the test. The user presses the scroll button until the correct option is selected on the LCD. The user then presses enter to make the selection. The LCD then instructs the user to install the lock in the apparatus and dial it to the zero mark. Once complete, the user presses the enter button and the process begins.

It runs through a methodically reduced set of possible combinations (based on the test performed earlier). After each combo is tested, the actuator attempts to open the shackle. If unsuccessful, it moves on to the next number. If successful, the  open shackle is detected by the whisker cherry switch and the combo is displayed on the LCD and the process remains at idle.

It will take this thing up to 45 minutes to try all possible combinations before it gives up.

I have a lot more work ahead of me, but it works!

For this lock, the actual combination is 22, 04, 26 and the autodialer gave the combo 22.5, 2.5, 26.5 after about 25 minutes of running (which also works). The divergence is due to the sloppiness of the lock design (again, these locks provide little to no real security anyway).

However, this summer, I've had more time to work with it. Also, I took a class that focused on VBA (my first programming language) and that helped me to understand the logic and basic coding structure behind coding, as I only know C/C++ through arduino, so my knowledge of it is limited.

I'd built a range finder/readout with these same parts and a PING sensor, but that wasn't very useful. I plan to use this in school this year, stick the sensor outside my window at my dorm and have it tell me how warm/cold it is outside, since phone weather is only so accurate. This is the first thing I'm considering soldering to a real breadboard to make it more permanent. Yes, temperature is in Fahrenheit. I'm not about to die.

Quadricopter kits are expensive (biologists are poor), so before starting, I'd really like to hear what you think about quadricopter projects.. are they easy enough to adapt and tune? is the hardware part demanding? Do they need advanced equipment (oscilloscope, etc) that I could miss? Are they well-supported? Did you ever made one? If yes, which one? What problem did you find?

I am just getting preliminary informations: more than answers, I would like to find out questions that I should ask myself before starting.

We'd keep track of who won and every week there'd be a winner and we'd taunt each other about how much they suck and whatnot. 

Like any other foosball table, it has its own little score markers. We would always talk about a better way to keep score - maybe some sort of app that could keep track, or maybe we could build a score board that we could mount on the wall. Something fancy, but we were always just talking out of our asses. They all seemed like cool ideas but they never really evolved beyond that - ideas. Last christmas however, I received an Arduino Uno and starter kit as a gift. I knew right away what my first project was going to be. 

-------

Fast-forward to today, I've got my first fully-functional version of the scoreboard. I've been mostly documenting the process with videos, but I've also been taking some pictures, which you can see here:
 
http://imgur.com/a/i3PgX#0

Now, the main scoreboard is simply an old [NHL Scoreboard Lamp](http://i.imgur.com/x2Y6l.jpg) that I got used online. It's made of metal and is pretty much perfect for the job.

Inside that unit are 8 two-digit seven-segment displays for the score (2 players, 4 sides = 8 displays). There are also 4 four-digit displays what will be used for time in the next version (I haven't gotten around to figuring out how to program them yet).

Powering those displays is an Arduino Uno with four 595 shift registers. This allows me to run all of the displays off of only 3 pins. Also attached to this unit is an RF receiver.

One of the things we wanted to do was completely automate the scoring. To do this, I mounted some laser diodes and photo cells inside the goal posts of the table. Essentially they were small trip laser sensors. These sensors were hooked up to a second Arduino Uno mounted under the table. When the ball goes into the net, it trips the sensor, and the Arduino sends an RF signal to the unit hanging above the table, which adds to the score.

I also decided to add manual score buttons. I don't want to undermine my own abilities, but I wanted to have a backup just in case, for whatever reason, the trip sensors stopped working. So there are some score buttons, a reset score button, and a switch to turn the lasers on/off to save batteries.

I made a video showing how the unit works. It's not that long, you should watch it:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ4HjjtZoX8

So... yeah, that's about it. I plan on releasing my code as well (as soon as I clean it up a bit more) but if you'd like it in the mean time, I'll certainly hand it over. I'll also answer any questions you guys might have!

Things I plan to change / add in the next version:

- Get the TIME digits hooked up and working.
- Add an auto-shutoff for the displays after, say, 10 minutes of not receiving any RF signal.
- Add an auto-shutoff for the unit under the table.

We build a wooden room 1.8 m x 5.4 m x 2.5 m(height). We bought 12 of [these](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/6mm-5mw-red-laser-module-3-5-4-5v-13378). Then we drilled holes to the lasers and the lasers were in place. On the wall on the other side we put [these](http://www.futurlec.com/Photocells.shtml) up where the lasers made a red spot. We added a couple of piezos, some buttons and a led matrix. Finally we put a smoke machine in there to make it possible to see the laserbeams.
The deal is that you had to reach the button of the room without breaking the laser beam. Then you had to push the button and the led matrix would show a number. Breaking the laserbeam would result in the piezos going crazy and only a push on the button at the start of the room would make the piezos stop.
It was pretty awesome! You should try it out!",,False,,t5_2qknj,True,,,True,t3_o0yk0,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/o0yk0/laser_trap_mission_impossible_style/,

I just recently started using Arduino, and at first I only had an Uno - but no cool input or output devices. So I made some simple scripts and sketches using PHP, Processing and Arduino to be able to switch the internal LED on and off using a web interface. It's really simple and only requires a PHP compatible webhost (most webhosting services support this) and an Arduino connected via USB.

I made a tutorial on how you can make it yourself, and figured I could share it here. It's my first tutorial, so I'd like your feedback and suggestions if you have any.

Is there a way to say either write up a sketch and upload it to a virtual Arduino and circuit and see the resuilts? Or perhaps somehow used only the physical Arduino but have it talk across the usb connection to a simulated circuit in an applicatoin?

My first experience with arduino was amazing!,spmcfarland,37,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/en4ss/new_to_diy_electronics_my_first_experience_with/,"It recently occurred to me that even though I use lots of electronic gadgets every day, I have almost no idea how they work. And I don't like not knowing how things work.

So I decided to learn a bit about electronics, and what better way than by getting hands-on. It didn't take long before I realized that arduino was the perfect thing for me.

So I ordered a 'quick start' pack from the Makers Shed, and while I was waiting for the actual package to arrive, I downloaded and read 'Getting Started with Arduino' by Massimo Banzi. His philosophy of tinkering had hooked immediately.

So today the package arrived and I got started. The first 'blink' program went off without a hitch, and I got ambitious. Instead of just one blinky light, I wanted two. And I wanted them to alternate.

The code is no problem (I work with javascript quite a bit; it's not that much different), but wiring everything up was all new to me.

I remembered reading somewhere that LEDs need a resistor to work, and I know pin 13 has one, but now I need a second one. I'm pretty sure this round thing (brown-red-black-black-brown) is a resistor. So I plug it in, wire the LEDs up and download the code.

And it works! Well, sort of. The LED with the resistor is really dim. ""Aha,"" I think, ""too much resistance!"" So I try another one (red-red-black-black-brown) and it works much better. But the other LED is still brighter. So I add a resistor (with the same markings) to that circuit, too.

Now I'm sitting with a pile of wires and electronic bits on my desk, and two little lights are blinking back and forth, and I couldn't be happier.

That someone with so little knowledge was able to do this in just a matter of minutes is absolutely amazing. I can't wait to keep learning and get lost in everything this little gizmo can do.

So thanks for being a great community, and opening the doors to common folk like me.

**TL/DR: I made lights blink. Thanks, arduino!**",,False,,t5_2qknj,False,,,True,t3_en4ss,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/en4ss/new_to_diy_electronics_my_first_experience_with/,

Basically I want to hook up my arduino to an alarm clock and have it open the blinds of my window when it goes off.  Maybe play a song as well.

Off the top of my head it seems I will need it to:
-Have internal measure of time
-remember preset time to initiate program
-run motor/servo for x amount of time to change angle of blinds

In the long run I would like for it to be able to check the angle of the blinds before running the motor, but for now I will just have it return the blinds to closed at midnight or something so they will be closed for sure.

Next I made a pair of transistor switch circuits so I could use an external power source to drive the motors while controlling them from the arduino. Unfortunately the motors are 2 wire, so I can only drive them forwards with this simple circuit. I plan to build a couple of H-Bridge circuits so I can reverse the motors as well.

I then wrote some simple code to just make the tank go through some pre-programmed moves to test controlling it, and I also wanted the code to be started from a button mounted on the tank that would also be able to interrupt it while it was running the program.

[Version 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mouA9WuD9h4)

I'd already had a play with photoresistors so I just made 4 of those circuits layed out on a cross made from coffee stirrer sticks. They are driven from the 5v out on the arduino board and share a common ground. I plugged the sensor returns into A0-A4.

[Some photos](http://imgur.com/a/w7xb3)

So I figured the next thing to do was stick them together.  :)

I'm not too keen on the idea of having to use Arduino's language though. I know their language is like a wrapper for avr-gcc. So is it possible to just code in C?

I just don't want to have the code simplified by the Arduino IDE, if that makes any sense.

Probably going to go for the UNO board if I decide to go for it and will be using it under linux.

Thanks for your help

Also, if you guys could recommend a kit, would you go with [this, an Uno with some components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=50_75&amp;products_id=596), or [this, a Mega 2560 with just the board](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=50_74&amp;products_id=587)?

I'm not sure if it has been done before, at least with RC copters.

My idea is to start with an existing RC quadcopter (like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Syma-Channel-2-4G-Quad-Copter/dp/B0096SJU3U)) and hack an Arduino into it along with a [wireless charging system](http://www.amazon.com/Palm-Pre-Touchstone-Charging-Kit/dp/B002CMEIWU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357771919&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=palm+touchstone).

My first goal would be to have the arduino board tap into the directional controls on the quadcopter as if the commands were coming from the RC remote, so the arduino acts like the controller and allows the existing gyroscope and flight controller to do all the balancing work.

My second goal would be to figure out how to get the quadcopter to follow things. It would need to lock on to a signal beacon and then move towards it. Roombas are able to do this when docking with their charging station. What kind of beacon system do they use?

My third goal would be to figure out a way to add proximity sensors so the quadcopter will try to avoid obstacles while moving on a set path. The best solution would be to use a camera so the quadcopter could be proactive in choosing flight paths instead of reactive to sensors, but at that point its starting to get pretty complicated.

I have seen the solutions for these problems implemented in different ways in other projects, but I'm not sure what the simplest solution is for accomplishing these things on an RC copter. I would like to get some feedback from the community and people way more experienced than myself.

Sorry no pics or video this time. Just a little discussion that I think might help some people wanting to do IMU based controls. First off I am using the very popular MinIMU – 9 from the good people at pololu robotic. I cannot say enough good stuff about these guys. They have great support and are very helpful.

http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1268

They even wrote a library to interface with the device! Which is all well and good but it uses wire.h and wire.h doesn’t have timeouts. I modified their libraries to use the better i2c.h library which has timeouts. I have verified that it works with the MinIMU-9 v1 but not with the v2. If you aren’t doing something like flying a helicopter with these sensors just use the libraries they wrote that use wire.h.  Here is my IDE with all the libraries I like to use:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21439374/arduino-1.0.1.zip

This current robot uses two megas and 4 xbees. One xbee link is used for communication between the arduino and the other link provides the data stream. I use real term to send the commands to the controlling arduino.
IMUs can be complicated messes which are really hard to understand. You have Kalman filters (IE black magic) direction cosine matrices (easier to understand but processor intensive and still a little bit of black magic) and then the complimentary filter (easy to understand, easy to implement). I used the complimentary filter for my quad rotor project. Since I’m not planning on putting it upside down I don’t have to worry about the 180 / -180 singularity. However, I want heading lock! That means I need a complimentary filter that can handle the singularity (in this case the 0 / 360 switch) and I need PID loop that can handle the singularity as well. Here is the process to turn noisy and drifty sensor data into a nice pitch, roll, and yaw with regard to the earth frame of reference. First, obviously, you get the data off the device:

    void GetIMUData(){
      compass.read();
      gyro.read();
    
      magYaw = compass.heading((LSM3032::vector){1,0,0});
    
      accX = compass.a.x ;
      accY = -1*compass.a.y;
      accZ = -1*compass.a.z ;
    
      gyroX = 0.07*(gyro.g.x);
      gyroY = 0.07*(gyro.g.y);
      gyroZ = 0.07*(gyro.g.z);

      accPitch = ToDeg(atan2(accX,sqrt(accY*accY+accZ*accZ)));
      accRoll = ToDeg(atan2(accY,sqrt(accX*accX+accZ*accZ)));
    
    }

Luckily the libraries I modified which were provided by pololu do the hard stuff for you. And the magnetometer &amp; accelerometer library includes a function to give you a tilt compensated heading. To get the accelerometer raw heading you just take the inverse tangent as shown there. Notice the signs on accY and accX. It is good practice to use the aircraft conventions anytime you are working with Euler angles. Also notice that the gyro has been scaled in accordance with the data sheet so that 1dps will correspond with one digit. OK now we have the data next we need to fuse the sensors. 

    void Complementary(){
    
      a = tau1/(tau1+dt);
      b = tau2/(tau2+dt);
      //port1&lt;&lt;millis()&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;b&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;tau1&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;tau2&lt;&lt;""\r\n"";
      pitch = a*(pitch + gyroY * dt) + (1-a) * accPitch;
      roll = a*(roll + gyroX*dt) + (1-a) * accRoll;
    
      yawPredict = yaw + gyroZ*dt;
    
      if (abs(yawPredict-magYaw)&lt;90){
        yaw = b*(yawPredict) + (1-b) * magYaw;
      }
      else{
        yaw = yawPredict;
      }
    
      //yaw = b*(yaw + gyroZ*dt) + (1-b) * magYaw;
      if (yaw &gt; 360){
        yaw -= 360;
      }
      if (yaw &lt; 0){
        yaw += 360;
      }
    }


OK now it would work to just do

      pitch = 0.95*(pitch + gyroY * dt) + 0.05 * accPitch;

But including your calculated dt will give you better results. The 0 / 360 singularity is handled by integrating the gyro. This gives us a rough estimate of the angle. Then I check to see if we have crossed the singularity. When that is the case I run just off the gyro and take it to the correct value. Not to complicated. But now how to implement a PID loop with this problem? I did a bit of research into the matter and people just kept saying quaternions DCM etc etc but not a single word as to how one runs a PID loop based off quaternions. So it was time to use my brain. There are essentially three states in the process. Not crossing the singularity, crossing from quadrant I to quadrant IV, and crossing from quadrant IV to quadrant I. 

    void PID(){
    
    
      PIDAngle = yaw;
      error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
    
      errorDifference = previousError - error;//check to see if singularity has been crossed
    
      if (errorDifference &gt; 180){
        singularityState = 1;
      }
      if (errorDifference &lt; -180){
        singularityState = 2;
      }
    
      switch (singularityState){//needs some cleanup
      case 0:
        break;
      case 1:
        if (yaw &gt; 270){
          PIDAngle = yaw -360;
          error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
        }
        
        break;
      case 2:
        if (yaw &lt; 90){
          PIDAngle = yaw  +360;
          error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
        }
       
        break;
      }
    
      iError += dt*ki*error;
      if (iError &gt; 100){//windup guard
        iError = 100;
      }
      
      if (iError &lt; -100){
        iError = -100;
      }
    
      dError = (PIDAngle - previousYaw)/dt;//treat setpoint as constant
    
      adjustment = kp*error + iError - kd*dError;
      
      if (abs(error) &lt; 1){
          singularityState = 0;
          holding = true;
          
          debugFlag = 5;
        }
      
      previousError = error;
      previousYaw = PIDAngle;
    
    }


I was so happy when I ran this code. One of my commands is to just rotate to a specific angle. It worked. The PID loop took the shortest path around the circle each time and also crossed the singularity with no problems! Don’t get me wrong here there are still a lot of problems with the robot like the PID loop is not properly tuned and other minor bugs like that. But this code once polished will be incorporated into the quad for a nice heading hold gyro system. Once again I cannot stress safety enough in dealing with robots. I cut my thumb pretty good on this bot when I stupidly picked it up by the wheels with the heading hold command still active. **Don’t get complacent. You will get hurt.** Luckily I only received a minor cut. Had that been in the quad rotor blades I probably would have been cut down to the bone if not lost the finger entirely. The code still rough so caveat emptor if you use it. I would rather this be a conceptual take away then off the shelf code to just run:

i love playing around with everything but i recently started catching myself feeling extremely overwhelmed when thinking about moving past a prototype. okay so this works when i plug into my computer - how would i plug this into a wall socket? how do i build (and potentially mass produce) smaller boards/chips that only contain the pieces i need? etc

any direction would help, ive just been asking around if anyone i know was an electrical engineer or someone that could shed more light on the subject but keep coming up empty, not even sure if thats the right type of person to be asking!

You can download the Simulink [toolbox from Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/arduino-software/arduino-simulink.html). There's no CAN but there's a ton more digital IO and analog IO (and XPC box daughter boards are not cheap.)

If you're an engineer that does any sort of controls work you know what I'm talking about. I can't put into words how awesome this is. If you're just doing your basic IO stuff it's not worth it. But any sort of PID control, state space, stateflow, etc writing in C just isn't going to cut it. Simulink IS the industry standard for this sort of stuff. Flight controls (Boeing), automotive (Ford, Chrysler, Toyota) , offroad (Cat, Cummins, Deere). Block diagrams are amazingly easy to set up for this sort of work.

Students: If your school has computers with full toolbox kit or you can get cheap licenses it's worth it to put on your resume. [Personally I think Mathworks will understand if you get it through other means so you can put it on your resume. If your employer buys you an extra seat of Embedded Coder I think it's an extra $4-5 by itself.]

It says that it only works on Windows but I have it working on both Lion and Debian it just requires a manual call to make and avrdude to upload it. 

Edit: Some people seem to think this is a way to replace C. It's not. If you're not an engineer or haven't taken controls classes it's really not going to make much sense. You definitely need to be comfortable in the Laplace domain and know digital controls to utilize it fully.

I'm not particularly proud of this, but I wanted to pass along my experience so that nobody else gets burned or recommends this to a friend to get burned. Or, in the alternative, recommend this to your enemies.

So I'm strolling through RadioShack, and I see this ARDX Arduino Starter Kit looking like the one here: http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/ardx-the-starter-kit-for-arduino-p-1153.html and the price was also rather similar. I've had my eye on this kit for a while and I was familiar with it from the seeedstudio website. I'd dabbled with Arduino a fair bit but wanted to get more into it, so I decided to buy it on sight.

First thing, right off the bat - no Arduino included. At all. Despite the information online clearly stating that it includes an Arduino Uno R3, there is no Arduino. Now, the packaging doesn't state anything about including an Arduino or not, and if it was that important to me, I probably should have double-checked instead of just rushing to the cash register with it. But I was making an assumption in thinking that if it's the same product, at the same price, with the same name, it would include the same stuff. NOPE.

Then, there are several flaws and missing components. The breadboard overlay sheets are printed incorrectly, and they don't line up with the pins properly. Useless. The header pins were not long enough to be used in the way described in the instructions, at all. Useless. And all the transistors and the thermometer sensor component were simply missing. Extra useless.

I emailed seeeeeeedstudio about this, and they weren't able to offer much help. They agreed that it's unreasonable for the kit to be the same price without the arduino, and they said they would contact RadioShack about that. And they helpfully suggested that I go to RadioShack to purchase any missing components.

I'm not sure if this is more SeeedStudio's fault or RadioShack's fault. But a lot of people were excited to see RadioShack getting into the whole DIY movement and carrying Arduino products. But if this is what they're bringing to the table, I'm not so sure it's a great thing. At the end of the day, I'm left with $15-$20 worth of components, tutorials I can't complete, and a feeling of being ripped off.",,False,,t5_2qknj,1367113034.0,,,True,t3_1d8wmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1d8wmb/seeedstudio_ardx_starter_kit_at_radioshack_caveat/,

I developed this last semester and ran it as a one-night build session for some guys in a student group I helped lead.  Everyone built it pretty easily in about two hours.  A simple project, some of the guys building it only had freshmen classes and the tiniest bit of soldering know-how under their belts.  For you friendly internet hobos, I assume you can either build it yourself on a perfboard from the schematic or can figure out enough of EAGLE to adjust the order number on the provided Gerbers and send off the PCB design to be made.  If you really demand it, I'll go figure out what tax forms I need to fill out to sell the PCB on BatchPCB. If you have questions, ask away.

Contains a light intro, Arduino code, schematic, and step-by-step build instructions with pictures for just about everything. Also has links to a video of a completed color organ, component list with Sparkfun and Mouser part numbers, and sources and tutorials I used to develop the project.

Some notes:

* Some guys who did the build switched up the LED placements without moving the corresponding resistors as well, so they ended up with dim and bright LEDs. An easy fix, but something avoidable.
* I haven't tried to build it on a perfboard, so I can't say if it'll fit in an Altoids tin or not. It should, but you might have to get creative with it.
* Turning on the power causes the LEDs to briefly light then turn off, which is actually a pretty cool-start up.

I'm a complete newbie with respect to Arduino. 

I would like to make a coffee capsule dispenser where the payment is made with bitcoins. I'm not worried about vandalism.

The idea I had in mind is the following:

* The mechanism for the dispenser is by using a spiral, like in some of the vending machines: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2327/2186595373_08e7d164ef.jpg . I have no clue where I can get that part, and whether there is a standard name for this part.

* Some kind of motor (servo?) to rotate the spiral.
* Arduino to control the motor.
* Payment is made through bitcoin. I want to use blockchain.info receive payment api: https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive . Whenever a $1 (or more precisely, 0.01 bitcoin) is sent to the address that will be presented beside it, an http callback will be sent. The arduino will act as an http server (is that possible?), and will trigger the motor when such a callback is received. If you're not familiar with bitcoin, please ignore the payment part.
* Wrap everything with a nice case. 

Any remarks regarding the design? Is the spiral the easiest way to implement a dispenser? How much time would such a project take for a total newbie? I have programming experience (but not on the Arduino), and I'm pretty sure that I can handle the payment triggering, but I'm not sure about the electronics. 
Is the Arduino the easiest platform, or should I use a raspberry pi or something similar?  

I would appreciate if you can help me create a list with all the parts needed. If I succeed building the dispenser, I will publish the design and the code to the community.

What I have here is Arduino nano connected to beat detector that takes its input from Microphone, some 16 meters (50+ foot) or RGB LED strips glued to my ceiling and IR remote to control things. Here is [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwH7J50j5_g). 
 
General idea behind beat detection is that I have electret mic, some amp then low pass filter with steep attenuation (can be build from double op-amp chip, some caps and resistors). From low pass filter signal goes to comparator (op-amp can be used). And then there is single transistor to drive red LED on panel and provide input to arduino. 
 
To drive led strips I use MOSFETs, they are cooled to aluminium case - transistors get really hot. Transistors can handle about 1500 Watts at 12 Volts but I think my case would not be able dissipate heat quickly enough so I may be limited to 500-1000 watts. I am currently using up to 180 watts under max load, case just gets barely warm.
 
For now I have connected IR module that was removed from ""stock"" LED strip controller that you get together with strips. 
 
I am also planning to connect external xeon strobe to flash from time to time (if you watch the video you can see strobe lamp next to controller and power supply).

As an engineer that has been watching Arduino and open source hardware from the sidelines, it seems like there isn't a place for people to sell what they make (something I think would raise awareness of the platform &amp; support the tinkers on the front lines).

Basically this would be a place to sell your homemade guitar pedal, pet feeder - any thing really. Sure there are sites to share plans, but there are more people (I think) that are interested in the platforms and gadgets but aren't necessarily builders. 

This could be totally off base, so I just wanted to raise the question and get some feedback. I have time this weekend and could bang out a v1 today and tomorrow. 

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback!

***UPDATE:***
Thanks everyone for your feedback! I'm going to build this and lets see what happens. If you have some gadgets you've made that you'd like to sell, please message me privately. 


***UPDATE 2***
Just bought tindie.com &amp; have a working site on my local machine using an open Django ecommerce framework, Satchmo. This is my first time with Satchmo but seems like a really great project.

***UPDATE 3***
Got it working. It seems all that is left is frontend work. I'll work on that this week. Thanks again to everyone for the comments. I'll have it up this week for people to start submitting their gadgets

What is the best way to make this work?,AskMeAboutZombies,33,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1gnat6/an_arduino_powered_frisbee_what_is_the_best_way/,"Hello. I'm looking for a way to control the trajectory of a frisbee during flight, but I need some advice on how to make it work. For example:

* What is the best mechanism for controlling a rotating disc? My idea is to rig the frisbee with a series of vibration motors around the rim, which pulse at the precise time to tilt the frisbee in a particular direction without wobbling. Would this work? Is there a better way?

* What combination of sensors would I need? My idea is a gyroscope for measuring tilt on an X/Y axis, an accelerometer to measure rotational velocity, and magnetic sensor to measure a fixed direction outside relation to the spinning disc.

* Would an arduino (plus sensors) work best for this, or should I recycle a mainboard off a smartphone? I know how to write things in scratch, but I don't know the first thing about writing an android app!

I would like to make this my first arduino project. It seems to make sense in my head, and I think it would be pretty cool to have a ""smart"" frisbee that can be programmed with limited control.  I'd appreciate any help or advice on making this work! Thank you for reading!

Edit: Thank you for the responses! Everyone has posted a lot of information and ideas. I'm aiming for this project to be simple, so I think my first goal should be to figure out the difficulty in controlling flight before moving forward.

I'd love to find a product similar to the arduino, a bare-bones board with one or two fairly powerful dsp chips (like a $20-30 ADI SHARC), maybe a little onboard memory, a way to program the chips, supporting components, and a bunch of pin headers for connecting optional peripherals/shields like analog audio i/o, midi i/o, video i/o, and more generic i/o for things like knobs, buttons, lights, etc, etc.

Unfortunately, whenever I start researching how to get started, I run into two problems. First, the development hardware starts at around $700 and includes a bunch of stuff I don't need. Second, the software development tools are $3000+ for a single license.

Now, I realize that these tools are this expensive because they're targeted at and supporting companies that are bringing a mass produced product to market, but they are out of reach of the average hobbyist. I'm not trying to keep development times down, and I don't have stringent testing and simulation requirements. I'm trying to make a black box with a couple of knobs that makes cool noises.

I am guessing that the Arduino would need some kind of driver (aside from the Ethernet library) to make use of a device like that, and it probably couldn't even be implemented in the available memory. But I thought I'd ask in case someone knows otherwise.

Another thought I had was that some kind of software on the PC might be able to give the a USB-connected Arduino a ""virtual Ethernet"" connection, similar to what vmWare does for virtual machines. However, Google doesn't turn anything up.

Is anyone interested in the code and schematic? ,thezboe,26,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/11tlbn/i_replicated_the_glowing_reddit_mail_indicator/,"A few days ago I stumbled upon a post where a guy had hollowed out a small wooden clock and had a replaced it with a a clear plastic envelope that would glow whenever he had mail on Reddit.

I don't think he ever gave the code, so I took some time today to learn some things and write some code to do the same thing.  I didn't hollow out an old wooden clock nor do I have a conveniently clear envelope, but it will light up an LED when you have mail on Reddit.

It's a very simple circuit. I don't have anything to schematic it with, but it goes [Pin 9 -&gt; Anode of LED -&gt; Cathode of LED -&gt; 560 Ohm resistor -&gt; Gnd].

The Python file will open an API session and login with your credentials (make sure to fill in your username and password in the file) and then access the page http://www.reddit.com/api/me.json which includes a few different parameters about your user including whether you have mail or not.  It will then send a 1 or a 0 if you have mail or not, respectively over the serial port to the Arduino which will read it and activate the LED on pin 9 if it has received a 1.

The Python script will only run on Windows (sry Linux guys, I could make another version, but I don't have time right now).  You must download and install the [PySerial](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/files/pyserial/2.5/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) libraries in order for the script to run. The script assumes that your Arduino is plugged into the COM3 port, but you may have to mess around with the serial.Serial(2) line until it picks it up.

A college buddy of mine, [Big Jawn](http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=425352413005&amp;ref=mf#!/video/video.php?v=422781108005&amp;subj=1739038372), came to me with this project last winter. His idea was to control a set of 10 fire cannons with MIDI. This would allow a MIDI controller to sync up with a live performance or DJ console to get BPM information and playback a fire display. We hashed out some details and he let me go nuts with the electrical side of it while he messed with the propane/high pressure cannon side of the build. 


The end result is a 1U rack enclosure that contains a beefy power supply, Arduino Nano, and a backlit button pad. The front panel features a key locked output enable switch, buttons to manually control the fire cannons, a button to arm the manual controls (and disable midi input), buttons to control the sparkers, and various diagnostic LEDs.


The end design for the cannons themselves took my by surprise. These are freaking enormous! They throw heat several yards and when used in concert can produce uncomfortable warmth from several feet. They are designed to follow as many fire codes as we could get our hands on (the guidelines are somewhat cryptic). Each cannon has a pilot torch at its top, which can be reignited via sparkers. The sparkers happen to be 20,000 volt Tasers. 


I am at the controls in this [shot](http://imgur.com/bfEME.jpg), and Jawn is checking some leaky thingamajig


**TL;DR: We made MIDI controlled fire cannons and they are awesome**

**Photos:**
Here is a collection of photos including build pics. So far it has been featured in three events, we only have photos from PEXfest 2010 and Camp Bisco 9: [Galleries](http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/6716903/1/Chanon%201.0%20Gallery?h=25f3a3)


**Videos:**

The first time showing off the hardware. We had no software at this point and were just holding the controller and jamming out on the buttons. This is from Playa Del Fuego 2010:
[PDF video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmkAMhtKcZk)


On to PEXfest 2010, we were running some sort of ancient step sequencing software with a computer and cheap POS Korg keyboard to send midi to the device. This was rather clunky and was a MAJOR headache to get synced to the DJ booth.

I built a crude wooden one originally but created this prototype once I finished constructing my 3D printer (prusa for those interested).  The parts were designed in google sketchup.

Arduino uno board with ethernet shield.  To power the servos I attached a 7806 voltage regulator to the power jack on the uno board which you can see hanging in front.  I am sure this is not the most professional/safe way to do it but it works for the time being though I would not leave it unattended as the regulator gets hot after a while.

The device simply polls a java website I created every two seconds to see if the html button I created has been pushed.  If it has, it dispenses a treat and sends a request to the web server that resets the button.

Favorite arduino project so far according to dogs.

I can go two directions with my future development efforts, I can continue to try and make it easy to use or I can work on projects that are not easy but show off the capabilities of an FPGA. What do you think people are more interested in? Arduino compatibility with hardware modules or cool stuff like Arcade games, keyboard synthesizer projects, and Logic Analyzers/Oscopes?

Have I even come close to capturing what makes the Arduino special?

Does this board have any chance of becoming the ""Arduino"" of the FPGA world?

I am wanting to create a controller with a fan and thermocoupler. I want to be able to set a temperature and the arduino will read the temp and turn the fan off and on based on that temp. I would like to store some variables like max temp, average temp, amount of time the fan was on. Maybe a timer so I can start the cook with 5 hrs left and it wont turn the fan on but will beep or something after that. I will also have to power the thing somehow.

I am thinking about getting:
* the Uno
* 16x2 lcd screen
* LEDs
* K-Type thermocoupler
* small PC Fan
* Buttons to set desired temp

Do I need the amplifier [Amplifier MAX31855](https://www.adafruit.com/products/269)?

In bright sunlight I get just plenty of juice to keep the battery topped off, but when the panel is covered by shade the solar panel isn't quite enough to supply the Arduino *and* charge the battery.

Enter the 5V switching regulator, tied directly to the +5V pin on my Uno:

- 12V battery to onboard regulator:  115ma / 1.38W
- 12V battery to switching regulator: 60ma / 0.72W

As you can see the energy savings are pretty significant.  In my case it means the battery now charges even if I put the solar panels in shade, which gives me a lot more flexibility.

[Here](http://www.ti.com/product/lm2576) is the switching regulator I'm using... it was $3 from Digikey.  Everything else you can get from Radio Shack (they sell the 100uH coil as a ""RF Choke"", it's in the tray with other inductors and is clearly marked as 100uH.)

Also, note that unlike a lot of circuits with coils in them, the diode is neither ""protective"" nor ""optional.""  The data sheet goes into some depth about choosing the right diode, but the tl; dr is ""use one that can carry a couple of amps.""

1362637126.0,21,self.arduino,19typ5,ATtiny85 with external I2C EEPROM,brewforce,26,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/19typ5/attiny85_with_external_i2c_eeprom/,"EDIT: [Article with pictures and diagrams](http://0xfebytes.blogspot.com/2013/03/use-attiny85-with-i2c-eeprom.html)

EDIT on the blog: I forgot to mention specifics of using arduino as a programmer. Changes have been updated.

I know it's not really arduino, but it probably belongs here.  This is a simple setup for using an I2C EEPROM with the ATtiny85.  There are many sites which outline the use of I2C eeprom, but there are a few nuances when using an ATtiny85 that arise because of the lack of true I2C.  I have compiled them here and think that they may be helpful to anyone else trying to do this.  I'll try to add some pictures soon.  

###Parts:###
======
* [ATtiny85](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9378)  
* [Microchip I2C EEPROM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/525)  
* Arduino as ISP (programmer)  
* Serial LCD  
* 2x 4.7k resistors  
* Jumper wires  
  
###ATtiny Pinout###
=========
1. Reset  
1. D3  
1. D4  
1. GND  
1. SDA  
1. D1  
1. SCL  
1. Vcc  

###24LC256 Microchip I2C EEPROM Pinout###
========
1. A0  
1. A1  
1. A2  
1. Vss (GND)  
1. SDA  
1. SCL  
1. WP
1. Vcc

###Connections###
========

ATtiny85 pin 8 to +5V (or +3.3V, but I used 5)  
ATtiny85 pin 4 to GND  
ATtiny85 pin 5 to EEPROM pin 5 (with 4.7k pull-up resistor to +5V)  
ATtiny85 pin 7 to EEPROM pin 6 (with 4.7k pull-up resistor to +5V)  
ATtiny85 pin 2 to Serial LCD  
EEPROM pins 1-4 to GND  
EEPROM pin 7 to GND  
EEPROM pin 8 to +5V  
  
The pull-up resistors are necessary when using the ATtiny85.  They are not necessary on the arduino because the arduino has internal pull-ups enabled when using the I2C interface.  
  
The A0, A1, and A2 pins on the EEPROM are chip select inputs.  They determine the device address.  When all three are low (tied to ground) the device address is 0x50 and when all three are high (tied to Vcc) the device address is 0x57.  Possible combinations allow for 8 devices on the same bus.  For this example I left mine at 0x50.  
  
The WP pin on the EEPROM is for write protection.  When this pin is high you cannot write to the EEPROM (though you can still read).  
  
[EEPROM datasheet](http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/24LC256.pdf)  
  
###Setting Up the Arduino Environment###
=========
I do not have an independent programmer, so I used my arduino.  [Here](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695) are the instructions.  After adding the hardware list (as covered in the instructions) you should access the yoursketchbook/hardware/attiny/boards.txt and edit it so that the only boards in there are the ones you need access to.  Make a backup of the original in case you need to add more boards in the future.  The file was one single line for me, but each board starts with ""attinyXX.name=ATtinyXX (some clock info).......build.variant=tiny8"".  I took out all but attiny85 1MHz and attiny85 8MHz.  
  
I had originally clicked the wrong board when trying to burn the bootloader.  Selecting the 20MHz external clock option, which kind of hoses everything up.  If you have made this mistake place a crystal or oscillator (freq doesn't actually matter) between pins 2 and 3 of the ATtiny85 and 10uF caps between pin 2 and GND and between pin 3 and GND.  Now you will be able to burn the correct bootloader.  

Continue following the instructions in the beginning of this section.  
  
You will also need the [TinyWireM library](http://arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Code/TinyWireM.zip), which utilizes the USI on the ATtiny85 to give us I2C.  
  
**NOTE:** If your Serial lcd has a library that uses SoftwareSerial or you are using SoftwareSerial to connect to your lcd you must burn the 8MHz bootloader.  You will also have to change the values defined in the top of USI_TWI_Master.cpp and USI_TWI_Master.h to account for the different clock rate.  
  
    #define F_CPU 8000000UL // was 1000000UL  
in the .cpp file  
  
    #define SYS_CLK   8000.0 // was 1000.0  
in the .h file  
  
[USIi2c library documentation](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/USIi2c)  
  
Continue on after you have setup the arduino as a programmer and successfully burnt the bootloader to the ATtiny (test with the blink example, changing the default output 13 for 0 on the ATtiny85).  
  
**NOTE:** You may get a message ""avrdude: please define PAGEL and BS2 signals in the configuration file for part ATtiny85"".  This can be ignored.  
  
###The sketch###
=======
Most of configuration I got from [this](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/arduino-external-eeprom) site.  I tweaked it because it was originally designed for the arduino.
  
    #include &lt;TinyWireM.h&gt; // equivalent of Wire library
    #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;  // for serial lcd, must be 8MHz clock

    SoftwareSerial lcd(4, 3); //define lcd serial device
    char abcs[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'};  // array for example purposes
    
    void setup(){
      lcd.begin(9600);  // initialize serial  
      clearlcd();
      TinyWireM.begin(); // initialize I2C lib
      lcd.print(""EEPROM Test 1"");  // test lcd
      delay(1000);
    }
    
    void loop(){
      // cycle through character array, write first object to
      // address 0, print object from address zero to lcd
      // repeat and cylce through
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
        writeEEPROM(eeprom, i, abcs[i]); // write object at index i to eeprom address i
        clearlcd();
        lcd.print(""array object: "");
        lcd.print(i);
        lcd.write(0xfe); // These 3 lines
        lcd.write(0x45); // change my lcd
        lcd.write(0x40); // cursor location
        lcd.write(readEEPROM(eeprom, i));  // print object from eeprom address i
        delay(1000);
      }
    }
    
    void writeEEPROM(int deviceaddress, unsigned int eeaddress, byte data)
    {
      int rdata = data;
      TinyWireM.beginTransmission(deviceaddress);
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &gt;&gt; 8));
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &amp; 0xFF));
      TinyWireM.send(rdata);
      TinyWireM.endTransmission();
    }
    
    byte readEEPROM(int deviceaddress, unsigned int eeaddress)
    {
      byte rdata = 0xFF;
      TinyWireM.beginTransmission(deviceaddress);
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &gt;&gt; 8));
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &amp; 0xFF));
      TinyWireM.endTransmission();
      TinyWireM.requestFrom(deviceaddress,1);
      if (TinyWireM.available())
      {
        rdata = TinyWireM.receive();
      }
      return rdata;
    }
    
    void clearlcd()
    {
      lcd.write(0xFE);
      lcd.write(0x51);
    }

I've come to you as you are my last hope. I don't know where to start with the arduino. The most I've done is written simple programs that blink the onboard LED and external LEDs. 

I want to do more but I don't know where to begin. For example, how do circuit designers know what resistors to use (ie: 1000 kohm vs 100 kohm) or even when to use them. Because of this I haven't purchased any hardware (lcd, resistors, sensors, capacitors, etc...). 

And even if you get it all connected, there most likely isn't a library that helps you interact with it so you've got to write your own. How?

The tutorials I've seen introduce you to very basic things that all use the built in libraries and functions to get things done.

I'm just tired of being ignorant, even at the risk of sounding like a whiner in this post. The drive is there, but I'm just lacking direction. :/ I have ideas for projects and I want to know where I should start. If anyone is interested I can share them.

One of the big things we spend a lot of time on is 'fixed pointing'. This is where we take every single number we have in memory and turn it into an integer with a fixed scaling. (We get rid of every floating point number).

When I finally got my Arduino in the mail I decided to benchmark the difference. I was rather shocked. Below is the amount of time it takes to do 4 calculations 500,000 times. If you're just making a simple controller to do your Christmas lights it might not matter.

I am pretty new to the arduino and microcontrollers in general and need some help.

To try and get a better understanding of the arduino and control theory, I thought it would be interesting to create a temprature controller resistor (50W) using a thermistor and PID loop. The output signal to control the temperature would be the duty cycle square wave sent to a FET controlled DC chopper circuit on the resistor.

So at 100% duty cycle I would get ~170V across the resistor, and at %50 I would get ~85V.

I first tried setting up the circuit on the top

http://imgur.com/inH7qSM

While it was working, I was only getting about a ~2V square wave across the resistor, the rest was sitting on Vds. I figured that since I had the Source lead not grounded, I may not have been driving the FET completely on from my 5V PWM. So I tried switching the location of the FET and the resistor creating the bottom circuit.

At this point, nothing happens so I de-energize the circuit. I put the scope on my PWM out and its fucked. Its now a very low voltage sine wave, not a 5V square wave.

I can still connect to the arduino and upload code, but none of the analog outs seem to be working.

I think I have an arduino uno, but I can't confirm right now. Any help would be awesome.

I was pretty impressed that the 328p survived a brief introduction of 9V straight to the 5V pin!

Next I may add some actual graphics and maybe some sort of rainfall or LDR to measure light levels, although not sure how to convert LDR readings to something useful like Lux/Lumins.

This is version 0.1, so I'd appreciate any feedback, including constructive criticism.  You can see pictures of the build [here](http://imgur.com/a/v65DS) and get the code that I used [here](http://pastebin.com/U4avRPaM).

The accelerometer has a few screens that display acceleration information.  The first displays X &amp; Y acceleration along with bar meters of each, the second displays longitudinal acceleration in a large font, the third displays X, Y, &amp; Z acceleration along with bar meters of each, the fourth is a graphical display of X &amp; Y acceleration, and the fifth shows maximum and minimum acceleration values for all three axes.  Additionally, the backlight changes color in response to longitudinal acceleration.

Besides the components needed to build a [standalone Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone), I used the following major components for this build:

[ST7565 graphic LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/250)

[HEF4050BP non-inverting buffer](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/HEF4050B.pdf) (included w/ purchase of gLCD from Adafruit) for converting 5 V signals to 3.3 V


[ADXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/163)

[MCP1702 3.3 V regulator for powering the accelerometer and HEF4050BP](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/MCP1702-3302E%2FTO/MCP1702-3302E%2FTO-ND/1098463)

Three 330 Ohm resistors to put in series with the display backlight LEDs and 5 V PWM source

One [tactile switch](http://www.adafruit.com/products/367) for switching between displays

One 120 Ohm resistor to put in series with the tactile switch

[Universal prototype board](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103800)

Initial setup of the ST7565 can be found in the [Adafruit tutorial](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/lcd/st7565.html).  For the sake of clarity, I'll briefly summarize what I did.  First, I soldered some ~3"" wires to each of the ST7565 inputs and outputs.  The ST7565 that I have came with an RGB backlight rather than a monochromatic one, so it has 11 pinouts instead of 9 pinouts.  The pinout is as follows:

B-:  Cathode of blue backlight

G-:  Cathode of green backlight

A+:  Common RGB LED anode

R-:  Cathode of red backlight

GND:  Ground

VDD:  +3.3 V

SID:  Serial input data

SCLK:  Serial input clock

A0:  Register select input pin

RST:  Reset

CS:  Chip select
     
     

The ST7565 expects 3.3V at the inputs, so you need to use the 4050 non-inverting buffer to convert the 5V Arduino outputs to 3.3V.  The Adafruit tutorial also covers this.  Basically, the 4050 has a 3.3V input, a ground, and I/O pins.  The I/O pins are adjacent to each other, so just connect a 5V signal to an input, and you'll see the same signal scaled down to 3.3V on the adjacent output.

Setting up the ADXL335 accelerometer is also pretty straightforward.  I used a 3.3 V regulator to power it, although I don't see why you couldn't just use the 3.3 V output on the Arduino.  I can't recall my reasoning for using the regulator, I just included it early on and it somehow carried through the design.  Anyway, the ADXL335 has six pins:

GND:  Ground

Z:  Z acceleration

Y:  Y acceleration

X:  X acceleration

3V:  +3 V (can accept 1.8-3.6 V)

TST:  Test pin (provides known response on X,Y, &amp; Z pins when powered)

    
     
I grounded the test pin to prevent it from floating and causing erroneous readouts on the X,Y, &amp; Z pins.

Here is how I had the components connected to the Arduino:

A1:  Z accelerometer pin
A2:  X accelerometer pin
A3:  Y accelerometer pin  (I switched the X &amp; Y pins because I changed the orientation of the ADXL335 when I took it off the breadboard)

2:  Tactile switch
3:  (Will be connected to audio feedback in future rev)
4:  NC
5:  LCD CS
6:  LCD RST
7:  LCD A0
8:  LCD SCK
9:  LCD B-
10:  LCD R-
11:  LCD G-
12:  LCD MOSI

The LCD B-/R-/G- are connected to the Arduino via 330 Ohm resistors.  The tactile switch is connected via a 120 Ohm resistor, with the other leg of the switch connected to +5 V.

That's pretty much it.  The rest of the magic happens in the code, which you can find [here](http://pastebin.com/U4avRPaM) (same as above).  I'd like to reiterate my thanks to Oliver Kraus, who did a lot of work to make his u8g library work with the ST7565 display.  I tried a few different libraries, and found this one to be the most useful.

Here are a few notes that may be of help, in no particular order:

-You can't display floats with a graphical LCD, although you can display integers and strings, among other things.  I used the dtostrf function to convert floats to strings.

-The accelerometer output depends on the input voltage.  The zero point will be half of the input voltage.  The rate of change (in mV/g) is ideally 0.1 times the input voltage (in mV).  So if you're supplying 3.3 V to the accelerometer, the board will output 1.65 V when not accelerating, and the output will change by 330 mV for every 1 g of acceleration.

-The u8g library can't display a box with negative dimensions relative to the origin of the box.  To display a box that increases in size in the negative direction in proportion to negative acceleration, draw a larger box, then overwrite it with cleared pixels to get a box of the proper dimensions.

-The fonts in the library take up a fair amount of memory, and are only loaded as they're needed.  If you want to use a wide variety of fonts, especially very large ones, make sure you have enough memory available.

Future improvements:

-Currently, the display only updates once every 500 ms, and no other processes take place during the delay.  The refresh rate will be decreased and a currentMillis/previousMillis loop will be added so that data collection and backlight updates will occur independent of display refresh.

-I'm going to include an audio feedback that changes pitch and volume in proportion to acceleration.  This will, of course, be able to be switched on and off.

-It would be nice to add GPS data logging and write position/acceleration values to an SD card so that you can plot acceleration on a map at a later time.  That will probably require a Mega, I would guess, although I haven't done much research on the matter yet.

-The current zeroing process requires that the accelerometer be level and accelerations are computed assuming that gravity was acting on the Z-axis only while zeroing.  Future revs may include algorithms to eliminate this assumption.",,False,,t5_2qknj,True,,,True,t3_phfr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/phfr6/arduinobased_accelerometer_with_graphic_lcd/,

Here is a link: http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-Touch-Screen-Compatible-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0010LXJYC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369151785&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=touch+pad+arduino


Google it, there are plenty of people who have made small projects out of these. A great, cheap, simple add-on for your collection. Also, if you want an actual color screen, this seems like an interesting one: http://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-Mega2560-Display-Adjustable-Duemilanove/dp/B008FWSH3C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369152059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=arduino+touch+screen

I have a few ideas floating around involving a touch pad, but we will see how that turns out. One thought would be to print the Android lock screen (3X3 buttons) on a piece of paper, put that on an enclosure of 3X3 LEDs, and put the touch pad in front of everything. Put this setup on my door, and basically have an Android lock unlock my house door. 

Anyways, just thought I would share these things I found.",,False,,t5_2qknj,False,,,True,t3_1erql5,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1erql5/found_a_few_cheap_interesting_parts/,

It's significantly more complicated than just slowing the clock down, but if you're interested in controlling the AVR's power state the ""right"" way instead of just using a simple hack, it's a good starting point.  For more information, [RTFM, Section 9](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc8161.pdf).

Caveats: 

- all PWM stops when you're in ""power save"" mode.
- hacking this code to use ""idle"" mode instead will work at a cost of about 5ma extra current draw and sleep() finishing about 5x faster than normal.  If anyone is really interested in figuring out what's going on, let me know in the comments and I can give you some things I discovered in troubleshooting.
- sleep() has a granularity of 5ms, because the ATMega is very slow to enter and exit Power Save mode.

Final note, please don't bother me (or anyone else) with religious and/or philosophical arguments about what the code *should* look like.  If you like pure, pristine, theoretically perfect code, you really shouldn't be working with microcontrollers (or hardware in general, for that matter.)  Feel free to correct bugs, however - nobody's perfect!

Thanks for all the help!,loserpolice,20,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/o5zez/arduinocontrolled_kegeratorfermentation_chamber/,"I have spent the past few months on and off (mostly off) working on an arduino-controlled kegerator/fermentation chamber combo.  The kegerator is a repurposed chest freezer.  The freezer is switched on and off by the arduino connected to a powerswitch tail.  


The fermentation chamber sits above and cold air is blown into the chamber by two computer case fans.  There is also a fan in each the fermentation chamber and the kegerator to circulate air to ensure an even temperature.


With a considerable amount of help from /r/arduino, I was able to connect everything safely.  It was no small task for me having very little electronics training (never used a soldering iron before this project).


Just this morning I wrote a short program to turn on the freezer, circulate air, and monitor the temperatures to the serial monitor.  I was ecstatic when i finally got it all to work together.


Anyway, here are some [pictures of the project](http://imgur.com/a/xEgdN#kbthj).  Please excuse the cell phone quality.


Thanks for all the help.  I'm looking forward to some temperature controlled brews out of this thing.

Any help or input would be much appreciated.

I am planning on building a kegerator/fermentation chamber for a homebrewing project([like this one](http://www.wortomatic.com/articles/The-Mother-of-All-Fermentation-Chillers)) and I will need to monitor and control three separate temperature zones.

Zone 1 would be the kegerator zone and controlled by a 120vac relay to a chest freezer.

Zones 2 and 3 would be the fermentation chambers and controlled by PC fans blowing air from the chest freezer.

I would also like to incorporate and LCD panel readout with push buttons to take temperature adjustment input.  Probably going to use [this LCD shield](http://www.robotshop.com/dfrobot-lcd-keypad-shield-arduino.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=base&amp;utm_campaign=jos). 

My questions is would the Arduino Uno be able to handle this amount of hardware?

From what I can tell has 14 digital I/O pins, of which I would need 7 for the LCD and 3 more for the fan control. And it has 6 analog I/O pins, of which I would use 1 for the pushbuttons on the LCD shield and 3 for the temperature sensors.

Also, I understand that I will need to build a relay for the AC to the chest freezer, but how should I go about powering the fans.  Can I simply have them powered directly from the Arduino board, do I need a separate power supply?

Here are the [photos](http://032koncept.imgur.com/diy_smoketracker) (imgur album).  


tl:dr, I made something kinda elctronicsy that I am proud of.  first time.

Story: 
Several months ago my boss mentioned to the three developers that work in our office (who are also smoking) that they were were doing an ""experiment"".  

It turns out for several weeks they decided to record and monitor when we went out and smoked (we all go at the same time usually) and who initiated it.  The idea was, to capture data, then to change the parameters (like letting us know they were recording it or other things) to see if the data changed, then make a marketing case study about it.  Fortunately, the boss is ultra cool and **none of this was to bust our balls about smoking**.  

As developers at a company that specializes in making boring data interesting - we of course decided to build a website.  We would click ""I'm smoking"" when we went out, and the site would log the time (in / out).  Of course, we never accurately entered in data to the website (because it required remembering to go to a website before you went out and smoked).

I then came up with the idea to make a physical interface where we would walk past it and punch buttons.  Something that might make it easier to remember to record that data.  Sure enough, I managed to get a very basic proof of concept done within a few days, but kind of forgot about it.  Then a few months later I decided ""Hey, I might as well finish(kinda) it!"".  It took me 3 days, but now I have effectively a punch clock that updates a database!

**How it works : **

3 Buttons are Toggles for the LEDs.. Essentially the LEDs light up when you've pushed the button (for each person).. then the arduino sends data to a perl script running on my machine that updates the website.  The website connects to the database and accesses the last punch.  The website also every second runs some javascript to check if the status has changed, and if it has, it'll display the new smoking status on the website with a nifty smoking animated gif.
