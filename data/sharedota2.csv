This is a full key. It comes with two guest invites. If you want the key, post a top-level comment with your SteamID and a link to your Steam profile. I won't be checking sub-comments for entries. I will draw in approximately 24 hours.

While this giveaway will be random(.org), I'm not giving it to someone with a bogus Steam account. If your account has only 1 free game on it or 0 hours played, don't bother entering. As much as I'd like to include everyone, I'm not risking giving it to someone who's going to sell it.

Because this key is real and ungiftable, I can't make the winner activate it. Therefore, I am going to friend the winner on Steam and type the key to him/her while we are both online. Three minutes later, I am going to post it on Reddit at the top of this thread for anyone to claim. NOBODY is selling this key. What the winner does with their invites is none of my business and out of my control, but they *will* claim the key.

------------------------------------

Edit: I still have my list of acceptable entries from my previous giveaway. I'm not going to list everyone on it, but if you are on it, you are automatically entered into this drawing. If you didn't enter yesterday, or want to be extra sure that I noticed you, feel free to post today.

Edit2: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Zj9Dw.png) is proof of the key I'm giving away (and the beggars). [Here](http://i.imgur.com/lHHIb.png) is proof of the key I gave away this morning. You can go back to the previous thread and confirm that the Steam account matches the Reddit entrant.

Edit3: This thread is being downvoted to the bottom of What's Hot by people who want to limit the competition. If you care to be a GGG, please vote the thread back up. I get zero karma out of this thread, it being a self post.

------------------------------------

The winner of today's key is **gopostalman!** Congratulations! I have sent a friend invite to him on Steam. Once we're both online, I will paste the key to him. Three minutes later, I will post it below this line in this thread.

------------------------------------

I've given the code to gopostalman. He activated Dota after I presented him with it. On the off chance that he used someone else's key at that precise moment and is sitting on this one, here it is:

Step 2: Comment on your initial entry (step 1) with the following: Why I should give you a key, Your experience with dota 1, HoN, or LoL, and How many hours a week you will play dota2.

Step 3: Comment on your initial entry (step 1) with the following: Your philosophy on how dota2 should be played (play styles), Favorite heroes, If you have a functioning mic or not, If you are more casual ~have fun guy~ or competitive ~i must win guy~ or even both, and any other games you play.

I am sorry to those who were not chosen, if more beta keys come my way I'll be happy to pass them out here! Until then FIGHT ON! You will all get your keys soon (:

EDIT: The purpose of this giveaway is so that I can have more people to play dota2 with.

EDIT2: Since I am not liking what I am seeing so far, I am removing the time constraints so that more people can post/and or fix the formatting of their entry. I will be checking in a few times to note the people that I favor, and will pick 5 people. At this point if you are not one of those 5, then you wont be a candidate for receiving the key and this giveaway basically will reach conclusion. I have yet to decide how I will sort out the 5 people. I am quite busy for the next 3-4 days so I will probably decide around 4-5 days from now which of those 5 will get the key. I also apologize for this long process, but I have given beta keys to a few people now and they dont play anymore (i know right?) SO with fury, I will make this a long process.


**EDIT3**: I have begun to send out PM's to people that I am interested in to get more information. I am checking on this thread whenever I can, so if you make an update to your post, I will most definitely see it. If you have received a PM, you will notice that I gave you a throwaway email to contact me with. I highly suggest that you also create a throwaway email to contact me with, as this will be the preferred mode of communication.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I also request that you tailor your responses so you can sell your self as the best person to play dota2 with.


*about myself; I have played the moba/ARTS genre for about 6-7 years. Before Dota-Allstars released Ancient Apparition I have already moved on to HoN and played that on and off until I received multiple beta keys (I was very lucky) on November. I am inspired by Na'Vi's play style  and also how composed FIRE is. I played casually almost the entire time, and the most serious my play has ever gotten was with a rival dota-allstars clan. I am an amateur looking for higher level play.*

The key will be given to new recruits to the organization. The few people currently in IHG that are not in the DotA2 beta will not be participating. 


This giveaway has a very high percentage of success for those that meet our qualifications. The chances, from our current estimate based calculations, may be as high as 20% for people that are eligible to join our community and participate in the giveaway. This percentage can be heavily influenced by your effort, credentials, and personality.


Our ultimate goal is to recruit many new faces. We know that most people who apply will be there to take a key and leave, but our keys will be given after close examination of our new recruits. The people who do not get a key will then have friends in the beta to play with once they get their own keys or when they get invited by another member. Becoming a part of IHG will not only give you this chance for a key in our giveaway, but increase your overall chance to get in sooner.


Recruitment to IHG is not limited to people without the beta. We are currently recruiting any players that meet our expectations and fill an application on our forum. The requirements to join are not high. Decent knowledge of DotA, a good personality, and loyalty to your new friends and home.

1) Your current **comment karma** total

2) Permalink(s) **directly** to your own posts in previous giveaways on this subreddit where you've posted and not obtained a key [only links directly to your comments will be counted]

3) Your steam profile URL

I'll give the keys to the two folks with the highest karma AND/OR the most prior attempts.  I'll consider entries posted within ~24 hours, and I'll announce the winners pretty soon afterwards.  Good luck.

**UPDATE 1:** Good news.  Looks like I may have two additional guest invites to give away.  After seeing all the responses here I checked with my friend (who got his beta key the same time I did), and he's willing to give away his two guest invites.  I'll review the responses tonight after 8PM PST and then announce the winners.

**UPDATE 2:** Got one more extra guest invite donated from another friend.  So **five** winners will be chosen.  I'm reviewing the responses now.

**UPDATE 3:** Here are the results so far.  48 total requests.  23 eliminated with zero prior attempts or did not post permalinks as requested.  12 more were eliminated with only one prior request.  Sorry but I'd really like the keys to go to those who've been trying for a while to get one.  I am reviewing the final 13 submissions.  Prior attempts is the key factor, but karma might help your chances...

**UPDATE 4:** For the 13 finalists, here is how the five winners are determined.  1pt for each prior attempt plus a karma bonus which is your comment karma divided by 100.  (Note: I capped the karma at 1000, but it did not affect the outcome.)

rules are simple:

-do not have the game already

**BOO** *WINNER*

* *Thage - 763*   **Redeemed**

*Note: If winners do not respond to my PM within 24 hours of my message I will do a redraw for that category.




So yesterday I checked my email and behold!  [Picture](http://imgur.com/QbKue)

Now as to why I don't deserve it? I did the survey less then 4 days ago and lied on all my answers. I figure if I put the highest answer for each category I'll be in the smaller pro section rather then the super large average section and be more likely to be picked. Whether that was the case or not I do not know, but I really don't deserve the key anyways.

But you don't care, so lets move on to the giveaway! Post a number between 1-1000 and then link your steam id through the word **PIKA** or **BOO**, only pick one of these words. If you don't know how, you can't enter the giveaway. If you post up your full steam ID not linked through either word, I'll consider your submission forfeit. Multiple submissions will also disqualify you from the drawing, please enter only once. First come first serve with numbers, so please search to see if anyone has your numbers first.


**To give everyone a chance the contest will last 24 hours and will end at 10:00PM PST 04/13/2012.**


Good luck everyone!

The answers were as such!

1.) Phantom Lancer- With his ability to replicate, there are no heroes in the game that can create so many attacks on screen!

2.) Maverick the Gambler- A mostly conceptual hero that shared the model of Rubick, removed from Dota due to some claim his RNG!

3.) Tauren Chieftain's "" Axe of the Chieftain""- Adds 300 Strength and has an active skill called Chieftain Strike (Massive pushback!) The trick was the fact that ""4 items"" were required to summon him (The four totems) and that ""Creatures of the creator"" (The icefrogs needed to get rid of chieftains invulnerability) needed to be used!

4.)Storm Spirit- Though razor was also re-worked, Storm Spirit kept 2 of his ability names, Lightning Grapple and Overload! The two Changed abilities are: Barrier: Absorbed Magic damage and Lightning rave which increased attack speed!

5.) Aghnahims Scepter- Originally only made for a few select intelligence heroes, this item used to be made up of Soul Booster Mystic Staff and a recipe! WOW.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I promise that should I ever get more keys, this will be the first place I come to give them out.

Hello ladies and gents, it makes me giddy to be able to give out one of my Keys, as much as I'd like to give out 2, one has been accounted for. However, please indulge me in this little riddle game I have set up for the chance to win! Note that this isn't some absurd riddle like the playdota ones, I have neither the time nor patience to contribute something THAT elaborate.

The first person to PM me with ALL of the answers shall win the prize, the contest will continue until I receive such a response, please note that it may take a while to respond as I am currently at work.

*Dons riddler cane and hat*

1.) A long a dreary fight it has been, us the scourge, them the sentinel. But alas, the shop has burned down, so we have no items.
We have all attained maximum power, yet know that as such, with no equipment to assists us, this nefarious villain attacks more often than all the other. Who is it I wonder, do you know?

2.) Rubick has a twin brother don't you know, who once fought this great never-ending war. But alas, his greed caused him to take his leave. Who was he?

3.)There was once a creature of immeasurable power, but brought low due to tenacious heroes. To do this 4 great items of power were sought out in the land, summoning this great noble warrior, our heroes were quick to learn his power was too great to be conquered alone. But in a twist of fate, the creatures of the creator were brought forth, weaking the great warrior, allowing for his defeat. The question remains however, that a great item was dropped by the warrior, told to give immense power to its wielder. No one knows what this item is called, or what it did. Do you?

4.) The chaotic storm used to be greatly different than the one we know today. Though two of his abilities retained the same name, the other 2 were changed greatly. What were they called, and what did they do?

5.) Eons ago, a great mage weapon existed, insanely difficult to make, only certain very specific heroes ever needed it to flourish. Nowadays its price is a shadow of its former self, what was this great weapons name? And what were the insanely expensive components to make it?

I'm gathered tons of these programs over the last few days (and may gather many more still tomorrow) and I figured rather than being one of those douchebags who sells them online to make a profit, I would give them away to deserving individuals. If you want one, respond to this thread and include the following:

1) Link to your Steam profile

2) Have at least one paid game on your profile. I don't want to give it to some empty account that you plan on selling/trading to someone

3) Write 5-10 sentences about why you want the key, and why you won't give up just because you get stomped 10 times

4) Tell me how I'm incredibly handsome, and not fat at all
Just these 4 easy steps and a beta key could be all yours!

EDIT: I'll be deciding the winners based on who responds first (though it will all be at my discretion ultimately). I'll send you your keys on Tuesday afternoon via PM (I fly back home Monday night and I'll be damn tired then).

EDIT2: It's over! I gave away 17 keys (very fun to type out over and over again). I started with the oldest posts and kept reading through until I found ones that stood out. I literally read each and every one of them, so don't be hating if you didn't get one :P A few tips for the future- Don't use a brand new account, I check that crap. Don't copy-pasta the same crap in every giveaway thread you enter either. People like me care enough to check that crap.

Here's a photo of me, by the way. Sadly I'm not as handsome as the man on the left, but I think I'm pretty skinny: http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/243508_525818724100254_359090661_o.jpg",,False,self,t5_2t1x2,1346801827.0,,,True,t3_z7x1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/sharedota2/comments/z7x1h/giving_away_15_beta_keys_still_need_to_count_them/,

There was a lot more interest than I was expecting. I guess Valve needs to start throwing out more invites. Anyway, I've decided on who it will go to. Congratulate http://www.reddit.com/user/startale for what they're about to receive.

There is one minor condition: startale will be encouraged to do as I did and give back to sharedota2 when (if) they can. The keys I received were on an account which was gifted dota2, so I expect star will also be receiving 2 keys to give to friends.

&gt;silencer, 282240, or some multiple thereof. literally infinite possibilities

Okay so here is the game to win the key:
1) Guess a number and a dota2 hero (below) closest number wins
2) Only upvote people, no downvoting allowed
3) Do not make multiple posts they will not be considered

Hints:
Choose a [Dota 2 Hero](http://www.dota-two.com/dota2-heroes) take the letters in the name (excluding spaces if necessary) and take the factorial of it. The number you get and multiply by my favorite number (1 through 100) and type the name of the hero you used.
&gt; Example:
&gt; Chen (four letters) so 4! or 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 (you can use a google) =24
&gt; Then multiply by a number (1-100) e.g. 64 so 24*64=1,536

Answer format would be (i'd like it if you used commas)
&gt; 1,536 Chen, Add anything else you want here

Conditions of Winning:
1) You do not spam
2) Your account is active-ish (my discretion not yours)
3) Follows the rules of reddit and this subreddit

External Information:
1) The only reason I ask that you provide a hero in addition is because I actually have 2 steam accounts with dota 2 and if you guess the hero right i will give you the 2nd dota2 only account (cheers) and if you just get the number portion right you will just be able to use the account until I no longer see fit (could be 5 seconds or 7 eternities).

The design is currently on 86 likes and we are trying to get 200 by the end of the day. Once it hits 200 I will pick a winner at random and PM to add them on steam.

Liking the link will only take a few seconds and it will be greatly appreciated.

Hey guys, Thanks so much for voting. This has pretty much been my first successful post on reddit and I really appreciate everyone voting and giving your opinion it means alot.

I have already picked the winner. I used a random name generator to mix everyones names up and put them into a numerical order then I used a random number generator to choose the winner. I will be PM the winner ASAP.

Thanks again

                 There are a few rules I go so you can be eligible for this giveaway.

Your account must have (3) or more games on it (I'm checking it and it's to avoid other people making a new reddit account or steam account to enter this giveaway) OR be worth more than $30. Just so I know it's not a throwaway account. To enter the giveaway, simply post your steamcommunity link (again to avoid other people who have DotA 2 but simply want more invites to trade it off) AND last but not least a reason why you want it. Giveaway will end on April 3, 2012 10:00 PM PST

Let's take it to the next level! Here's a quiz to tickle your brains a little bit (at least!). Whoever answers correctly first takes home 3 beta keys.

- **TASK &amp; RULES** - For each hero of Dota 2, consider whether it is theoretically possible to do infinite damage in ONE instance. You are allowed to only do the damage YOURSELF with your ONE hero--however, it is entirely up to you to choose which enemies you face in your scenario (so you are basically one versus any enemies you desire). For the target of your damage, you are allowed to use ANY SINGLE hero (for example an infinite strength Pudge).

*NOTE: BLADE MAIL IS NOT ALLOWED IN YOUR SOLUTIONS* (as it would allow any hero to do infinite damage by reflecting for example the attack of an infinite strength Pudge)

*PATCH: Dota 2 running the content from patch 6.75b (http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.75b) -- patch 6.76 is not implemented in Dota 2 yet!*

*In case any hero has multiple ways of doing infinite damage in theory, it is enough listing one of the ways the hero can do it.*

- **HOW TO ANSWER THE QUIZ** - In ONE post in this thread, list *every single hero* with the potential to do infinite damage and HOW they can do it against any given lineup of your choice. ONLY LIST HEROES WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO IT, ANY OTHER LISTINGS ARE INCORRECT.

e. g. *Ursa*: Stacking up an indefinite amount of Fury Swipes attacks on an infinite strength Pudge.

*Shadow Demon*: A single attack from the Disruption illusion of an infinite strength Pudge.

[...]

Good luck to all participants; may the theorycrafting games begin! (You do not need to list my two examples in your solutions).

To get a key (This is those kind of keys with 2 friend invites included on them as well), I want to read why YOU should have them. It might be because you have really tried to get a key, it might be because you'll write the greatest fanart or most epic story of why you should get the key. Just hit me up with something and I will, during the next 3-4 days handle out these 5 keys.

TL;DR: Give me epic stories of why you should have the key, and I'll give you the key!

*FingerFactor did a great job (he did work on it quite a bit after his post here), so he got the key. I'm quite happy with the result. Thank you all for trying!*


I have an spare key for anyone willing to make me some artwork.

During the last 3 years, the Healing Ward from Warcraft 3 has been my avatar, but it's getting old and ugly, specially considering 64x64 is the best there's available.

Since I don't want to waste anyone's time (like if many people remake the image) I'll ask you to post some artwork done by you, I'll choose one and ask him to do it. If you want to do it right away go on, but unless I like it I won't give the key and you would have wasted your time.

I'm not very picky, I want it as true to the original as possible, but higher resolution (enough for modern avatar usage, like 640x480) and greater detail. I really like that angry ward, so I want the same expression in his ""face"".

So that's it! I'm going to sleep now, I'll wake up in exactly 9 hours and check this thread.

Edit1: I can't believe I forgot the link:
http://www.dotastrategy.com/images/skill/healingward.gif

Edit2:
Wow so many people did it &gt;_&lt;

I like a few of them, but only have one spare, I'll have to choose, sorry for the ones that don't get it and put effort on it :(

Edit3:

FingerFactor's is my favourite, but it still needs some work, I'll ask him to work a bit on it (It doesn't look as angry, maybe it's because of the way he's turned towards right in the original). I'm sorry, I liked a bunch of others, I shouldn't have just posted and went to sleep so not many people reworked it. Oh well.

Congratulations and thanks for the awesome idea.

The final DotA 2 invite contest will be as follows:

&gt;People will post ""I want a Dota Key"" somewhere in the real world. This will be on like a little piece of paper and people will take pictures of where they decided to place the paper. The one with the best or most creative picture with ""I want a Dota Key"" wins. For example, I might go skydiving holding a giant sign saying ""I want a Dota Key"" for the contest

Judging will be held approximately a week from tomorrow so you have plenty of time to brush up on those photography skills. I don't care if you are in the picture or not, but the winner will be the person who has ""I want a DotA Key"" in the most unusual, bizarre, extreme, clever, or otherwise outrageous spot. Be sure to capture as much in the surroundings in the photograph so I can get a good estimate of where you are (eg. a brick wall 1,000 feet in the air looks the same as a brick wall 5 feet in the air at point blank range.)

EDIT: Meant to add **NO PHOTOSHOP**. If I can tell you've photo shopped your picture inj any way I will disqualify you from the contest.

Instructions:

1. this is the file holding the data:
http://imgur.com/hsa2l

2. There is a *.txt file hidden in the image (google should tell you how to decrypt that). The password to decrypt the image file is the 8th word of the first paragraph of a wikipedia page (hint hint).

3. Inside the text file there is an encryption hash (very common, unsalted). Decrypt that there is my email address. First response in my inbox with the subject ""I cracked it"" gets the key. 

4. Time limit is 48 hours. If nobody gets it then both this key and the other one I have will be regifted. 

5. Have fun. 

It really isn't hard. I was toying with something actually brute forceable and not just follow the breadcrumbs. 

1st warning: Attempting to reset my reddit password, whilst novel, won't work. Next time I get a message informing me its being attempted both keys are being withdrawn. What it does however do is give me your IP address. Unless you want to find yourself neck high in donkey porn I suggest you reset your router. 

2nd Warning: Y halo thar 10.215.206.177. Managed to reset before I got my BackTrack VM up and running. Last warning. Its not fair that you are spoiling it for other people. All the information you need is in this thread. Whilst social engineering is novel and at least shows you are thinking its not cool. Also think when was the last time you saw a password reset form that actually told you the email address of the place it was sending the request?

Edit: This... this is getting complex. Keys are still available. Everything you need up to and including decoding the email address is available in the thread below. One person has at least got to the final decryption stage but has not submitted an entry. You are making this far more difficult than it needs to be (considering I spelt out the process). Thank you for stopping the password reset attempts. 

Double Edit: If I was going to try an crack, for example, an MD5 hash, I would use John the Ripper. And I would supply it with some characters, for example athotmaildotcom. Some kind of dictionary attack based on T3ppic would be cool. Like Teppic or T3pp1c or some mixture of Teppic and my country of origin like someone managed to social engineer (British or lowercase abbreviated synonym there of). 

Honestly now guys that last edit practically gave you the answer. ********athotmaildotcom 8031810176 possible hashes which for even the slowest computer is about 10 seconds of work. And you know how to narrow the list down. 

Triple Edit: To make it fair Krayons gets the 2nd key because he managed to get from start to finish and got stuck due to a slow computer. So Krayons if you still want a key PM me your email.  For everyone else one more key is still available.

&gt;Why hello sir! I noticed you have a dota 2 beta key in your hands there.
I don't know if you can tell where I'm from but I'm from the poor part of town. You see, my parents used to be rich but they lost all their money in something called the housing market. I don't really understand any of it.
Since that happened, I haven't been to school. I've taught myself how to read and write, and built a computer from scratch using chicken wire and 9-volt batteries we found in the gutter. I learned how to do that from this computer engineering book I swiped from the store up the street.
I'm not too keen on how the internet works but this ""internet cafe"" lets me plug in my computer and log into reddit. I've learned about this Dota 2 game from being here and I told the guy who runs the place how much I really want a key. He said that he doesn't have any, but if I manage to get one myself then he will give me one of the cafe's computers so I can play it.
So, that's my story.
Please, if you don't mind, I would like the beta key!

Anyone found too illiterate to read the rules before hitting enter will be flogged.

Here is some advice from ElusiveByte:
&gt;This thread was created as a place for people who want to offer services, artwork, crafts, ~~TF2 items~~, etc. in exchange for a key. You may not offer money for a key, or anything that can easily be purchased by anyone, like Steam games. You may not offer anything illegal. Offering invites to private torrent sites will likely be prohibited.
While giving money for a key is not allowed, you may offer to make a contribution to charity in the key sharer's name for a key. It's up to you and the key sharer to decide how best to handle this.
Basically, someone with a key should be able to come to this thread and see all of the things that people are offering for a key. This will keep the thread list a lot shorter, and new threads will be focused on people giving away keys.
Try to think before you make an offer: Does anyone really want what you are offering? Don't post silly things unless you really think someone might trade a key for it. If you do post something dumb, don't be surprised if your comment gets removed. This is not just another thread in which to beg for keys. Use the Invite Signup Thread for that.

Edit: YOU DO NOT POST SIMPLE REQUESTS FOR KEYS HERE!

Edit 2: Yay, reading comprehension... I just removed around 10 comments offering games/etc. for keys so I'll spell out the relevant rule here.

&gt; Do not offer money in exchange for a key, or anything that can (or could) be easily purchased, like Steam games.

UPDATE: To those asking how this puzzle should be solved:

* First copy that string in the adress bar of your browser, and you will see that it actually is an image of an qr code!
* Scan it with your phone or with a web based scanner and it will lead you to a website.
* In the sourcecode of the page, there's a rot13 encoded string
* Unrot13 it and you get: SPUNKGARGLWEEWEE

1. Post your steam name

4. If you post your steam name and you are not on steam to accept I will stop giving away the other keys, since I don't want to wait on your time.

As per my last thread, I am giving away dota 2 invites for Australians again!

Long story short, I've acquired another 3 invites to Dota 2 - one full invite and two attached guest passes. Because I don't trust anyone enough to share the guest invites with redditers, I will be giving away a steam account with Dota 2, as well as the two guest passes. So first I will find a winner for the steam account, create their desired account, activate the dota 2 key, give away the two guest invites, and then give the winner their new steam account with dota 2 (meaning it might be 2 days or so before you get the account).

As with the previous thread, I would like some friends to play with on dota 2! So I'm looking more for willingness to play as a teammate, friendliness, and willingness to improve your mad skillz (I don't really mind if you are terrible so long as you will let me teach you!)

Also anyone who applied in the previous thread is welcome to post again in this one! I have looked over the old thread and there are a few people I had in mind but I don't know if they have gotten keys in the meantime.
So if you would like to apply, please state:

*  Your current steam account :

*  Your desired steam account name :

*  Why I should want to play with you, your previous dota experience, anything you'd like me to know :

Thanks:D


EDIT: 2/3 keys have been given away now (with the third probably going very soon).  Thanks to everyone for writing in - I really am sorry I don't have a key for everyone.  As before, if I get any new ones I'll come back here and keep giving them out.  I also encourage anyone else who has spares to do the same:D

1. 18+.
2. European or used to play between 2 PM - 2AM(GMT) and wouldn't mind playing atleast two matches daily.
3. Experienced in DoTa or HoN, atleast a year (combined or not).
3. Speaks english fluently.
4. Doesn't mind going on vent and has MIC.
5. Friendly, not a stereotypical and narrowminded flamer. If you get angry easily - do not apply.
6. Knows that DoTa is all about teamwork and has the teamplayer mindset.
7. Really excited for DoTa 2!

Additional characteristics that would make my choice easier are welcome. And do note that I'm looking for a person to play in a group with, not to give a key to someone who would simply go his own way or play barely at all!

I'll start out by choosing the comment with the most upvotes, but I know many people out there are assholes and will just downvote other people's comments, so if that doesn't work, i'll just choose whatever comment I think is the best. This ends at 12 AM EST, so if you post after then, you're outta luck, sorry.

Edit: Alright, contest is over, i'll be reading through the comments and choosing a winner momentarily. I will send the winner a PM.

Edit 2: Okay so I have chosen the winner! He/she will receieve a PM soon. I read through all the comments and chose the best ones. Then I went through those people's comment/post history AND their steam profiles to see how dedicated they are to gaming and how dedicated they are to getting a key. Sorry to those who lost, i'm sure your luck will turn out better next time!

Everyone post in this thread who wants one, I will print off a list of your names, toss them in a hat and will choose a winner once I feel like there are enough people in the thread, but will definitely be at some point tonight.


I figure this is fairer than last time and if anyone has suggestions let me know. Good luck!

There will be some changes made to the milestone brackets. This is to allow for quicker beta key giveaways so that people can enjoy the game sooner =) The new brackets and corresponding number of beta keys given away are:

88 Followers (Winner: @LIkonen, 18 April 2012, No. 69)
138 Followers (Winner: @RobertLif, 19 April 2012, No. 88)
188 Followers (Winners: @rowanstruwig, No. 42 and @Aubreebree, No. 96, 23 April 2012)
225 Followers (2 Winners)
250 Followers (2 Winners)

For 188, 225 and 250 brackets, instead of one winner, we will now have two winners which means to say that two random numbers will be generated for each of these rounds. This doubles everyone’s chances of winning a key in each round. As usual, the upper limits on the numbers generated will correspond to the milestone for that bracket and all other rules apply.

I have 3 more keys to give away! I started a topic requesting a CS GO key, As I find this highly unlikely, I figure Ill just give my keys away for free =) BUT can I please request that if you do get an invite for CSGO in the future, you please consider me.

Not sure how to do this. But please Include your STEAM ID. I would rather not have the unfair advantage of multiple accounts replying to the post. 

Question - Whats my Favourite Car? Hint - Its Japanese. Edit- MAKE and MODEL. Thanks 

The person who gets that right first will get a key. That is my only random question. 

For the fact of people complaining about Randomness, I would like the other answer to be about why you think you derserve the key over all the other people who reply. The two other keys will go to what I think are the best replies. 

Include both answers in your question if you wish.

Good luck. 

You all have just over 5 hours from now. 7:30pm (GMT +10) 



Edit - The Car has been guessed by atyahoodotcom. Will read through the other posts in 45 minutes to determine which 2 won the other keys. Thanks

The keys are gone. Good Luck to everyone else

(do the Steam survey, it works)





Hey

A couple months ago I went crazy to get my hands on a beta key, so I created 7 new E-mail addresses and corresponding steam accounts to fill in the Steam survey.

Last night I got 4 keys out of 7.
The one I'm giving to my friend.

So I have 2 keys, which are linked to fresh Steam accounts and gmail E-mails.

So... No competition, nothing, the first two people to post here with their names and a simple 'thank you' will get the Keys.
(1 each)

And that will be it.

I tried to give it away for reddit's secret santa, but my giftee didn't want it/play games :(

**Find x, where x is an integer such that it equals (number of days since I got my invite to dota2beta) minus (total number of games of dota2beta I've played).**

Example 1: If I got my invite 3 years ago and played  ~100 games of dota2beta. Then the answer is around 1000. (1095-100 = 995)

Example 2: If I got my invite a month ago and played 34 games a day since, the answer is around -1000. (30-1020 = -990)

I'll put a comment under whoever is closest to x on Friday night.

Edit: per tgftw's suggestion, I will not be accepting responses if your account was created after this post was made. Edit yet again: The winner I choose will be a pseudo-active redditor, defined by myself. I've been looking at comment histories, and the idea of giving it to someone who has only made comments on r/sharedota2 does not appeal to me. Sorry I keep changing the rules. Yes, I'm a meanie and a dictator. Also it has to be for yourself, not a friend.

Another edit: changed it to ""day i got my invite"" as opposed to ""first day i played"" or ""day i installed it"" to be more specific since all three days are actually different and I know the invite date from my e-mail history.

**tl;dr Guess an integer. I'll pseudo-randomly assign a winner.**

***********

**Final Edit:** Time to announce results and explain my choice in the pseudo-arbitrary winner. I received my beta invite on 3/3/11. Today is 1/13/12. So, I got my invite 316 days ago. I've played about 5-10 games. So 306 &lt; x &lt; 311.

Closest guesser is [Animasitas](http://www.reddit.com/user/Animasitas) with 300.

Next closest is [derkunde](http://www.reddit.com/user/derkunde) with 279.

I did not consider either of them very active Redditors.

Next up is [mitsuhiko](http://www.reddit.com/user/mitsuhiko) with 275.

According to his comment history, I believe he already has/plays dota2beta. Plus [this](http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitsuhiko) is probably him, and clearly has dota2beta.

That leaves [jeepersnz](http://www.reddit.com/user/jeepersnz) with 274 as the winner whom I choose.

&gt;You have twelve silver orbs. You know that one is fake. The only thing that distinguishes the fake orb from the real orbs is that its weight is imperceptibly different. You have a perfectly balanced scale. The scale only tells you which side weighs more than the other side.

&gt;What is the smallest number of times you must use the scale in order to always find the fake orb?

&gt;Use only the twelve orbs themselves and no others, no other weights, no cutting orbs, no pencil marks on the scale. etc.

&gt;For clarification, you do not know whether the counterfeit orb is heavier or lighter than the rest.

&gt;Presume the worst case scenario, and don't hope that you will pick the right coin on the first attempt.

Just wanted to say that I'll be giving out three DOTA keys away to three different people. Here's how it'll go.
Basically, I'm thinking of a number between 1-100 (for the first key) The person to get closest will get the key, you only get one entry per key, if you've already won a key, let someone else get one. xP 

1-100    (First key)
101-200 (second key)
201-300 (third)

For example, you could post like this,

'I'm guessing for the first key, (put's number here) , (Steam URL) '

And so on, and so on. 

I just want to put a smile on someone's face, life can be pretty hard these days and games could provide an escape for a little bit. (Not saying you should spend all your times playing games, bwhahaha!) 

The people who guess the number (+2/-2 , For example, if the number was 36, if you guessed 34 or 38, you'd win.) first, wins the key. You can post for all three keys, but if you post on one key, wait thirty minutes to post again for another.
