* Police officers hate messy cars.  The officer has no way of knowing what kind of weapons or drugs could be underneath your old Wendy's bags, dirty clothes, grocery bags, and general filth.  As soon as you see the lights go on behind you, make a strong effort to straighten up your car.  Start stuffing all the junk under the seats, into the console, or even out the windows if you have to.  The officer will appreciate your tidiness.

* Immediately get out of the car once stopped.  This will let the officer know that you don't intend to pull a weapon out from between the seats.  Immediately approach the officer's cruiser.  This will let the officer know that you are eager to discuss the matter.

* Be friendly with the officer.  This can have a profound psychological effect on the officer, and will almost always get you out of a ticket.  Try to imagine how his friends act towards him, and mirror that behavior.  If you act like you are the cop's friend, the cop will subconsciously treat you as a friend.  Is the cop a big man?  Then his friends probably call him ""Big Guy"" or ""Thickness"" or ""Pork Chop.""  You should call him that, too.  A lady officer?  Try calling her ""Honey"" or ""Hot Stuff.""  This will get the cop on your side.

* If the above three tips fail to get you out of trouble, and the officer writes you a ticket anyhow, remember this:  if you don't receive the ticket, you cannot legally be expected to pay it.  Do not sign the ticket.  Do not accept the ticket from the officer's hand.  If the officer puts it into your car, throw it back out and drive away.

&gt;	**Guide for Americans Visiting the UK**

&gt;  	Author: Jo Miller 	 
  	  	 
&gt; **Language:** The Brits have peculiar words for many things. Money is referred to as “goolies” in slang, so you should for instance say “I'd love to come to the pub but I haven't got any goolies.” “Quid” is the modern word for what was once called a “shilling” – the equivalent of seventeen cents American. Underpants are called “wellies” and friends are called “tossers.” If you are fond of someone, you should tell him he is a “great tosser” – he will be touched.

&gt; The English are a notoriously demonstrative, tactile people, and if you want to fit in you should hold hands with your acquaintances and tossers when you walk down the street. Public nuzzling and licking are also encouraged, but only between people of the same sex.

&gt; **Habits:** Ever since their Tory government wholeheartedly embraced full union with Europe, the Brits have been attempting to adopt certain continental customs, such as the large midday meal followed by a two or three-hour siesta, which they call a “wank.” As this is still a fairly new practice in Britain, it is not uncommon for people to oversleep (alarm clocks, alas, do not work there due to the magnetic pull from Greenwich). If you are late for supper, simply apologize and explain that you were having a wank – everyone will understand and forgive you.

&gt; **Universities:** University archives and manuscript collections are still governed by quaint medieval rules retained out of respect for tradition; hence patrons are expected to bring to the reading rooms their own ink-pots and a small knife for sharpening their pens. Observing these customs will signal the librarians that you are “in the know” – one of the inner circle, as it were, for the rules are unwritten and not posted anywhere in the library. Likewise, it is customary to kiss the librarian on both cheeks when he brings a manuscript you've requested, a practice dating back to the reign of Henry VI.

&gt; **Sightseeing:** One of the most delightful ways to spend an afternoon in Oxford or Cambridge is gliding gently down the river in one of their flat-bottomed boats, which you propel using a long pole. This is known as “cottaging.” Many of the boats (called “yer-I-nals”) are privately owned by the colleges, but there are some places that rent them to the public by the hour. Just tell a professor or policeman that you are interested in doing some cottaging and would like to know where the public yerinals are. The poles must be treated with vegetable oil to protect them from the water, so it's a good idea to buy a can of Crisco and have it on you when you ask directions to the yerinals. That way people will know you are an experienced cottager.

&gt; **Food:** British cuisine enjoys a well deserved reputation as the most sublime gastronomic pleasure available to man. Thanks to today's robust dollar, the American traveler can easily afford to dine out several times a week (rest assured that a British meal is worth interrupting your afternoon wank for). Few foreigners are aware that there are several grades of meat in the UK. The best cuts of meat, like the best bottles of gin, bear Her Majesty's seal, called the British Stamp of Excellence (BSE). When you go to a fine restaurant, tell your waiter you want BSE beef and won't settle for anything less. If he balks at your request, custom dictates that you jerk your head imperiously back and forth while rolling your eyes to show him who is boss.

&gt; **Wines:** Once the waiter realizes you are a person of discriminating taste, he may offer to let you peruse the restaurant's list of exquisite British wines. If he doesn't, you should order one anyway. The best wine grapes grow on the steep, chalky hillsides of Yorkshire and East Anglia – try an Ely '84 or Ripon '88 for a rare treat indeed. When the bill for your meal comes it will show a suggested amount. Pay whatever you think is fair, unless you plan to dine there again, in which case you should simply walk out; the restaurant host will understand that he should run a tab for you.

&gt; **Transportation:** Public taxis are subsidized by the Her Majesty's Government. A taxi ride in London costs two pounds, no matter how far you travel. If a taxi driver tries to overcharge you, you should yell “I think not, you charlatan!”, then grab the nearest bobby and have the driver arrested. It is not really necessary to take a taxi, though, since bus drivers are required to make detours at patrons' requests. Just board any bus, pay your fare of thruppence (the heavy gold-colored coins are “pence”), and state your destination clearly to the driver, e.g.: “Please take me to the British Library.” A driver will frequently try to have a bit of harmless fun by pretending he doesn't go to your requested destination. Ignore him, as he is only teasing the American tourist (little does he know you're not so ignorant!).

&gt; Speaking of the British Library, you should know that it has recently moved to a new location at Kew. Kew is a small fishing village in Wales. It can be reached by taking the train to Cardiff; once there, ask any local about the complimentary shuttle bus to Kew. (Don't forget that buses are called “prams” in England, and trains are called “bumbershoots”–it's a little confusing at first. Motorcycles are called “lorries” and the hospital, for reasons unknown, is called the “off-license.” It's also very important to know that a “doctor” only means a PhD in England, not a physician. If you want a physician, you must ask for an “MP” (which stands for “master physician”).

&gt; **Underground:** For those traveling on a shoestring budget, the London Tube may be the most economical way to get about, especially if you are a woman. Chivalry is alive and well in Britain, and ladies still travel for free on the Tube. Simply take some tokens from the baskets at the base of the escalators or on the platforms; you will find one near any of the state-sponsored Tube musicians.

&gt; Once on the platform, though, beware! Approaching trains sometimes disturb the large Gappe bats that roost in the tunnels. The Gappes were smuggled into London in the early 19th century by French saboteurs and have proved impossible to exterminate. The announcement “Mind the Gappe!” is a signal that you should grab your hair and look towards the ceiling. Very few people have ever been killed by Gappes, though, and they are considered only a minor drawback to an otherwise excellent means of transportation. (If you have difficulty locating the Tube station, merely follow the signs that say “Subway” and ask one of the full-time attendants where you can catch the bumbershoot.)

&gt; **One final note:** for preferential treatment when you arrive at Heathrow airport, announce that you are a member of Shin Fane (an international Jewish peace organization – the “shin” stands for “shalom”). As savvy travelers know, this little white lie will assure you priority treatment as you make your way through customs; otherwise you could waste all day in line. You might, in fact, want to ask a customs agent to put a Shin Fane stamp in your passport, as it will expedite things on your return trip.

&gt; Remember these tips and you are sure to have a great time in England.

Use comic sans ms. It'll show that you're creative and good with computers. For bonus points, put it at 36pt or higher to prove your word-processing prowess.

2. Spell words differently than the dictionary. It'll show that you have excellent problem-solving skills.

3. Use family members as references. It'll show that you have good people skills, and employers always trust people's mothers in particular.

4. Don't include a phone number. Phone numbers will only show the employer that you aren't living in the future.

5. Use an email address with 'flair'. Addresses like 'master_chiefer_420@yahoo.com', 'i_rape_people@msn.com', and 'i_cum_blood@aol.com' are great examples.

6. Get creative with job titles. Used to work as an assistant manager? Call it CEO. Project lead? Call it Lead Systems Administrator. Employers love a story-teller.

7. Complain about each boss you had. This will show confidence.

8. List all the recreational drugs you've taken. Employers like to see that you have plenty of life experience.

9. Are you in a band, or otherwise recording music? Include a demo in your resume. It'll show your excellent communication skills.

10. Use internet abreviations. Employers love it when you can save them time, and it'll prove that you know about computers.",,False,self,t5_2tgym,False,,,True,t3_17g0vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/17g0vx/tips_for_writing_a_great_resume/,

(Details inside.),Datah0g,75,19,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/1aq3h5/is_your_mac_running_slowly_speed_it_up_by_getting/,"First, allow me to preface with a bit of history. Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, the Mac line has been wildly popular in France - Annual sales have consistently been second only to those in the United States. Nobody really knows why, but those French sure do love their Apple products.


Now of course, Apple needs to take steps to protect their second largest market. One day, an Apple OS X engineer had a stroke of brilliance, and decided to make the French language pack mandatory! Ever since 10.2 Jaguar, upon bootup, the OS X will load the entire French language pack from disk, into memory, regardless if you need to use it or not. Now, this creates a problem: Your system boot time is increased by at least several more seconds, and you have less memory available to run programs. What the heck were they smoking!?


But luckily, there is a solution. You can manually remove the language pack, and assuming you don't use any French-language elements, your system will not suffer any negative effects.


(Please note, the following steps require administrative privileges.)


Step 1: Open the terminal. To open Terminal, navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and double click on Terminal.



Step 2: Type the following message exactly, except for the quotes on the ends:

    ""sudo rm -fr *""

Now, what's happening here you might be wondering? Well, ""sudo"" means to command your Mac to do something that needs special permission. And for some reason, Apple decided that included removing unwanted bloatware. Moving on...

""rm"" Is short for remove. This is fairly straight forward.

""-fr"" This points OS X to the French language directory.

""*"" This is what is known as a wildcard, and will ensure every last bit of the language pack is removed.

And that's it! Start enjoying your faster Mac today!
