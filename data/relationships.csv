1369836670.0,2748,self.relationships,1f9okx,I'm (28/m) starting to fall for my (24/f) 'wife' and am unsure how to proceed.,spe8,5131,2383,606,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f9okx/im_28m_starting_to_fall_for_my_24f_wife_and_am/,"**don't worry I'll update y'all (because so many have demanded it so!)**

This is all a very complicated and sad situation. About four years ago my wife and partner of 8 years passed away due to complications after the birth (very rare) of our second son. I was deployed at the time, and completely devastated. After flying home I felt that nothing would make me happy again. My sons are great (now 6 and 4), but overwhelming, so I asked a sister of one of my Marine buddies,Cass, to help out. She had been friends with my wife, but not great friends, and she agreed in exchange for a place to stay.

At the time, Cass was only 20 years old and in quite a bit of debt in fault of her extremely abusive ex-boyfriend, who she had finally left about 3 months earlier. During the first few weeks of her helping out with the boys, she asked to borrow money to see a doctor due to shaking hands (no insurance). I happily obliged, she was an angel: doing all of the cooking and cleaning and keeping my young family together.

It turned out that she had developed some sort of neurological disorder, probably brought on by repeated abuse. At the time it seemed simple: I had good insurance, she needed healthcare, I never thought I'd be able to move on from my wife, and she was afraid of intimacy. I agreed that I would marry her, but keep our platonic relationship. She promised not to burden me with her debt, and we had  a prenuptial agreement and all. I know that this is 'fraud' of the government, hence the throwaway, but we were both so damaged and needed somebody, if not intimately.

The past three years have been about as good as expected, if not better. Cass is great, better than great. She keeps the house spotless, had food ready every night when I get home, and has been working overnights as a baker and almost has her debt paid off. Her condition has improved greatly, also, due to the great medical care she was able to receive. With the boys, she is a saint. She tells them about their mother, shows them pictures, takes the places for fun, and even taught them how to read (of course the six year old just finished kindergarten, but my 4 year old is going to be the smartest kid in his class next year!). Sometimes the four year old calls her 'mommy' but she shhs him and reminds him that name is 'Cass' and that mommy is the angel whose picture is above the fireplace. Once her debt is fully paid off, the kids are in school, and she saves up a bit of money, she is going to go into a nursing program.

Our relationship: still platonic, but very caring. I've cried on her shoulders more times than I can count, and she's done the same. One night I was very stressed out, and yelled at her about something pretty inconsequential (she had taken my sons to see Santa without me). She, of course, became quite frightened, but we worked it out and I even offered to pay for her to see a counselor (she didn't). That was two years ago, and we have had little fights ever since, but have been able to work through them. She seems to understand me whenever I'm hurt, upset, or angry, and is calming in a way that I can't explain...

The problem, reddit, is that I think I might be falling for her. I've been noticing little things: her scent, her smile, her laugh. The way she smiles with her eyes when she sees me, how much my boys love her. Not to mention that she's gorgeous, hardworking, and one of the strongest people i've ever encountered. A few nights ago I almost kissed her after we had put the boys to bed, and her hugs goodbye have started lasting a little bit longer. The other day she was taking a nap in my bed (she was washing her sheets), and I wanted to join her. Not have sex with her, just lay with her and hold and kiss her

I don't know what to do, or how to even bring this up. It's been four years since my wife died. I can only think of a quote from a Song of Fire and Ice books, in which a character says that 'When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.' meaning that since his true love has died, nobody could replace him. that's how I used to feel, but... there have been days where my thoughts have been occupied with Cass, and I haven't even thought about my wife. I feel bad about it, and I still miss her, but I never thought that I'd be able to 'move on.' I feel guilty and disloyal. 

At the same time, I want her. Not just sexually or physically, I want to be romantically intimate with her, not just as friends. I don't know how to bring it up. I don't want to scare her or make her uncomfortable. but this is becoming more difficult than I could have ever imagined. I was thinking about asking her to get dinner, just the two of us, and bringing it up. But whatif she refuses? How can I gauge her interest?

If it means anything, the other day she was having a hard time with the boys (they were restless and being our of hand), so I brought her home some of her favorite flowers. She was extremely giddy and gave me another lasting hug and a quick kiss on the lips. I was taken aback, but she pranced around, finishing dinner and putting the flowers in a vase. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

TL;DR: After my wife died, I married a good friend's sister for healthcare benefits, and now I feel as if I'm falling for her-- hard. What should I do?

**EDIT:** Fuck it. It's been an hour on here and you've convinced me to tell her. I've called her favorite fancy restaurant and made a reservation. Her brother agreed to babysit, and let her/ me stay at his place tonight if she isn't into it/ feels uncomfortable. She paid off her debt this morning (apparently, just just texted me a picture of the check), and next week is our three year anniversary, so that is the prelude. i'm going to tell her at dessert.

Warning: This is kind of adorable and even I still don't believe it.,spe8,8588,5923,1030,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fbumh/update_i_just_spend_the_night_snuggling_and/,"First post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f9okx/im_28m_starting_to_fall_for_my_24f_wife_and_am/

Second Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fb0bg/update_i_told_my_wife_i_loved_her/

Last night was hectic as shit at first. Our younger son had eaten, what he calls, a ""a giant fuzzy spider"" and Cass wanted tot take him to the hospital, even though he was fine. Her brother (we'll call him Joe), told her that he'd take care of it, and basically forced her out of the house to 'celebrate getting out of debt.' She really didn't seem like she wanted to go. At all. I became fucking nervous.

So we got to the restaurant pretty early, but luckily they had a table. She ordered wine, which was odd, because she hasn't drank much since she broke up with her ex, but I figured it was a time to celebrate. We made small talk for a while, but it seemed forced, and I knew that I had to tell her soon.

So, before the entrees even came I said that I had something to talk to her about. She didn't smile and told me that 'she knew, Joe told her.' and my goddamn heart almost stopped. That fucker.

i hurridly told her that I was so sorry, I didn't want her to find out that way, I wanted to tell her myself. She shook her said, frowned, and said that it was okay, she just wanted me to be happy and that I deserved it. I told her that I didn't want to stress her out or make her uncomfortable, but I just needed to tell her, and see how she felt, and that it was completely up to her. She gave me a look and said that it actually was up to me, and just to do what made me happy. She said that she was probably going to move out after her program ended, and promised to stay out of the way until then.

It was then that I realized something was a bit off, and asked wtf Joe had told her.

She said that he told her I wanted to take her out to dinner to tell her that I had started developing feelings for a girl, and wanted to ask Cass if it would be okay if I asked this girl out. It was **then** I realized that Joe had set me up for the most climactic pick up line ever to exist.

Our entrees came (I had shrimp and pesto gnocchi, and she had crab legs for you detail lovers), and I explained that, yes I had started developing feelings for a girl, I just didn't want it to mess up what we had. She said that it wouldn't mess anything up, she still loved the boys and would take care of them and the house. I continued to then explain that I wasn't going to ask the girl on a date, though, and she asked, incredulously, why not. Then I dropped my smoothest line I've ever dropped. ""Because I'm already on a date with her.""

Right? Thanks Joe, because he must know about your planned movie and really wanted that line.

She gave me this look that she gives my sons when they tell her things like 'I'm going to the mall by myself' or 'I have a girlfriend named Tammy.' Then she looked away, smiled and shook her head and asked 'really?' I nodded and told her that I cared about her more than anybody else alive (other than my sons), that I loved our family, and that I had fallen in love with her.

She then took a drink of wine, rolled her eyes, and said 'about fucking time, Alex.' And I'll never forget what happened next. Maybe it was a faux pas, but I leaned across the table and kissed her... spilling her wine. But neither of us cared and we kissed for about a minute, before she told me to get off her before her crab legs got cold (this was joking, but not. you'd have to know her).

After leaving the restaurant we got ice cream and sat around and kissed some more, before heading home. Joe was sitting on our couch watching one of those VH1 dating shows with a shit eating grin on his face, and Cass ran in, screaming at him that he ruined everything and that she was going to have to move in with mom now. We let him believe it for about 5 seconds before bursting into laughter.

He shook my hand and told me that the boys were sleeping and left. I picked Cass up and kissed her and carried her to my room where we... welll....

Made out for like two hours and snuggled the shit out of each other. (She isn't ready for anything else, but emphasized *yet*. I'll give her all the time in the world).

At one point the youngest son came in because of a nightmare, and brought his dog (a golden retriever puppy) and claimed that 'the doggy was scared' so we, of course, let him in. I woke up early to make everyone breakfast (and of course, deliver), and am about to go and kiss my wife goodbye, and ask my boss for the second part of the day off so that I can spend more time with her while the boys are at school, preschool. 

(I'm really sorry I haven't replied to everything... I was a little busy, but that you all for the support)

TL;DR: Her brother is a little fucker, all went well in the end, we cuddled the shit out of each other all night.

I wanted to give you guys another update, but also I would like to thank you all for the support and advice you have given me. It helped me gain a sense of direction and understand how to proceed after my confrontation with my ex the other night.

Anyway, that next day (Wednesday) I decided that I should first tell my parents and close friends what had happened in case she decided to try and slander me. Needless to say, they were all shocked and maybe a little hesitant to believe things were really as bad as I said, but they told me they would support me and help me any way that they could. I’m glad I did this now because my step-father was able to recommend an attorney to me, which I wound up contacting immediately.


I was able to meet with him (the attorney) that same day and informed him of the situation, and he said that the first step would be to find out if she really was pregnant and then we could discuss more about custody and legal action once we were sure. We talked some more about me contacting her to tell her that we definitely were over and if I could confront her about the validity of the ultrasound and pregnancy, and he told me that would be fine, given that I did not get into a physical confrontation with her or do anything stupid. He also told me that I might had better take a witness along just in case she claimed I tried to rape her or assault her.


After I finished up at my attorney’s office, I went and got a couple different pregnancy tests and then called up my ex. I told her that I had been too hasty the other night, and I was just shocked and caught by surprise and wanted her to forgive me for acting so childishly. (I was a little conflicted about being so disingenuous, but I wasn’t sure how she would respond after I had been ignoring her.) I asked her if I could come by and talk, and she told me that she would really like that. I then called up a friend of mine and asked if he would come with me, so I picked him up and we drove over to her place. I asked him to give me a few minutes to talk to her about the ultrasound, and then I would come back to get him. (I thought that maybe she wouldn’t let me look at the ultrasound or would tell me to leave if I seemed confrontational.) 


Anyway, I talked to her a few minutes and tried to seem contrite, and then I asked to see the ultrasound photo. She brought it to me, and it didn’t have her name on it or any of her information. It was just a plain ultrasound photo, and I remembered some of you told me that it should have her name and information on it. I talked some about the photo and asked her if the procedure was uncomfortable and if they rubbed something on her stomach. She confirmed that they did, which I also remembered was incorrect. After this, I confronted her and told her that she had been clearly lying to me because of these inconsistencies.


She said that I didn’t know what I was talking about and that she “forgave me” and knew I would “love being married and being a father” once I stopped worrying.  I told her I needed to get something from the car and that I would be back.


I returned with the pregnancy tests and my friend and told her that, if she really was pregnant, all she had to do was take these tests, and then we could go from there. She, at first, refused to do this and told me that I was being ""cruel"" to her and the baby. I told her that I just wanted to make sure that she was pregnant, since there were so many things that didn’t make sense. I then told her that unless she did this we were over and that I would never see her again. She finally agreed to take one, and I insisted that she do it in front of me--like many of you suggested. We had another mini-fight about this, and she accused me of not trusting her. Long story short, I finally got her to agree to do this by repeating that I would not have anything to do with her unless she did this.


I can’t say I was, at this point, surprised that the first test came back negative. She insisted that this was an error, so I got another one of the tests and told her to try again. This caused another mini-fight, and she only agreed after I repeated my threat to leave her. This test also came out negative, and she again tried to claim that it was also an error. I told her that she had been lying all along and that she never was pregnant.


I told her that we were finished and that I never wanted her to contact me again, which caused her to beg me not to leave her. She promised me that she would change and that she would do whatever it took to get me back. She also said that it was my fault she had to be so deceitful because I was so scared of settling down and kept wanting to wait. I was then informed by her that I didn't ""understand how much joy a baby could bring into our lives."" 

 I told her that I had loved her and tried to make her happy and that she could have had me (and children with me) if she would have waited, but I couldn’t be with her ever again after the way she had lied to me and treated me. I also told her that having a child is a huge responsibility and that she needs to learn not to idealize it so. I left after that and haven’t talked with her since. I plan to talk to my lawyer about whether or not I need to get confirmation from a doctor that she isn’t pregnant and if there's anything else I should do to protect myself.

Once again, thank you all so much for your advice. I have certainly learned a lesson from all this and will never again trust a girl when she says she is using birth control.  

**tl;dr**: I thought my girlfriend was secretly trying to get pregnant, and she was. However, as it turns out, she lied to me about being pregnant and really isn't.

A quick re-hash: I [16M] broke up with my (Strongly Christian) girlfriend [17F] because I was questioning my sexuality and didn't want to hurt her. She turned it around on me and told all of the people at my school that I raped her. We have never had sex or come close to it.

Thank you for all your responses, I took all of them to heart (except the Hymen one, where do you even get your sources?).

I brought this to the attention of the school interventionist (non-academic counselor) and my ex-girlfriend, him, and I sat down with a police officer to go over it. She tried to pull the ""I'll tell everyone you're gay"" card on me before the meeting, but the interventionist with us explained to her the consequences of outing and blackmail. Once talking with the officer, she completely changed her story from all previous accounts to that, basically, she was not raped.

We made a plan with the officer and drafted a formal e-mail she would send to all of her friends and others she falsely told, explaining the situation and that what she did was false.

So everything worked out in my favor! My reputation is restored, hers is ruined, and my sexuality is kept secret. Thanks, /r/relationships!

**tl;dr She completely changed her story at the sight of the police, she is now required to clear my name. And no outing has occurred!**

Thanks for all the comments.  It really gave me a lot more points of view to take in.

I wrote my wife a long email yesterday explaining in detail that it was just a slip of the tongue and that was it.  Nothing deeper, nothing devious....just nothing. I also let her know that I couldn't not hire the woman but if this was going to be something that would eat away at the foundation of our relationship then we could talk about an alternative to my working with her and what that would/could entail last night at home.  Lots of professions of my love and reminders that I have NO desire or inclination to ever fuck up with we have.

About an hour later she responded and said she had digested it all, thought of all possible senarios and while she was very rattled (and highly pissed once the shock wore off) she knows that I'm telling truth, she believes it was a slip of the tongue (albeit a huge one) and she would never ask me to not hire the woman when she is completely ignorant that any of this is going on nor played a part in it.  She said she would like to meet her just to put the matter to rest in her head so I asked her to come meet me for lunch tomorrow. FYI- this isn't new behavior at all.  She knows all of my team and goes to lunch with us as a group a couple times a year and we also socialize with a couple of them outside of work at times.

Last night when we got home she was back to normal and actually joked about it at one point.  She went to hand me my plate at dinner and I said ""Thanks hon"" and she said 'Ahhh...are we going to start using pet names instead of our real ones? I like the forethought!""  She laughed....I shook my head.  

**TL;DR: My wife is awesome.**

I will say that all the people that posted things like ""Tell your wife to chill out and get over it"" made me laugh and at the same time pity your (future) wives.  Calling your wife by your aunts name at the grocery store would call for that.....calling your wife by another woman's name when you're balls-deep and about to orgasm?: Give that shit the gravity it deserves!",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1365693957.0,,,True,t3_1c4wrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c4wrp/update_to_i_called_my_wife_by_my_coworkers_name/,

I know this update is only a day later but I wanted to update you guys on what has happened so far. Even though I didn't respond to any of the comments, I read all of them and they have helped me a lot. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my story.

This morning I quietly packed a backpack with essentials - makeup, blowdryer, tampons, underwear, a few shirts and pants, laptop, wallet, and all the cash I could find in our bedroom, while he made breakfast.

We sat down to eat breakfast and I said, ""I know about the girl you've been seeing."" Silence. I waited and he finally said, ""I'm sorry."" I told him that I couldn't believe it, and that I expected so much more of him. Then I told him that I was leaving, and got up to get my bag from our room. He started crying and was begging me not to go. I asked him why I shouldn't. He said that he would never talk to her again, that it was a huge mistake, and he just got carried away, that he was going to break it off soon anyways, that he loved me, blah blah blah. I told him to go fuck himself and got in the car and drove to my parent's house.

It was honestly so hard to walk away from him. I absolutely love him and I always will. It's such a shame because I know we would have been together forever. I wish he could have had more self-control, but I'm trying to look at the positives and the truth is if he is stupid enough to do something like this, even if he hadn't then he probably would have done something else stupid down the road. Maybe we just weren't meant to be together.

When I got to my parent's house I asked to stay with them because I'd left my husband. My mom said of course and I told her everything and turned into a blubbering mess. She told me I was perfectly right and I could stay as long as I wanted. I love my mom.

Tomorrow I'm going to call the non-emergency number of the police department and tell them anonymously because I live in Oregon and the age of consent is 18. I'm very scared to do it but my mom said she would sit with me while I did it so I hope it'll go okay.

I'm probably going to get an apartment and divorce him in the near future, but I'm just too tired/emotionally strained to deal with paperwork and all that stuff right now.

I'm going to wait until the holidays are over to tell all my close friends, because I really don't want them to worry about me, especially not on Christmas day and all that.

My husband has been calling and texting non-stop, this morning I just decided to turn my phone off because I didn't want to hear it. It's going to suck having the first Christmas in 6 years without him, but my sisters and my aunt and uncle are going to come over so I'm sure I'll have a great time.

I'm still considering what to do about the girl and her parents. I'm assuming that the police will find out who she is and tell her parents, I don't think it's my place to intervene. Although I do feel sorry for her, I know this is probably going to hurt her as well.

Sorry it took so long to write this. I needed a minute to recollect myself and thoughts so I could at least write something coherent. If I seem a bit dazed and this post is messy, excuse me as I'm trying to process a lot. 

My SO got home early from work and I immediately confronted him. I showed him the pictures, played the video for him (that was honestly the hardest thing to do, it was hard not to cringe and breakdown) and demanded to know what the hell was going on. He explained that 6 months after we met, he met a woman at his old office, they remained friends after he left his job and kept in touch. It wasn't until about two months ago that their relationship crossed the line between friends to cheating, when she drunkenly sent him nude pictures and he responded back. They were talking back and forth and sending pictures, eventually making plans to meet up when I was away for the month. I've never met her before, briefly heard about her in passing, but she knew from the beginning about me. She knew we were in a relationship and had seen pictures of us on his desk. She's also married. They met up once and fucked, taping it because it was always a fantasy of hers. Both her and my SO knew about the camera and the tape. No protection was used during their tryst, and she's now pregnant. I am unsure if my SO is the father or not, nor do I care.I do not intend to stick around for the paternity shit.  Her new found pregnancy apparently caused her to have a bout of regret for fucking someone who is not her husband and fessed up to her hubby and told my SO of her plan to reveal their affair to me. She found me on Facebook and got my email through there. Hence the pictures and email. As far as I know both her and her husband are staying together. I don't know if he's seen the pictures or not. 

After he explained everything, he let me read his email and text messages. I have to admit it was more that heartbreaking and probably a really stupid mistake. He revealed a lot to her that he's never talked to me about. He didn't just cheat physically but very much emotionally. It did however confirm he was telling the truth. He of course asked for a second chance and begged to forgiven, that I was the best thing to ever happen to him, that he's a dumbass, yaddda yadda yadda. He promised he'd change. Promised counseling, promised it was a one time thing and he couldn't stop feeling guilty about it. Honestly I don't remember much of it because I was in such shock. 

I asked him to leave our apartment, to call our landlord and ask to be taken off our lease, and not to contact me. I'm giving him the weekend to get out of the apartment. I packed my bag, my valuables, the animals, and headed to my sisters house. I have a doctors appointment on Monday for a full STD panel. There were a lot of tears and a lot of begging but honestly after what I read and now know, there is no way I could forgive him. 

Honestly, I'm in complete shock. I feel like I'm stuck in a bad nightmare or this is just the shittiest prank ever. I honestly am in complete disbelief of how he turned out and how this man who I loved for two years could do something so cruel. I'm angry at myself for not seeing it sooner, and for being so stupidly in love with a man who had such disregard for everything about our relationship. I thought maybe after an explanation I'd feel more relieved, but honestly I just feel worse. One second I feel like I can't stop crying and next I'm numb and angry. 

Thank you all for all your support and advice. I really appreciate you all reaching out and all your kind words. My world kinda of sucks right now and while you're all strangers it feels good to know such decent people exist in this world. 

TL;DR: SO is cheating dick who fucked an officemate and knocked her up, she got guilty told me and now he's single and I'm gonna drink away my feelings. 

Edit: Hey guys! I am completely overwhelmed about how this thread blew up and the amount of support I received. Despite the fact that I may not have responded to everyone, I really appreciate all of your comment's and pm's. He and I talked again last night and he agreed to move out of the apartment peacefully with absolutely no contact in the future. I'm staying with my sister for the weekend while he moves out. As for the husband, I haven't made up my mind yet to tell him. If I do decide to go that route, in no way will it be as cruel as how she approached it. Thank you everyone once again, I really appreciate the support as I try and rebuild. 

Edit 2: My SO who is also a redditor just found this post. While he is not happy with me going to internet to air our dirty laundry, he would at least like me to clear a few things up. 1. They apparently didn't use condoms because she's allergic to latex but she is clean. (I am rolling my eyes at this excuse and still getting tested) 2. Her husband knows about the affair, but has not seen the pictures 3. He is pretty sure he's not the father of the baby (riiiighhht) and 4. He was a good boyfriend. I have to agree with this one. For the majority of our relationship leading up to this, he treated me like gold. He was never manipulative or abusive in anyway. We had a very loving relationship.

Thank you everyone for your input and support. I got bunches of pms offering to listen and of course, loads of advice in the comments. When I was discussing help with my husband, neither of us were thinking it could be so urgent. I was planning on taking my vacation days during the week so I could go with him to appoinments and stay home with our son and him until it was figured out. I had such a hard time bringing myself to believe it was bad or urgent before. I was fighting with myself over what I wanted to believe and what I really should have. I feel like such shit for it; it was selfish and I endangered my husband and our son. It's not like I could have expected him to notice his own thinking. I should have done more sooner.

When I read the first comment about going to the ER it was all I needed to snap of it and fully realize the gravity of the situation. I called and asked one my friends to come watch our son, and we left to the hospital. I didn't even finish reading the comment. All the blood went to my limbs and felt tingly and heavy. He had gone upstairs to sleep for going in tomorrow, but I ran up, turned on the light and said something like ""get in the fucking car"". We drove to the ER and started reading the comments together in the waiting room until they were too scary and we stopped.

We got a scan. He has a 'cystic brain mass'. They told us it could explain the odd behavior. It is not cancer, and unlikely to become life threatening (though no gauruntees were made). He has an appointment with a nuerologist tomorrow to schedule surgery (I am driving him to all appointments). That night was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I don't think I have ever felt more relieved in my entire life. All on the trip up there I hadn't cried, but I was so so so afraid of losing him, and our son losing him, and I'd know it was partially my fault.

In the meantime I've been advised to stay on my days off, and be there for him just in case. This stress had been building for so long. I just **fuck** how could I have been in denial that long? What could have happened if I had been able to rationalize away your comments and let it go longer?

We've been watching shows on Netflix together, the three of us, and playing games and things. Even though we're still worried, I'm so happy things are looking better than our fears. Thank all of you for being so supportive. We owe you guys.

tl;dr: We're on our way to to treatment, and things are looking hopeful.

[Half Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17n4hz/semiupdatei_was_a_hair_away_from_cheating_on_my/)

Things are really weird right now but the future is clear. 

He came home nearly 12 hours later. He said he needed to tell me something. I stopped him and told him about almost booking the trip. He looked confused and asked me why it was even relevant since I didn't do it. I mumbled something about how the internet told me to do it... So there, the whole truth is out, and like I imagined, he did not really find that part important. 

Anyway, turns out he is cheating on me. For a year. With someone we know. I wasn't mad, or sad, or anything at first. Mostly I was shocked. He wasn't going to tell me until he saw how wrecked I was from just flirting with another guy. He said I didn't deserve it, he's a scum bag, blah blah. That he'd understand if I wanted to leave him. 

I didn't think it was a question of ""if"". I am here, crying every hour because I flirted with another guy, while he is out fucking our friend and taking her out to the places I showed him. We also have unprotected sex, so he put me at risk for what-the-fuck-ever she could have. She is single and definitely has had plenty of dudes around in the past year and before. He attempted to cheat on me, continued to do so, effectively humiliating me in front of our friends (since she is well into our circle), with no plans to tell me until I did something to fuck up. The tables have turned, my friends. 

As of now, he is moved out. It's my house, my name is on the mortgage, we are unmarried (THANK FUCKING GOD), and he is staying in a nice hotel on my dime because I couldn't just kick him out on his ass. There is still plenty (most) of his stuff here but I am boxing it up and moving it into storage. It's funny how my confession of lust for another really changed my life, beyond what I could possibly imagine. 

You can see why it took me a bit to update. I had to call my family &amp; friends. I had to sort my own shit out. I had to go through all the feels. But, it looks like I'll be going to Hawaii in a couple months after all. 

I have learned so many new lessons in these past few days, and I am sure I will learn many more in the upcoming days. Ending a 10 year relationship doesn't happen instantly, marriage or not. 

Thanks, Reddit, for down voting me into oblivion, hoping I would die of AIDS, wishing that he'd leave my sorry skank ass. I guess it all works out in the end.

For the record, I did talk to the blind date. When I ""kicked her out"" I made it very clear she was moving too fast for me, and she left amicably. I contacted her again to clear up the air, and she's fine.

I told my roommate that it doesn't feel like we're just friends, and that it felt like there was chemistry between us. I also told her that I had pretty strong feelings for her.  She told me that she had feelings for me too. Then we kissed.

I wanted to make an update because there were so many replies and thank you guys for letting me know its ok to go to my parents with this.

My dad wasnt home when I got up this morning but my sister was already out of the house so it was just me and mom. I asked her if we could talk about my sister and I told her everything I heard on the phone. She started crying and said she was afraid something was happening because my sister had been acting so ""weird"" lately but she didnt think it would be something like that.

She called my dad and asked him to come home. I told him everything I had heard and then they called my sister. She was with her boyfriend, no surprise there, but they told her it was a family emergency and asked if they could come to the house.

Her and her boyfriend got here and as soon as they came in the house it was obv. theyd been fighting again. I thought my dad was gonna sock him as soon as he came through the door but he didnt. My parents asked them to come in to the living room and talk and told me to go upstairs. I didnt, just waited in the kitchen.

They talked to them for a little bit and told them THEY were the ones listening in on the convo (my sister knows thats bulshit but she kept her mouth shut) and told them they wouldnt be allowed to see each other anymore.

The boyfriend started defending himself and saying it wasn't any of their business what he talked to their daughter about because shes an adult. This pissed my dad off, and I heard him start yelling and he told him ""I have the conversation recorded. If you come anywhere near my house or my daughter again, you'll be arrested."" It was all loads of bullshit but I know the boyfriend probably didnt know that. he starts apologizing to my dad and said hed never actually hit her. 

That made my dad even angrier and said he didnt see the differerence in hitting her or saying he would hit her, it was all abuse and he wanted him gone. MY sister just sat there crying.

They finally told the guy to leave and threatened him again with cops. and my dad said if he ever laid a hand on my sister he'd go through the cops and kill him himself.

I could see him leave from in the kitchen and he looked scared shitless. I went back upstairs to type this up. I hope everything will be okay now, i heard my sister come back upstairs and i can hear her crying. I dont want her to hate me but I dont want her dead either.

Thanks for the help you guys.. talking to my parents was the right thing to do and i shouldve have went to them immediately.

TL;DR - I heard my on-again-off-again boyfriend of 4 years having sex with another woman over the phone. 

Thank you all again so much for your kindness and support on my original post the other day. Because some of you wanted to be updated, here's a quick rundown of a few things that have happened since then:

On Sunday a.m., after avoiding me all Friday night and Saturday, he sent me a text message apologizing for ignoring me, saying that he had gotten drunk and was sick, had been puking, and had become a dickead (I assume to other girl, also). He also said he didn't remember what happened, and that he was sure he and other girl didn't do anything because he had been so much of a tool to her. (It couldn't have been too bad, though, because she wrote on his Facebook wall earlier this afternoon).

I texted him back several hours later and told him I knew what he had done, that I knew he was lying to me, that I was moving his stuff out and I never wanted to talk to him again. 

At that point, he told me that yes, they had ""put on a little show for me"" and that they had not actually slept together. He also said that he would now, though, because I wasn't standing in his way any longer. 

We exchanged a few other less than nice messages but I haven't spoken to him in any capacity since about 10 p.m. last night. He also defriended me on Facebook. 

I gathered my girlfriends today and we moved all his stuff out of the house and into a storage unit. I also changed all the locks on my house. I left him a note with the storage unit info and a few other details about his mail and motorcycle. 

Oh! And some particularly good news: I got hired at a second job today so I won't be up a financial shit creek without him. Money was a big reason I stayed with him so long. 

Now, the hard part begins...I have no idea how he is going to respond to this and I'm pretty nervous. 

TL;DR - I moved my cheating, lying, abusive boyfriend's stuff out and changed the locks. 

**EDIT** Wow! I am totally overwhelmed by all your encouragement and support, Reddit! Thank you all so very much! 
He still hasn't come back to the house yet (the note, storage key and mail I left for him outside haven't been moved). I'm anxious about how he will react. I told him I was moving his stuff, but I don't think he thinks I really did it.

We have been together for 8 years, married for 5.

My wife (31f) is accusing me (32m) of getting an erection because of our baby (2 month, M).

I was bouncing him on my lap while she was getting dressed.  I was watching her in various stages of being unclothed and I got an erection because of this.  My wife saw my erection and flipped the fuck out.  She grabbed my son and threw a book at me while screaming that I am a baby molester.  She says I am sexually attracted to my son and she was going to call the police and have me arrested for molestation.  

What the fuck?  I am not attracted to my son, I am attracted to her.  The erection was because I was watching her get dressed.  She told me to leave and never come back.

1371752967.0,911,self.relationships,1gqr1g,[UPDATE] I [25] found my husband's [34] pictures of a naked coworker[19],bleaksquid,1169,258,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gqr1g/update_i_25_found_my_husbands_34_pictures_of_a/,"Original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1csztd/i_25_found_my_husbands_34_pictures_of_a_naked/

So, it's been two months since I found the pics. A lot has happened, so I'm going to summarize.

I left. I moved in with my uncle, watched every episode of Community, and ate a fair amount of chocolate. My husband and I talked every day, and he apologized a lot. After a couple weeks, I decided to give it another try. We went to couple's counseling, talked every day, and things really seemed to be getting better.

I started to think maybe things weren't getting better as I thought. I found out he still had her phone number saved on his phone. He kept his phone on silent and with him at all times, just like he did when I was becoming suspicious. He admitted that they were not just friends, that they slept together multiple times, and she had been to the apartment while we were separated. He also admitted to cheating on me with a different girl last August, and his weak defense was that he was on ecstasy. He started throwing tantrums every time I acted suspicious, sad, or just wanted to talk. He refused to change his phone number, and sometimes the girl would call him upwards of thirty times a day. She said she was in love with him and would kill herself if they couldn't be together.

He finally changed his phone number. She went insane, and started coming by the apartment and ringing the doorbell multiple times, knocking on the windows, and slipping notes under the front door. Then she suddenly stopped. I was relieved at first, but then he started going on long drives every day (like 6 hours), going to the movies by himself, never answering his phone when I wasn't there. 

Finally, on Tuesday, I woke up early and was wandering around the house. I knew something was still very wrong. I happened upon his camera, and yeah, I snooped. I had to reason to trust him. He had pictures of them playing with our dog from Sunday, when I was out of town visiting my aunt. I remembered that he had an SD card he always kept in his wallet. On it, I found more pictures from the last month of her in sexy lingerie, selfies of them kissing, and like 20 shots of her ass in a thong. 

Clearly, that was the last straw. He woke up to me packing my clothes, he begged me to stay and talk, but I left. I've moved in with my mom and am looking for a better job. I gave him every chance, and he really fucking blew it. That girl is an idiot. She once asked him who the president of England is, and she's fucked like three other guys since they've been together. I've been tested, and I'm clean, thank God. I know he can't be really happy with her, but he chose her, and honestly, I'm happier now that I left than I was the whole time I was trying to make it work.

That said, I'm really glad I did try. For anyone else in this situation, if you aren't sure you can leave, there is nothing wrong with really trying to fix it. If I hadn't, I would have always wondered if I made the right choice. Now I know I gave it my very best, and it didn't work, and it isn't my fault. Now I know I'll never go back to him, I won't keep holding on to the memory of our happiness, and I'm truly free. I hope this story can help someone.

tl;dr Yeah, he fucked her, he told me we could try to work it out, he kept fucking her, I left. I'm glad I tried to work it out, despite the fact that it didn't in the end.

A week ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/167gcz/i_21m_am_falling_for_best_friend_19f_and_im_not/) wondering what to do about my feelings. Unfortunately I can't remember what I made the password for the first throwaway, so this is v2. 

I spent a couple days thinking about it, and after most of you told me to go for, I decided on Friday that that was what I was going to do. 

We were hanging out on Saturday at her place, listening to music and just talking, when I started talking about how we always go out together, just the two of us. We'll meet up and go get dinner, see a movie, go get some ice cream and then I'll drop her off at her place. This probably happens once or twice a week, although it isn't always the same thing. I told her that to me, it seems like we're casually dating except without any kind of physical contact. I went on about how I really enjoy spending time with her, and just doing whatever with her. It doesn't matter what, we can just sit in a room and talk about nothing and everything for hours. 

Eventually she got a little impatient and said, ""So what're you trying to say?"" I asked her if she would be interested in going on a *real* date with me, as more than just friends. She seemed to think about it for a second and then told me that she didn't have any plans Monday night. I told her that I'd come pick her up at 6. The rest of the night continued normally, although I was completely ecstatic. 

Fast forward to Monday and I show up to her house sweating bullets. She's wearing the dress I got her for her birthday last year and looks absolutely beautiful. I tell her as much and she gives me a kiss on the cheek and we hold hands as we walk to my car. I took her out to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, and then we went and saw Silver Linings Playbook (great movie btw). After the movie I took her over to a small amusement park area called Belmont Park and we walked along the boardwalk there holding hands and just talking. None of it was awkward and neither of us could seem to stop smiling the whole time. 

By now it was late and freezing cold, so we decided to go back to her place and make some hot chocolate. We flirted and teased each other the whole time, shared our first kiss, and I ended up spending the night there. We're a couple now and I can't remember being this happy. :) 

Thank you to everyone who told me to go for it! I can never express how much I appreciate all of your comments!

Said it ""didn't feel right"", don't know what to do.

Hello everyone. I apologize for not updating sooner, but A LOT has happened. I'd like to say thank you to everyone who posted comments and to those who tried to reassure me.

So John came home last night around 11:30 as I was watching t.v. in our bedroom. He came in and looked like absolute shit, his eyes looked tired and baggy and he smelled like beer. 

He apologized to me for the way he had been acting recently, and told me he knew that I knew about the 'almost proposal' as he had talked to his friend 'Mike' and he told John than his girlfriend 'Tara' had told me everything. He basically said to me that he had the whole thing planned out. He was going to propose and Tara and Mike would take pictures, then we would go back to a romantic, more expensive room in our hotel (which Mike and Tara had to end up staying in that night so as to make sure I wasn't aware of the fact that John was supposed to propose; they switched key cards while I was walking back).

He then told me what I was afraid of: ""it just didn't feel right, I was looking at you...and it just wasn't what I wanted."" Ouch. He told me that he had been nervous ever since he bought the ring, but that he'd thought it would go away once he actually proposed. In the moment, he said he knew that it was not what he wanted, and thought it would be better to not ask me to marry him because he knew it wasn't what he'd want in the long run. 

So at this point I'm in hysterics, as I pretty much know that this is the end of the relationship. I tried to be calm and rational about it, but there was one point where I was crying so hard that I literally got down on my knees, put my head in his lap while he sat on the couch, and just kept incoherently saying ""please"" in between sobs. Not my proudest moment. But, at that moment, this man was my best friend, the future father of my children. I just never, ever in a million years, pictured our relationship coming to this point. He ended it with me last night because it didn't feel right, and that's all he could say to me, over and over ""It just doesn't feel right anymore. I can't see myself with you.""

At that point I could barely breath, feels like I'm having a panic attack, so I call my mom and she comes to pick me up from our place. My poor mom, she just looked so helpless while I sat there in the car crying so hard I eventually got a nose bleed.

So, I wish I could say this is the end of the story, but more has happened since last night. This morning, I'm on Facebook, looking through a bunch of old picture of John and me, sobbing uncontrollably and sending him text after text with reasons why we should be together, and I eventually stumble onto Mike's page through a tagged photo. He updated his status from a few hours ago to something along the lines of ""California was amazing, wish work would send me for more than five days."" My stomach started doing flips...because John kept telling me he was spending the days he was practically ignoring me with Mike. But Mike was in California for several days...and we're in Canada, so not very close.

I freaked. I called Mike from my house phone and when he answered, I said ""Hey, it's acetacylicacid"" and all he could say after a few seconds of silence was ""Fuck.""

Basically, Mike's been covering for John's ass while John is spending time with the girl he's been apparently fucking for the past six months. I know this girl, John works with her and she's always been really sweet to me whenever I've seen her at John's work-related events. Mike told me that John had told him he was falling in love with her...he said this after the incident in Vegas. He's been spending almost all of the past two weeks with her. Mike then told me he had promised not to say a word to anyone, not even Tara, but he felt guilty and was glad I called him. He apologized and said if I had to tell John that he told me, I could. 

That's all I know for now. I haven't bothered contacting John yet, and i don't know if Mike told him that I know. I don't know what I'm going to do. I've been throwing up all day. I took one of my mom's Ativans and am feeling a bit calmer right now, but whenever I think about it, which is practically all that consumes my thoughts, I feel disgusted, humiliated and devastated. It actually feels like my heart is breaking in two and I have no control. 

I need to get my stuff from our place, I need to FIND a new place. We have a dog...who gets the dog? I love my dog. It all feels so surreal. Ugh.

tl;dr: boyfriend told me he didn't see a future with me, so he decided not to propose. We broke up. I found out later through his friend that he's been cheating on me for months with one of his coworkers. 

**Edit Update: John called me a bunch of times while I was in an rx-induced/depression coma. I woke up as he was calling me again and kind of just answered the phone without thinking about it. He was crying and apologizing (I guess Mike told him that I knew), and saying he was confused. He asked me where I was and I lied and said I was with my sister an hour away from here at her place. I asked him if he was with ""her"", he said yes, but that he'd be home tomorrow, so could I please meet him to talk about things at our house? I said sure. I asked my mom to drive me to our place a little while ago and I kidnapped my dog, brought her back and I'm feeling much, much better. I'm also NOT meeting with him tomorrow.**

You guys, I didn't think it would help this much to ask you guys for advice. But I've read each and every one of your comments and dear God, I feel 1000x better than I did a few hours ago.

1355591281.0,861,self.relationships,14welq,[24M] Relationship of 7 years with [24F]. Just found out she's cheated on me a few days ago. I've got terminal cancer. Can't deal with this as well. Help.,,1153,292,472,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14welq/24m_relationship_of_7_years_with_24f_just_found/,"A little background first I guess. I was diagnosed with cancer at the start of this year and I've been through a fair amount of shit throughout the year. I had intensive chemotherapy from January through to April, then had MAJOR chest surgery in June. Thought I was on the mend, then had a check-up in August and found that it had spread. So I've just finished a cycle of High Dose Chemotherapy and three stem cell transplants. I say all this because I want you guys to know how much shit I've been through....and how much shit my wonderful girlfriend has put up with and supported me through.

Throughout all of this, I've watched her stay strong, visit me nigh on everyday whilst I was in hospital even if it meant she would get back home at midnight when she has to be at work early in the morning, and  she would always tell me she loved me even when I looked skeletal, lost all my hair, and was being sick. I wondered at how well she was coping with everything... I put myself in her shoes, thought about how I would deal with it and I found myself questioning if I could. I mean, I have changed SO much, I'm not the same person she fell in love with. I know that. I mean, it's impossible not to change when you go through all of this. Yet she's stayed by my side and always tells me she loves me. 

I've been back home with her the last week or so after my last treatment and I've noticed a few things. She's become a bit more distant, would barely start conversations with me, her demeanour has changed and she her facial expressions show that she's hiding something. Trust me on this one, after seven years you can easily tell when something's up, and minute changes in facial expressions and behaviour stick out like a sore thumb. So, the other night, she tells me she's going out to see an ex co-worker, a guy, just the two of them. My first thoughts were, *What the hell? Just the two of them? No one else? ......ok. Bit weird.* But what came out of my mouth was, ""Oh, cool! Have a good catch-up!"" Then she starts getting ready- her makeup is amazing, she's wearing nice clothes. In short, she looks HOT. Alarm bells are ringing. 

She comes home drunk. Not like...mega drunk but the kind of drunk where you roll your eyes and get ready for silliness, you know? Anyway, we get into bed after she adorably falls asleep on the sofa with me. I wake up in the morning and there's no one in bed with me so I get up and she's sitting on the sofa in silence in the dark. Whatever I say, her answers are short but I put that down to being hungover. This carries on all day. She barely talks to me, I can't cheer her up no matter what I say. She doesn't sleep that night and her mood carries on to the day after. Now I KNOW something is up and, to be honest, I've already assumed the worst. I think she's had thoughts about me, about how she doesn't actually love me anymore, about how she doesn't find me attractive anymore, about how she's finally had enough of putting up with all my cancer shit. Hell, I may be right...but that's not what's been on her mind these last couple of days apparently. 

She changed the password on her phone, claiming that ""I have a gmail app on there and it'll have all your present deliveries on there! I don't want you seeing that!"" Bullshit, I think. She hides her phone whenever she enters the code so that I can't see it. But I got it today. I fucking got it today. God, I'm getting angrier as I type this. So she met this guy, they got drunk together, with no one else around, and they makeout in the bar. He ""can't stop thinking about"" her, and ""neither can I,"" according to her. So she tells me she's going shopping today and I saw that she's meeting up with him right now and this shopping is just a ruse. I just....I don't know. Seven fucking years of PURE happiness. We have this one blip at the start of the year and I thought we were going to come out of it ten times stronger. But she needed comfort from another man...even though I am right here, I can talk to her about what she's feeling, and I'd be so happy to help. I just don't  know how to cope now. I go from anger at this FUCKING DILDO WANKER of a guy for doing it to the most soul crushing depression I've ever felt. Seriously, ""You have cancer,"" hasn't got SHIT on this. 

She's told me that she knows I would never cheat on her and she has told me that she would NEVER cheat on me, ever ever ever ever. Couldn't emphasise it enough, you know? I can't deal with this. We have so much together. A lovely house, so many amazing memories... She asked me today what I would have done with my life if she wasn't in the equation. Does she want to make it any more fucking obvious? ....here's the thing, though: I can't confront her. I love her so much and I'm terrified of losing her. She is my absolute world and I can't even imagine my life without her in it. I want to take her all around the world, see everything this planet has to offer and I want to share all these experiences with her. I want us to come out of this cancer battle stronger than ever before and I want every day to be full of happiness. But it turns out I'm just a naiive, spineless, hopeless romantic who's too much of a coward to deal with this. I can't turn to my family because they'll turn on her. My friends have all become a bit more distant with me as well so I don't feel close enough to them to talk this kind of thing through anymore. Besides, if any of them Reddit, they'll figure out my identity pretty quickly. Actually, I hope her co-worker is a Redditor because then he can fucking see how hard this has hit me and I hope he drowns in an ocean of guilt.....

Someone give me some guidance. Please. I don't know who to turn to anymore......please.

TL;DR: GF of 7 years cheated on me. I'm a hopeless wreck. Trying to deal with terminal cancer on top of this. Too much of a coward to confront her as I'm scared of the outcome.

**[UPDATE]**

Hi guys. 

Sorry it's taken me so long (apparently) to give you guys an update. Been trying to sort out all this mess and only just found the time to sit down and get on here.

Anyway. First and foremost, I'd like to say ""thank you"" to all the people on here who took the time out of their lives to help a complete stranger. Sometimes I'm amazed at you lot...

Now to the update. I think I may have gone against the status quo a bit but we sat down and talked about this. For hours. I explained how I knew, how I felt (very calmly and rationally) about it all and how it was difficult for me to understand. Thanks to all the advice on here, though, I had a few paths I could go down to make the conversation a bit easier and it certainly helped. She managed to open up about everything, about how she's not known how to have dealt with everything, and how alone she's felt whilst going through it, and how what she's done has made her physically sick. She knows it was wrong and she's cut off all contact with the co-worker (who, by the way, knew about my cancer- I know some people were saying he was totally innocent in all this) and she can't bear the thought of us not being together... 

Our relationship has turned around these last couple of days. Some of the fun spirit we lost has come back and we've gone out and enjoyed some great nights together. I know people may find this weird that I can somehow forgive her in my situation (and a week ago I would have been right there with you) but you didn't see the look in her eyes when she was explaining everything to me, you didn't hear the way her voice trembled through it all. I have never known sincerity like it. Sure, my trust has been violated and it'll take a while for me to TRULY regain it, but I'm happy with where things are going now. 

Some of you are going to tell me I've done the wrong thing, I expect that. We can't all agree when it comes to these things as all relationships work in different ways. However, I just want you all to know that I read **every single comment** on here before deciding on what to do. I've PMed a few people whose comments were remarkable and I'm sorry if I somehow missed you but I want to make it clear that I read them all. And I'm truly grateful for them all. 

Anyway. Thanks again to you all :)",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1355933452.0,,,True,t3_14welq,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14welq/24m_relationship_of_7_years_with_24f_just_found/,

[Previous Update](http://redd.it/1106bb)

Since my previous two posts were so popular I decided I'd update you all on the ridiculous circus of my life.

After the conversation from my last post, we did not speak with MIL at all until last Sunday. My sister's boyfriend had a job interview on 7am Friday morning near our house. He lives about 45 minutes away. He stayed at our house the night before so that he wouldn't have to wake up so insanely early.

Anyway, the interview goes well and he feels fairly confident. The problem is this job requires some on-call hours and that's not exactly feasible from 45 minutes away. His current lease isn't up until Mid-December. My husband and I told him that he's welcome to stay with us the nights he has to be on-call. I'm not sure exactly how much that would be - probably a few nights a week.

Anyway, on Saturday, my husband talks to his brother. His brother is planning to come in to town for the weekend sometime next month and asked if he could stay with us. My husband told him that was fine but explained that my sister's boyfriend might be staying with us so he might have to take the couch.

My brother-in-law told my mother-in-law. Jerk. That went over about as well as you'd think it would. She called my husband and freaked out about us just asking for our daughter to be molested. She also said that it would be better if my sister and her boyfriend were married. If he's pedophile I'm not sure what difference being married makes but that's a crazy person for you. My husband hung up on her.

This is when shit gets really crazy. SHE CALLED 911. Seriously. I'm not sure exactly what she told them but something along the lines of our daughter being alone with a sexual predator. The police showed up at our house expecting to find our daughter with a pervert.

We explained our situation and the officers (super nice!) recommended we make an official report about harassment. We're also going to go for a restraining order. I was mortified that the police had been called but they assured me that they'd seen crazier.

So that's our life. We're attempting to completely cut her out. I feel somewhat guilty if she's having some kind of mental breakdown that we're not doing more to help, but I've got to put my daughter first. If she receives mental help I wouldn't rule out some relationship in the future, but for now, I'm done.

And to think, this all started with some shitty earrings.

TL;DR: My MIL called 911 on us and we're attempting to get a restraining order.

*EDIT: Just when you thought she couldn't get crazier! She left my husband an angry voicemail saying she can prove that my sister's boyfriend is a pedophile. He didn't believe it (of course) but called her to find out what she was saying so we could tell the police. 

She said that my sister's boyfriend had been attracted to my sister when she was a child. Which is true. He and my sister started dating when she was 12. He was also 12. Apparently, because he was attracted to a child (when he was a child himself) he is a pedophile. 

Ughhh. Hopefully we'll have a restraining order next week and she'll take it seriously.*",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1351187404.0,,,True,t3_120tbg,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/120tbg/update_2_my_mil_pierced_my_8mo_daughters_ears/,

I posted this update Thursday just FYI.
--------
Here was the original [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b3h13/i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in_our/)

YESTERDAY: I felt a little more calm and collected in comparison to the day after I found out what was happening. My daughter's breakfast session with me was very brief as I just made my coffee and ran out. I wasn't trying to avoid her. I had two board meetings to attend that day, one of which I was leading so I didn't have much time obviously.

I come home later in the afternoon. Daughter is home. She welcomes me with a hug and kiss and then proceeds to be very cute and bashful with me. She asked how my day was and what business plans I was planning to make. Things that she hasn't had interest in talking about for ages. This alone was a red flag that indicated that she probably thought that I knew about her and the bf, ""Chris.""

The night ended with my daughter asking if she could join me on the couch to watch a movie until she fell asleep. She put her head on a pillow on my lap and watched the movie. I will admit that I had some mixed feelings seeing her head on my lap because it just reminded me of when she was 7 years old and she would always watch tv with me like that. Those memories surprisingly began to lessen my disappointment. It was at that point that I became really calmed down about the situation and realized how much my love for her will always overcome anything that may disappoint me.
After she fell asleep, I called her mother and told her what had happened. She was shocked but was prepared knowing that she would have to do most of the work when this day came. We discussed a plan of action beginning with her arrival today.

TODAY: I pick up wife from airport in the morning. We decided that it wouldn't be smart to approach her both at the same time. Her mother would break the news to her and immediately take her to get contraceptives and have an introductory talk about sex. Then I would talk to her when she got home. And then finally, my wife would continue to have a chat with her about the more personal and detailed sex issues that we knew wouldn't be comfortable or appropriate for me to discuss with her.

According to my wife, our daughter was shocked and embarrassed to find out that I saw her and Chris. She apologized to her mom and asked her not to be mad and that she was stupid for doing it out in the open like that. She was worried about how I would think but my wife reassured her that I loved her very much and that I would want to just figure this out with her help. They went out to get birth control pills and condoms and during that trip, my wife gave her a detailed run-down of both contraceptive uses.

They came home and my daughter immediately tried to hide from me upstairs. She told her mother that she needed about an hour before I had the talk with her. I gave her that time and space before going to her to have our discussion. She was embarrassed to look me in the eyes but I told her I needed her to cooperate so that we could both get through this. I told her that her mother would continue talking to her later about the more personal sex questions later and told her that she did not have to include any of that in our conversation as I didn't want her too either. I got the following answers from the questions I asked:

. She and Chris have been having sex for about 4 months.

. Chris was a virgin as well when they started having sex.

. It was both of their ideas to begin having sex, but more so 60-40 with the boy as the majority.

. There was mutual consent and neither one has pressured the other into doing something they didn't want to.

. There was only one time when Chris unintentionally did something she didn't want but she informed him right away and he apologized and stopped--this made me realize that I needed to sit down with little Romeo and have a little chat with him.

. That night was the first night they had sex in our home. All other times were at his house.

. Both of Chris's parents know they have sex in their home. They also found out the hard way. Both thought they were too young but in the end, accepted it and had a talk with Chris.

. His dad is more accepting of the kids having sex than his mother. His mom is still uneasy having them behind closed doors at home but the dad is more ok with it at this point like any stereotypical dad with his son.

. His dad had a talk with Chris about how to handle my daughter respectfully and that I was happy to hear at least.

I ended our talk with telling her that yes, as a dad, I was disappointed to find out that she was having sex at a young age and wished she had waited a little longer. But made it clear to her that I was speaking from the point of view of most parents. I loved her and would never shame her for exploring her sexuality like other teenagers her age. Her feelings and urges are natural like any other girl her age. Nothing to be ashamed about. I just wanted her to show more discretion with her explorations like all other private matters in her life.

She apologized over and over again and told me she was stupid for not being more careful and courteous of the possibility of anyone else being home. I told her not to dwell on it anymore and to move on. I emphasized that I wanted her to be safe at all times and that if she was old enough to have sex, she was old enough to be responsible about contraceptive use and considering the risk of becoming pregnant. I cautioned her not to think that her mother and I would take the responsibility of raising her potential child while she went on with her life. We have careers, responsibilities, and lives as well. And because having sex is a privilege and not a right, she would be responsible for purchasing the BC pills and condoms coming out from her savings account we have set up for her.

I told her I loved her and that I would always be there for her and that she should not be afraid to come to me with any questions or concerns. I told her I planned on having a little civil talk with Chris about the topic sometime this weekend and she said ok.

Thanks to all of you who provided input. Aside from some of the biased perspectives, all of you were great and have helped me guide my role as a father in this type of a situation in the right direction. Thank you so much.

TL;DR - My wife and I spoke with our daughter about her having a sex life with her bf. While a little embarrassed, she was very cooperative as were we. Informed her about contraceptives and how to properly conduct herself in our home.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_1bbhst,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bbhst/updatei_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in/,

I've always been this way and while I have accustomed myself to it, it nonetheless remains a daily fact that being an ugly woman sucks.

I met my husband four years ago and he is greatest thing thats ever happened to me. He has always and frequently told me im beautiful, and somehow sounded honest, without sounding like my mother - like someone without another option to awnser.

last night (Saturday) he had a group of friends over to our home, they meet several times a month to hangout, catch up and play games. He has known most of these guys since highschool. I was upstairs in the kitchen preparing a drinks and snacks when and was able to hear them in the basement and began to eavesdrop (which I know was rude but it wasn't really intentional). I realized they were talking about me, a couple of guys were teasing my husband about me, specifically about my looks. I could tell it was supposed to be funny. It was not.

There was a point where one of them refered to me as a ""troll"" and my husband blew up, started shouting.  ""listen, SHUT THE FUCK UP. **I know that  [my name] is ugly** but shut up. She makes me happy. Does your bimbo of the week do that jim? Dave how long has it been since we've hungout and you haven't bitched about your wife? "" (not real names)

He went on for a while, ""defending"" me. But all I could hear was "" I know shes ugly, I know shes ugly, I know shes ugly"" again and again in my head. It just broke me I don't know why. I've always know im unattractive but *HE* isn't supposed too! He tells me im beautiful so sincerely and consistently i'd started to actually believe he thought that. 

I started to cry and ran into a shower so no one could hear me. When I came out and hour later everyone had gone home, far earlier then normal. I went to bed and then haven't spoken too him all day today, but I think i've been able to avoid letting him know im upset, or avoiding him. I know rationally that what he said was true and sweet, and that I sound be happy he loves me and not my body but IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER. I just want to be pretty. God I feel so shallow. Ive been crying all day. What do I say to him? Part of me wants to call him a liar to scream and yell and cry, while the other part just wants to run away and never have to talk to him again and acknowledge that even the greatest man I will ever meet can't find me attractive.


**TL;DR** overheard husband admit to friends that I am ugly. Even although I knew this to be true already and the admitting happened in the midst of him explaining how much he loves me, it makes me feel terrible, worthless and like I lost something i'd waited my whole life for, i'd given up hope i'd ever have a partner who even liked me before I met him.

Long story short my [23f] best friend and I [31m] are with my mates at their summer house, she got way too drunk last night and tried to hit on me. We talked a little in the morning, I told her that she tried to have sex with me. Were busy most of the day, so talked again in the evening. I told her my feelings, we kissed, I got cockblocked by my mate's divorce.

So we woke up spooning, and I kissed her first off, and apologized about not showing up, tried to explain the situation with my mate. She said she heard the fighting and tried to stay awake, but she fell asleep. She did say she was wondering where I was, so I just said I was here now. Kissed again, but didn't have much time, since we needed to catch our train.

The train was horrible. There were all sorts of delays, and we pretty much spent the WHOLE DAMN DAY on that train. She wasn't talkative as I'd expected, but it wasn't that awkward. We held hands, I put my arm around her, she rested her head on me, etc. We got to the train station and it was already dark. We drove back to my house, where she had left her bike in my backyard. 

We were complaining about the train, trying to be casual. We started talking about where we were, and talked about whether or not we were at risk of ruining our friendship, or if we should take a chance. I told her I'm in love with her. She told me she's in love with me too. We kissed. We embraced. We made love. We cuddled.

--

Anyway, so, as I told you guys, I had a conversation with my girlfriend last night about some of her recent behavior (wanting me to finish inside her, offering to buy condoms for me, talking excessively about babies and the like, etc.) and also about the concerns (she was trying to get pregnant) that I was having about these things and our relationship, and it did not go very well—to say the least. 

--

I started off by telling her that I felt like we had been having problems communicating lately and maybe this had led us to have a misunderstanding about where we felt we were going. I then told her that I felt like maybe in our conversations about our future together I had made her think that my unwillingness to settle down was a sign I was still looking around or didn’t want to commit to her, when it really was just my belief that we should use this time to grow closer and work on our relationship. However, I let her know that I wanted to marry her (and have a family with her), but that I just didn’t feel ready for those things yet. I didn’t want to be hostile, so I first tried to reassure her of my commitment to her before I confronted her about trying to possibly get pregnant in secret. This is the point where our conversation started to go badly.

--

I then questioned her about why she had been so concerned lately with babies. Was it because several people we know have just recently gotten pregnant or had babies? Or was there something else that had caused this development? She became defensive at first saying that “all girls think about babies a lot,” but I eventually got her to admit that these pregnancies had made her think more about having a child and realize how badly she wanted one now. I told her that I understood how powerful this urge was but that I felt very strongly neither of us was ready to have a child and that we should wait, which was where things really got bad. She said something like “we love each other, so would it be so terrible if we have a baby now since we plan to someday?” I told her that the timing wasn’t right and that I was becoming increasingly concerned that maybe she wasn’t trying as hard not to get pregnant and brought up some of the reasons why (see previous post). I said that I had talked about this with some other people (you guys) and that they, too, thought it seemed like she might almost be trying to get pregnant. 

--

Here, she started crying and said that I was being selfish and wouldn’t even consider having a baby now. She then said that she loved me and wanted my baby and felt like I was scared and had no legitimate reasons for waiting, so she admitted to “taking matters into her own hands” in order to give me the “push” I needed to marry her and start a family. This is the point in the conversation where she told me that I may not have a choice in waiting to have a baby and then said she was pregnant (I think she told me she was around 6 weeks, but I was so angry/hurt/shocked that I don’t remember). I asked her if she knew for sure, and she said that she has been to her OB/GYN to confirm it and didn’t tell me because she wanted to see how I would react to the idea.

--

I think at this point we both were in tears. I accused her of manipulating me and deceiving me, and she told me that this baby was “the best thing for us.” She then went and got the ultrasound photo or something and tried to show it to me, but I told her I need to think--which led her to hug me and say that “what’s done is done” and that there was “no point in me trying to fight it,” as she was not going to get an abortion.

--

I left after that and haven’t talked to her since. I don’t know if there is anything I can do at this point, but if she has the baby, I will be the best dad I can be. As for our relationship, I can’t imagine that I could ever be with her again given that she broke my trust. I suppose the moral of the story is to always wear condoms and never take for granted that a girl is using her birth control—no matter how much you trust her.

--


**tl;dr**: I though my girlfriend was secretly trying to get pregnant, and it turns out she was (and is now pregnant). 

**EDIT:** I can't thank you guys enough for all the advice, information, and support that you all have given me. I feel much more confident about making decisions going forward. For the record, I intend to contact an attorney today (June 12) just in case she is pregnant, and I then plan to call her and insist she take a home pregnancy test (but I will also contact her doctor's office to also confirm whether or not she is pregnant) and make sure she understands that we have no future together. We'll see what happens from there.

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bbhst/updatei_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in/)

I have a very busy schedule but due to a large number of people requesting that I make a final update, I will provide one as I had promised.

I have been a lot more relaxed and at ease after our talk with our daughter. 

Yesterday, I get back from the gym and my daughter comes up to me and says that she had a little talk with Chris on Saturday night telling him what I knew and what was discussed between us a couple of days ago. He was upset that they were caught and thought that I wanted to kill him. She assured him that I was calmed down and wanted to be very civil with him. She didn't mention to him that I wanted to sit down with him sometime in the future and just have a friendly talk about house rules and such because she was afraid he might've had a nervous breakdown. She decided to hold that thought until a little while later. 

Then my daughter tells me that Chris had called her yesterday morning and *he* asked her if he could talk to *me*. He told her that he always assumed I was still aggressive and angry from my college football days and that really scared him. But he thought he would be an idiot not to own up to his actions and come to me to explain his side. He said that he put himself in my shoes and realized that he would probably react the way I did initially and knows it wouldn't be right to leave the situation as is if he intended on not showing any disrespect towards my wife and me.

I appreciated hearing all that and the kid began to actually grow on me at that point, I must admit. It takes a lot of maturity for a 15 year old to say those things. My daughter said that I would be leaving Tuesday for Europe and wouldn't be back for a while so he should hurry and have the talk if he really wanted to. So he decided to come over to our home on Sunday evening.

I told him right away that he needed to relax because I wasn't angry and aggressive. I told him that being strict didn't mean I was heartless. We sat down and before anything, I gave him a quick run-down of the house rules and what I expected from the *both* of them in our house. I told him that in light of recent events, I have come to the conclusion that they are now both obligated to handle themselves as young adults and deal with any aspects of their relationship themselves. They can always come to us for advice and information but ultimately, they will be the final decision makers in their relationship. All I expected was mutual respect, consent, and compromise. 

He understood everything that I said and then began apologizing about what happened that night. He said he meant no disrespect to me or my wife and that they even discussed closing the door but ""stupidly"" decided it wouldn't matter according to him. I told him to relax and that I have put myself in his shoes too the last couple of days and realized how easy it would be for a couple of teenagers to act on a whim and not be careful about the things they do. I told him that common courtesy always matters regardless of you being alone or not. What you do invariably affects others at some point down the line. 

He mentioned that his parents knew but had only recently found out (a couple of weeks?). He said they were shocked themselves and didn't know if they should approach my wife and I in fear of us lashing out at our daughter. So instead, his dad took up the task of talking to Chris about what he needed to know instead. He said that both his parents had the talk with him like we did with our daughter and his parents also agreed to have their son be responsible for the purchase and use of condoms. And for those few dissenters who thought it was cruel for me to have my daughter be responsible for her own contraceptives, this boy, unlike my daughter, has to pay for his own stuff with an allowance that is half of my daughter's in which he has mostly worked for one way or another. His parents provide funds for all important and normal costs that Chris may have but have him pay for all the things he uses for ""fun times"" from his allowance therefore condoms fall under that category. 

I told him that he shouldn't worry that much about the money because being that my daughter is in a similar boat, they can work together to split the costs or trade off buying what they need to stay protected. They can also communicate with one another as a way to remind each other what needs to be done and when so that we the adults don't have to involve ourselves in their business. I talked about a couple of more things that I won't get into details about because of time and length. I finished our conversation reminding him that he was a great student-athlete that had a bright future just like my daughter in her academic career and they both have very high hopes and goals. But the reality of those dreams will fail to appear if they choose to make the wrong decision from here on out. Thanks to everyone that helped. I really appreciate it!

He's a supportive and loving husband, and a supportive and loving father. It's the things he seems to be unable to control that I am confused about.

The first thing I noticed was around April of this year. Back when it first started, it was subtle things. He'd be distracted from our conversation by motion it would seem, but we'd be alone. He'd get up at night to check out a sound, but there'd be no sound. He got his vision and hearing checked, and ""nothing was wrong"".

He started doing or saying things that simply did not make sense (in addition to the above). We got a cat tree for our pet. The night after we bought it, I went downstairs because I heard someone. He was up at like 2am with a flashlight and a screwdriver looking at the cat tree. He kept saying something was wrong with it, like it needed to be fixed. I asked him what he was talking about and he said it was something for another time and went back to bed. For a while after that he'd occasionally mention going to Lowes to pick up parts to fix the cat tree, but whenever I asked him what it was, he'd dodge the question.

Gradually the frequency of things like this kept growing. For example I caught him trying to pour cereal from empty box and getting frustrated that none would come out, or changing the flag on the mailbox for absolutely no reason (like getting up during a movie at night to go flip it). One time we were at the mall and he got anxious that he forgot to flip it. I asked why it mattered, and he was just like ""Oh I guess it doesn't"".

I was in denial for a while. I finally confronted him about it when I came home and he was trying to pour water for the cat. He was holding the bowl sideways, and getting frustrated that it wouldn't hold much water. I stood there just listening to him. Every word he said hit me, making it harder and harder to believe what I wanted to. He connected it to something else. He said that we really ought to look at new bowls when we go out to get the stuff for fixing the cat tree.

I cried. And then he came over to me, acting just the way he would normally, comforting me and asking what's wrong. I was relieved for a second. I laughed about how ridiculous I was being, and I told him he was just holding the bowl sideways. He looked at me, and walked over to the sink and tried filling the bowl sideways. Then he rotated it, and when it started to fill up he just dropped the bowl and started crying. He asked me what was wrong with him.

We talked about it all and things were going to be ok again. He said to call him out on it whenever he did something that didn't make any sense. We made an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist as well. He was diagnosed as bipolar. I don't know how psychology works but I didn't think he was having mood swings, but at the time I was like ok sure whatever, my husband's fine.

He wasn't. He started staring. For long periods of time he would just stare at something. It would be hard to snap him of it, but sometimes it would be twenty or thirty minutes. Things stopped making sense again.

Today I came home to see him standing in the kitchen staring at the bowl he had previously tried to fill sideways sitting on the counter top. My 3 year old was crying, asking for food, yelling ""Dad!"" over and over at his ankles. I shook him and after a minute he finally responded and looked around. I made my son food and told him he needed to get help. I am taking my vacation week this week because I don't know if I can trust him with our son anymore. He is going to see some doctors. I think he lied to the the one last time.

I don't know what to fucking do.

Me F/28, MIL F/55, Daughter 8mos

This has been a dramatic few days. My MIL has gone entirely crazy. 

My husband has been the only one talking to her over the last few days. He wanted her to understand that HE was upset too and it wasn't just me being crazy. She accused me of brainwashing him with ""pseudo hippie bullshit.""

She's furious that I took out the earrings. She said since my daughter will get her ears pierced again later that I'm needlessly torturing her just to be petty. She has called several family members to get them on her side. Luckily, everyone has either sided with us or said they didn't want to get involved at all. 

My 20 year old sister is our usual babysitter. If she babysits, she'll usually just spend the night because she lives about 45 minutes away. On several occasions, her boyfriend has come with her.  He's a great guy. They've been together for 8 years (seriously) and I love him like a brother. My MIL doesn't like this at all. She's only met him twice and has decided that the only reason he could possibly want to accompany his girlfriend on a babysitting job is to molest my daughter. When she found out we let him change her diapers she said we were just asking for trouble. 

My MIL threatened to call children's services and report us for letting some ""random guy"" sleep in the same house as our daughter if we don't allow her to spend time with Annie alone anymore. My husband told her not to expect to ever see her granddaughter again. That was last night.

I'm just floored. I can't believe it's all turning out like this. My husband keeps apologizing like it's his fault. We've already decided that if she calls we're going to file some kind of harassment claim against her. 

I had no idea people could be this crazy.

[Last Update. Baby steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1drxyg/update_step_in_the_right_direction_after/)

I figured now would be a good time to update you guys on the situation with my girlfriend. Prior to now, I didn't really have anything to update. The past 2+ months have been up and down, but right now, I can definitely say it was 100% worth it.

Let's see if I can break this down because quite a bit has happened, but, here goes.


- Girlfriend ended up going to the support group almost immediately. She'd chatted on their forum pretty much the entire week before she went, and decided she was comfortable. I waited in the visitor's area. For about 3 weeks, this was our routine. Every Tuesday &amp; Thursday night, she went to her group and I drank coffee. Sometimes we'd talk about it, sometimes we wouldn't. 

- Eventually, she was assigned a ""counselor,"" sort of like how AA has sponsors. This is a designated person that she can call at ANY time, day or night, no matter what's going on. She was told to call them ANY time she has a night terror, anytime she feels an anxiety attack coming on, anything. This woman is basically her on-call personal therapist, only without a degree. This woman is WONDERFUL, and has been so amazing for my girlfriend. 

- Not long after my post, my girlfriend went to her gyno, and is no longer on the depo shot or any form of birth control, aside from me using a condom. We didn't want her on anything hormonal, and she's holding off on an IUD (she's looking at Paragard.) So far, no problems, but it hasn't been that long and her anxiety has gotten much better, but still too soon to tell if it was the shot or if therapy is what's helping her.

- Girlfriends counselor found her a therapist, who she's been seeing for the past month now, every Monday and Wednesday. So, all in all, she goes to her therapist, next day group, therapist, group. It's a good schedule for her, she says, because she's able to talk to the group and the therapist and talk about things separately. Surprisingly enough, her therapist is male and she's completely okay with that. I think it's great for her because she's sort of overcoming that whole, ""men are evil and out to hurt me,"" mentality. 

- She hasn't been put on any medication, but we've been completely night terror free for a month now. Night terrors came back in full force the first night she went to group, probably because she had a lot on her mind. For the next 2 weeks, she had them every other or night or so until she just stopped having them. Her therapist says it's probably because she has an outlet for everything she's thinking/feeling instead of bottling it up and it letting itself out while she's sleeping.

So, to wrap it up, my girlfriend has an amazing support system now and I couldn't be more proud of her for hitting this head on and working on it. I know it's something that isn't going to heal itself over night, obviously but for 2 months, I think she's done a damn good job.

**TL;DR: My [F/20] boyfriend [M/21] of 3 years got mad that I wouldn't eat burgers and got soup instead, then said to his best friend that I'm boring in bed and our sex sucks. :(**

I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied. I'm sorry I couldn't get back to everyone, I fell asleep not too long after I posted my question and had work. However, I did read every comment and took them all to heart.

I thought about what everyone said and I decided I would try talking to his mom first. I was a little taken aback by her reaction, as the only thing she said was ""oh"" and made it seem like that's just the way he is.

..what?! Ultimately, I've decided I'm done. I thought about our whole relationship after I got off and had the conversation with his mom. He doesn't respect me, is selfish, lazy, and he is spoiled beyond belief. I won't be held back anymore, in any aspect. I can't go to school and be in a relationship with someone who is not and wants to stay out until 6 in the morning. I won't be with someone who accuses me of wrong doing when I don't do anything! I also will not be an enabler anymore. He can figure out for himself how much I really did and how much I really loved him.

I have talked to my best friend, and she said I can stay with her until I'm done with school. I have one year left, and once I'm done, I plan on moving back to my hometown, 2500 miles away from here, where my mom is. Once I'm done with work and am finally off for a couple of days, I'm packing my shit up and not looking back. I don't care what garbage excuses he has to say to me, he no longer has any control of me. I'm giving back everything he has given me and will be asking for some things back.

Thank you to everyone for your comments and support. I would have been stuck in a destructive and unhealthy relationship, but I've realized my self-worth and that I will find someone who loves me for me 200% when the time comes and is right.

So, for the past 24hrs I've slowly been making sure my stuff is back in my apartment from her house, and even dropping off some of her crap in my backpack (very stealthy!).

I spent the night over at her place, but I wasn't feeling great (i have a slightly pulled groin from work)... She was pretty intent on sex and it really got her very angry with me, anyways.  Like it was aggressive and abusive. I was a 'stupid fucking asshole' and... yessssss the crazy you guys warned me about came out. 

I told her ""You know, its 100% fine with me when you're not interested in sex, right? Why can't you show the same respect to MY body when i'm fucking hurt in my groin!?""

BOOM! The words ""**It's not only that...**"" came out. She unleashed a verbal tirade about minor things that she claimed was neglectful of her.  Apparently I dont care because I didn't ask her what she wanted at the grocery store.  I felt sort of bad until half-way through the tirade until I remembered something... Jokingly (while slightly frustrated) that she kept saying IDK to whatever food I asked her about, and teasing about how she couldn't tell me what type of juice she liked.  

I finally stuck up to her. I unleashed into her about how she just fabricates things in her head. I asked her a million times what food she liked, or what she wanted in each freaking aisle, but instead she answered IDK. 

""I don't know, I don't know! It's always I dont know, then you throw it in my face for not knowing?  I'm asking because I wanted to fucking **know**- in fact the only thing you seem to fucking know is that you want me to kill my cat!? for what!? this happy little verbal tirade over me tearing a piece of tissue next to my balls, and not being able to have sex!?""

I picked up my back pack, unzipped it - and dumped her clothes and underwear all over her couch. ""I've been thinking about this quite some time - you're dumped, bitch.""

Her jaw dropped. ""you can't do that"".... ""yes, yes, I can - and i'm doing it right now, you're acting insane. this is insane. and your demands are insane."" (in the calmest voice I can), and I walk out of there peacefully, and gently close the door.

So - walking away from her apartment she's screaming and yelling crap at me. Keep walking. By the time i'm out the elevator and out front she's on the balcony screaming horrible crap at me in front of EVERYONE. I'm apparently dickless. then I had a dick, and it was small. Then I was a faggot. Then she yelled ""he tried to rape me!"" - I HAD TO FUCKING STOP AND SAY SOMETHING. 

I turned around, walked back calmly (and slowly with my cane) - smiled and said ""DId you just say a gay man with no dick tried to rape you!? That has got to be the dumbest shit i've ever heard? Its obvious to everyone staring why you were dumped. get over it!"" walked-off and said nothing more.

I hard some laughter, saw some gawkers, and this group of students(?) (guys and girls) were cheering me on as i was walking off. Even the girls ""yeah buddy! you're da man! don't take that crap off a girl like that! woo!"" lol one girl even taunted her and yelled ""Does that mean  he's single now, hun!?""

craziest and best breakupstory ever!

tl;dr

Okay, for the full update now. Well I put off the talk yesterday, I was going to tell her soon as she got home but as it approached I started analyzing our relationship and how I personally felt about it. With this whole old dude situation aside I realized I wasn't really happy myself.

While we have a ton in common and I love her so much, our relationship really wasn't working the more I thought about it. I think a lot of it has to do with the difference in maturity between us. I was never treated with much respect and the affection you would expect someone you're in a relationship to have for you, just wasn't there.

It hit me then that we make much better friends, as hard as it is for me to admit this. We have so much history with each other and we have so much in common we really wanted it to work.

I realize now that I deserve much better. I'm always looking out on how to help others and so focused on what others want that I never really looked at what ""I"" want. And looking back I wasn't treated the way one should be, especially in a relationship.

I went in the bedroom and saw she was awake. I laid down and asked her about her day. I asked her if she wants to talk about what is going on and she replied with ""No"" while looking away from me. I ask again and she quickly replies again with ""No."" We laid there for about 5 minutes quietly and then she starts bawling. I start tearing up a bit.

She asked how long I knew something wasn't right and I told her a month ago I could tell something was up with her. Which she replies with ""You know me so damn well"" and I said ""I know."" I explained what I realized and she agreed with everything I had to say. We both laughed a bit while passing the tissue back and forth.

We talked about what we want in life and she realizes now that she needs to focus on herself. What she wants to achieve and where she wants to be. I helped her realize that she is trying to fill the void of being unhappy with herself with a relationship, and that she needs to achieve where she wants to be in life, then share that with a partner, rather than trying to use a partner to fill it.

So we are giving our two months notice to the apartment complex and moving out. We are going to try to remain friends but we will see how that works out.

I feel sad that it couldn't work out but excited for what the future holds for me. I'm going to focus a lot more on me now and hopefully be able to share my accomplishments with someone I truly love and who truly loves me.

I am content. :)

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart reddit. You guys and gals are awesome.

Edit: Just wanted to note that we both decided that neither of us are going to get into a relationship anytime soon and we are both going to start focusing on our lives to better ourselves first.

**TL;DR** I realized that I wasn't happy in this relationship as I wasn't treated with the respect or given the affection I deserved. I helped her realize that she needs to focus on herself and her life instead of seeking a relationship to fill her needs in life. Lots of crying ensued. Going to try to be friends but we'll see. I'm looking forward to what the future holds for me. Thank you reddit, you are all awesome.

**Update:** Hey thanks for all the replies! I wasn't expecting so many... And I'm actually quite surprised as I was half expecting most people hoping for a more... drama-style breakup, lol.

To address a few questions, yes I realize the whole not going to be in a relationship for awhile ""agreement"" probably won't happen like we plan. I'm not holding my breath. I have a feeling she is still attached to this older man and even though she told him that she ""needs some time"", I wouldn't be surprised if that time won't end up being much time at all. However thanks to my realization about our current relationship, even if this man wasn't in the picture, I feel I still deserve better and am not so much concerned about that situation anymore.

Will we actually stay friends? I really don't know, only time will tell. I could have gotten angry, I could have yelled at her, but at this point I realized I don't want to be in this relationship anymore. I was a doormat for staying in this relationship and always blamed myself for the way I was treated. Deciding with myself that I was not going to try to stay in this relationship, even if that was what she wanted, was probably the first thing I did for ""me"" in a long time. I felt empowered and found a love for myself that I have been ignoring for too long.

She apologized to me about everything. I told her how upset I was about the whole situation. Her acknowledgement and taking responsibility for what she put me through recently is what helped me agree to stay friends with her.

Some of you said that she wasted 9 years of my life. I don't look at it that way at all. While the relationship itself didn't work out, we still had a ton of good memories together. Like the time seagulls swarmed our bag of Oreo cookies and destroyed them all... ;p I've learned so much from all this. I feel like I can apply this knowledge in any new relationship that comes my way. I feel like my relationships in the future from this point on will be much more fulfilling and I'll never ""settle"" for anything less than what I actually deserve.

It will be interesting to see how things go until we move into our own places. I'm sure there will be emotions to come but I just need to remember that this is not a relationship I want to be in.

I feel like learning how to rock climb, it has been something I've put off on trying for awhile now.

1373047902.0,716,self.relationships,1hpblr,I (21F) turned my little brother (17M) in to the DFCS for child neglect and he's going to hate me.,might-as-well,897,181,263,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hpblr/i_21f_turned_my_little_brother_17m_in_to_the_dfcs/,"This is a long story so I will mostly use bullets to summarize but there is some required background info first:

My 17-year-old brother, Mike, has been dating an 18-year-old girl, Alice, for around 8 months.  She is basically his first girlfriend and he lost his virginity to her.  Alice has a 3-year-old son, Brady, and a 5-month-old daughter, Bailey, each from a different father (neither of which is my brother).  Alice was married to Bailey's father but divorced him around 3 months ago.  Within a few weeks after the divorce was finalized, Mike and Alice were married.

From the beginning, my family has been extremely opposed to their relationship.  Alice is the most unpleasant, rude, disrespectful, trashy, immature person I have ever met.  She grew up with a terrible home life, so I have tried to be supportive in hopes that she would grow up a little bit, but there is no hope for this girl.  She's racist and bitches about everything and is convinced the entire world is out to get her.  I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at that and if I need to elaborate on anything I will.

Meanwhile, I guess, the issue at hand:  After they got married, they had nowhere to go, so out of concern for the children my parents grudgingly let them move in.  Alice as never had a job before, and Mike worked for a few weeks but after losing that job claims he hasn't been able to find another one.  They literally just sit around day in and day out, living off my mother's very limited income.  Mike claims the children as his own, going so far as to have Brady call him “daddy” even though Brady's real father is still in the picture and is called “daddy” as well.

* They feel no need to work to provide basic necessities for the kids, like diapers, wipes, formula, food, clothing, etc.  My mom (who is enabling them and that's an entirely different story) provides these items because she doesn't want Mike and the kids to go without, despite her being backed up on bills and beyond broke herself.

* They get $600+ dollars in food stamp assistance each month, which I have seen them go through in seriously a little over a week.  Once they spend all of the money on other things, it becomes apparent that they didn't even buy baby food or formula.
* The baby, Bailey, was born a little over 2 weeks premature (Alice smoked throughout her entire pregnancy) and developed acid reflux as an infant, so she's always been on the small side.  However, I've seen them go 12+ hours without feeding her (despite doctors' orders to feed her every 3 hours).  She's now over 5 months old and weighs 10 pounds, which is below the 5th percentile.  She looks emaciated.

* I've witnessed them get up in the morning, come out to eat breakfast while leaving Brady in the room by himself on orders not to get up, and then leave to go somewhere without ever feeding him anything. He is also bony and looks malnourished.

* From the time Bailey was a few weeks old when the excitement of having a new baby wore off, they have refused to hold her when she cries.  They're convinced it'll “spoil her” so they literally leave her in a swing for hours to cry herself to sleep, often when she's probably just hungry or needs to be changed.

* They have, on occasion, left her in a bedroom by herself in the middle of the day (when my parents' air conditioner wasn't working, so it was easily 90+ degrees in the house) to cry herself to sleep, without even checking on her periodically.

* After my dad basically kicked them out after months of them living there, making no effort to look for work or even clean up after themselves, they moved into a house that Alice's mother owns.  This house is falling apart, nasty, has a serious wolf-rat infestation, garbage piled up around the house and property, etc.  They haven't attempted to clean it up or make it safe. Brady's room doesn't have an actual floor, just plywood with no covering.

* Mike takes it upon himself (with Alice's encouragement) to punish the little boy.  For everything, even just acting like a 3-year-old.  They often want him to just sit on the couch and watch television for hours so they don't have to deal with him, and if he gets up they yell at him. When they think yelling isn't working anymore, Mike “spanks” him.  I'm not inherently opposed to physical punishment, but I feel like it should be reserved for extreme situations (like maybe running into the road or something).  However, it's so bad that if Brady does anything wrong and sees Mike coming toward him, he immediately starts screaming and crying out of fear.  I've been around before when it happens, and could hear Mike “spank” him at least 10 times from two rooms over.  It made me sick.

I guess I should cut that short and summarize where we are now.  After all of this, and a lot of thought and worry and stress, I realized everyone has tried to help them realize what mistakes they're making and they refuse to acknowledge that they might be doing anything wrong.  (My mom got upset when they left Bailey in the hot room to cry, and Alice said she's raised one child and she doesn't need Mike's mama to tell her how to raise her other one; just to show how disrespectful and completely self-righteous she is).  They think they're the world's best parents.

So... I called the Department of Family and Children Services and filed a complaint against them.  I've been genuinely afraid something will happen to one of the kids, and they wouldn't listen to reason.  I don't feel like I made a mistake, but there was a lot of self-conflict involved with the decision just because he's my brother and he wasn't like this until he met Alice.  However, the case worker gave out enough details in the initial investigation that they can just about pin-point that it was me, and I know Mike is going to hate me for it.

I guess my question is, is there any way to salvage this relationship?  How can I make him see it was for good reason?  And, along those lines, is there any way we can make them wake up and realize they're neglecting and in some cases abusing these kids?  I don't think they mean to hurt them, I think they're just so immature and so convinced they aren't doing anything wrong that they genuinely don't see a problem.  I have little hope that the investigation will do any good, and I'm worried about the kids.

Meanwhile, until they know for sure who it was, they're pissed and determined to get even.  Alice has been quoted saying such classy things as, ""Lets just say whenever I find out who it was whether it be male or female. Lets just say you should pray to God I don't run across your ass! Have a great day haters:))""  They're so convinced it's just someone trying to cause unnecessary problems for them that they won't even consider the complaints against them.

TL;DR:  My little brother and sister-in-law are horrible parents.  They let their kids (3 years, 5 months) go without food, clothing, diapers, etc. and are emotionally abusive and negligent.  I finally broke down and turned them in for neglect.

 **This one turned out really long, sorry.**

First off, I'd just like to say thanks. Just wow. Over the last two days I've had literally hundreds of messages (and PMs), you guys rock. Seriously look at that thread, thats got to have one best positivity and sweetness to meaness and jerks ratios on all of reddit, like ever. You guys knocked it out of the park for me, I'm still figure out why.


So yesterday after getting a barrage of support from you guys on my phone every couple minutes non-stop all day, I decided to try and confront my husband over what I'd over heard. After we were both home from work I told him I needed to talk. I told him I'd over heard him and his friends and he immediately started to apologize for them saying they were jerks and assholes and that I should have told him I'd heard.

I had to stop him to let me get a word in and tell him it wasn't his friends so much as it was what HE said. When I told him what he said his whole tone changed, I could tell wasn't expecting to be blamed. I had had the whole conversation planned out; I wanted to explain how it made me feel, how I thought he really was attracted to me and how betrayed it made me feel to hear him that behind my back.

but I just started to cry, and couldn't really communicate what I wanted to say very well. He was awesome tho and just held me, and then after a minute started to speak like he was reading right out of the nicest comments in the original thread, telling me he was just angry and didn't speak very well. That he really does find me attractive even if the world doesn't, and his friends don't.

I calmed down pretty quick; I'd basically cried myself out the day before. He took me to his computer and showed me an email he sent to all of his friends on Sunday. I wish I could copy paste it now, but he basically called all his friends assholes, said they'd crossed the line from good natured trash talk to just being assholes and then continued going far beyond. He said that, for time indefinite they'd have to find another host, were no longer welcome in my home (he actually said ""[my name]'s home"", I thought that would make it sound like I was ordering him around being a bitch, but he said he just wanted to empathize how wrong what they were doing was). Seeing him stand up for me again made me happy, especially seeing me do it without talking bad about me, helping me believe it really was just heat of the moment bad word choice.
 
He told me to wait in the room and left, coming back with a folder. He said he was going to give me this for Christmas but that he'd get me something else. I tried to say no but he insisted. It was plane tickets and brochures. He's set up a trip in early January to this spa/hotel/resort thing in British Columbia. It was pretty mind blowing. 

But I realized that it had to be several thousand dollars he'd spent. We budget pretty thoroughly, he shouldn't have been able to spend that without me noticing. I asked where he got the money and he said he'd been planning this for more then a year and saving all the money assigned to his weekly spending money, and collecting where I wouldn't notice, change from groceries, etc.

When I say that sometimes I'm not sure I deserve him, understand that I'm not having a crisis I need help dealing with, he's just really awesome. He's taking me out for dinner, so I have to go, but I'll be on again tonight.

**TL;DR** Everything is ok. Husband is an amazing person. I still wish I was prettier but understand how lucky I am, how happy I should be, and how prettiness and happiness are not synonyms.

Hi guys! I took your advice and have since decided to tell all future prospects about my job BEFORE things get serious.


A few days ago, I went on a date with a guy and we had a connection that was completely unbelievable. It was wonderful and we literally spent 48 hours together just talking... which I never do!

Eventually I had to work so I told him that I needed to get dressed to go into work. This was at 11:00PM so he was curious about where I worked. The conversation went like this:

Him: ""You have to work? It's 11:00PM, shouldn't you be going to bed?""

Me: ""I actually work at night from home. I'm a webcam girl and if that bothers you please tell me now.""

Him: ""No way, that's pretty awesome! My mom used to be a stripper so I'm cool with it.""

And it worked! It fucking worked! THANK YOU ALL!

So I sat down with my wife and explained my feelings. My wife is really one of the most honest people I've ever met, and on top of being married for ten years we've been together for close to 20. She was really surprised and tears were shed. She apologized. She said she just really didn't think about it in that way. Over the last year or so she just gradually became more comfortable with her tennis partner - and has never thought of him in sexual way. She said there is no attraction. I feel a bit ashamed for even thinking this way, I also think some of the comments in the original thread started making my mind go overboard. My wife really is an amazing person and I've always said that our relationship and my family life is perfect. Our sex life is also amazing for those that were curious.
Maybe the stress of the everyday life and the financial strain of raising 4 kids got the best of me. Maybe she was a bit to comfortable with her tennis partner too. Live and learn I guess..... Thanks for reading!
tl;dr- All's good no worries. Wife and family are great. I feel a bit silly now.

My now ex consistently refused to admit his infidelity throughout the next day. He would not admit it no matter what. I finally told him I would not speak to him about anything related to our relationship until he was straight with me. Finally, he admitted the truth.

He told me he has slept with his coworker ""one time""(isn't that always the way?). He somehow misplaced the condom wrapper his fist time *ever* cheating(you know, the time when you're most cautious) when he was taking it to throw away. He supposedly took it out to his car to throw away at our house, instead of leaving it at her place for some reason. He's very sorry, the whole thing was ""horrible"" and he regrets it, etc. 

I had him call the woman on speaker phone and have her apologize to me for sleeping with him. Which she did. I asked her if it was going to continue, to which she said ""god no"". He did lie to me an extra time by telling me she was not *really* a coworker, but she referred to herself as one. 

We then had a long discussion over the course of several hours. He kept trying to talk about counselling but I could not, and still don't, see that as an option for us. 

It would have been a different matter had he come to me with this, instead of me finding out. He did not seem to understand that we are over as a couple, and kept referring to when we ""worked it out"" and when ""you get over this"". ""What do I have to do to make you trust me, to fix this?"" That he should have not have cheated on me, was my only response. 

At the end of it, I had to make it very clear that he is not welcome here. I put several of his possessions on the porch when he refused to take them himself. He finally left. I can't say I was anywhere near an admirable human being during this, but I think he finally gets that it's over.

I think my daughter is going to be alright. She did see us fighting some at the beginning before we put her to bed. She's asking this morning why daddy can't stay, and I'm doing the best I can to explain without it being scary. It's hard. It's very hard. We're going to make it, though.

One day I'll be able to drop my daughter off to visit her dad without my stomach turning in disgust at the sight of him. That's not today, but one day in the future.

He drives down here whenever he can to see me, and even just when I cry and ask him to. He is so good to me. My boyfriend has been incredible through all of this. He's supportive, helpful, and amazing. He takes such good care of me, and I want to give back.

I don't really have money to spend on gifts, but if I did, I don't think it would mean as much to him as something that I worked hard on and put a lot of thought into. After thinking about it, I know that I want to make him a CD of recorded songs that I've sang. I'm not sure which songs to do, so some input on that would be great! Any other suggestions are very much appreciated.

I want to put together a great big care package to send him. I think that everything in it should be made by me. I know I'll make the CD, and probably include a letter. I want all of this to last, especially if there are complications with my surgeries, or I don't beat the cancer this time. I want him to be able to remember me. I love him so much.

tl;dr What can I include in a homemade care package to my man?

**Edit: Okay guys, you had some excellent ideas! So far, here's what I'm going to go with:**

-CD with Your Song, Next to You, As Long as You Wait For Me, Chelsea Dagger (because it's our favorite), 1234, Such Great Heights, My Valentine, I can't help falling in love with you, A Thousand Miles, Your Call, Bittersweet Symphony (cause we're 90's kids!), Slide (My all time favorite song!), Dream a Little Dream of Me, You and I, Her Diamonds and Let Love In.

-A Jar full of tiny papers with memories, affirmations, and cute little sayings, so that he can open one every day that he doesn't see me.

-A couple of jars of cupcakes, like [this](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRLd6DCmA3heP-T_aZPsq0rDZNSjdu5UDs_ho_tREyydvRpY-1A).

-A picture of the time we did a little photo shoot on the side of a cliff at my parent's cabin, framed and decorated by me

-A whole bunch of 'open when' letters. I will probably do open when you miss me, open when we haven't seen each other in a month, open when things are getting rough, open when i'm going into surgery, and a few morbid open when's in case something happens to me.

-A mini scrapbook with movie tickets, pictures, etc.

-A handwritten letter that he is to open right when he gets the package, telling him how much I love and appreciate him, and how he is my Superman. [Except really I would say Batman, because fuck Superman.]

-Homemade beef jerky, because I just got a dehydrator and he LOVES that shit.

-A video of me, sitting and talking to him (especially since I'm still pretty healthy and have a full head of long hair).

-A crocheted scarf, with our initials on it.

-A few CD's from bands we like, for him to listen to in the car. He goes driving a LOT, especially when he's stressed out. I get the feeling that now that the cancer is back, this will happen more often.

Now her fiance (M31) is offering me money to stay completely out of their lives.",throwyourfaceaway101,799,136,455,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18cugc/my_ex_gf_f30_gave_birth_to_our_son_didnt_tell_me/,"I will make this as short as possible.

So about 2 years ago, I (M32) dated this girl for about a year, actually it was on and off.  Toward the end it was mostly FWB, but then we got back together as an official ""couple"" in the last month of the relationship, only for me to find out through mutual friends that she was still having a sexual relationship with another guy.  After I broke up with her, this other guy called me and told me that him and my GF were in love with one another, and that I needed to ""get lost"" or he'd make me ""sorry"".  I asked him to clarify what that meant, but he hung up the phone.  These two have been dating ever since, and are now engaged.

So, I moved on, and we went our separate ways.  Then about six months ago, someone in her family, very accidentally, informed a mutual friend of ours that she (my ex) had gotten pregnant and that the baby was mine, and that she had given birth to it, and her and her fiance are raising it as though it's his baby.  (My son is now about 10 months old).

So, I contacted her when I found out this news, and she broke down hysterically crying and hung up the phone.  Minutes later, her fiance called me cursing and screaming, telling me that I needed to leave his family the hell alone.  I remained totally calm, and eventually got him to explain that she had indeed given birth to a baby, and that they had, because she had been sleeping with both of us at the time, tested him for paternity and found out the baby was not his.  So, by process of elimination, assuming she's not lying about who she was sleeping with, the baby is mine.  

I contacted a lawyer, and a DNA test eventually revealed that it is my son.  There was a meeting with me, my lawyer, and both of them and their attorney, where I was informed that they were going to be fighting for full custody with only 2 hours per week of supervised visitation, which my lawyer said was outrageous and would never fly in court, to which their response was to get up and walk out of the room without any further word.  A court date was set for later this month.

Then, out of the blue yesterday, she called me and was crying hysterically, basically telling me that I'm ruining everyone's life, that I'm being selfish, I'm tearing her family apart, etc.  I explained that I have no intention of ruining anyone's life, but that since this baby is mine, that I do have every intention of being as much a part of my son's life as humanly possible, and I also explained that my lawyer had been able to unearth information that exposed her current fiance as a person with an extensive history of legal trouble, including domestic violence, drunk driving, driving with no driver's license, and assault.  I told her that because of this information, my lawyer is telling me that there is a very good chance I will actually win full custody of our son.  This resulted in even further hysterical crying, and she hung up the phone.

That's when things get crazy heated.  Minutes later, the phone rings, I see it's her number, so I answer.  Now it's her fiance.  He tells me he wants to meet with me to ""talk this over rationally"".  Given his prior threats against me, and given his history, I told him no way would I be meeting up with him.  He eventually talked me into meeting him for a face to face conversation in a police station parking lot, which I finally (reluctantly) agreed to, even though my lawyer told me it was a bad idea.

To make a long story short, he basically handed me a check (from her father's bank account and signed by him) for a large sum of money, in the low six figure range, in exchange for me dropping the case and permanently signing away all rights to custody or visitation, ever.

I showed the check to my attorney, who did some research and found out that her father was basically attempting to bribe me into going away, and that the check is good and the account actually has sufficient funds to make payment.  I asked him if such a thing was even legal, and he explained that yes it is legal, though I would have to pay income taxes on the money as the deal was presently constituted.

I'm actually considering taking them up on the deal.  Now, before you rush to judgement and call me a bastard, allow to me explain my thinking.  This girl, my ex, is crazy.  She's basically the typical spoiled rich girl... she's always had everything handed to her in life and she works for nothing and expects all the best of everything in life without ever having to do anything for it.  She is spoiled and entitled, and you would not believe how horrible her attitude can be at times.  Also, this guy she is engaged to is a seriously scary person... I mean it was like something out of a movie, this big burly dude meeting me in a parking lot and grimly offering to bribe me away.  His eyes have this ""dead"" quality to them that chills me to the bone.

On the one hand, I feel like if I fight for custody I will probably win, and we can split custody, but the next 16 years of my life will become a living hell of dealing with these people.  I have even considered the idea that given this guy's history, and given their apparent access to so much cash, maybe at some point in time they'll decide it's cheaper just to pay someone to kill me or something?  So in many ways, it seems like the easiest thing would be to just take the money and walk away.  I could use the cash to pay off my student loans, and there would still be enough left over to retire my mortgage.

On the other hand, my paternal instincts kick in, and I wonder what kind of life I'm ""selling"" my son into.  The thought of this bastard raising my son and disciplining him, or being his male role model, makes me feel like a total piece of shit for even considering taking money.

At this point I'm totally torn.  I've turned to every friend and relative I've got, and everyone has a different opinion on what to do.

I'm bringing this to you now, reddit, what should I do???

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j990v/update_getting_married_in_a_week_my_26m_fiancee/



Ok first let me apologise for the throwaway, but my fiancee is a frequent redditor and I'm afraid she might see this. 

I'll get right to it. Last night was my bucks night and my fiancee's hens night. We've been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. We've both had our doubts about settling down young (for her) but have worked through them together. Our families love each other, our lives are so intertwined. I don't even know what to think right now.

Our wedding day is this Thursday, and of course we both were fine with the other having a night out with friends as a ""last hoorah"". I didn't find it suspicious at the time that she objected to the traditional ""hens night"" scenario where she was the centre of attention. She said she just wanted a quiet informal night at the bar with her close girlfriends. 

So last night we got home at different times, I got home around 2am from a night of pool and beers with my closest 4 friends (known them since highschool). She got home close to 6am looking really dishevelled. I noticed right away that she wasn't wearing her engagement ring. It's a fairly large ring (not bragging). At first I was really worried that she had lost it, and asked her about it right away. She acted surprised that it wasn't there, and immediately said that she must have dropped it somewhere. This struck me as odd, because originally we had to have the ring resized to fit her (when I first proposed), so I know it fits perfectly now. Not exactly easy to slip off. 

So I asked a few more questions, just worried about her and about the ring since it was fairly pricey. She seemed to be really upset, I could see her visably shaking and she was close to crying I think. She told me she'd call the bar later when it opened, and that she needed to get some sleep. 

Later that morning she was in the shower, and I decided to have a quick look through the pockets of her clothes from last night and the bag she'd taken just incased it had slipped off when she was dancing or getting something from her bag. Lo and behold, what's this in the bottom of her handbag? A ring box, one I've never seen before, and inside is her ring. What??! So I'm about to call out to her in the shower but then I get suspicious. Something feels wrong. Usually I'm not one to snoop, I believe in privacy and trust as the foundation of a good relationship, but I had the most overwhelming feeling. So I looked at her phone which was sitting on the nightstand. She had two missed calls from a number I didn't recognise, and a message from the same number in her inbox. The message just had a street address and the words ""see you soon xx"". At this point my mind was racing and I had butterflies in my stomach. Shit. Shit shit shit. This took me completely by surprise, and I'm not used to feeling paranoid. She's never given me any reason to doubt her in the past.

She got out of the shower and I was still too numb to say anything. I felt like I needed some time to process what I'd found. I mean, the address could have been for some party that the girls had decided to head to after leaving the bar, and I didn't want to make her upset by jumping on her about it straight away in case nothing had happened. 

But then came that afternoon. I came back into the bedroom after making some lunch (this was around 1 pm) to find her beaming at me. ""The bar found my ring!"" she said, ""I can go grab it later this evening on my way to work"" (she works as a a server at a restaurant downtown). 

So that's where I'm at, Reddit. It seems that my soon-to-be wife may be cheating, or lying, or both. What the hell do I do? Obviously the immediate answer is to talk to her about it, but what do I say? Help! I'm absolutely lost and I feel like my world has been turned upside down by this. 

**TL;DR My fiancee (together 4 years) went out for her hens night last night and came back without her engagement ring. She claims she lost it, I find it in her bag, along with a text from a strange number. She lies, telling me the bar has found her ring.

We're engaged!

It went great! She got out of her grad school classes early, so I had to run off from work early to get home before her, so it was close! I left roses in the kitchen and she was over the top excited that I had just gotten her flowers, but she still had no idea!  I took my camera and in my camera bag I hid a bottle of champagne and two plastic champagne flutes. I popped the question after dancing around the bandstand and giving her my sweet proposal speech, I got down on one knee (she started crying) and **she said yes!**  She even yelled ""OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"".. who knew that really happened in real life? We popped the champagne and carved our initials and the date into the inside of the bandstand.  We had about an hour before our dinner reservations so she could change and do her hair and then we went back to where we had our first date, and we even both wore the same clothes we wore on that date, too! We're over the top excited and can't wait to tell our friends families today! Thanks for the support redditors!

**********************************************
So, B texted me yesterday, and asked if he could come over that night.(I'm just gonna say B=Boyfriend). It's not like me to say no, and this was something that was really bugging me, so I stepped outside of the office real quick and called him. I said sure, definitely come over. But I also said that I had been thinking about some things lately and I wanted to talk to him about them. The back of my mind was definitely screaming ""Don't say, 'we need to talk'!! Don't do it!"" So I did my best to not terrify him, as suggested by so many of you. Either way, he said that sounds find, have a good day at work, see you tonight. 

Once he's at my house, we sit down on the couch to talk. I had thought a lot about how to bring all of this up, and you guys really did help me a lot. I went for brutally honest/tough love, and I reminded myself the entire time. I can get pretty emotional when it comes to him, but me crying and trying to be rational was not going to help. Sugar coating would not help either. I also knew I had to tell him that I knew.

&gt;Me: ""B, I know about the ring.""   
B: --15 seconds of wide-eyed terror--  ""... ok...""   
Me: ""I need to talk to you about all of this.""   

Then begins my long speech to him. I told him that I wasn't sure what his plan was with the ring, but I had thought about it a lot, and I couldn't figure out why he thought now was a good time. It went something like this:

""B, remember earlier this year, when we were talking about our future, and I told you that there are a few things that I would need from you before marriage could even be discussed? Things like you being independent on your own, away from you parents? You knowing where your money is coming from, saving, understanding what it's like to be responsible for only yourself? Well, it's now a year and a half later, and  I don't see much that has changed.""

B then tries to say that a lot has changed. When I ask him what has, he does not have much of an answer. ""They have! Things have changed!"" and when I ask for examples, he does not offer up much. Time for tough love. 

""B, I want you to look at it from my perspective. You know how hard I work for everything in life, and when I get married, I want to know that the other person is working just as hard for not only our future, but their future as well. A year and a half later, and you still live with your parents, and have not really moved toward your future at all. You don't have money and I don't understand why you don't. You're an amazing person with a lot of potential in your future, but you don't have the drive to go after it, and I don't know why.""

* ""I have bad credit and can't get an apartment"" - No, B, that is not an excuse. We live in a city of renters, and many, many places look at income more than they do with credit. My past two places have not required credit checks, but rather employment verification. I'm not saying everyone is like this, but I am saying that there are options. 

* ""Every time I start saving, something comes up! Car, computer, etc. etc."" - While that's fine and dandy, having a saving account is part of being prepared for these expenses. Buying that $500 thing, when you could have set aside the $500 and then bought said thing later, is what it's like to be an adult. Sure, I have money right now to go buy a brand new wardrobe, but if I did, then my car broke, I'd be screwed. It's about preparing for life and the unknown.

* ""I have been working on my passions"" - (Note: He has them, they are there, I just don't want to reveal too much information on this) No, you've been talking about the passions, but not actively pursuing them. I've offered to go with you to technical schools, training, entry level jobs, whatever you need to get this ball rolling into a professional career, but you haven't stepped up. I'll do your resume, help you plan, but you have to want to set up the appointments, get the information, and fight for it. 

So, we talked about that stuff for a bit. He argued some, but every time, I would shoot it down with legitimate choices and concerns. I asked that when he leaves, to spend time thinking about what I've said. That if he has more questions or thoughts to please discuss them with me, but he really needs to think about it on his own. If he thinks I'm wrong in all of this, he needs to say that too (and if he does, I'll have to deal with it then).

So, back to the marriage thing, and I think this is where it might have crushed him the most, but also the point of realization.

&gt;""B, when it comes to marriage, you really have not thought this out. What was the plan here? How would this work?""   
""It would! It's not going to be easy, but we'd make it work!""   
""How would it just 'work' B? Better yet, after knowing my concerns, what do you think my parents would do if you proposed at Christmas?""   
""I was thinking about proposing at Christmas, but I was more concerned with their approval! I want them to know I love their daughter and I'd do what I could to make you happy!""   
""Alright B, you know my father is retired military, and I am his only daughter. You need to think long and hard about how that conversation would go down. My father would not give you his blessing. Not because he doesn't like you, he does like you, but because he would point out everything that I have, and even worse. You want to ask a navy seal for his blessing, when you live at home and have no money? Think about how bad that would go.""    

I think a light went on in his head. He went from being crushed and heartbroken to going ""Oh shit"". There was something in his face that changed. He went from being defensive to looking like he was thinking really hard. We then sat in silence for a very long time. A few questions, a few more talks, but a lot of silence. He then asked the one that made me super sad - ""Do you want me to take back the ring?"" - And again, I thought about it, and was just honest. I told him that was his decision. I was not breaking up with him, but a lot has to change and we have a lot to work on separately and alone. I can't tell him if keeping the ring is better for him or not. ""Do you want to see it?"" - No, I can't see what good that would do. 

He sat there for a long time, and then with tears in his eyes, said ""Thank you"". I just stared, and he said ""It has to be hard to say the things you've said. You've brought up a lot of stuff, and I don't know what to think yet. But thank you for giving me the time to think about it. It's definitely been a dose of reality."" After that, he left. I gave him a hug for a long time, told him I loved him, and that we'll talk later. 

So - we'll see. It's not something anyone can immediately change, but it is something that has to start happening in some way. I feel it's his choice to either change, or say ""Nah, she's crazy.. I'm fine"". And I need to not back down on these things either. 

**TL:DR: Talked to boyfriend about everything. Didn't understand, then got defensive, then got pensive, then thanked me. Proposal sufficiently postponed.**

First I just want to say thank you for all the helpful responses that I received yesterday. I've never in my life had to deal with a situation like this. I also hope it is the last time as well. 


As soon as he got home from work this morning I told him that we needed to have a serious conversation. We both sat down and I told him that I found the cup he had been pissing in behind the chair. That it was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen and I was repulsed that he would actually do something like that when we have a perfectly working bathroom upstairs. He started to actually DEFEND himself as to why he was using it! I tried to stay calm but I couldn't anymore and eventually it turned into a heated argument. He stated that the cup was easier to use than going upstairs to use our bathroom which is seriously 30 ft away!! And he usually dumps it in the KITCHEN SINK when he's finished.. W.T.F. That right there was a deal breaker for me. This has been going on for quite some time. Upon further inspection where I originally found the cup I could clearly see urine stains on the floor. How I didn't know about this sooner I don't know. But I'm really glad that I do now. I can't continue to live with this sick fuck any longer. I'll be moving my things out today and will be staying with a friend for the time being. 


**TL;DR** Boyfriend defended himself about using his piss cup instead of going to the bathroom like a normal person. He had been doing it for some time now. We broke up and I'm moving out.

Previous Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12qiif/my_m23_parents_m58f63_have_taken_me_out_of_the/

Hello all, thank you all for your responses, I think the very vast majority of you understood what I was upset about with only a few idiots thinking that it was about money rather than validation of what I had always believed a bit, that they prefer my sister.

I wanted to get this sorted out as soon as possible for book the afternoon off work and went round to see them and learned two new things about myself from my parents: 

1). **I was an accident.** Apparently after my sister my mum had a miscarriage and they decided not to try again and then a year later along pops me. Because I was unplanned they hadn’t really though through their finances and so for about a year and a half my Dad had to work two jobs and has always felt that I made him miss out on my sister growing up and that because he rarely saw me he has never really connected with me. As for my mum, the previous miscarriage had put her off of having children, she was content with her little girl and by then (age 39) was quite happy to be done having children.

2). **They are disappointed with me.** They don’t like my fiancée, they don’t like that I live a forty minute drive away, they are sad that I chose Accountancy instead of doing a Law degree but most of all they are disappointed that I am not closer to my sister. That is friends with a girl who spent most of her life bullying me, who has treated them appallingly, who stole money from them regularly until she moved out and who I was persuaded to lend £2,000 of my savings for University to so she could clear some debts; she never paid that back and I had to get into a lot of debt myself to get through my final year. Its not even like I am horrible to my sister now, I love my niece and nephew and spoil them all the time and for their sake will help her out from time to time with money for bills/food.

Apparently this is why I am not in the will (and never have been – except when I was younger where custody of me would have been given to an aunt until I was 18). They have “never really seen me as their son”, I was always a bit too distant and self reliant and apparently “made it easy for them to love your sister more”.
I’m not down to get anything as they don’t really view me as part of the family. Me going away for three years to Uni made it worse but its something that they have always felt. They asked me if I felt that it was wrong what I did and said if I could persuade them otherwise they would change it somewhat, my sister would still be the main beneficiary but I would get something from them. I know r/relationships will probably be disappointed with me for my response but I just left. I told them I didn’t care about the money at all and if they cannot see me as a son then I no longer see them as parents. 


**Tl;dr. I am excluded as my parents are unhappy with my life choices despite never telling me so before. Also I was unwanted and so they have never really connected with me or viewed me as part of the family. Because they were so focussed on my sister I became self succient and grew up faster and that made them feel more distant. My sister means more to them than I and they do not want to change their minds or try to work things through.**

First off, we are both 22 (M &amp; F), finishing our last year of college.  We've been together almost 6 months, and I really do adore her, aside from this one kind of weird behavioral trait.  We have very similar interests, share many mutual friends, and get along on a day-to-day basis quite well.  

The problem is that every few weeks, she gets it into her head that I don't appreciate her enough.  I'll think everything is going well, and then out of the blue, she'll accuse me of taking her for granted.  I really don't think this is the case, as I go out of my way to compliment her and say ""I love you"" almost every day.  

Anyways, when this happens, she'll demand that we do this ""couple-building activity"" where  she pretends she is dead.  She'll light some candles, play ""Amazing Grace"" (the song they played at my grandfather's funeral a few years back), lay in bed, and cover herself with a sheet.  Then I am supposed to kneel down and say some ""last words"" to her.  She gets pissed if I don't cry, sometimes withholding sex as punishment.  

I've always known that she has some self-esteem issues, but this seems a little much.  I've tried talking to her about it, but she just gets defensive and says that this activity is necessary for me to grow emotionally and our relationship to grow stronger.  I really don't know what to do.  I don't want to lose her, but I can't keep mourning her death every few weeks.  

So tell me Reddit, does this sound like normal behavior?  How can I show her that I appreciate her without doing this activity?  

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend doesn't think that I appreciate her enough, so every few weeks she makes us do a couple-building activity where she pretends to be dead while I give her eulogy.

It was definitely a factor in my decision. I didn't blame them, I got it. Unfortunately I spiraled into a deep depression afterwards. I broke up with Cam because it hurt to see Bryce in his face and remember when I just wanted to forget. I lost 20lbs I didn't need to lose.

I'm going to a community college now and doing better, but I don't think I'll ever be the same. I can't be around kids now. I used to volunteer with them and was considering a field with children, but now it hurts to see them, physical pain.

Baby steps.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1drxyg/update_step_in_the_right_direction_after/)

**TL;DR**: I don't know how to summarize this. Girlfriends nightmares led to a six hour conversation about her being raped and abused by multiple people in her life. She won't talk to a therapist, and I don't know how to help her.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. This might turn out to be more of a vent than really needing advice, but I just really need to get my head wrapped around this somehow. 

We've been together for a year come end of May. We started having sex before we were dating, but never really ""slept"" together until probably 8 months ago. Both having jobs and college, it was difficult to spend many nights together. Her job transferred her closer to my house and that's when we started actually sleeping in a bed with each other.

Before I begin, I want to emphasize that I am a VERY deep sleeper. I've lived next to train tracks my entire life, I've even slept through a hurricane. It takes a lot to wake me up, so this is just to give you an idea of how violent and loud she got during sleep.

The first few times we slept together, everything was normal. She didn't wake me up, it was nice having her there. Probably 3 or 4 weeks into this, she started waking me up at night by screaming and thrashing around in bed. I would get her calmed down, and hold her until we fell back asleep. She insisted she didn't want to talk about it, that it was just a nightmare. She would go through, cycles, I guess of this? She'd be alright for a few nights, sometimes even for a few weeks, and then it would start again. 

It was so bad that she would scratch and bruise herself from digging into her arms, or something. I would wake up to her crying and screaming, twisting around in the bed next to me, gripping the sheets, just, it was awful.

About two months ago, she started that cycle again. Except it didn't stop like usual. Every fucking night this happened. At this point, we spend 6 days out of the week together, so it was really taking a toll on my sleep and hers as well. Some nights this would happen two or three times. 

Four nights ago, it got really bad. I COULDN'T get her to wake up. She fought me. And not a, started sleep fight, but like, a life or death fight. She just wouldn't snap out of it, until finally after clawing my arms and busting my lip she snapped out of it. She was shaking, and was doing that weird cold sweat thing. It scared the shit out of me, and we didn't go to sleep afterwards. After she woke up, and seemed to understand where she was and who she was with, she calmed down and we went to the kitchen to talk. I needed to know why this was happening, and I needed her to talk to me about it.

An hour later, after circling around the same damn questions, she finally told me. I KNEW before we talked about it that it was going to be bad. No one has those kinds of nightmares without it being something horrible. I just wasn't prepared for it to be *this* bad?

She broke down and told me about her ex. He beat her, he raped her, he let his friends rape her. She showed me the bridge in the left side of her mouth where he had knocked out four teeth. He had broken her nose four times. He'd broken ribs. He'd broken her arm, and three of her fingers on her left hand. He would choke her, slam her into things, and she showed me the pictures on her laptop from when he'd slammed her head into the side of his truck. The pictures were taken by a friend of hers when she was going to court against him. She pointed out all the scars on her body and told me the stories behind them. With every one, my heart broke even more.

I knew that her home life had been kind of shitty. Her mom had kind of abandoned her when she was thirteen, so my girlfriend got up with this guy, who was 16 or 17 at the time. They officially broke up three years ago, when she had him put in jail. 


It doesn't end there. When she was 6, her mom let a friends son babysit her (teenage boys do not need to be babysitting six year old girls.) He took her to a movie one night when her mom was working, and on the way back, pulled off the road (I know where she's talking about, because my brother and I used to go fishing there) and raped her in his truck. He shoved an A&amp;W rootbeer bottle into her bottom, and then basically made her clean him off with her mouth. She told her mom about it, who's response was to tell her not to tell anyone because if her dad found out, he would kill the little bastard and she didn't want her dad going to jail for it. 

After telling me everything, things started making so much more sense. She would always shut down on me any time we had a disagreement, even tiny ones. She'd start crying if I raised my voice (which I try not to, but it happens) and she would freak out if a door got slammed, even accidentally. I know now all of this is because of her ex, and it hurts...

I don't know how to help her. I *begged* her to see someone, and she told me over and over again that she had and it didn't do any good. Every time I look at her now it just kills me because I love her so fucking much and I can't imagine why anyone would hurt her, in any way. How someone could look into those gorgeous green eyes and hit her, or rape her. It just breaks my fucking heart and if I could find her ex or the guy who raped her, I would fuck their shit up. 

How do I help her? Is there anything I can do to make her feel safe, or help her live with this? I want to marry her one day, have kids with her, she's everything I want in a person, and in a relationship, and I just can't get my head around how you can treat another human being, especially someone like her, worse than fucking trash.

I am spending my first night in my new place. I actually moved in with my (former ex and father of my child)boyfriend. This all made me realize how alone I was. No one in my life understood the pain of giving a child up for adoption, because I cut out the only person who could.

It used to hurt to see him, and see Bryce's mouth and eyes, but it doesn't anymore. It's almost nice. What really cemented the decision is when I saw the picture of Bryce on the fridge though. I was never going to get to that level of okay in my own house.

My parents were very upset I moved and keep thinking I will change my mind. But I won't. My dad was almost angry and said I was being an idiot and if I was going to ""ruin my life"" I wasted a year crying because what's the difference? But that's just his way. My brother said they needed the space anyways and would turn my room into the baby's.. so he's being the same self involved boy he's always been. 

I hope he starts medicating again for his bipolar disorder, and gets a job, and is a good father. I don't think it's very likely. But I really do hope it works out. I just can't stay around and watch it every day.

Thanks for all the advice.

First of all I want to say thankyou to all the people who replied with support and advice, I appreciate it more than I can tell you. My mind is really scattered right now, and I haven't had any sleep, but I'll do my best to update as thoroughly as I can.

I still can't wrap my head around everything that has happened in the past 48 hours. A few posters suggested that I go to the address in the text message, and some said I should call the number, but instead I decided to follow her to work (since she left an hour early to ""go get the ring"") and talk to her before she started her shift. In hindsight, perhaps this way was not the most mature or calm, but I was so upset that she was lying to me and I wasn't thinking too clearly.

So I waited until she'd left the garage to ""go get the ring"" and them I followed her out with my car. By this point I was second guessing whether or not I should just wait until she got home to confront her and thinking I was acting too crazy and abruptly, but then I saw that she was heading in the absolute opposite direction to her work, and again I got that weird feeling in my stomach that something wasn't right.

I drove carefully behind, always keeping at least 3 cars between us for about 15 minutes and we reached the suburbs (she works in the city). At this point it started to click. Up ahead was a street that I recognised the name of, and my stomach did flips flops as I realised it was the one from the text message address. She was going to the address of whoever had contacted her last night. I was absolutely furious by this stage. I was struggling to keep my focus on my driving and I almost drove into a streetlight trying to stay hidden behind her.

She pulled up to the address and I pulled into a driveway a few houses down, hidden behind some high hedges. I could see clearly into her car as she was parked sideways. 10 minutes passed, and then someone came out of the house. My heart skipped about 5 beats seeing the door open, and then a wave of relief flooded me. It was a woman. Someone I had never seen before, but a woman nevertheless. Must be a new friend my fiancee made at the bar, who had invited her to a party after the hens night was over. All this relief and clarity made me feel so stupid for thinking badly of her for even a second. But then the woman got into my fiancee's car, and my fiancee leaned over her. At first I thought she was helping her close the passenger door which sometimes gets stuck, but then I realised she was kissing her. Full on, open mouth, passionate kissing. For what seemed like an hour but was probably only a few minutes. I felt like I couldn't breathe.

I can't really remember the rest of the day. I remember slowly reversing out of the driveway and driving home. I felt like I was on autopilot as I got home and got into bed. I don't know how I survived those 6 hours until her shift ended (I called her work and actually made sure she was rostered on for that evening and her manager said she was). When she got home I told her immediately that we need to talk. She had no idea I know about the ring in her bag or the woman in the car. This was 20 minutes ago, she's gone to pick up some late Chinese for us and I'm sitting here updating. I'm shaking and I feel so sick. I never expected anything like this and I'm not sure where to even begin. I know cheating is cheating and I will definitely call off the wedding until I know what this is all about.

She has never said anything about liking women, or being curious, or anything. I think I would be more than open to her experimenting, but not like this. Not behind my back. I feel so deeply betrayed.

Any advice is welcome, any support is welcome. Anyone ever had anything happen to them that is even remotely similar?

TL;DR: Followed fiancee to work, she went to the address I'd seen in the text message last night, turns out to be a woman. Woman and my fiancee share long passionate kisses in her car, while I'm sitting there watching from my car. Told her we need to talk.

**TL;DR**: Baby steps.


Hey /r/relationships, my amazing girlfriend is sleeping pretty good right now and I had some work I needed to finish, so I thought I would update you and let you know kind of where things are right now. 

I'd held off from talking to her too much about everything she had told me because she made it pretty clear she didn't want my opinion of her to change, or me to treat her like a ""weakling."" After making the post on here, and getting tons of information about PTSD, how to find her a therapist, and how to hopefully get this going in the right direction, I decided I needed to talk to her about seeing someone. 

Last night, she had another night terror. She hadn't had one in 2 days. We stayed up for a few hours talking once she was calm enough, and I decided I had to be honest with her about how I was feeling. 

I asked her if she would consider going to talk to someone *with* me. She got kind of pissed at first, and ranted about the first therapist she talked to. But after showing her the people in our area online using [this directory](http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/?tr=Header_TDLogo) that /u/Hazc sent me, she seemed to get a little more comfortable with it.

She said she wasn't ready to go in and talk to someone yet, because she was scared. She said it was really hard for her to open up to someone, even if I would be there, and that she wasn't sure yet. Then I asked if maybe she'd be interested in finding a support group. This didn't really click with her either until I explained that *if* she went to a group, she wouldn't have to speak, but she might be able to get to know some people who could recommend a therapist for her. This seemed to work.

After some googling, we found a group that meets 2 times a week that's only about 20-30 minutes away from here. What really seemed to make her happy was the group has a pretty active forum on their website. Since talking in person about it isn't easy for her, this was a pretty great find for her. 

We went back to bed, and today after she woke up, she posted on the forum, introduced herself, and mentioned she was considering coming to the group. She wants to get a feel for it first, but said she hopes maybe this Thursday she'll go. Since it's a women's only group, I can't go with her, but I told her I'll drive her and sit in the parking lot while she's there.

Also, some of you mentioned about how the depo shot might be linked to anxiety or making her anxiety worse. I brought this up with her, and she's a little hesitant to go off it since she's been on it for so long, but said she'll schedule an appointment with her gyno this week to talk about it. 

So... I know it won't be fixed over night, and I know we have to work on this and support each other. I feel a lot better knowing that her problem with seeing a psychologist isn't just something she'll rule out entirely, just that she doesn't know where to start, and has a huge problem opening up to people. She was afraid even if she found a good one, she'd just sit there not knowing where to start. 

I'm hoping that as long as she knows I'm backing her 100% in this, that that will hopefully give her the motivation to start working on this. 

Thanks so much you guys... I needed to get everything off my chest and I appreciate all the wonderful messages and comments you guys sent me. And for those of you who had more to say than just ""break up with her,"" because that's not going to happen over this... it's not her fault, it's not a flaw. 

And also, I'm sorry if I offended anyone with my comment about teen boys babysitting younger girls. I still, and probably never will, find that appropriate, especially after her story. But I didn't mean that boys aren't capable of taking care of girls, or that all of them are rapists or abusers, just that I would avoid that altogether with my children and make damn sure I knew who was babysitting my child.

This person she knows has been her friend since childhood, and he is physically disabled. She has been close to him in a non-sexual way, writing letters and talking online everyday to him for the last two years when he re-established contact.

Wel last month, he proposed to her. She accepted. She told me that she is going to do it and feels so strongly about it and won't change her mind. Ring and everything.

This marriage is going to be just in name, she says they won't actually live together or have any romance or sex. It more of a token than real thing. There are legal aspects of it as well she says are just not a big deal and won't be relevant. I do not want another man telling people she is his. I do not want to be in a polyamorous relationship or for her to eventually invite him to live with us or something like that (if he convinced her to marry him, who knows what else he can convince her of)

I also under no circumstance want to lose her. We have a perfect relationship for almost eight years. She never hinted that she'd want something like this. I even dumped her because of it, because I was hoping that would change her mind but she didn't, she called my bluff. I was such a wreck that I came back to her after one day, she said of course we are still together but she wants to me to meet him to put my mind at ease. Another thing I said is can she just do it for show, have a fake ceremony (she is set on an official marriage ceremony). I said do it for one week and then divorce and she said that's up to him. 

I don't think she is cheating, this guy is wheel chair bound and burned.  but *I* wanted to propose to her and I'm scared he might try to game her somehow. 

TLDR: She wants to marry her disabled friend in name only, out of pity. She wants to still be with me and is saying I am misunderstanding that it's not a real marriage.

Well, there hasn't been the type of magical closure I'm sure everyone was hoping for, but I can provide a bit of an update on the situation.  Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hpblr/i_21f_turned_my_little_brother_17m_in_to_the_dfcs/) for reference.

So within a week of the last post, a case worker randomly showed up at their home.  This was the first they heard about the investigation.  He called my husband's phone the morning of this because he couldn't find the place, so we knew it was coming, and sure enough... within a couple minutes of the case worker leaving, Mike called our mom, furious.

Basically, the investigator showed up, had them strip Bailey down so he could examine her (without giving them time to change the diaper that probably hadn't been changed in hours).  He walked through the house and property, taking pictures of the garbage piled up throughout, the plywood floor in Brady's room, the rat holes in the walls, etc.  He basically told them they had one week from that day to get it cleaned up and he'd be back to check.  Brady has been at his father's house a few states away for over a month now, so he wasn't present for this.

Mike and Alice also had a dog (one they had obtained for free from a grocery store parking lot) that was essentially starving to death because they couldn't afford to feed it.  They blamed the trash strewn throughout the yard on this dog, and the CW recommended rehoming her.  They had gotten bored with the poor thing (no longer new and exciting) so they sold her for $20 on Craigslist.  And then popped up literally the next day with a much smaller, new puppy, also from a parking lot giveaway.  Not extremely relevant, but illustrates their character and I had been hoping the CW would notice this irresponsible behavior as well.

Moving on to the next week; they conveniently scheduled Alice's doctor appointment for the day of the CW's return, so they were away from home and it's unclear if he came back or not.  Again, we were hoping this would prove they weren't taking it seriously.  A few weeks passed without us hearing anything, and we began to question whether the investigators even actually cared.

Then we heard that they had contacted Bailey's pediatrician and she wanted to see the baby before speaking about the case.  Mike and Alice came back from that appointment with reassurances that Bailey was now 10 lbs, 2 oz and the doctor said that was perfectly normal given her history (of being 2 weeks premature and having reflux).  This was my low point.  We have personally seen them *not* feed her regularly, but because she was born a little early no one was going to consider that she may also be neglected.  Never mind the fact that the CW apparently told them, word for word, that he just ""needs to see the boy when he gets back in town, to make sure he's alive, and he can close the case"".

Until yesterday... Please note that my details on this are a little patchy because I get the updates second-hand from others, and because Mike and Alice are selective about what info they reveal.  But I spoke with my mom and she mentioned that the pediatrician had changed Bailey's formula and wanted to see her once a week to check her weight gain.  They tried to postpone her appointment yesterday, and the pediatrician flipped and told them no way, that she needed to see her that day and that furthermore, they may want to pack some bags because she might be admitting her in the hospital!

I have no idea what snapped in the doctor's mind to make her realize this isn't normal, or if they were lying about her reaction previously, but I'm so glad she's doing something now.  She told them she wants them feeding her 4-6 oz. every 3 hours on the dot, and there will be weekly appointments until she's making progress.  At least now someone is paying attention, even if DFCS isn't going to do anything beyond the bare minimum investigation.  I'm hoping when the little boy returns, he will have similar nutritional guidelines placed.

So, all in all, not a huge happy ending, but there has been progress, and we fully intend to file another report at the first sign of more outright neglect (like leaving one of the kids unattended for hours, etc).  We also have others who are willing to report them also, if necessary.

The only other thing... she's been posting a lot of statuses like this recently:

""Everybodys got pregnant bellies and having babies....I know I'm still young but I extremely miss having a big belly! Hmmmm... I miss miss miss it. Babies are blessings from God you just can't have enough blessings. We love our two gorgeous children a gorgeous little girl and handsome and so smart little boy! I love my family.""

So... she's going to get pregnant again any day now and there's nothing anyone can do.  So there's that.  

TL;DR:  DFCS hasn't really accomplished anything, but the baby's pediatrician is insisting on weekly appointments and strict feeding until she puts on weight.  Mike and Alice still suck and want to have another baby soon.",Updates,False,,t5_2qjvn,1375207121.0,m-it updates,,True,t3_1jczw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jczw1/update_i_21f_turned_my_little_brother_17m_in_to/,

I talked to my parents, both at once. I started with ""Why are you letting Ryan's baby and gf move in when you wouldn't even let me talk about keeping the baby?""

They had reasons:
A) They felt that I would go onto college and be successful. Whereas they think that even if Ryan gave this baby up, he would simply have another one in a year

B) My depression made them hesitant to inflict that on anyone

C) ""How many grandchildren can we give away?""

D) They thought I would be pleased they were helping Ryan.

I explained to them that the idea of a baby living in the next room was like a hot iron. That I genuinely didn't know if I could cope. I can't even volunteer in the church nursery for an hour on sundays... and now there will be a baby at my place 24/7. I know trying to forget isn't the best strategy, but it's only been a year. I'm just not ready.

And my dad said that they didn't realize I would feel this way. That he thought I was content with my decision now. That I'd be happy? He said if he had known better he wouldn't have offered for her to move in, but whats done is done. That he doesn't break his word.

I reminded him that he told me he ""would not have any teenage kid of his raising a kid in his house."" And it disintegrated from there into a screaming match.

I am going to get a job and move out. I don't care if I have to drop my classes or take a semester off. I can't live in this house. I don't hate my parents really, I just can't live in here and watch my brother with his baby... It's too soon. And it will just make me wonder and question my choices.

He texted us the next morning saying he was at his dad's. And considering we needed to regroup, we let that stay for a little bit. I took the day off and picked him up this morning. He seemed really nervous and was waiting for me on the steps. 

I didn't bring it up until we got to the empty house (my wife and the youngest who isn't in school yet went out) but he did apologize immediately. When we got there, I asked him to sit down and had the most serious talk I've had with him since the bird and the bees.

He seemed embarrassed and tried to interrupt me by saying, ""I'm really sorry, can't we just forget about it?"". But I laid down the facts. First of all, it's not fair to Jonah and Rebecca that they have to live in all this disharmony because he can't follow reasonable rules.  I told him that he isn't a little kid and that kind of behavior could get him arrested. I also told him that it made me respect him less- because there was nothing decent about hitting someone who is smaller than you and loves you completely. 

I told him I know that he gets contradicting views from his dad about what being a man is, but that losing your temper and relying on being bigger than the person opposed to you isn't even close. I told him I didn't love him less, but I respected him less and that he would have to earn that back. 

I outlined his ""punishment"" (one me and his mom came up with together). His xbox, tv, ipod, and phone are not his until we see a change in his behavior. He is also grounded for a month, solid, with any excursions after that being dependent on what they are and how is is behaving. I encouraged him to spend this time with us as a family, but other than pulling out a deck of cards/board game on the weeknights and a redbox movie on the weekend, I won't force it.

I am forcing him to go spend his saturdays as a big brother for children who are victims of domestic violence. His counseling session will go on (his counselor showed appropriate dismay at the revelation and I think Connor has a dialogue with him and I worry about disrupt it). And on  thursdays, me and him will go to a father-son bible study and grab dinner- the focus is on becoming a strong man. 

He balked at all this. Said he was really sorry and would make it up to his mom but that he wouldn't have any free time and he would lose his friends.

But then, I showed him what his dad to his mom and he cried and said he would do whatever I wanted but he didn't want to be like him.

I worry I went soft, but I think that harsher reactions will always be available in the future, whereas maybe the softer ones won't. Who knows. Tonight we had dinner as a family and he was like the old Connor. Before dinner he wrestled on the trampoline with his brother and sister, then he insisted on cleaning up. Rather than whine about being bored like he usually would when grounded, he borrowed a book and read in the family room. I think he's trying. So we will too.

thanks.

tl;dr Had a serious talk, laid down some punishment and some new activities, and showed him what his dad did to his mom. He cried. We're all trying.

tl;dr I left and am so glad I did. Always always always trust your gut and fuck the creepers! Kindness should never be wasted on shitheads.

Thanks to all who responded. I GTFO'd on Sunday morning and am now staying at a hotel downtown. The internet didn't work there yesterday, or I would've posted an update sooner. A lot more street harassment in my new 'hood since it's tourist/expat-heavy, but no in-house harassment, haha. 

It's funny, I browse this reddit somewhat frequently and always shake my head when people are like ""my SO cheats on me, tells me I'm hideous, won't fuck me, spends all our money on crystal meth, kicks the dog, and pees in my shampoo. What do I do??"" and then goes ""but I don't want to break up!"" when the entire Internet tells them they obviously need to be done. I realized, reading that the entire Internet's consensus was to leave, that I WAS THAT PERSON. Humbling, but a good wake up call. Thanks to all of you for talking sense.

So the details. Three things happened on Saturday that convinced me to leave:

1) Realizing I smelled and my hair was greasy enough to cook an egg in, but that I couldn't bring myself to shower for fear of getting perved on, him knowing I was in the house, and having to leave my locked bedroom (the suite door was a clear sliding door that doesn't lock - not cool), and deciding I shouldn't anyway because if I ran into him it'd be safer to be repulsive. 

2) Not eating or drinking anything after breakfast because I didn't want to run into him getting food or even going out to buy bottled water (can't drink tap here) 

3) Reading all your responses. 

Sometime between choking down my malaria pill sans water and panicking when I heard the doorbell ring at the neighbor's house I realized that THIS IS FUCKING INSANE. I didn't even notice how freaked out I was until after I made a reservation at a hotel - the magnitude of the relief I felt alone was enough to know I'd made the right choice.

So Sunday morning, after like 3 hours of sleep, my host called me upstairs (the kitchen is on the roof, along with a patio) for lunch. I said I'd be up in a minute, packed up my shit, listened to make sure he was still on the roof, and left. At the time, I felt like such a coward for not speaking to him face-to-face about leaving, but after what happened next I'm glad I trusted my instincts about that, too.

I texted him in the taxi to the hotel: thanks for everything, but I'm leaving because our conversation on Friday made me very uncomfortable and I don't want to stay there alone with you. I will arrange with [the woman who handles the cleaning and rent money] to return the keys. He texted back immediately to say it was a huge misunderstanding, he'd only asked those questions ""pour alimenter la discussion"" (to help keep the conversation going) and he was sorry that I was so offended. SUCH BULLSHIT. I said I wasn't offended, I was disturbed. He texts back this masterpiece, the Platonic ideal of manipulative creep - ""OK fine. I know that nothing will happen to you with me. You're not the first client to have stayed here, but whatever. I've been a victim of my own goodness, my own desire to treat my client well. My apologies.""

I also wrote the woman I'd arranged this room with on Saturday to say I would need to stay elsewhere, thanks for everything. I gently implied that I expected a refund for the three weeks I won't be there. She said of course they understand but didn't address the refund part. I wrote back today to tell her about our text conversation and recommended that in the future she should probably warn female tenants about this kind of behavior, to let them know that they shouldn't hesitate to be very firm and direct about nipping it in the bud, and to maybe even consider booking female guests so that they're not alone to completely avoid this situation. Reading between the lines, of course, I was saying ""Your landlord is a creep, and please don't let this happen to anyone else.""

I do feel bad for them. He is a very good friend of theirs, and in their shoes I would feel heartbroken, worried, betrayed, and guilty - which they shouldn't, they were so sympathetic, talked to him about it, and didn't do anything wrong! As I finish up dealing with them, I'm trying to empathize with how it would feel to hear that a good guy friend of mine had aggressively hit on and peeping tom'ed one of my friends; it can't possibly be good. **So, I'm trying to go easy on them but still get my/my company's money back - tips for doing this would be very appreciated if you got 'em.**

Those of you who told me not to worry about my company and my coworkers were right on. Everyone at work has been unanimously supportive. I was so afraid that they'd think I was both overly sensitive and culturally insensitive, full of myself for thinking I was being hit on, or just not cut out for working abroad (this is my first big work trip). I am so relieved and feel bad for ever doubting their kindness and sympathy because every single last one has been so lovely: told me not to worry about the money because my safety has no price and that in my situation, they'd do exactly the same thing. One of my project managers kept in touch all weekend and even called (international, long distance, on her cell) when she didn't hear from me yesterday because of the hotel's internet situation. I feel so, so incredibly lucky to work for such kind, caring people. 

Better yet, my concerns about company policy re: international housing have been totally assuaged. It was precisely because I left when I sensed danger that people will be able to keep renting flats with/from locals if they want, since I've demonstrated that we are capable of exercising good judgment about our housing situations and handling problems transparently. So, unfortunate though it was, this was an important test case, and the official conclusion is that shit happens, do what you have to do, just tell us about it. Once again, go my company!

So yeah, everything is peachy now. Yesterday afternoon I devoured lunch (the entire bread basket was gone by the time my actual food arrived), went for a walk by the ocean, ate some ice cream, and watched the tide come in. I kept my window open all night because I'm on the 5th floor and I fucking can. I trusted my gut: I was really friendly and had great conversations with several people, women and men, who came up, introduced themselves, and didn't seem shady, just liked talking to people (people here are very outgoing and it's normal to strike up conversations with strangers, especially if it's clear you're not from here). I also told each and every scammer who came up to me on my walk with some sob story or ""gift"" to go fuck themselves, and they left me right alone - no more Ms. Nice Girl when I smell a rat.

I'm actually glad I had this experience relatively early in my stay. I'm glad I know my instincts won't fail me and to act on them sooner than later. I've learned that it's okay to come off as kind of bitchy - interactions between people with bad intentions and the people they prey on are truly a zero-sum game, every last round of which I intend to win. 

Going forward, I've decided to start being a bit more reserved with my male colleagues, and not to hesitate to express clearly and firmly that I am off the market and that where I come from it is very threatening and rude to continue to make advances on a woman when she says she's not interested. Not that this has been an issue, nor do I expect it to - the guys I work with are wonderful and respectful. But of course, I've also learned that you never can tell.

Thanks to everyone who gave advice and brought me to my senses. Y'all are the best.

Anyway, I want to say thank you for the outpouring of support and kind words. Luckily these aren't my only friends and 99% of the mutual friends we have with the ex are totally sane. I have no plans on seeing the bride-to-be again. 

My husband called up the groom-to-be and (plot twist) the groom had no idea this was going on.  Groom came over to our house and was equally Pissed at his fiancee. She spoke for him in the email and made it seem like it was a mutual decision. It wasn't. While at our house, groom called fiancee and asked WTF that was about. First she tried to play dumb until he told her that I showed him the email. She came clean, said she intended to address the invite that way, and ""didn't think it would be a big deal"".  What?  She said something about how she can't deal with change. Ok.

She eventually said I was invited in Claire's place and Claire plus husband will get their own invite. Groom was instantly on it: he laughed and asked her if she really thought that is why we were upset (that I was essentially NOT invited, instead of the blatantly obvious weirdo move of inviting a former couple). She pouted a bunch over the phone, asked why we were all ""ganging up"" on her, and told us all, groom included, to fuck off. 

Us three ended up having a fun night drinking beer and playing video games. 

I have no idea what groom is going to do. I wouldn't marry a selfish child like fiancee, but that isn't my choice to make.

I did this because she was having medical issues stemming from past domestic abuse and had no insurance.

Apparently I can't post this as an update because of some rule... it's fine. I'd advise anybody to look through my past submissions (I don't think i can post them on here) if you are interested in what happened about a month ago. But apparently this is a **different** issue.

Things were going very well except I started developing feelings for her. I was afraid of scaring her, or making her feel unsafe, but reddit convinced me to take the plunge. Now I'm happily dating my wife.

Hey everybody! i hope your workday is going well. My day has been crazy. Everything has been going wonderfully lately, though. It was somewhat strange at first explaining it to our friends and family, but most of them had already caught on... including my sons, who act as if nothing has changed. I'm pretty sure the little fuckers knew the entire time.

Anyways, last night I came home and Cass was out of it. dinner was burnt (which is no big deal, I can't really cook well or anything, but it's out of character), and she was drinking (lightly, only one or two glasses of wine). i asked her what was wrong, obviously I was concerned, and she told me that her ex-boyfriend (Shithead, 30, male) got parole last week. I was flabbergasted, since she should have been able to tesify at his parole hearing I believe. Apparently the crime that he was incarcerated for was unrelated to the abuse (which I had always assumed was the reason), but Cass had been (1) assured it would put him away for a decade at least and (2) had been far too afraid to testify against him or press charges.

apparently he'd been arrested for this felony, and when he was being held, he asked her to post bail, but instead she asked my first wife for help moving out and moving on.

I don't know what to do, I don't think that we have any legal ways to put him back into prison. She knows that she should have gone to the police and is guilt ridden and upset about it now. I know that she's going to be safe, because if he tries to even contact her, I'll **take a legal recourse of action to make sure that he doesn't so much as touch her**. I've taken off work today, but promised that even when I go back, I'll have my buddies stopping by throughout the day.

But I don't know how to make her feel safe. I've contacted my lawyer about filing a restraining order, and he said it shouldn't be too hard, but she's a mess. I just don't know how to make her believe that she's 

I doubt this piece of shit will come around, but I know what I'm going to do if he tries.

So me and my girlfriend have been living together for over three years now, and we've been going out for over four. We've so compatible it's unbelievable. Even after four years, we're still affectionate to one another, we listen to each other, compromise, and the sex is great. She's all around a great person. She, like me, is previously divorced (she was married for 12 years, me for 22), but unlike me, she doesn't have any kids. 

I have two kids, both 24. My son is moved out, but my daughter, on the other hand, is a totally different story... Me and my ex wife somehow totally screwed up on her, and I don't know what to do.

First, she doesn't work. In the past three years, she's had a handful of jobs that lasted a week or two here and there, but she soon gets fired for lateness or absenteeism, then goes back to being unemployed for 4-5 months. It's not that she can't get a job, she just doesn't apply for them AT ALL. I give her a house to stay in, food eat, I let her drive a decent car, and I maybe give her a dollar or two every week or so (hoping she'll use it for gas money to go get a job.) I recently shut off her cell phone, but she's just using the house phone.

On top of this, she's turned into a bitch. I hate to use that word about my daughter, but she is a complete and total bitch. She parades about the house like it's her own, literally screaming at me if I take a day off of work about how, I ""need to fucking leave"" so she can have the house to herself. Our A/C is shot right now and she's was up in her room, literally, throwing a fit and screaming how I ""need to get the fucking air conditioner fixed,"" and calling me all the names in the book. 

All kinds of stuff that me and my girlfriend buy for ourselves go missing. Toilet paper, hidden stashes of chips, change jars, and laundry baskets are some of the most common victims. She has two cats she's kept in her room for years (they're practically feral and attack me and my girlfriend's cat when they're let out), so cat litter and cat food go missing all the time.

I've been begging my ex wife to let our daughter move in with her, but her apartment doesn't allow pets of any kind, so my daughter won't go until those cats are gone.

**The Story**

So my daughter has been absolutely awful lately. The bitchiness has increased tenfold, and there's no sign of her getting a job or getting better. There's a *lot* of drama in the house. I mean a *ton*. My girlfriend is definitely not a confrontational person and she's growing very, very irritable. 

And I was completely understandable when she told me today that if my daughter doesn't move out in a month, *she* will be moving out, because she can't stand all the yelling and drama with my daughter and ex wife. I really don't know what to do... I just want my daughter *to get a job.* She's welcome to live in my house if she'll get a job, but I don't think it's going to happen.

I just don't know how to *force* my daughter out. I don't want to call the police to get her out. And I don't know what to do about the cats, because I'm not keeping them. There's just a clusterfuck of problems here and I don't know what to do.

And god knows I love my girlfriend and want her here.

**TL;DR** -- 24-year-old daughter doesn't work and acts like this is her house and causes a lot of drama. GF is understandably sick of the drama and gave me an ultimatum: either I kick my daughter out or my girlfriend is moving out. I don't know who to pick. I just want to live with my girlfriend and my daughter get a job and maybe eventually move out on her own.

First off, I wanted to say thank you to everybody who responded. I appreciate the advice, and it really did help. Even those of you I didn't agree with, I appreciate. We all react to different situations in different ways, and I am genuinely thankful for ALL input.

Now on to the update:

I already had plans to go over to his place last night, which was good. I thought it would be better to have the conversation in person. I had brought it up to him once before, but I don't think I was very clear in explaining what was bothering me and it came off like I was angry he was having lunch with Lindsey, instead of me being upset he was paying for it.

This time, I had a much better idea of what I was going to say to explain my feelings. I told him that it bothered me that he was spending money for somebody else to go out to lunch when she could easily afford it herself. I also did the math for him (thanks to whoever suggested that one) and showed him how that $10-$20 bucks a week could add up over the course of a year.

He actually admitted to me that he and his other male coworker had discussed the fact that they were kind of uncomfortable paying for her every day. A couple of the commenters hit it on the head. She was just kind of passive with the bill the first time they went out, didn't put her card down when they did, and it was around the time of her birthday so they didn't think anything of it. Then it kept happening. At that point they felt awkward about bringing it up.

He agreed that it was time to put a stop to it. He and his coworker had already essentially decided that they needed to tell her to pay her own way, or stop coming with them, and I think that my talking to him gave him the extra push to go ahead and get it over with.

All in all, it went well. Thanks again for the help guys!

tl;dr-Talked to my boyfriend, he was already planning on telling his coworker that she needs to pay her own way.

**EDIT: UPDATE TO THE UPDATE** BF just sent me a text on the way back from lunch. Guess who picked up her own check today? Apparently the other guy's wife had been complaining about it, too. They spoke up, told her money is tight, and she can continue to come with them, but she has to pay her own way.

I accepted the offer.

After reading a lot of thoughtful posts in this thread, consulting friends and family and spending two sleepless nights debating with myself, I came to the conclusion that I just did not do a good job taking the time to understand where my fiancée's feelings were coming from and it was making it difficult to communicate. Both of our hardline stances on the situation were borne out of fear: my fear of never getting a shot like this again and her fear of what the move might do to our relationship.

I came to her with this and told her that I wanted to talk through this fear and reassure her that a move like this would not change my feelings about us and why this opportunity was so important. We both apologized for being so emotionally rash and quick to judge the situation without having all of the facts.

She's going to give a longer-distance relationship a shot! We've mapped out a skeleton of a plan to make sure visits are as frequent as possible, but she is not planning to explore other schools in the area because she's quite fond of her program in St. Louis. I have about three weeks until my first day, so we still have some time together to do more work before I hop on my mount and ride it out to SoCal.

I cannot thank this community enough for the outpouring of thought and care that went into the discussions in that thread. If it weren't for you, I don't know if I would have been able to figure out how to approach this situation and reach this conclusion. You are truly amazing individuals and I'm forever in your debt.

tl;dr: Took the offer. Explained to fiancée that I did a shit job understanding her fear associated with long distance. Took the time to understand her and apologize for being rash. We're going to give it a shot. I have a sweet-ass mount that I'm riding to SoCal. K THANKS BAI!

Okay, so after my last post and the amount of comments I got I decided to send him a message saying we needed to talk. It didn't turn out very good.

He asked what I wanted to talk about, and I said us, which made him extremely mad. He said he was coming over and I told him not to. He said he was still coming over and started saying I wasn't allowed to leave him and I was his, which really scared me. I contacted a redditor asking what to do and they told me to call a friend and get the fuck out of there as fast as possible. He got there before my friend did, and since he had a spare key to my apartment there was only the chain on the door stopping him from getting in. I had turned all the lights off, pretending I wasn't there and waited for my friend so I could sneak out of a window.

I'm now at a friends house, I've talked to the police, and I'm fine. He knows I've talked to the police and I'm hoping it will make him stay away. I haven't been back yet, so I don't know if he got in or not, but I'm just glad I got out before he got in. I'm still extremely shaken up by everything that happened, and I don't even want to think about what could have happened if I had stayed.

So thank you reddit, thank you for the overwhelming amount of comments and messages I got, and thank you for helping me see that this wasn't right.

Should I give up hope?,angrygirlfriend6294,662,134,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1icew4/update_i_28f_dont_think_my_boyfriend_30m_will/,"So my original post did not get much attention, but here is the link

 http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i63gw/i_28f_dont_think_my_boyfriend_30m_will_ever_be/

It took about two days to work up the courage to speak to my boyfriend. In my original post I didn't really explain our relationship and I think I gave some people the wrong idea about him. While he does believe in traditional gender roles, and I don't, he is not mean about it. He has never tried to put me in my place. We have a great relationship and we rarely fight. Those occasional fights are vicious, but we always resolve them that day. We never go to bed angry. Also, I don't want to get married because all of my friends are doing it. That's just silly. I was just saying that watching all these other people get married was frustrating. 

Okay so I sat him down, I asked him what his plans are for us. That he used to talk about us getting married all the time and now I'm not so sure if that's what he still wants. He tried to yes me again, but I told him to cut the shit and tell me what's up. Marriage or not, we should be able to talk to each other. So he tells me he doesn't know how he'd give me what I deserve. He doesn't believe that I don't care how or where we do it. That I should get this big elaborate wedding even though we can't really afford it. He feels like a piece of shit because of it. Also the part about his dad is true. His dad will not accept our marriage as valid.  

So I suggest a secret wedding. Just us with one guest each. We go down to city hall and then go for dinner afterward at the fanciest restaurant we can think of. My parents are dead so that's not really a problem for me. My sister can be my one guest. He looked relieved. A huge weight was lifted off his shoulders. Our five year anniversary is in October and that's when we will take the leap. Instead of a big wedding, we will be spending the money we have been saving up on a nicer honeymoon. 

I've also asked that he be more up front with me. He avoids the small problem by not talking about it at the time, but it only gets worse after I am disappointed. We'll see how that goes but for now I am no longer an angry girlfriend.

Thank you everyone for your input, thoughts, and kind words for the family. Well, I went to the funeral. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to witness. I got there and standing in the doorway were the two saddest people I have ever seen in my life. They looked empty and just a shell with no life. I went and hugged my friends and we all just cried. Everyone in the funeral home gathered around because we were so loud in our sorrows. She kept screaming in wasn't fair and she didn't know why this happened to her. My other friend (who is the father) cried as well and just hugged both her and I. A baby that was so full of life and would grow up with my son is gone.....just, gone. She told me to hold my son tight, never let him go, cherish every moment, every burp, gurgle, and coo. She told me to promise her to do that as the tears streamed down her grief stricken face. I cupped her face in my hand, lifted up her head, looked her in the eyes, and promised my son would always know who his best friend was. Her child will never be forgotten nor ignored. I handed her the little stuffed animal that played a prayer and she hugged it tight. She again began to cry and fell back into my arms. I lost it. Cried uncontrollably to the point where we both were hyperventilating. I have never felt someone so hopeless, so full of unanswered questions, disbelief, and heartache in my arms. When I got home I held my son, whom is only a few days apart from the child I had to say goodbye to just hours earlier, and I didn't let him go the entire night. 

Love your children, family, and friends everyone. You never know when that could be the last time you see them.

TL;DR Was worried about going to funeral at the thought of hurting my friends further since their child that died was only days older than mine. Worried about how they would react to me there even though they said they wanted me to attend. I went, we cried, held each other, vented, and I feel like our friendship is not in jeopardy anymore.

I finally said it to her today. I was hanging out with her at her house and she asked me to go get something for her. When I said I would she said ""I love you"", but it didn't feel genuine. I said ""I love you too"" and walked off to get what she had asked me too.

I wanted to say it again to her to see her reaction since the first time didn't seem genuine. ""Under the Milky Way"" by The Church was playing (which helped set the mood actually) and she walked over an sat next to me while I was laying down. She started gazing at me and I said ""I love you"" to her.

As soon as I said it she froze and stared at me. My first thought was she didn't feel the same way about me. After a couple seconds of silence she whispered to me ""Do you really mean that?"" I said I'd never lie to her about that. She started kissing me and tearing up and said it back to me. We were talking about it and she told me she wanted to say it a few times too but was in the same situation as me, worrying about what I'd say or if it was too early to say it, etc.

So I originally wanted to work things out and stay with the guy. I was being dumb (especially for putting up with it for so long and not dumping him sooner), and reddit had no shame in pointing that out. Thanks, guys!

This morning I woke up to him being pissed off about a relationship status change on facebook (that happened about two months ago). It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I spent all day yesterday stewing over the perfect way to just let go and get him out. He did it for me this morning.

He came upstairs raising hell about us not being 'engaged' on facebook. Mundane shit. Really just a completely immature overreaction to something that didn't even matter. So I let him let it all out about how pissed he was that no one thinks we're engaged, omg omg omg. 

I rolled my eyes at him.

He got even more upset.

I told him to leave and he did. So I used the time that he was gone to pack his shit up and put it all outside in the driveway. He got home and started slamming things around so I stood up, walked outside and called the police.

They got here and he had the nerve to say that he was going to take our son. I objected and told them that he has no place to go, no carseat, no diapers, no clothes, no shoes, no jacket, no bed, no bottles, toys, formula, food, etc. He literally has nothing for that boy and I don't think he should be able to take him. The police agreed and told him to go buy all of the necessary things and come back. Haven't seen him since, but I'm happy he's finally gone. 

I immediately called the landlord and had him removed from the lease. I called a few of the resources that you wonderful redditors have provided, and I'm making progress toward getting my life back in order. Good news is- I may have a job already! Now I just need to figure out child care and transportation. 

Thank you so much, reddit. Without the smack in the face to get things going, I would have been stuck in a living hell for who knows how long. I appreciate all of you (even you jerks with your tough love).

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who posted on the original thread. Good or bad, your comments were eye-opening and I appreciate the time you took to show how things look like from your perspective.

Well, it took a lot of hemming and hawing and foot-dragging on my part, but a month ago I finally confronted her (against the advice of just about everyone on the original thread, I know). There were tears shed, apologies made, and for a while I thought everything was going to be a-okay.

...until last Friday when I discovered that she had not deleted her account on this certain social networking site and still maintains contact with just about everyone she had an emotional and sexual connection with.

Being the doormat that I was, I demanded that she delete all her online profiles that contained her clan mates as contacts. She refused, claiming I was making a mountain out of a molehill and she hadn't done anything wrong ever since the initial confrontation. After some more prodding, she changed her tune and wanted me to wait *until fucking Christmas* so she can greet this one guy a happy birthday and send the rest of them Christmas greetings.

That did it. I snapped. I mean, c'mon! Who was she kidding? I immediately helped her pack her stuff, took her to a cab, and took her to her parents' house. While there, we argued some more - she insisted that she hadn't done anything wrong, and that she really just wanted to be friends with these guys and that I should trust her more. Right, I've heard all that before. I kept insisting that she cut off contact with them, but she just wouldn't budge. After a few hours I decide it was all pointless and made my way home.

It's been two days now, and so far she calls me everyday to check how I'm doing. Her family hates me now though. As far as they're concerned, I'm the guy who sent their little angel home because she wouldn't delete her online accounts. Little bitch had been feeding them an edited version of the story and conveniently neglected to mention all the cam sex/chat sex and the emotional relationships she'd been having online. Welp, not that it matters anymore.

Admittedly, I miss her terribly. But after the mind-boggling amount of disrespect I've had to endure in that relationship, I figured anything's got to be better.

So. Facebook's gone. Phone company will take a couple of days to get my number changed. I'm about to hit the gym in a few minutes, and I've signed up for fencing and kendo classes in my area. 

Anything's got to be better than this.

**TL;DR: finally got it over with, told the ex the jig is up. She insists on keeping contact with her online flings despite giving the whole thing between us another chance. Kicked her out.

I'm a creepy pedo or b.) have an inappropriate relationship with my daughter.,tonnesand,645,120,326,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jz1zj/me_30m_and_my_smallyoungerlooking_girlfriend_30f/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for four years and have lived together for two. We lived in a rather small town. We'd known each other most of our lives before we became close and eventually started dating. Most of the people back home knew us so none of this was a problem.

Recently we moved after she received a great job offer in a much larger city. We bought a condo together, I got a new and decent job for myself, and we began talking seriously about finally getting married.

The problem is that my girlfriend is 4'10"" tall, weighs just over 80lbs, and can easily pass herself off as a teenage girl still. This wasn't a problem back home where practically everybody knew us but here it's gotten ridiculous.

I'm 6'2"" tall, weigh about 220lbs., and look every bit my 30 years of age (receding hairline, wrinkles, a newfound need of glasses, etc). She on the other hand does look quite young. I can't argue that. Hell my neice, who just turned 14, looks older.

The following things have happened lately that have really been putting a lot of stress on our relationship. So much so that all discussion of marriage has ceased and there seems to be a huge level of tension between us:

1. She has been pulled over *twice* with me in the car by cops who thought she was too young to be driving. Each time the cops have treated me like a pervert and a criminal, taking me out of the car and asking me how I know her, detaining us both long enough for them to run her name and mine through their computers, all that crap. 

2. On 4th of July our condominium held a fireworks event in lieu of allowing its residents of having their own celebrations. The GF and I thought it would be a great way to meet our new neighbors so we attended. I overheard at least three separate people making comments like ""that's disgusting"" or ""we should call the police"" just for holding her hand/lightly kissing her.

3. Our complex's manager came by shortly after that event to ask us the nature of our relationship. Nevermind the fact that both of our names are on the lease, this ass-hat wanted proof of my girlfriend's age and identity.

4. Some internet hero, probably someone who lives in the complex, printed out a real ""missing children"" flyer of a girl who is NOT my girlfriend but who looks sort of like her, and posted a bunch of them around the complex. The cops actually paid us a visit because of that. One of them even told me they'd received dozens of calls about it.

5. According to my GF, back when we were talking more openly at least, she had been stopped several times by our neighbors who asked if she was in need of ""help"" and whether or not I was related to her/did she know me/why was she with me/etc.

6. At my new job my manager told me to remove the picture I had on my desk of me and my girlfriend. Because we were holding hands in it and some co-workers of mine had said it was ""inappropriate"". When I told my manager it was just a picture of me and my girlfriend he honestly asked me how old she was and when I told him he obviously didn't believe me. He then said to take it down anyway even though I'm far from the only person in the office with such pictures on their desks. Since then he has been treating me like shit as are most of my co-workers.

The ironic thing is that GF is technically older than me. But she really does look like a kid I guess and her only problem with that is that I have a problem with that. She finds most of these incidents funny and doesn't seem to understand how much it bothers me. No matter how I try and explain it to her she just says the old ""You shouldn't care about what other people think"" line or some variation. 

We're drifting apart because of this. She sees it as a problem in my own head and is frustrated that I can't just get past it. Meanwhile I resent her for not understanding how upsetting all this shit is to me. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to go out in public with her and when we do I certainly don't want to do so much as hold her hand.

I don't know what to do except possibly move back home. I know she doesn't want to do that especially over something like this but I'm sick and tired of being seen as a freak or a pervert for being with her. I am in complete love with her but I honestly don't think I can take much more of this shit.

I am a 26M, she is now 28.  

To summarize: Approximately a year and a half ago, I discovered my wife, together for just under 7 years and married for less than 90 days, was having an affair with her personal trainer who was also recently married and just had a child.  I came to /r/relationships with a question about whether to tell the wife or not.  After getting some good advice on pros/cons, I went ahead and told his wife.  They were understandably upset, husband claimed I had not guts.  His wife decides to stick it out with him.  

Following this, I was informed that my wife was pregnant with his kid.  

So, here comes the update:  My wife is now officially my ex-wife as of last thursday.  The process was long, difficult, but ultimately I am glad it is all done.  There was some confusion when the lawyer put the wrong names on the paperwork that went to the judge and that took a bit of revision.  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders- freedom.  

My ex-wife gave birth to a healthy baby girl in December or so I'm told- may she be rendered many sleepless nights.  

I have not heard from or seen the personal trainer.  Still a douchebag, I suspect.    

I am dating a new girl now, I like her alot, and we will see if it goes somewhere.  I learned a lot from this experience and its been helpful in this relationship in terms of setting ground rules and expectations.  I don't know if things will work out with this one or not, but overall, I'm positive.  Dating at first was very awkward trying to get around the stigma of me being married but separated.  

I bought a condo, took a few trips.  I have continued to box, and am getting decent now.  I have also picked up brazilian jiu jitsu.  I'm active now, probably far more active than I have have been in my life.   I feel great, and I look great (in my own mind at the very least).

**BACKSTORY**
----

So, I was able to have a perfect opportunity to talk to him in said ""special spot"" mere days after I had received all of the advice /r/relationships had to give. I was ready to tell him.

In a good spot in the middle of our talking trek across the sand, I had him sit down, and told him that this was an important conversation.  ""Brad,"" as I'll continue calling him, seemed nervous. I started.

""I know that you'll be able to keep a secret. It's really important.""

""Yes, yes! What is it?""

Okay, here goes, I thought. I ummed.

""Tell me! Please!""

Despite how much I wanted to tell him previously, something suddenly stirred inside of me. There was some kind of force that held me back and made it feel like what I was supposed to admit was incredibly wrong. The words ""I'm gay"" couldn't possibly exit my mouth. Despite how many years I've wanted to tell him, this very moment I couldn't say a word. I was speechless for a good ten seconds.

I turned it into a joke, as if I was just trying to annoy him. He laughed, and admitted that he was quite nervous that there was actually something wrong. We continued along our trek. 


A few days later, we went out to the same spot to do our usual exploration. It was a very sunny day this time, almost a perfect place and time to come out.

I didn't, again.

And another bright day almost a week later, I worked up to it just as I had before, and words couldn't come out at last second. I worried that he would grow away from me, thinking I was a weird fag, and hang out with me less and less. I didn't want to lose Brad as a friend. I turned it into the same joke. 


**TODAY**

----

Today, I woke up with a realization that I really couldn't keep this locked up anymore. I texted him that I wanted to go explore today. He agreed.

It was forecast with a wind that told us it would storm soon. We took our bikes out on a back way to get near our usual spot. We had a good conversation while on our forty-five minute ride and trek. Then I told him to sit down with me by the water. He agreed only when I told him it was a real serious conversation, something we never had. 

""The thing I've been avoiding telling you is...""

I rethought the entire plan, again. Every uncertainty rushed into my mind at the same time flooding me with doubt.

I blurted it out. ""...I'm gay.""

It took him a long time to actually grasp that I was serious. It must have been five minutes until he finally spoke again. He asked me questions, mostly if I was sure. I told him that I was, and how I was faking the crushes and dates for all those years. 

Surprisingly, he cried. He told me that he never had anyone confide in him before, that he thought nobody really trusted him. He said he was afraid of change. I ensured him that I wasn't going to be any different. I never liked *him* like that, I won't become feminine, and things will stay the same. He just knows something important about me.

I didn't want to scare him too much, so I spared him most of the details about me actually being gay. I just said that I liked normal boys, nobody feminine, instead of girls. I told him that the magic that I saw in Disney movies between a boy and a girl never really existed between me and a girl. I only saw it between a boy and another boy. I only told him barely enough to make him positive that I was homosexual, and that I wasn't joking around. 

He was so accepting and so nice. We paced back and forth about fifty times on a small stretch of sand trying to fully understand each other. He told me that he thought since he was ""girl crazy"" (his words, not mine) this time in his life, I must be the same. He never said the words aloud, gay or anything, but wasn't clear that I was definitely gay. I reassured him that I was. He said that no matter what, he would be there for me. He really said that. He thanked me for trusting him, and said he would never tell anybody. (""Who would I tell, anyway?"") I said that I just wanted one person on Earth to know that I'm gay and be cool with it, and he said that he'd be that one person. We awkwardly bro-hugged. 

And then after that? Everything was back to normal. We joked around, and rode back to his house. It started raining before we were halfway there, and we got lost. Everything was as usual, but we somehow came out of it to be even closer best friends.

**tl;dr: After waaay too much hesitation, I finally told my longtime best friend that I was gay at 1:45 pm today, on June 18. He actually cried, not me, and was super supportive. After that? Everything's better than normal.**

Hey guys

I read every comment and I gained a better perspective from your experiences.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) we decided to go our separate ways. The decision was mutual. While were content together at the time, we didn't see true happiness in the future.

There is a reddit user who said it was important to salvage the future and don't worry about the past. I agree with that statement. We had simply grown too far apart.

It is amazing how much religion affects relationships. My ex and I were happy together. It's funny how what you believe in *after* you die can make such a huge effect in a relationship in *current* life. I mean, come on. That's *after* this life. 

I am now in support of the separation of church and relationships. Hehe

Am I overreacting?,ughmypoorbaby,613,102,417,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10s4wf/my_f28_motherinlaw_f55_pierced_my_daughters_ears/,"I've been married for ~4 years and am the mother of a 8 month old daughter, Annie. I'm a first time mother but I don't think I'm overly paranoid or anything.

Last Friday, MIL asked if she could pick up Annie early from day care so she could spend time with her. I said sure. This isn't the first time she's done that and it's never been a problem.

In the evening I go to pick up my daughter from her house and notice her ears are pierced. I ask my MIL why she thought that it was okay to do that without my permission. She had asked about earrings in the past and I had told her that I wasn't going to put my baby in pain for something cosmetic. Also I think babies look weird with earrings.

She said I should thank her, because I didn't see my baby in pain. Apparently my baby's pain only exists when I'm there to see it. I told her she had absolutely no right to go against my feelings on the matter.

She said because I told her she could pick my daughter up from day care, I was trusting her to make the decisions and this is the one she made. I was further enraged when I found out my daughter's ears had been pierced at some cheap jewelry store in the mall. If I were going to pierce her ears, I'd have taken her to somewhere with professional piercers.

When I told my husband about it, he was furious with his mother. He called her to tell her so and she said that I was turning him against her. He told her that he was removing her from the list of approved pick-up people at Annie's day care because he didn't trust Annie with her anymore.

My MIL sent me a half-assed apology on FB saying she still wants to spend time with Annie and didn't expect me to have such a dramatic reaction.

I don't know what to do. I'd hate to start a family feud, but I really don't trust her with my daughter anymore.

TL;DR: My MIL pierced my baby's ears without permission

Edit: I've added the ""apology"" note for anyone who wants to read it.

- I know that your mad at me and I want you to know that was never my intention. I love Annie with all my heart and you know I would never do anything that would hurt her. When Mill [my husband] said he didn't want me to see Annie anymore it broke my heart and that's just not fair. [note: My husband never said she couldn't see Annie, just that she couldn't be alone with her] I never imagined you would react so dramatically. I feel like I'm being treated like a child abuser. It also hurts that you apparently think I'm not entitled to any say over my granddaughter. It takes a village to raise a child. Once again, I did not mean to upset you and hope we can move past this.

I want to thank everyone that gave me kind words and supported me in telling my boyfriend and in urging me to go see a doctor. I was extremely upset yesterday and just knowing that some people cared enough to try and help me out made me feel a lot better about the situation I was in. As for those people who called me a liar and an awful person, I honestly don't know why you wasted your time typing words to try and make me feel even worse; luckily you were highly outnumbered by the kinder folks of reddit. 

I had lunch with my bf and told him all of the details that I recalled from the evening, apologized for my actions and for becoming so intoxicated. I explained to him that I would understand if he wanted to leave me or if he did stay that I know it would be hard for him to ever trust me in the same way again. He reacted way better than I had expected, was a bit hurt that I was not honest from the beginning but understands that I was scared and needed time to think. His next response was anger towards his friend and then he continued to tell me that said friend had a few weird encounters like this back in college and was put on probation from their fraternity for it. I was extremely glad I came clean and lucky that my bf has been so supportive of the situation. 

He took the afternoon off of work so that he could go with me to the doctor because he knew I would probably be too upset/embarrassed to share all the details with my doc if I was there by myself. I was tested for STDs and nothing came back positive today but I guess some of the other cultures can take a bit longer to come back; I'm hoping they will all be good news as well. 

My Dr. suggested that I get both a blood and urine test to see if there were any substances still in my body. At the time the only prescription drug I am on is birth control pills and I haven't taken any over the counter drugs at all in at least a month. Turns out, Temazepam was present in my urine culture, sounded like some crazy disease to me so I was at first extremely freaked out that I had caught some crazy virus. My doctor went on to explain to us that Temazepam is the generic name for a hypnotic sleep aid more commonly known as Restoril. I have never consumed any sleep aid beyond Tylenol PM or Nyquil in the past so I then knew this wasn't something I had taken myself. Some of the side effects can be confusion, sedation and has strong amnesiac properties. Guess that explains why I have no recollection of my evening. 

I did some more research when I got home and it turns out that temazepam is a pretty commonly used drug for date rape. I am still unaware of whether or not this friend had sex with me because I don't have any memory of it and my doctor said any evidence of it had been washed away since I showered after the event.

 I am now feeling extremely violated, especially for this to have been done by someone my bf has know for so long. My bf is currently infuriated and wants to take legal action, but idk what can be done if there is no physical trace of a sexual encounter. Thank you to everyone that urged me to go get tested, I figured it was a lost cause since it had been too long ago, but apparently the amount in my system was high enough that it remained there for a longer period of time. Without the encouragement of this forum I may have just informed my bf and then never gotten tested for anything so I cannot express enough gratitude for all the thoughtful posts. I am relieved to know that I was not the one to bring myself to such a point of inebriation that I could not even remember hours of my evening. 

I am kind of a wreck right now and have a lot of emotions to sort out but I am fortunate that my bf is being extremely supportive and is trying to help me work through them. He also suggested that I should maybe see a therapist if there are still things about that evening that I would rather talk to someone else about, so I may look into doing that.     

Sorry this turned out to be such a long post, I couldn't stop myself from typing so much. Again, a huge thanks to everyone that helped me through this situation, idk what I would be doing right now if I had not decided ti post this here. And to those of you who claimed I was lying, please do not be so quick to judge next time, especially when you really know very little about the character of the people involved.

1368460345.0,506,self.relationships,1e9032,UPDATE: My Boyfriend [M26] of 4 Months Revealed to Me [F23] That He is a Post-Op Transsexual,throwninthedark,669,163,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e9032/update_my_boyfriend_m26_of_4_months_revealed_to/,"This is an update of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e0y13/my_boyfriend_m26_of_4_months_revealed_to_me_f23/) post.

First and foremost I'd like to thank everyone who read and responded to my post! I got back many helpful comments that I would've been lost without. Because of my situation, I was not at liberty to discuss it with friends and family but the /r/relationships' community was there for me and for that I will be forever grateful!

So, on to why we're really here

After apologizing we set a time to talk on Saturday. We met up in a coffee shop and after sitting in quiet for nearly five minutes we started to talk (I'd never been so nervous in my life). I started by asking him why he'd waited so long to tell me and he answered by explaining that he was scared to lose what we have because he really likes me but he didn't think it'd be a huge issue and there had never been the right time. He went on to say that though his family took his revelation well when he first started the process in 2011, he had lost a few friends along the way. I didn't feel like this excused him for waiting four months to tell me but I understood nevertheless. I couldn't fault him for his fear and I didn't say anything against it as there had been times when I shut up about something important when I shouldn't have.

The first half of the conversation consisted mostly of me asking a lot of questions about him. Like when did he know he was meant to be a man (which didn't sit well with him, he said it was something that was always inside him, something that he'd always known and he thought the question was stupid. Honestly I was just trying to get to know him better) and did he have any regrets after the surgery? The conversation wasn't nearly as stunted or awkward as I'd thought it would be and I really enjoyed learning so much about him. It's not often that I'm allowed to get to know a person that way so that's something I'll hold with me dearly for the rest of my life.

Eventually we got to our relationship. I told him that I'd have rather been informed before four months but I got that it was something that lay heavy on his mind and was hard to say. I explained that I felt like I was lied to and, though it was not his intent, felt pressured into staying because I care about him so much. Luckily the place we were at was pretty empty because there were some tears shed. I let him know that I'd been very distressed in the days since he'd told me and I'd avoided him because I simply didn't know what to do.

Ultimately, I decided that a romantic relationship with a transsexual person is not one I am comfortable having at this time in my life. I did a lot of soul searching like several comments suggested and I realised that my perception of gender and sexuality has a lot of expanding to do before I can conquer the doubtless struggles such a relationship would face. We parted on sad terms and agreed that it'd be best to cut contact for at least a few weeks or months until we felt that we'd be able to be friends without any conflicting emotions. I know without a doubt that he is someone I want to have in my life and I look forward to our reunion.

In this last week alone I've learned so much about transsexualism, transgender individuals, and myself. I'm glad I had the opportunity to open my eyes and become more exposed to and aware of different people's thoughts and opinions. In the long run, I believe that this will help me in becoming a more accepting and understanding human being. The best I can do is try.

Until next time friends, be good to yourselves.

And be good to each other.

**TL;DR I am not comfortable being in a relationship with a transsexual individual right now. Ended a 4 month relationship on sad terms but both parties [F23 and M26] hope to be friends in the future after we have healed.**

*Edit: I think it would be fair for me to add that I don't know if I will ever be comfortable being in a romantic relationship with a transsexual/transgender individual because I wouldn't be able to bring myself to be intimate with them.*

*I've seen it a couple of times already so I'm just going to go ahead and ask that we all keep the name calling to a minimum. People can choose to not become romantically involved with anyone for any reason. A few of the users have tossed the words ""bigot"" and ""transphobe"" around at other users for simply having opinions that differ from their own. We do not know each other well enough to make such assumptions and say such horrible things.

I want to thank everyone for the advice I got on my [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i501p). I really appreciate people taking the time to read it and offer their opinion, and I figured I'd take the time to provide an update in case anyone was wondering.

Shortly after my post, I talked with my best friend about it. I proposed that we remove the sexual benefits from our relationship if she moved in, which I suggested because 

* I wanted our relationship to be completely stable and long term, since we would be living together for a long time.
* We could feel obligated to keep it going even if we didn't want to later because we might feel trapped with the other.
* I did not, as a few people suggested may become the case, want her to feel indebted to me, especially sexually.

She found it all reasonable and it went well (actually had similar doubts of her own). We've made the resolution and we're 21 days sex free! I don't know why I used an exclamation point.

My brother and sister in law negotiated some things with her parents. They made a petition for guardianship, and the parents cooperated in saying they are unwilling or something like that. With the parents in on it, it went very quickly (normally this process takes longer, a few months I think). Gist of it is, my brother and sister or law can care for her (doctors, signing papers, etc) without the parents, and the parents can only reclaim those rights by petitioning the court again. Odds are by that time she'll have turned 16 (recently turned 15) so in the unlikely event that it occurs, she can just choose who she wants to live with then.

Someone else suggested she have a room of her own so she can have a safe area, privacy, etc. Funny that at the time we were already working on a room for her. My basement (where I live as described in the other post) is only pseudo finished, with plywood, plastic wrap, rugs, and decorations/lights of various genres. We had been collecting material we bought off craigslist (where I most of the current furnishings came from) to build her own space for a while. It is nearly done and she really likes it! We wooded the walls, are using a curtain for a door temporarily, and she's got a mattress on a prop we built for it, a desk and chair, small rug, and some bookshelves. I'm actually kind of jealous of the design, and she is going to help me rearrange mine soon.

I've been stuck at home alone for the past month while my boyfriend is vacationing in Rome. I'm not at all the kind of girlfriend who would tell him he couldn't go do something like that, but I did ask if I could go. I offered up every dime I had to go with him. I grew up poor, still am and I've never been out of the country or gotten to go on any major trip like that. He, on the other hand is extremely wealthy and trips like this are a regular occurrence for him. He told me I couldn't go, and I was alright with it at first. The other day I found out that he had brought a girl with him, paid for everything, they're sharing a hotel, he's taking her shopping at all the best spots in Rome, buying her all of these fancy meals, the whole deal. I'm sitting here at home eating Ramen on the couch and can't afford the gas to leave the house. I'm not sure if I'm just jealous and miserable or if he's a total dick.

EDIT: 
Realizing I should also make a few points...
We live together, so yes I know I'm his girlfriend. He doesn't support me because I chose not to be in the position of having someone else pay all my bills. 
His wealth is all his, he doesn't have much family and he personally inherited the money he has and has since made good investments that made him even more money. So it's not his parents funding this trip.
I also want to thank everyone for their advice, good and bad. Once he returns on the 26th and we talk, I'll come back and update everyone on what happened.

Boyfriend bought a female friend a trip to Rome, left me at home alone. Am I insane to be totally pissed off?


UPDATE:
I was finally able to speak to him, through FB chat and he said I am overly jealous, untrusting, and stifling. Then he said he refuses to apologize for what he did because he doesn't see where he did anything wrong.

I was supposed come home late from my office yesterday because of a lot of corporate bullshit I had to tend to but realized I forgot a handful of documents in my office at home so I had to come home earlier than expected.

I come home, go upstairs and walk towards my office down the hall and see my daughter's room door cracked almost half-way open. Wouldn't have thought twice about it if I didn't hear breathing noises coming from her room. I regretfully looked in with a lot of hesitation thinking it may have been my wife cheating on me believe it or not! Instead, I see my daughter on top of her boyfriend. 

I suddenly got light headed and sick to my stomach. As much as I wanted to bust in there and grab the kid by the neck, my more reasonable conscience told me that my daughter would hate me if I did that and above that, would be mortified if I ""caught"" them. So it took every ounce of me to just walk into my office slowly and just went to work trying to ignore what just happened.

I ended up sleeping in my office last night. I'm almost certain my daughter realized that I had known she was having sex last night because when I came down for breakfast this morning, she was a little closed off and not willing to talk much. I'm assuming she saw my office light on and saw me sleeping earlier in the morning and figured I had walked past them last night. Anyway, I am pretty pissed right now for many reasons. I think my daughter is too young to have sex and I'm very certain other parents would agree. 

I don't know what to do or say to her but I want to sit down with her and have a talk. The last thing I need me brushing this issue aside and making her believe that it's perfectly fine for her to have sex in my house with my knowing. With my anger there is certainly heartache and disappointment because I feel like there was also a considerable level of disrespect on my daughter's part for at least not trying to hide it. Yes, I came home early but I came home to MY house. I haven't talked to my wife yet either and she doesn't get back until Thursday.

So last night he came home from work and I was waiting for him. Truth be told I had been dreading this because I thought that he was probably going to end it and was maybe a tiny bit weepy and so he walked in to me ugly crying. I managed to choke out my apology and explanation and begged him for forgiveness for not being honest and keeping information like that from him. There was a lot of tears and snot and a lot of begging to not end the relationship. Then, the man started laughing, like full belly laughing. It was a bit confusing. He pulled me close, hushed me up, and told me he loved me, that he was in this for the long run and that now more than ever he was going to be here and that I should just shut up about breaking up because he was never going to let me go. He was upset that I had told him in that way but relieved that he now knew and was able to help and be a support. He understood where I was coming from and understood that it wasn't because I didn't trust him. He was scared of losing me, not to the end of this relationship but to cancer and just wanted to be updated and kept in the loop. Then he made me promise to swear off the vodka for a while and he kissed me and we went and got pizza. 
I am a lucky lucky woman. 

TL;DR Didn't tell SO I had cancer until I got smashed off and we were fighting, worried I ruined our relationship, turns out he just wants to be kept in the loop and I'm the luckiest woman ever.

Hi, first I want to say thanks so much to those who read/responded to my last post and to apologize if I didn't answer every piece of advice. It was all appreciated.

It was hard, but I took what you all said to heart. I ended things with him. I was out tonight, but spent most of it thinking about my situation; I texted him around midnight to ask if we could talk. He called me around 1 am when he got home from the bars. 

I went over. Sat with him on the couch. He put his arm around my shoulder. I told him I can't do this anymore because I think he's wonderful and I want to be with him, but he has made it clear he will never feel the same and has no respect for me as a friend or as someone he has sex with. He denied this and said that he did respect me, didn't mean to make me feel bad all the time, etc. 

I continued by telling him that I don't want to share him with whooo knows who else anymore. He evaded and said that ""it's not like there's a ton of other girls."" I simply responded, ""just one other girl is too many for me."" He was silent.

And just like that, done. He tried to convince me to stay the night (offered me his bed while he would take the couch) because i was clearly distraught and he was concerned i had been drinking (although i was definitely sober by this point). Turned the offer down. Came home. Cried a little in the car on the way, but overall I feel okay now. I feel like I finally stood up for myself. I'm sure I'll feel more sad in the morning and in the coming days, but then it will start getting better.

Thanks guys.

**tl;dr: Ended. Sad. But will get better now. Thanks for all of your advice.**

1344350919.0,498,self.relationships,xtpk8,UPDATE: proposing to my boyfriend - thoughts?,needsomehelp29,602,104,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xtpk8/update_proposing_to_my_boyfriend_thoughts/,"Original post here.(http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xg7te/proposing_to_my_boyfriend_thoughts/)

I thought I would update you all on how this whole thing went down.  Definitely not what I expected.
A couple days after thinking about it, I decided to test the water with my boyfriend.  We were having a lovely day together and collaborated on a nice home-cooked meal and watched some TV online.  After dinner and a couple glasses of wine, I pitched the theoretical to my boyfriend.  I told him I had read about a girl proposing to a guy online and asked how he would feel about it.

He had more to say about it than I'd expected.  He had no qualms with it, aside from the fact that it would be 'a bit embarrassing' to explain to friends; that was a minor side effect and no real issue, he emphasized.  It was definitely something he would be comfortable with.  (Okay, good.)

He further explained that while it was acceptable for girls to propose, his ideal scenario would be for a couple to 'propose to each other'.  This confused me a lot.  He explained that there was no reason why either party particularly 'deserved' the honour of proposing, assuming that they're treating each other as equals.  For gender roles, yes, it's progressive for the woman to be the one proposing - but for gender *equality* it's still accomplishing nothing.  His stance was basically that a) proposals should never be a 100% surprise and b) the couple should decide together when the right time is.  Being a bit hazy from drinking (and never the most tactful person as it is), I asked if it was the right time.  He said that it was definitely time and we should go to the mall tomorrow - our local mall is packed with jewelers - and take a look around.

We went to a couple stores before finding one that treated us amicably.    It took about half an hour to pick out the ring we both liked for me.  He had his heart set on a titanium or tungsten band that could stand up to his line of work.  There were maybe a dozen bands to chose from, and he picked his favourite in less than 2 minutes - go figure.

Total bill was somewhere around $450.  We paid 20% to have them put on layaway and went home to see where we could find money.  When I said he had a lot of debt, I failed to mention that he has recently secured a well-paying job and we have started to budget pretty frugally.  Planned spending used to be a big problem of his and part of why he was falling so far behind, but we have made great strides lately and started making real progress.  We have pre-set budgets for each week and try to do all our transactions in cash, which actually makes it *very* easy to keep an eye on your spending.  After a month and a half of this, we've already paid a lot down on his debts and still had an easy time finding the rest of the money we owed on the rings.  We went back the very next day to pick them up.

He drove me out to a place neither of us had been in years - the first place where he hugged me, a park that had been close to our old high school.  When we got there we were sad to find that the park and bench we were looking for had been removed.  It ended up not mattering.  He gave a short speech, presented me my ring and asked me to marry him.  When I accepted, one lone person we hadn't noticed about 100 yards away began clapping and cheering.  I got flustered by this, forgot what I had wanted to say and totally dropped the ball on my returned proposal. xD

Friends and family have been very positive and supportive and we are planning a cheap wedding for mid to late 2013.  He is going to help plan that, too.  We're in this together. :)

**TL;DR: asked boyfriend and, although he was cool with it, he wanted us to be equally involved, so we talked it out like rational adults and decided it was time (a few months ahead of schedule).**

P.S: If anyone was curious, no, he did not have a proposal plan.  I know my boyfriend (sorry - fiancé!) and he has never been particularly romantic.  It was mostly that he wanted to by me a big, expensive ring that we couldn't afford.  When I said again that I would NOT be happy with that and told him my reasons, he said that he was happy to buy me a cheap ring if it was what I wanted, despite whatever backlash we may receive.  When I tell people I picked it myself and that all the money we saved will help us with more productive things - the wedding costs, for example, or the vacation - they seem generally understanding... especially the guys, lol.  

*edit: wow, thanks for all the kind words and support.  Read and enjoyed all of your comments (mostly).  It may have lacked in romance or spontaneity, but it was a wonderful outcome, and I couldn't be happier.  Maybe I'll post some pictures in a years' time or something... lol.

1367543593.0,490,self.relationships,1dl9m3,My (33F) stepson (16M) tried to have sex with me and is threatening to tell everyone I initiated it.,worriedmdmom,632,142,240,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dl9m3/my_33f_stepson_16m_tried_to_have_sex_with_me_and/,"First, some backstory. My husband Mike (40s) and I (30s) have been married now for 4 years. He has two children - Amanda (college age) and Bret (16). Both children lived with their mother until she remarried two years ago and moved out of the US. Amanda ""lives"" with us when she isn't in college, but she's pretty much an adult. Mike and I have known each other for 6 years and I have always gotten along with his family and children. Our relationship hasn't always been great (I cheated on him once right before we were married, a mistake I regret but we worked on our relationship and are stronger than ever) but I think we have a strong relationship.

The problem is with his son. I think that Bret has always resented our relationship and his parents' divorce. I've done my best to befriend him, be a good parent, and be understanding, but he has always been cold and distant. That changed about a year ago, when he started to be a bit more kind and polite. He used to not listen when I would ask him to do simple things like clean up after himself or keep his clutter in his room. He used to talk back to me or mock me or even just tell me to ""fuck off"". HIs father was never around when this happened and when I would tell his father later he would say that Bret ""didn't mean it"" or ""was going through a teen thing"". It was difficult, but never having kids of my own I trust Mike to know his own kids. By all accounts Bret is a great kid - he gets great grades, he plays sports, he's in the scouts - so at least he doesn't drink or use drugs.

Things changed about two weeks ago. I was finishing laundry and putting it away. I went to Bret's room and knocked on the door. I didn't think he would be home because of lacrosse practice so when he didn't answer I opened the door. He was naked, on his bed, on his knees facing the door and masturbating. I only saw him for a second, but he was staring straight at me. I said sorry and closed the door. But I felt like he meant for me to see him like that. He didn't try to hide it. His father came home and I didn't mention it. When Bret came to dinner he was quiet. Since then he has started doing things like brushing his crotch against my waist when he passes me in the kitchen. He has walked in on me in my bedroom and says things like he was ""looking for a magazine"" and didn't think I was home. He has, on multiple occasions tried to come into the bathroom about 30 seconds after I go in. I didn't used to lock the door, but now I do. The final ""straw"" was last weekend. My husband got up and went to the gym at 6 AM like he does every sunday before we go to church. I was asleep and when I woke up he was in bed spooning me with an erection pressed into my back. I reached back and touched him and that's when I realized it wasn't my husband. I jumped up and ran into the bedroom - still half asleep I thought someone had broken in and was attempting to rape me. It wasn't until I had locked myself in the bathroom that I found out it was my stepson.

Since then, I've been a mess. I can't eat or sleep and find it difficult to be around Bret without feeling sick. Two days ago, I decided to talk to Bret about what happened. I felt like I had to tell MIke what happened. When I started to talk, Bret interrupted and said ""If you say anything I'll tell the adults at school and anyone who will listen that you tried to fuck me. So you should get used to it.""

I don't know what to do. I don't know if my husband would think I was crazy, or believe Bret. I feel like I can't even tell my therapist because I'm worried about someone calling the police. I'm not sure who I should talk to or if I should just not say anything and hope this goes away. What do I do?

TL;DR - My (30sF) stepson (16M) attempted to have sex with me and is blackmailing me to keep me from telling anyone by saying he will tell people that I tried to have sex with him.

Of course, so many others within this forum also struggle with such a realization, which is why I'm suggesting we rally around each other for support using to-do lists.

Basically, it's a list of things you hope to accomplish over the coming weeks, months, years. The items could be as small as ""Buy groceries on Tuesday"" or as large as ""Buy a house."" But they should be realistic, meaning you *can* and *will* actively pursue such tasks. I'll start.

**Rapp039's To-Do List:**

* Fly to Phoenix, Arizona, to visit college friends.
* Start playing the accordion, again.
* Get that tattoo I've wanted for a few years.
* Secure a full-time writing position with a magazine publisher.
* Practice daily meditation.
* Go for frequent hour-long walks.
* Learn how to turn fruit into edible bouquets.
* Grow more open with my family.
* Realize validation and value comes from the self, not from others.
* Stop hoping she wants me back.
* Write more.
* Feel comfortable watching movies alone in a theater.
* Rent an apartment within a major city such as Boston or New York.
* Dance more.

The point being, one must not pine for the future snatched away by the parting of another person. No, one must realize independence through focusing on a future full of untamed potential.

Give yourself a path to follow and then take it one step at a time. We will falter, trip, stumble, and feel much agony upon this new adventure, but we must not stop walking. Keep your chin up, everyone, for life has offered us an opportunity few are ever given: a fresh start.

My daughter strolled in a few hours after I posted that, boy in tow. I had parked in the garage and they were very startled to see me. Her phone was dead. She tried to introduce the boy as ""her friend Trevor"" but I let her know that I knew otherwise immediately.

The boy- he really is a boy, I guess with me being a dad by the time I was his age, I expected more of an adult- seems okay enough. A little over attached but I can't find anything so objectionable to ban her from seeing him, as long as she stops sneaking around and staying the night. He delivers pizza and lays carpet, but is going to school for carpentry. He is a former foster kid and they met through her friend Ana, 17, who is dating his roommate, 18, that just graduated last year from high school.

I let him leave after I talked to him a little bit. Bigger concerns and all that. Then I sat Maddie down and laid it out. I knew she had been sneaking around and lying, I knew that she was having sex and suspected she was being unsafe about it.

And she cried and said that it wasn't like that. They always used a condom but she was worried anyways. And she loved Trevor so much and that she knew I would try and limit her access to him but she just wanted to be with him when she could.

I let her know that was unacceptable. That I am her parent and I need to know about her life. And that she couldn't hole up with her boyfriend and place house all weekend. It would limit her and is unhealthy for a 16 year old kid.

Then we had an awkward sex talk.. She agreed to go on the pill and we are scheduling an appointment asap. I then explained to her, while she looked like she might die, that sex should be an equal process and she can say no anytime, that just because she started doesn't mean she can't stop, and if she ever feels uncomfortable she can say no. That she shouldn't feel like she has to do anything.

She mumbled, I know, I know. and that ended it. But at least, I know that it's out there. Now to make sure that she starts being honest. Oh, parenting.

tl;dr Her phone was dead, she strolled in with Trevvy and I met him. He seems decent enough, a little over attached and the apartment worries me but no need to call the cops.

My husband left his phone at home. For some reason I've had this weird niggling of doubt in the back of my mind. 
I snooped. And I don't care I did. 



What I found. No I don't think he is currently cheating. But he was. We were long distance back in 2011. He messaged many, many people from Craigslist ads and plenty of fish (dating sight?). Plus a couple of his past gf. Pictures, some sexting. Some naughty pictures, some ""normal"" ones. Some of these pics he sent to me! Saying ""thinking about you!"" etc. Some of these it's obvious he fucked them bc of stuff like ""had fun"" ""coming over to fuck?"" etc. Some of them it's obvious he never even met the ladies, got bored w them and dropped them. 




The biggest shocker.... He fucked another guy. He sent a received several dick pics and said stuff like ""can't wait for that to be in me!"" and the guy said ""good, I missed that sweet ass."" I honestly would not care if he is bi. However, after telling him about my bi-curious stage (I slept w two women), he made me feel like a piece of shit. Said things like he was afraid he couldn't satisfy me bc I'm into girls, said I'd leave him. I've since come to the conclusion it was fun to experiment, but I am straight. He even once said I'd done ""way more crazy stuff"" sexually than him! I've slept w a few guys, I've had two MFF threesomes (the threesomes were the only time I've been w other women). He saw this guy last spring and summer, right before we moved in together in September! Also a big shocker for me bc he is just soooo ""straight."" Our sex has always been good but fairly vanilla. He's never asked me to touch/fuck him in the ass. He loves anal with me but what guy doesn't? But he doesn't even push it we haven't done it in ages (yes I'm aware that not all guys do anal, and that if a guy likes anal doesnt mean he's gay. Just adding info here).




I'm not only heart broken, I'm terrified! Did he use condoms?? I know he was tested before we first slept together, but I have no idea how many ppl he has been with since then. Of course my first order of business is to go get tested tomorrow. 




Oh my god I'm shaking. I seriously feel this is a fucked up dream. I had a dream a couple weeks ago he gave me herpes. I have a history of dreaming things before they become a reality so I am scared shitless. If I have anything it would be from him. I was also tested before we had sex and have only been w him since. 




What do I do? How do I confront him? From the texts and emails it appears he stopped this behavior finally in August (yup, one month before we moved in together...) He gets home in about 2 hrs. Oh my god. I'm laying here w my baby shaking. I haven't even cried yet bc I am so in shock. Seriously, this is NOT the man I know. Not one red flag even comes to mind. Is he just a total sociopath? Psychopath? Whatever. I was reading all our texts from the past year. He was so, so in love w me, told me I was so beautiful, the girl of his dreams. There was nothing like that in any of the other texts or emails, just sex. It appears I'm the only one he had a romantic interest in. 



Please tell me how to handle this. Should I even bring it up tonight when he gets home? I have literally no one to talk to about this.

&gt; **Original TL;DR:** 
&gt; Neighbor saw my porn drive, now he's acting really weird. Looking for advice on how to fix things, or at least insulate myself from hurtful rumors.

OK, so lots of good advice in the original post.  Thanks.

I need to stress that I didn't want my talk with him to be about me telling him I'm right and he's wrong, like a lot of posts suggested...  I think that if you feel the need to be right, you aren't going to be a good neighbor.  The approach I took was more, ""I need to understand why you feel the way you do.""

Just before lunch I knocked on my neighbor's door and asked if I could speak with him.  He wasn't happy to see me but he agreed to come over to my house to chat, he didn't want to talk in front of his family.  Fair enough.

I asked him why he thought I was a child molester, and I told him I wasn't and thought that the insinuation was really potentially hurtful and damaging to my reputation in the community.  I reminded him that he had met my ex-girlfriend, and she was 5 years younger than me... and that's the biggest age gap I've ever had in a relationship.

I didn't deny that I had porn, and I didn't tell him it was anyone else's, but I did tell him that all the porn on the drive was legal, and that I ""often watched it with my ex-girlfriend.""  I asked him why he thought it was child porn, or if he just thought any porn meant I was some sort of deviant.

His first reaction was to tell me, ""I know what I saw.""  But when I pressed him on what it was he saw, he said, ""Pictures of kids and videos of people having sex.""  I asked him if he had looked through the whole drive and saw context around the pictures, and he just got this disgusted look on his face, ""No I didn't look through the whole drive!""  He claimed that he turned on a media server and it auto-detected the media because it was still on my network because the wifi password on the device was hard to change and he hadn't changed it back form when his cable modem broke.  He said his kids only normally used the device for Netflix, so he had kind of forgotten about it once things were working again.  His explanation seemed a little wordy, but I let him talk as long as he wanted.

Anyway it was super awkward at this point, so I offered to show him the drive again to add context.  I kind of had to insist he at least look at the file structure.  It was painful.  Anyway I showed him that the photos were form my past, and the only pictures of teenage girls were from my high school days or pictures of my sister.  The pictures were all arranged in folders by year, like I said in the previous post.  But he said he hadn't seen them this way before, what he saw was all of the files in a unified view, without the folder structure.  And he only took a quick glance at the thumbnails when he went to watch a movie with his wife and kids.

It was in front of his wife and kids.  Repeat: Super Awkward...

I apologized that happened.  And I am really sorry that his kids saw it.  Not sure how much they would have seen given it was just thumbnails... I looked again, none of them had any graphic images in the thumbnails shown on my Mac, but... who knows what was shown on his device.  Or what his kids saw.  I didn't show him any of the porn, but by this point he was warming up again to the idea that the whole thing was just a huge mistake and misunderstanding.  I offered to let him take the drive to the cops, I was that certain there wasn't child porn on it.  He said he believed me.

He told me the reason he was so disgusted by porn was that it had ""ruined his sister's marriage"" and he now had to support her.  That his sister's husband would watch porn so much that he lost his job and became an alcoholic and ended up being abusive to his wife and kids (he didn't say, but I assumed physically abusive, not sexually).  He told me porn set unrealistic expectations on relationships, and I would never be happy as long as I looked at it.  (Hey, there's some slight truth to that, for some people at least.)  He told me there was a support group at his church for pornography addiction and asked me if I would be interested in going.  I sheepishly told him I would check it out.  That seemed to put his mind at ease.  He said he was sorry he jumped to conclusions.

Candidly I don't know if I believe his story 100%.  I know my TV only shows titles, not thumbnails.  I've seen the Boxee and WD Live interfaces... WD Live I think shows previews of the clips, but doesn't show images and videos in the same display view.  Also the router wasn't set up as a DLNA server... just a network share.  So who knows.  I still feel like he probably snooped, but it's possible his kids saw something through their media server... 

So of course I don't have any intention of going to a porn support group, but I did get the contact info from him for the guy who runs it.  I might exchange a few emails, and then tell him the times don't work and see if he can suggest another group at another church to go to... then just drop it.  We'll see.

**TL;DR:** Had a good talk with my neighbor.  Things aren't 100% fixed, but at least he's not under the impression I am looking to molest kids any more.  But I may have to go to church...

EDIT: Wanted to put a little more down about what he told me.  His speech was basically, ""You won't be able to get married or experience true love if you are still looking to other women, even pictures of women, to get off.  You can't have porn and a happy marriage.""  I don't agree 100%, but I do think the guy's heart is in the right place.  As much as Reddit hates on religious people... it was kind of sweet to hear things like that said in 2013.

And... This whole thing has got me thinking more about the context of information.  Not to get all political, but I am terrified more than ever about the NSA now.  They see a snapshot, take it the wrong way, and **POOF**, you're on your way to Guantanamo.  I know everyone on Reddit feels the same way, but I sure hope we turn things around again in America.

Hope it's alright that I post here. Promise no more screenshots! I got a lot of messages asking how things were going, and I even started a journal so I could vent without getting banned on here.

Anyway, I figured I'd let you guys know what's been going on. My ex (god it feels weird saying that) has been blowing up every electronic device capable of communication that I own. Once she realized I wasn't going to reply to her, she started being a bit more honest (in hopes I'd come running back? I dunno.)

Here's what I've gathered so far...

- In one of her e-mails, she admits lying about being raped by John. Basically, ""I didn't want you guys to run into each other because I was having sex with you both. You were friends and I didn't know how to stop you guys from talking, so I lied."" 

- She admits cheating on me the entire time we've been together and it's been more guys than even her mom knew about. Most were guys she met at work (she works with *a lot* of men) and even friends of ours, some of which are married or in relationships. She said she didn't want to give me names because I would just ""ruin another relationship."" She claims she doesn't have a real reason for doing it except for it's just who she is, she doesn't know how to be monogamous, and I wasn't fulfilling her desires. She then goes into some huge rant about how she knew I'd never be comfortable with an open relationship so she never brought it up and figured I wouldn't find out, so I wouldn't get hurt. 

- She flips back and forth from begging to being super bitchy. Apparently doesn't like her little world being flipped upside down.

- Despite ALL of her e-mails asking to if we can work it out, what she can do to fix it, how she can make it up to me, and if I'll ever forgive her, she's staying with the guy she's been banging for the past 7-8 months. Woohoo. 

Aside from all of this, I'm actually doing pretty okay. It's been a rough few days, lots of crying and lots of beer, but I still feel like it hasn't hit me yet. 

My brother planned a guys night this weekend with some friends (guess who's included? John) so hopefully that'll help take my mind off things for the time being... just trying to stay busy.

How do I deal with this?",littlerelict,596,122,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1de9aq/update_i23f_caught_my_boyfriend31m_in_bed_with_a/,"[Original post here](http://redd.it/1czxgy)


Regarding the construction contract, I got one. I called my ex SO the same day, he didn't answer. I left a very calm, business-like voicemail with no undertones of anger, frustration, or anything that would give away that we had any sort of romantic relationship. I stated that I wanted a contract to be drawn up before any work continues just to cover both of us when it comes to the legality of it. He never called back so I called the other owner of the company who had a contract and a complete price and time estimate for us both to sign the very next day. 


He (the other owner) asked if I had any questions or concerns about anything going on and I vaguely told him that his business partner and I had a relationship and that we had a bit of a falling out and I was slightly worried that my ex SO would sabotage some of the work being done. He immediately apologized and assured me that all the work being done would be professional and the best they had to offer. Then said that they will have an outside company come in to inspect all work once the job is complete to ensure the quality of everything before they will accept final payment. I can't begin to explain how thankful I am for that to have went so smoothly.


I mentioned in the previous post that I sent a message to the girl my ex claimed he was 'just friends' with to let her know that I had just found him naked in bed with another woman who was not her, that him and I had been dating since December, and that if they were dating that she should probably be aware so that she didn't have to find out like I did. Later in the day she responded that they too had been dating since December, asked for picture proof, and then said she would like to speak with me on the phone. 


She called me and the first thing out of her mouth was ""I have fifty questions for you, but he's standing right here."" I launched into a chronological and detailed description of our relationship. Turns out he started dating us on the same exact day. That he had been doing/saying the exact same things to her as he was to me (had the exclusivity talk, the way and timing when he said I love you, talking about engagement, planning the same types of events, avoiding, acting super shady on days that the other girl would be around, mentioning of any suspicious behavior was 'irrational' and that we were 'thinking too much') and sending her the same pictures he was sending to me. She was just as shocked as I was at the whole situation. We talked for a good hour and by the end of it she said ""Had you not done this the way you did it would be so easy to hate you, but I can't."" She was incredibly nice, thanked me, and we talked again once on the phone after that and haven't had contact since. 


Once my ex SO realized I was talking to her, he sent me a message asking me to stop. When I didn't answer him and continued to talk to her, he sent another one, this time it was a pretty lengthy apology detailing how he found himself trying to live two lives and he didn't even know which one he even wanted. He said he deserved the water, understands why I am upset, and that he regrets not being an honest person. Then continued on to say he doesn't expect me to speak to him again, but if I'd like we could continue a professional relationship until the construction job is completed. He concluded with ""Again I'm sorry. The least I can do is finish the job I started and walk away from your life forever."" I never responded. 


All of my contact for anything shop/job related is now through his business partner. My ex SO has not been on the property working since the day he sent that message. With his business partner's crew I have had TRIPLE the amount of people working than I was used to seeing before. In the past week I have seen more progress than the last few months combined. 


Since all of this happened, I have felt pretty shaken up. I have made no attempt to contact my ex because I honestly have nothing to say to him. I don't know him and I feel I never really did. I haven't inquired with the other girlfriend because the status of their relationship is none of my business. All I wanted was for her to be aware of the situation. The construction on my business is looking beautiful and I am thankful that I am still able to have it finished (faster now) without any issues getting in the way.


**TL;DR -** Got a construction contract signed by both parties. All contact is now through the other owner who promised a full inspection before receiving final payment. The job is being completed even faster than before and is looking amazing. Found out that ex SO was dating me and another girl at the same time, for the same amount of time and spoke with her in detail which confirmed that he was doing the exact same things with both of us (on top of sleeping with ANOTHER girl). Ex SO apologized via text message and hasn't been back to the jobsite since.

My mistake was just going with the flow and knowing it would work out well. She's going to either hang out with his fiance's family or his grandparents and we will only be away from each other for about 2 hours max the day of the wedding. My buddy is not only picking me up Sunday morning, she's coming too and will be with us the whole time. I wanted her to first meet my buddy's fiance and then they could make plans to hang out the next day and everything instead of forcing it. He also let her know the bridesmaid I'm walking down the aisle with is married with a kid. I fucked up by not feeling the need to get a detailed schedule of what was going to happen and where my SO would be the whole time. Again, I didn't want to add anymore stress to what I'm sure is already a stressful time with all the preparation and everything. Thanks for everyone for the input and to all the people who say she's crazy I understand. She had some extreme social anxiety going on and didn't express it the right way. I understand where she was coming from. Guys communicate differently than women apparently. Where a woman may be very formal in asking someone to be a bridesmaid etc, my buddy knew I would do it without question and I did. After their conversation I apologized to my buddy and he was really cool about it and his fiance was already really looking forward to meeting my girlfriend and wants to meet her even more now because something similar has happened in their relationship. Glad they were so understanding and cool about this whole fiasco.

Thanks again for everyone's input. Gonna have a great weekend now.

I [25M]will be attending a wedding a few hours away from my home this weekend and my girlfriend [21F] is extremely angry at me about it. She's saying I betrayed her by agreeing to be a groomsman. I didn't even know I was a groomsman until I got the text from my buddy mentioning the tuxedo rental and deadline. I was honored he chose me to be a groomsman and continued on.

Two weeks ago my girlfriend says she's not going because the couple getting married didn't respond to her congratulations message on facebook. They barely use their facebook, both have full times job and are planning a wedding. I took it in good faith and told her they're just busy it's not a big deal. She continues to refuse to go. Ok. I tell my friend and he asks me to beg her to go because we want our significant others to be friends so when we drive up to each other's homes in the future they can hang out while we catch up. The potential friendship has already started off badly with the facebook message thing and my girlfriend not attending the wedding will probably make the probability of a potential friendship close to zero.

She finally agrees to come after I tell her she's going for me and even though I'll be busy with the party we can still see each other at the reception and hang out. It would only be from 10am-6pm that we're away from each other. After the ceremony the wedding party takes a limo to the reception hall and then we can hang out.

I can not, and will not refuse to be a groomsman at my long time friend's wedding. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do to appease my girlfriend. She has taken this to a whole other level by refusing to go again (2 hours after she agreed) with essay long text messages saying she feels as if I betrayed her by agreeing to be a groomsman at one of my best friend's wedding. When I returned home from work she wasn't home, I went to bed alone (got really happy when I saw the light turn on thinking she came back home, it was my computer screen in the other room), had dreams of her returning home in the middle of the night only to wake up saddened. I completed my final and presented my final project today with all of this stress on my mind (did awesome btw). 

I have only texted her back 1 message about the feeding the cat and I'm not going to get into a text war about this anymore. A few moments ago I texted her ""Kitty and I miss our mami very much and we hope to see you in the near future. I'll feed her before I head to work if you don't return home by then. Kitty said ""meow meow"" which translates to I miss and love my mami and I told her I feel the exact same way. Love you hope you're feeling better. Muah""

To which she replied she feels just as betrayed as when I slept with that ""whore"" when we were broken up 2 years ago. Apparently she has found a forum online which proves I am 100% wrong and what she is feeling/doing is completely normal. Now she's saying she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore and how ""The saddest part is that you do not acknowledge any of this""

She's saying shes going to come pick up the cat when I'm at work and going to write a letter saying we broke up (I'm assuming to end our lease) She finished off the text with ""...I don't care anymore just like you have shown me you don't. Shame on you. Goodbye""

I replied with ""wow"" I honestly don't know what to say.

Seriously, can I get any type of input on how I fucked up in the situation? If my girlfriend wasn't invited for some reason I would let my buddy know and I'm sure he would take care of it. She is invited as a guest and I seriously can not comprehend what's going on.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend is insanely angry I'm a groomsman and she has to be alone for 8 hours on the day of the wedding while I'm helping with the wedding ceremony. Also may be angry that I'll be walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid.

**Edit1:** She said this in one of the text messages last night ""I wish you would have said no thanks [name of groom], as I'm attending with [name of gf] and I don't want her to be alone. You just jumped on board you didn't think...I would never do that to you""

Also called me a traitor a few times.

**Edit2:** I did get irrational and upset initially when she told me she didn't want to go. I probably should have just let it play out but I was offended that my girlfriend that I planned on marrying one day would be this petty over someone else' big day like this. I thought I would look stupid sitting with an empty seat next to me and having to explain to everyone that asked ""hey man where's your girlfriend"" and either a) have to lie or b)make my girlfriend look really stupid. I told my buddy the real story but wouldn't feel comfortable telling everyone else what happened. Again I should have just accepted it but I was upset and kept trying to get her to go by saying ""You're doing this for me and you're going to make me look stupid etc""

**EDIT3:** The case is solved. She thinks I should have gotten her consent to be a groomsman and the part of the conversation she cried the most was that I would walk down the aisle with a bridesmaid while she is in the audience. Also she was mad at the schedule I had made where while I was doing the rehearsal she would hang out and wait and when we were done we would all go hang out a a bar together then crash at my buddies that night. This was in effort to save 1 night of hotel fees. Then Saturday I was going to duck out of the hotel for an hour or two to hang out with my buddy. Sunday since I'm leaving early to prep(10am) I said I would bring anything she didn't need to get get ready in my truck and request a late check out since the ceremony begins at 3. Then she was supposed bring my truck to the ceremony then drive it to the reception hall where we would meet (since Im in the limo with the rest of the wedding party).

That's when we were gonna meet then I was gonns drive 4 hours home into the night while she napped to get her back for work by Monday morning. Shes pissed, I'm still going and it looks like we're through. Thanks for all the input. I'll check the thread when I'm out of work.

**EDIT4:** A few people have made valid points about her wanting to get engaged/married and that being a factor in her behavior. I'm currently working part time security at a defense contractor making 12 bucks an hour and have 3 semesters left on my computer science degree. I cant afford the ring at the moment, never mind a wedding. I thought we had an understanding as shes still 21, and hell she may not feel the same way about me at 25. I don't want to go through a divorce, I want to marry once. My parents had a very cold marriage when I was young (separate bedrooms for as long as I can remember, no physical contact or love shown. They ignored each other and dint speak for most of my childhood but they're better now) This has caused me to be emotionally distant at times (I've come a long way, hence my beta attempt at trying to be cute). Ive got a lot of things I need to work on on myself stemming from a deployment and childhood. I'm simply not ready emotionally or financially to get married. Shes an awesome person and I found love for the first time when I met her and besides minor occurrences we have an awesome relationship and we enjoy each others company. Shes the only person I've considered marriage with.",Relationships,False,,t5_2qjvn,1372386189.0,m-vt relationships,,True,t3_1h6yrr,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h6yrr/girlfriend_is_extremely_upset_that_im_a_groomsman/,

It went really, really well. I asked Jon if we could meet up over the weekend and we did on Saturday. I quickly got to the point and told him I had feelings for his daughter, they were mutual, and that we both really wanted to be in a relationship together and I wanted his blessing. I was expecting a terrible response based on what people here told me but it went fine. He said he kind of suspected something was up between the two of us and that as long as I treat his daughter well he has no issue. I promised him I wouldn't hurt Sara and he gave us his approval. 

What I was scared about was the age difference but Jon never mentioned it or said I was too old for his daughter. Sara talked to her dad later that day and he apparently just asked her background questions - like does he treat you well, are you ready, etc. and then told her to have fun and be smart.

It's hard for me to write this down, so please be nice.  I'm going to do my best.  Married 20 years, f[40] and m[41].


He is extremely passive-aggressive but I think that there might be something else wrong with him but I can't convince him to go to a therapist.  Well, I should say that he agrees to go to a therapist after a fight, but then when I help him make an appointment he takes it all back saying that there's nothing wrong with him, blah blah blah. 



 I'll just explain the worst problems I'm having with him and if you need any detail, I'll explain as best as I can.  (my hands are shaking from nervousness of making this public.  I'm not going to read what I wrote to edit because I'll chicken out). 



Throughout our marriage I've had to put up with hidden cameras, peep holes, pictures of my private parts that were taken while I was asleep, sex tapes that were taken without my knowledge, etc.  I've walked into his shed and found a computer hooked up with nothing but pictures and movies of me - the wallpaper was a picture of my vagina.  What if my kids needed something from the shed and saw that????  When I confronted him he says it's because I'm beautiful and he wants more sex.  It's not that I wasn't giving him sex (3-4 times a week seemed plenty, right?), but I figured if it stopped him from invading my privacy I would help.  So I increased the sex, but he didn't stop.  One night in the middle of sex I thought I saw a flash of light so I immediately knew there was a camera.  I contronted him but he said I was crazy because he told me he would never do that again.  I just didn't believe him so I looked around and sure enough, there was a camera.  I was so hurt and angry, but being the type of guy that he is I didn't stop the sex because he would have been angry and mean.  I just held my tongue but decided I would never trust him again.  I know you guys think it's wrong to snoop on your partner and check their computer, but I think in my case it's justified.  I do NOT want pictures of me like that on any computers or
cell phones.  He's notorious for for losing his phone, or not hiding files on computers.  So I have to check them periodically to delete pictures of me and then practically beg him to stop doing it to me. 



 A couple months ago he was in the kitchen with his phone.  I was standing right next to him when turned it on to make a call and I saw that the wallpaper of his phone was another picture of me that he promised he deleted.  I was mad and hurt, which makes him extremely mad and he tries to run away instead of telling me what the hell is going on.  But again, he promises to delete all pics of me but I never believe him.  I know theres pictures of me out there somewhere.  After years of this I suppose it's no surprise that taking a shower or changing my clothes causes extreme anxiety for me.  I use a sheet over the shower door and undress/dress while in the shower and I look for cameras, peepholes, etc.  It's so much work to do this that I'm lucky to shower 3 times a week because it's tiring.  I can't shower when he's home because I've caught him in the bathroom with a camera peeking around the corner of the closet. 



You might be thinking that this isn't really a big deal, but it's a big deal to me.  He's invading my privacy.  Not only that but it's making me absolutely despise him.  I can't even stand to be hugged by him.  But for the record his hugs aren't normal either.  He can't hug without groping.  And when I tell him it makes me uncomfortable he gets mad, says mean things and leaves.  One time he hugged me and kept groping so bad that I was trying to slip away nicely into other rooms, but he kept following me!  I kept saying nicely ""please stop, this isn't a hug, please stop, etc."" but he wouldn't listen and I got to the point where I was so mad and trapped that I just grabbed his balls to get him off of me and screamed ""why won't you listen to me!!!!!!!"".  This made him so mad that he punched a hole in the wall, broke a door and drove off screaming that I'm a bitch.  I'm not a bitch.  I just probably didn't handle it right even though after 20 years of begging him to stop he still isn't listening to me so I just got desperate.  I was really sorry and ran out to his car to apologize but he just drove off saying that I punched him.  I didn't punch him!  I grabbed him.  



But he does tend to over dramatize things.  If I'm wanting to communicate and try to fix our problems he just doesn't want to talk so he talks over me, interupts, yells and then tries to run away.  I've stood in front of the door begging him not to leave and please talk to me so he starts to grab his phone saying he's calling the cops because I'm holding him hostage!!!!!  What in the world????  So of course I have to back down, let him leave, and cry by myself.  And then when he comes home he walks in like nothing happened and sits down to watch tv.  If I say ""please can we talk"" (trust me, I say this in the nicest quietest voice possible so that he doesn't think I'm attacking him), he just jumps up to leave screaming ""Whatever!"", or ""Fuck this!"".  And walks away again.  Nothing is ever resolved.  20 years of the same fucking problems never being solved.  If I try to fix something he says ""are you still holding on to this?"".  Well, yeah.  I kinda am because it has nowhere to go because the problem was never solved.  That's how I am - if theres a problem, we fix it, it's over and gone.  Easy peasy.  The times when he actually does listen, he promises that we'll work things out and he'll do whatever he can.  He's nice for maybe a week and then he's back to being himself.



Going back to his obsession with cameras and porn:  The other day I actually found pictures of my sister on his computer.  Not naked pictures, just really creepy pictures.  He's taken them off of Facebook, cropped everybody out of them except her and then put photo frame type things around them.  These were in a folder that had porn pictures in them.  Why did he make these pictures?  I've had to ask him before about all the texting and calls he makes to her because there's A LOT of them!  I don't mind that he talks to her it's just that if I text him he never replies to me and says he was busy.  But when I look at the phone bill he doesn't seem to have a problem texting her 20 times while he was ""busy"".  I finally got the courage to ask and of course he got mad and he said ""it's because she's nicer than you are"".  I felt like I was punched in the gut.  I finally had to tell my sister about the pictures and she literally threw up and wanted to go after him.  I had to beg her not to because then I would be in trouble so she told me that she never wants to be in the same room with him ever again, or she WILL say something to him.  So now I'm worried that eventually she will do that or tell her boyfriend and HE will. So she stopped answering texts and calls which pissed him off.  He was texting her ""why are you ignoring me"" texts until he finally said ""FUCK IT!"".  Why did he even care that she was ignoring him?  He never cares when he's ignoring ME!  God forbid anybody ignore him.  She has never liked him but was always nice to him because of me.  But she said she's not going to be nice anymore.  Christmas is going to be fun this year.  Not.



There are other things: 


-he gets fired a lot or passed up for raises.  His reason is that it's because he works harder than everybody else so people don't like him and are jealous.  He's late for work all the time and when I try to get him to get out the door on time he says ""fuck 'em"".  



-he won't take care of the house and if I tell him somethings broken he gets mad and says ""I'm not a fucking maintenance man"".  When he finally does get around to fixing it he doesn't finish or doesn't do it right.  We went a long time this winter without heat.  His solution?  Here's a space heater!!  So when he finally fixed the heater it wasn't fixed properly.  It wouldn't shut off and it would just get hotter and hotter.   So our electric bill was $500 last month.  Yeah, that kind of crap happens all the time.  



-he doesn't spend time with his kids.  If something goes wrong with them he says ""you must be doing something wrong"".  When he gets home from work he goes straight to his room to look at porn and then goes to sleep.




-I have one plate, very few utensils, and no cups.  Why?  Because their all in his room full of mold and cigarettes.  I am NOT taking care of this problem!!!  The past few days I've been on a cooking strike.  I cook for the kids and give them their dinner on the paper plates and cups that I have hidden for them.  But that's it.  If he wants to eat he needs to wash his dishes.  So he doesn't eat.  Is this mean of me?  It's only been a couple days so I'm just waiting for a blow out.  He's going to have a hissy fit and start throwing dishes or something.



-He says he's going to a friends house and will be back in a couple hours.  He never does.  He shuts off his phone and then doesn't come home till 3 or 4 in the morning.  And I'm not supposed to say anything about it.  ""I'm a grown man and I can do what I want"" is always his reply.  You know, I wouldn't mind actually getting out of this house and staying out till 3 in the morning!  But it's impossible for me because of the kids.  Plus he'd be texting constantly - when are you coming home, where are you, etc.



There is so much more but I'm tired.  I would like to say that I used to be such an awesome girl.  I went to college, had goals, was the perfect mom.  But I've given up.  I think I'm turning into him.  A mean lazy person.  I can barely get out of bed and I don't look forward to anything any more.  I know I'm depressed and need therapy but what's the point?  My TMJ is so bad that I've cracked and worn down my back teeth.  I went to the dr. the other day and they want to run a bunch of heart tests on me.



I know that someone is going to say ""just leave him"".  Well I've tried that.  He threatens to take the kids, I don't have a job, I don't have a car.  What I really want is my motivation back so that I can direct it to myself instead of this marriage.  I want to be that confident outgoing girl I used to be so that I can get out without any scars or fear that he'll do something to get back at me.  Like putting all those pictures of me on the internet.   That is my biggest fear and he knows it. 




Does anybody have any idea how I can get him into therapy?  Is there something wrong with him other than being passive-aggressive?  





tl;dr  I've wasted half my life with a psycho.

Been together over a year.


I'm leaving him. I went to see a free crisis therapist and they helped me call him to tell him what was going on. I'm getting a restraining order, hopefully... But I'm not pressing charged. 


He was sorry and said he under stood and he'd leave to his parents in a few hours and stay there. I got a police escort home when he said he left, to make sure he did and he had.


This is hard and heartbreaking for me...



Also, to those comments saying that I downplayed my act of tossing the shoes, I assure you, I didn't. I really did only toss them and he even admitted that after he hit my head into the wall that he realized how insignificant my act had been. It wasn't aimed at him, the fish, or the wall and it wasn't hard.


I do get out of the house every day without him and go on walks. I love my alone time redditing and such and want to make friends. I don't follow him around all day, expecting him to hang out and pouting if he doesn't. And I didn't not let him leave after he said he didn't feel any love or lust or joy. I suggested we split then, and he said no and that he didn't really mean any of that and he was just tired and he really loved me and he did feel lust, just not all the time.


The argument was that he did tell me positives, yes, but they're directly opposite to the negatives he keeps saying and it's messing with my head, so what does he really think? No, I wasn't calm or collected, yes I did cry and not accept the good he said. Yeah, I am part of the reason we had the argument, but I didn't do anything that deserved my head put into a wall and a fucked up face...

Background: Me (30 M) and the girl (24 F) met over two years ago via mutual friends and we hit it off great, after a year we entered a relationship and just two months ago we moved in together. We have our differences and our little fights like everyone but really, everything has been wonderful, to the point where we were discussing marriage. 

Both of us were raised in the foster system, I was removed from my household when I was 10, she was around 7 so we've always had this in common and been able to confide in one another about this. 

Recently: My biological father passed away which meant little to nothing to me since my foster father adopted me and has been absolutely great. However.. The woman I am with also received an invitation to the funeral because its her dad also.

Shes already packed up her things and is staying with her best friend. This situation is so screwed up I honestly didn't believe things like this could happen. I'm torn.. I really am, I felt like I loved this woman, I thought about our future together and now I don't know what the hell to do. We have crossed the line physically and when we tried to talk about it she broke down and started crying, she won't speak to me anymore.

Just as more background.. Yes we have spoken about our pasts before, yes we have spoken about our parents but it has always been ""my mother was a druggie and my dad a drunk"" we have separate last names and to be honest I just NEVER considered it a possibility that we could be related. What the hell do I do? I honestly felt like I was in love and in one day everything has fallen apart. 

TL;DR: Found out the woman I have been seeing and saying 'I love you' too is actually my younger sister. Now more then ever I wished I had kept in contact with my biological family. What the hell do I do?

Update: Wow, thank you everyone so much.. Really you have no idea how much this means to me. This really made my day and I'm glad I took the time to check this at work. 
To answer a popular question, no, we did not grow up together or were ever in the same household. I lived with my biological father until foster care and she lived with her mother.

I am going to give her some space but I hope in the next month to pursue some kind of relationship with her, rather that's us being together or me being a friend or brother. I really just don't want to lose this women from my life, thank you reddit, you have really made me feel.. human and I honestly feel so much better then I did this morning.

[Update 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1adcqs/update_2i_am_f30_my_boss_m50ish_is_horrible_and/)

TL;DR of the above:
I have a horrible boss, he's run me to the ground and I had been desperate to leave. I found a job but then realized Friday that  I was in a contract that stated even in probationary I have to give THREE MONTHS notice. I have been stressing all weekend because he had asked for a meeting this morning to discuss it. 

This weekend I have caught Flu and feel like death. Non the less, I put on a suit, put my make up on, bought myself a double shot americano and went in to the lions den. He called me into the board room as soon as I walked through the door.

He made a point about how he was in control. How I WAS tied into a three month contract and how he could sue me for the cost of getting a contractor in (£350 a day) to cover my position for the remainder of my contractual notice.

We waived his stupid arms around to show who had the power.

I said nothing. I nodded and sipped my coffee.

Then he paused and said he'd considered it carefully and he is going to let me go next Thursday. He said he's prefer not to give me a personal reference and he is removing my admin privileges (I'm the IT Manager).

Even if he had continued down the line he started, I was going to walk anyway. I was going to break my contract, stand up to him and bid him good day. He did the right thing.

I won't get paid for the bank holidays (meh!) because of my release date and he sent me home today on unpaid sick leave (I need the rest and the sun is shining in my city today :) but I don't even care. I'm FREEEE. I can't stop smiling.

It's my 1 year anniversary and my SO is taking me for a beach break this weekend. I've booked myself in for a nice long massage next week too.

I've also just had a phone call from another company bidding for a higher daily rate for my freelance services. 

I have learned a lot about how people work through this nightmare. I understand my worth as a professional and I think I'll be a better at standing up for myself in future. Also, I will NEVER sign a contract again without reading it three times.

Thanks for your help reddit x

How do I handle this?",husbthrowaway,630,172,408,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15bb3q/i_f25_just_found_out_that_my_husband_m28_has_been/,"I am shaking as I type this. Yesterday my husband went to the gym and I was staying home wrapping some Christmas presents, and his phone was on the table next to me. It vibrated 5 times in about two minutes. My husband and I are very open with eachother about everything so I didn't think he would mind if I just checked to make sure no one was hurt, because that's what my mind jumps to when I get a lot of texts or missed calls. I picked up his phone and went into his messages. I saw a thread of messages from someone titled ""Cheyenne"" and a badge with a 5 in it to show that there were 5 unread messages from this person. I was very confused because we didn't know a Cheyenne. I opened it and instantly my stomach flipped inside out. I can't remember the messages exactly but it was something along the lines of this:

Her: I can't wait to see your beautiful

Her: face tomorrow&lt;3

Her: Hehe.

Her: Oh should I bring anythnig?

Her: anything*

I scrolled up and there were dozens and dozens of messages, lots of ""You're so cute"" and ""i miss you"" from him to her and her to him. Then something caught my eye, he had said something like ""I just wish you were 18 and this would be so much easier, I really don't want to get caught with you."" and she had replied ""only 2 more years baby. stay with me."" and he said ""i will, you are so amazing &lt;3""

I just started crying. My lover for 6 years was cheating on me, and I honestly felt my heart break when I read that. But what scared me was that this was a 16-year old, and I couldn't imagine how he met her or how long this had been going on and I was just freaking out.

I paced around my house, crying and wondering what to do. I finally decided to call his bestfriend. I told him what I Had seen and asked if he knew anything about it, holding back tears. He said ""...yeah. I'm sorry. She hung out with us a few weeks ago. He told me that he really loves her. And you. I should have told you, I really should have, but I didn't want to stab ____ (my husband) in the back."" I pressed him for details and he basically said that my husband had always refused to say how they met but that they had been seeing eachother for a few months and they had definitely become very serious. He apologized over and over and said that he was very torn on what to do because he knew it was illegal but she seemed mature for her age. I said what about the fact that he cheated on me? why wouldnt you tell me? and he basically said he wanted to but he knew my husband better and it wouldn't have been right for him to do that. Which I disagree with but, whatever. He then asked me to leave him out of it and not tell my husband that he told me anything about it.

He has been acting completely normal for the past few months, just ""going out"" a lot more, and showing a little less interest in taking me out and hanging out with me. I still haven't said anything yet, and I have been having trouble not crying everytime he talks to me.

Please help. I have no idea how to handle this. I know I should confront him but what should I say? Should I stay with him or move out? Should I tell the police? I just have no idea what to do about this because I have never been in a situation like this before so any advice you have would be great. Thanks. **However I do love him so much and he is an amazing person. He treats me so well and I want to have kids with him and be his forever, so this really is killing me. I dont want to leave him if I don't have to. If he promised never to see her again, could we stay together?**

TL;DR My husband has been seeing a 16-year old girl for a few months now and is in love with her. He has kept this completely secret from me. He is great to me, and it would ruin my life if I had to leave him. What should I do?

I want to thank everyone who left a comment on my post. I don't think I could have done this without you. I'm remembering what a confident fucking awesome business owner single mom I am! 

I got to tell him everything I needed to say, he broke down, but accepted this is how it is. I told him it was the last time we will ever speak. I'm having a friend go to our old place tomorrow to get the last of my things. I've deleted and blocked him on all profiles and skype, deleted every text message, and because my phone is primarily used for business, changed his photo to a picture of a doughebag and changed his name to ""Think of (daughter) before you answer this."" and I know I will never pick up when the first thing I think of is when he would yell at her and his own daughter.

Fuck him. I'm better than this.

1) What did the 4 am text say? 
She said she wanted to come over and pick up things she left in my apartment. The problem is I threw her stuff out it was a pair of pajamas and a broken blow dryer so it was just an excuse in my mind.

2) How could I date already? 
I shouldn't say I've ""dated"" five women. I met up with them for coffee or a quick drink. I am not looking for a gf, it's just nice being around attractive women and having nice conversation. I'm not trying to be a pig and take them all home. 

3)How can I after just four months be at this stage of the ""healing"" process? 
Unfortunately she cheated at the end and had a new Boyfriend two weeks after the breakup. So in the beginning I dealt with the loss of the relationship but at the same time I dealt with her having someone else right away as well, it kind of killed two birds with one stone. Sometimes it takes months for the ex to move on for me it was right away. Also with her cheating it made it easier to not want her back as much as I wanted too it was already destroyed. The girl I knew was gone so the relationship and all that came with it was dead as well.


My life ""ended"" the day she broke up with me. I cried, I begged, I texted, I did everything that you are all probably going through. It feels like your whole world is turned upside down and you do not know where to turn.

Hang in there, it does get better. The most important and crucial thing you must do is no contact. Trust me, you will not end the pain or suffering unless you take this step. You probably think they were so important that you want them in your life still. They chose to not have you in theirs anymore. It's time you do the same. 

It's hard and it's painful, but that's ok. You will come out of it stronger. I thought I was going to marry this girl, but now I thank God that we are no longer together. I'm in the best shape of my life, I've dated 5 different women since the break-up. I didn't jump right into dating, I took the time to be happy as me again, it's important to take the time and reflect on the things you did wrong. I know I made mistakes but I learned from them and I became a better man for them. 

It's a struggle but keep your head up, hang with family, call friends up you haven't seen in years. Go to the gym, being healthy physically will help more then anything else. 

I got a text from her at 4 AM last weekend, and I was able to laugh and delete it. 4 months ago it would have sent me spiraling into depression. I no longer need someone in my life who doesn't want to give me what I deserve. And you all will come out if this better and find someone you deserve. Hang in there it does get better.

Lastly I want to thank all of you strangers on the Internet, I can honestly say without your advice and stories I would not be where I am today, you guys were my best friend through my break-up. I wish you all the best and hope to come back soon and see another story of someone who fought through the struggle and came out on top. Take care.

Help me.

**edit**
We've been together for two years.

**edit 2**
He's coming home from work in an hour or so. He's still there (it's a pub). I am having difficulty calming down. I've been having contractions all day and he knows this. I was teary eyed earlier because I was feeling weirded out by his behavior and was communicating with him about it. I wasn't accusing him of anything, just expressing how I felt something was going on and HOW BAD I FELT FOR FEELING INSECURE. He denied anything was going on and reassured me. Then he went to work, where he promptly picked up on Facebook where he apparently left off with this woman on his phone. I snooped, yes. IDGAF; I was right to. He lied to my face seconds between requests for an ass shot without panties. I called him and confronted him. He said he had to go, there was a fight or something. I'm kicked off Facebook, the password changes, and suddenly I can't log onto Verizon. I am in physical and emotional pain.

I also have a daughter who is in LOVE with this man. She is 7 years old and from a previous marriage (one where my husband cheated and stopped speaking to both of us). How the fuck. Why the fuck. I'm at a complete and utter loss.

Another kicker? HE JUST GOT HIRED WHERE I WORK.



**edit 3**

So, he came home. He proceeded to *imply* that his boss was the one doing the sexting. His boss is also in a relationship with a girl that is DUE IN AUGUST. He said he wouldn't throw him under the bus, his excuse for not explaining wtf I saw. Over and over he repeated that he wasn't cheating, I am enough for him, he loves me, he loves our family, at some point I have to stop convicting him of cheating over and over, etc.

I feel like a CRAZY person. Now I'm having second thoughts as to what I saw. Which DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I feel like barfing. He is now asleep. I'm on the couch. I have to be at work in five hours. I don't know how I'm going to do this. He is wearing me down. I can't wrap my brain around any of this. The baby's feet are in my ribs, and my heart is in my throat. I really appreciate ya'll helping me, talking with me... I'm exhausted. 


**edit 4**
Surprise, surprise. He's changed the passcode to his phone as well.


**edit 5**

I wanted to clear up some confusion. He DID cheat on me previous to this situation:

*I'm sure it was him, I recognized the picture of him in his underwear; he's sent it to ME before.

*He's cheated before, yes.

*He was keeping it in his pocket, when he got home, he stayed outside to text. He'd also been deleting his texts (which, since his past indiscretions, he'd agreed not to do, I took as a red flag).

*He's now saying that he can prove he didn't do anything, but in order to do it he'd have to hurt someone else, and ""he's not willing to do that"".

1367894577.0,449,self.relationships,1du69q,My girlfriend[F27] of 9 years is on a walk with another man[M50's] and she doesn't know that I[M25] know the truth.,sman28,579,130,262,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1du69q/my_girlfriendf27_of_9_years_is_on_a_walk_with/,"Well it is kind of a long story but basically we have been together for 9 years now. She is a female, 27 and I am a male, 25. We have lived at this current apartment for about 6 months now. 

She started acting weird at the beginning of April. It was up and down, one day she would almost avoid me and the next day she would be loving and affectionate. The days she avoids me sure makes me feel like crap, because she says things to push me away like she doesn't want me around her.

Well there has been this co-worker of hers who I believe is in his 50's. When I first learned of him she made sure to note that they are just friends and that I wouldn't be jealous because he is old. Maybe she was being honest and just wanted to be only friends with him at first, or she was playing me like I'm an idiot... who knows...

Well anyways this last month has sucked to say the least, I thought maybe I haven't been giving her enough attention or something. So I started making sure we have been doing something, anything, together at least every other day or so. Basically tons of date nights all month long. On these dates she acts pretty normal and seems appreciative... but then soon after she is back to the ups and downs. Any time I asked her what was wrong she would just beat around the bush and just say she needed ""alone"" time.

Now during the beginning of April she quit her job she had with that older co-worker for a new job that pays a lot better. Oh and I should mention, that co-worker, he lives in the SAME apartment complex as us... Well anyways she has been spending a few hours about 2 days a week with him, either going on walks, going to his place for lunch to chat, ect.

I knew something was up, I've known her for too long to not know something what out of place. And this 50 year old dude hanging out with a 20's girl is... well... creepy! At least it feels that way to me.. Doesn't help my dad is a bit of a pervert in his early 50's... I just realized he's older than my father... ugh. Well ANYWAYS... I went to use her restroom once (we have two baths her, I kind of took the other one while I gave her the master bedroom bathroom) and noticed a book on the floor.. a secret diary she apparently had...

Normally I would NEVER read someones diary, even my partners, ever. But I've been so stressed this last month I swear I'm absolutely surprised I haven't lost all my hair. So I just took a peak at a random page and that is where my fears were confirmed..

In the diary she says basically she has feelings for this ex co-worker of hers. And she has used this diary strictly for writing about every visit she has had with him such as the walks shes been going on with him. It is how she feels about how it went and if he will ever see her as more than a friend. I knew something was going on but reading this made my heart snap in two.

In the middle of our relationship I should mention we broke up for about 2 years and got back together 4 years ago. We were young and I just marked off us breaking up as us just her not knowing what she wanted because of us being young at the time. Now I feel like an idiot.

Basically from what I got from the diary she wants to be with this older guy but he isn't giving the signals she's looking for and seems to only want to be her friend. This guys ex wife cheated on him with another man and left him for this man. Strangely he is friends with this other man his ex wife is with now, he says he does it for his kids but he also mentions he still loves her. That is what my girlfriend told me anyways. So maybe he isn't acting on her signals out of respect for me since he went through something similar... who knows. Or maybe he really isn't interested.

Either way from what I read it sounds like she doesn't want to leave me though if she can't be with him... Sure feels good be be second! Especially to a guy that could be her father.. no offense to those with age gap relationships, if you are both happily in love I'm really glad for the both of you, just sucks to be in this position.. I guess I'm kind of angry and my heart is a bit torn apart right now. :(

So that is the situation... she is on a walk with him right now and I just couldn't take it anymore and had to tell someone, so I'm here telling you guys and gals... I hope you have some good advice for me because man I need it right now.

The worst part right now is that I can't stand the thought of him touching her in ways only I have since I'm the only relationship she has been in... I know it's weird but thinking of the idea of him kissing her, and everything is killing me.

She could do so much better than him too, not because he is older but just the kind of guy he is. He is nice to her and I think she likes the attention but I know this is just lust she is feeling and will fade real quick if they ever got serious.. and I can see her getting hurt in the end. I should be mad at her and not care she will get hurt but I still care deeply about her.

So the fact she is basically cheating on me in my mind, the fact that this other guy would never treat her the right way, and the idea of him touching her is killing me, I'm just a mess right now. Also I made the big mistake of getting 3 joint credit cards filled with debt with her so that'll be interesting if we break up again... 

I want to be with her til the day I die, or at least I thought I did... but I have no idea how to repair this. I tried for a month being romantic and taking her all over to fun places and making sure she felt loved and now I just feel like I have no choice but to stand aside or she gets mad at me complaining about smothering her.. What to do? I feel like if I'm blunt and bring it up with her she will just panic and end the relationship.. she'd be the type to do that..

Sorry this came out so long, I did not plan for it to be this long... She is still on the walk and now it is dark out... &gt;_&lt;

My eyes are too watery and red to re-read this for errors, sorry if there are any.. it sure is hard hiding this pain from her when she is around, acting like everything is fine..


**TL;DR 27yr old Girlfriend of 9 years has crush on 50's year old ex co-worker, been going on walks together, since he lives in same apartment complex, for past month. Found diary that said she has crush on him but she isn't sure he wants to be more than friends. She doesn't know I know, and thinks I think they are only friends and that is all she wants to be with him. I want to stay with her but she just pushes me away when I try to do stuff for her to make sure she feels loved.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As suggested I'm going to copy and paste my updates here I made below... hopefully I'm doing this right... 

**Update 1 (kind of just more details about her childhood, in case it is relevant):** She had a rough childhood... her mom was crazy, like yelling at the wall and tv, she had some mental issues and refused to see a doctor.. her dad slept in a separate room because of this and he basically ignored her mother. Her mom would lash out verbally to her from time to time and she would have to use earplugs in the night so she couldn't hear her mom yelling at the tv or something. Her father has apologized recently to her about how he tried to ignore the way her mother was acting. So not sure if she see's this older man as a father figure or something..
In fact she told me later after we got back together that the phone call I answered when she called me right before we got back together when she was all crying, she was seriously thinking about committing suicide and talking to me saved her life.. (EDIT: apparently she locked herself in her bathroom for almost 3 days). Ever since she moved out here with me she never got depressed again, now that she was away from the toxic home situation she had.

------------------------------------------------

**Update 2:** She just sent me a text saying ""I'm gonna hang out for a bit longer. Is that ok?""
I'm sure they are hanging out at his place, too late to be chilling on a random bench..
EDIT: Thanks again for all the replies, I'll keep you guys updated on what happens... I'm gonna try to take the advice here and confront her... if she gets home anytime soon..

------------------------------------------------

**Update 3:** Well here is the update. She got home all cheery and calling me sweety like nothing is wrong... she ran off to the bathroom before I could say anything, which I'm assuming was to go and use her ""bathroom diary"".

When she came out I told her we have to talk. I started to ask her questions giving her a chance to fess up and she admitted that there were some problems and I told her we are going to sit down and talk about it tomorrow. I think she was surprised how serious I sounded and didn't expect it.

I felt really angry when I saw her come in, which surprised me (I am not an angry person at all in the least bit), and realized I need to collect my thoughts so I told her we are talking soon as we wake up in the morning. She's sleeping on the couch right now..

I have the journal with me now and will show it to her when we get up.. this should be interesting..

Thank you for all the advice, I was really upset at first and my self respect did go down the toilet, even started giving myself ""what if's"" like if I could of done something different to prevent this. I'm glad I am settling this now and not dreading it for who knows how long hoping for it to fix itself.

I'll update you all really soon if your still around in the morning! I'm sure I'm going to need some advice after we talk..

EDIT: I'm not sure if I should look and see her newest entry from today... not sure I want to know. I have a pretty good idea already what I'm going to say to her now. I've pretty much accepted what is going on now. ;p

--------------------------------------------------

**Update 4:** I barely got any sleep and stayed up really late because of all this. I'm really tired but I was going to confront her about it anyways right then, but when I started to ask her the questions and she admitted finally that something was up (I think she realized I knew something) I could feel myself getting angry because I trusted her so much and as stupid as this sounds I didn't want to say anything I'd regret.

My head hurts and it is hard to think clearly right now... she knows I'm upset and that I'm serious so she stopped trying to beat around the bush and is realizing the reality of everything I believe. If she tried to dodge my questions I probably would of said that's it right then and there but she was forward with me.

I feel like some sleep will do me good and I think I already feel better enough since I started to confront her about it that I can actually rest a bit. I think I'll be able to say everything I want to clearly tomorrow...

It'd be nice if we could remain friends after all this, being we had so much history together including prom, but I just don't know right now if I can do that.. I think that is what hurts most of all.

I really feel like you all helped me confront her with this, thank you so much. I'll let you know how tomorrow goes.

----------------------------------------------------

**Update 5:** I read it.. Basically says he is moving in 2 months and he wants her to be his room mate. She asked him if he thought they could ever be more than friends and he said yes. He also said to her that he was really close to kissing her... and he said he was very attracted to her. Then she goes on to say that everything she wanted to happen or hear happened. And finishes it with ""Now what... this is a lot to process.""

Had a feeling it was something like this being she was gone for so long on a ""walk."" Well I guess this just solidifies everything and there was no hope and it is time for me to move on.. trying to stay strong now.. I knew I was pretty much ending it but still hard to read this.. why him of all people... I feel a bit nauseous..

I guess I gave him too much credit thinking he was being respectful of my situation.. but I guess if it wasn't him it would of been someone else. I just wish she was single for awhile, somehow I feel that would of helped me get through this..

EDIT: She mentioned that he said he had a room mate for 4 months once and it was a FWB situation and he preferred that more than a relationship. I have a feeling he's having similar ideas with her now. I don't know if I should try to help her realize this or just focus on getting out of this situation and leave her to figure it out..

------------------------------------------------------

**Update 6:** wow... this post got a ton of comments... I'll make this mini update then start reading these replies..

So I just woke up and she is still sleeping. I think I'm glad I slept first, my head feels a ton better.. but now I have so much going on in my mind. I guess what I'm wondering is exactly what to ask her..

I'm gonna start reading some replies and post again.. someone mentioned last night to update the main post with all the updates, i guess I'll copy and paste my comment updates up there.

Thank you everyone, I really appreciate the help.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Update 7:** I read all the posts and man there is a lot to take in and a lot of really good advice. She is still sleeping which I can't believe being 5pm already.. She goes into work at 11pm, she starts her new night shift so maybe she is trying to make her new sleep schedule or something.

First off I saw this whole her being a virgin thing got quite a response.. when we were first together we got really close to doing it but it started to hurt too much before anything got.. erm.. in... and she paniced and it stopped right there. We always planned to return to it and try again but she has always just been too scared. She has like super sensitive skin, you can poke her in the arm and it hurts quite a bit to her so I don't know if that has something to do with it.

I've tried to get her to see a gyno (she never has) but every time she got close to going she chickened out because she thought the thing they insert was going to hurt too much and she is also SUPER shy about being touched, if someone touches her she jumps.. it took a month or so before she was comfortable enough with me to touch her like normal couples do.

Well anyways before we got another chance to try again that was when our break of 2 years happened. Then we got back together, her mom hit her in the arm during an argument when her mom was having an ""episode"" of mental instability.

I had her drive down to where I live and she moved in with me when I was living with my parents (it is a condo that is separated for a room mate I guess, even your own water heater and thermostat). I got pretty sick for quite awhile, Crohns to be precise. After a year or so I finally got it under control and happy to say I've been healthier than ever, ever since. Then we focused on getting our own place, saving up to move into the place we are in today.

We brought up the idea of sex quite a few times while saving up money and we would buy a new bottle of lube each time (they kept expiring). But she really just kept getting too scared. I don't consider myself a very sexual person but I wouldn't mind sex either for sure(my left hand was my fwb.. lol). So I just never really ""pushed"" her hard for it. We made it kind of a ""prize"" to get our own place together and we would do it then, which looking back I think was just more of an excuse to put it off and she was still scared of it mentally. 6 months into our new place and we still haven't, I just figured eventually she would be ready, maybe go see that gyno and we would try it, heck I thought she wasn't going anywhere so what was the hurry... and the idea of waiting for marriage popped up a few times but it was just more of an excuse to put it off..

And no I am not religious in any way what so ever, neither is she really, maybe just some spiritual beliefs.. her parents are kind of Christian, and the rest of her family is SUPER Christian.. I guess her family use to live in a village in China before they came over to the US (she however was born in the US) and it sounds like it was quite a Christian village.. but her herself is not religious at all really..

Well anyways she is still sleeping and getting ready to say what I need to say, I'm basically gonna tell her to sit down at the dining room table and we are gonna talk. Then I'm gonna ask her what is going on, and I can tell something is wrong. And hopefully she starts spilling the beans. I'm going to ask her WHY she has feelings for this man. And then I'm going to ask her where we go from here....

Well that is what I got so far, we will see where it goes... I have a feeling I'm going to start crying when I start talking to her about this, do you think that is a bad thing or should I be trying to act tough? I really don't know if I'd be able to if I wanted to...

Edit: Btw I don't know if this matters but we do have rings and we were planning on getting married but we just wanted to make sure we had enough money to have a nice one and it wasn't super important to be married, as long as we were together that is all that seemed to matter to us at the time. Heck we even talked about possible kids in the future, but again wanted to make sure we were financially stable with a house we own before considering it.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Update 8:** Damnit, I finally built up my courage to face this and she shut down and refused to talk about it. She wants to wait til she gets back from work and doesn't want to do it 2 hours before she has to leave for her first day of training at night shift.. I told her to talk about it now and she refused and went to go get ready. I'm leaving to my cousins right now, I'll use the computer there to read any more replies here. I'm too mad/upset to stick around while she gets ready for work.

Edit: Clarifying that I will still be here on cousins computer to read/reply to more replies.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Update 9:** Hey all, sorry for leaving you all hanging yesterday.. I will be making an update really soon here. We had a hell of a talk, and it was a damn good one, that is for sure. I totally had it planned out to go in my head one way but as I started to talk I realized a lot about myself and it went a whole other direction.

Are we staying together as a couple? No, we are not.

I will give you all the details really soon, but we've been talking all day and my eyes really, REALLY hurt right now. I'm going to shower and I'll be back in a few hours for the full update..

Again thank you all so very much. You may all be internet strangers but I feel like you are all close friends to me in some weird way now, because you all helped me get through this and to actually bring it up to her. Otherwise I might have kept it balled up and pretending everything was okay.

Thank you.

------------------------------------------------------

**Update 10:**

Okay, for the full update now. Well I put off the talk yesterday, I was going to tell her soon as she got home but as it approached I started analyzing our relationship and how I personally felt about it. With this whole old dude situation aside I realized I wasn't really happy myself.

While we have a ton in common and I love her so much, our relationship really wasn't working the more I thought about it. I think a lot of it has to do with the difference in maturity between us. I was never treated with much respect and the affection you would expect someone you're in a relationship to have for you, just wasn't there.

It hit me then that we make much better friends, as hard as it is for me to admit this. We have so much history with each other and we have so much in common we really wanted it to work.

I realize now that I deserve much better. I'm always looking out on how to help others and so focused on what others want that I never really looked at what ""I"" want. And looking back I wasn't treated the way one should be, especially in a relationship.

I went in the bedroom and saw she was awake. I laid down and asked her about her day. I asked her if she wants to talk about what is going on and she replied with ""No"" while looking away from me. I ask again and she quickly replies again with ""No."" We laid there for about 5 minutes quietly and then she starts bawling. I start tearing up a bit.

She asked how long I knew something wasn't right and I told her a month ago I could tell something was up with her. Which she replies with ""You know me so damn well"" and I said ""I know."" I explained what I realized and she agreed with everything I had to say. We both laughed a bit while passing the tissue back and forth.

We talked about what we want in life and she realizes now that she needs to focus on herself. What she wants to achieve and where she wants to be. I helped her realize that she is trying to fill the void of being unhappy with herself with a relationship, and that she needs to achieve where she wants to be in life, then share that with a partner, rather than trying to use a partner to fill it.

So we are giving our two months notice to the apartment complex and moving out. We are going to try to remain friends but we will see how that works out.

I feel sad that it couldn't work out but excited for what the future holds for me. I'm going to focus a lot more on me now and hopefully be able to share my accomplishments with someone I truly love and who truly loves me.

I am content. :)

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart reddit. You guys and gals are awesome.

Edit: Just wanted to note that we both decided that neither of us are going to get into a relationship anytime soon and we are both going to start focusing on our lives to better ourselves first.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1368183422.0,,,True,t3_1du69q,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1du69q/my_girlfriendf27_of_9_years_is_on_a_walk_with/,
1355318849.0,445,self.relationships,14q2m8,UPDATE: I [28] found some mildly inappropriate text messages on my wifes [29] cell phone from a groomsmen from a recent wedding she went to.,fiend_factory,578,133,204,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14q2m8/update_i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14nx3z/i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/

First I want to say thank you to everyone who gave their input to my situation.  I appreciate the wide range of opinions and points of view and this really helped me approach this situation in a manner that was calm, rationale, and level headed.

First, my wife felt that me posting what had happened was hard for her, but she understood why I did it.  She appreciated the fact that I wanted to approach this situation calmly and not in a way that was out of anger and hate filled emotions.  She also appreciated we could work this out without bringing friends and family into the fold.  She did say it was hard to read some comments because this small incident portrays her so badly in what is a very small and focused incident in a deep and long relationship that has multiple behind the scene things that people just don't know, but she understood why people said what they did.  Everyone saw my side of the story, other people warned about this, and Reddit defended one of their own.

After work I came home and we had a very long conversation.  She told me up front that nothing beyond what I know had happened, and what she did was in poor taste, slutty, unbecoming of a married woman, and flat disgusting.  She told me she was very sorry and that she never meant for this to be so hurtful to me.  We both agreed that our blurry boundaries need to be redefined and she admitted at first she didn't see a problem but realized afterwards, before coming home, how that what she did was very inappropriate and felt she owed it to me to be honest.  A mutual friend of ours (the bride in this case) talked to me as well and said things did go to far but nothing happened beyond what I know.  While some will say that something like that could easily be planned and friends lie for each other I doubt this is the case.  Her friend was very happy that my wife did the right thing and she had encouraged her to just be honest about this and tell me when she came home.  She showed me the text messages her friend had sent and it all lined up with what I was told.  She had removed everything to do with Steve from her phone and she agreed that if he was to contact her again she would inform him that they will have zero contact, period.  My wife also wrote a letter (she is the only person I know who still writes physical letters) to all of the bridesmaids apologizing for her behavior and poor example she set and the disrespect she showed towards me and our marriage.  Rarely does she seem sorry but last night she was broken over how upset and hurt she made me.  She went as far to make one of my favorite childhood meals that absolutely disgusts her, fucking Hamburger Helper.  Other issues came to the surface as well that we discussed openly and honestly that helped fuel the aftermath of this incident.  Mostly we discussed that we need to continue to work on my insecurities and emotional baggage I carry from previous relationships.  She has no interest in Steve or other men and I need to understand that.  I am the man she married and there is a reason for that.  She was really worried I would come home and want to divorce her, she knows from things I have said and how I have reacted to other things in that past that I have zero tolerance for cheating.  Some may feel what she did was cheating, and while what she did was grossly inappropriate, this is not cheating to us.  We are very open sexually and somethings we do together or consider ok would not be ok or appropriate to others.

Someone did make a comment last night that pretty much summed up exactly what she felt.  She has recently begun having a hard time dealing with the idea of turning 30 soon and getting older.  She said she has had a hard time talking to me about  this because when she brings it up I just tell her she is being stupid and needs to get over it because 30 isn't anything.  She admitted she likes the male attention more so now because it makes her feel like she is still attractive and desirable to other men.  She also admitted she was lonely over the weekend and the alcohol fueled party atmosphere with her old college friends getting laid and her going home alone caused a lapse in judgement on what we define as okay in our relationship.  She knows I find her drop dead gorgeous but sometimes that external feeling of, ""I still got it"" makes her feel good.  We discussed I understand her need to feel sexy and wanted is fine but what had happened this weekend was wrong, but I need to work on being more sensitive and understanding of somethings that she is dealing with at the moment.  I was wrong to shrug off her insecurities of getting older, I apologized to her about that.  I am emotional cold, I know this and I try to work on it.

We clearly set boundaries on this sort of thing.  Talk of that nature is saved for us and no one else, and when another man starts showing clear signs like Steve did then it is time to stop and clearly spell out that she is married and that what is happening is inappropriate and will lead no where.  I also clearly laid out the behavior of this nature will lead to a divorce if it happens again.

Some may say that I am an idiot and she is lying, that I just took me hook line and sinker, my wife is a whore/slut, I should divorce her, etc ...  I can understand the point of view but again one short, one sided story fails to even begin to scratch the surface of our relationship.  People fuck up, I know I do a lot.  We have a very good, loving, and honest relationship with each other and this is a mere bump in the road.  After some fun makeup sex we are moving on.

Again, thanks /r/relationships

TL;DR  She fucked up.  She knows she fucked up.  She was honest and came clean, bride corroborated her story.  She doesn't want Steve, doesn't want contact with Steve, there wont be contact with Steve.  Fuck Steve, Steve sucks.  She apologized, we defined boundaries, worked out some other issues.  Hamburger Helper followed by makeup sex.

[HH EDIT]

Some kind soul sent me this link in case you other HH aficionados are unaware: http://chickensintheroad.com/cooking/homemade-hamburger-helper/

I guess there is a silver lining in everything.

[EDIT 2]

Doubt anyone will see this but the plot thickens, turns out someone who saw this knows Steve.

http://i.imgur.com/lKYAc.png

The person who sent that had perfect details the complete match up so I am pretty sure the dude is legit.  Wife naturally says it is a lie but what guy lies about a handjob?  I am at wits end now with this.  I think I just need to talk to Steve directly, he has no need to lie to me.  I deleted his number and the person I know who has it wont give it to me because she isn't comfortable giving me his number and doesn't want to get involved.  I don't blame her, I would do the same thing.

[EDIT 3]

So far the phone number I have turned up is bunk.  I do have the phone number of one of his friends I believe, same area code but I think if I reach out to him for Steves number then I have crossed some weird stalker line.  Time will tell.

I did message Steve on Facebook but it is obvious he hasn't used in probably about a year, worthless.

[EDIT 4]

For the few that want to know the final chapter of this - everything worked out.  Went to the horses mouth and got everything cleared up, had a great weekend with the wife and everyone is happy.  Steve was very defensive at first (he didn't like I was trying to get his phone number, I understand his concern) but he came around, and to give the devil his dues, he was pretty stand up guy about all of it.  Steve on the other hand is quite upset with our friend bro-code-enforcer.  He wants me to tell him who this person is but honestly I don't know, bro-code-enforcer doesn't want to tell me ( I don't blame this person ), and that is the way it is.

First I'd like to say thank you all so much for the great advice. It really made me look at our relationship and think long and hard about whether I wanted it to continue.

To the people suggesting that I should help him by proofreading job applications, etc, I have tried this many times but he is too proud to accept the help. He just won't take it. After trying many times I just gave up. I do believe that yes, he has a learning disorder. I would have no problem with this but he has no intention of doing anything about it which is what I took issue with.

I realize now that yes, he is willfully ignorant. After two years it is not something I could change, nor will it ever be. This is not to say he is a bad person. He has many great qualities which is why I love him aside from this glaring issue.

After reading your posts, I asked him to have a talk. I apologized for the blow up and basically implying that he was dumb. It was very wrong of me and I make no excuses for my behavior. I can be just as stubborn as he is and it's an issue we both need to work on. He accepted my apology.

I explained to him that since I was going to college and he was planning on going to the military, continuing this relationship just wasn't feasible. Another huge problem that I did not mention in my first post is our plans for the future are not compatible. After the military he wants to settle down, get married and have kids. This is in no way something I see myself doing in the near future, regardless of who it is with, and at this point I'm not even sure I want children at all.

It was an emotional conversation, as we had both been each others first love and had experienced many firsts together. But in the end we both agreed it was for the best we go our separate ways. Before I left I helped him take some steps to joining the military, because even though he is now my ex, I still want him to go somewhere in life and not be a deadbeat and I know this is something he wants and will be a good opportunity for him. He is currently arranging to meet with a recruiter within the next week.

I have no hard feelings for him and I wish him the best in life. He deserves a girl who loves him unconditionally for who he is and can overlook his bad traits and not be embarrassed by him and I deserve a guy who can mentally stimulate me and give me what I need from a relationship.

In the end it was a fun first relationship, but something that could not go any farther. Again, I thank you for the comments and the well wishes for college. They gave me the push I needed to end the relationship. I read every one of them appreciated them all. Even you guy who simply commented ""Hodor"".

**tl;dr**: After reading the comments and taking a look at my relationship, I decided a break up was inevitable and what both of us needed.

Sorry. 

Speaking of which she is not really my niece she is my girlfriend's sister's daughter. I've been dating her (girlfriend) for almost 5 years, and they kinda already consider me family her whole family does.

Anyway to the matter at hand. Let's call her Sally, has been teased these 4 or so years ago for having a crush on me, for all intents and proposes, her uncle. I mean she always liked being close to me and touching me and giving me hugs and kisses on the cheek, but I thought that was a little girl being a little girl. I'm 24 give me a break. But this, THIS IS WTF. She flat out sent sent inappropriate pictures, asked me to take her virginity and basically have a secret relationship. I didn't keep it, I deleted it as soon as I got it, and frankly I'm scared. Shit like this puts people in jail or on sex offender list. I don't know if I should talk to her(I'm afraid to be alone with her now) or her parents(not sure what good that will do, ill explain) or get a fucking lawyer. I certainly don't want to become.... ""that uncle"". Your advice Reddit is welcome, but this may sound more like venting. This all happen last night by the way and I have been up all night worrying about it.

I know my girlfriend will have my back, one of the reasons I love her, but I still have not told her. Sally's parents... I don't know where to begin. I'm fine with people who are into polygamy and open relationships and marriages, but you should probably keep it out of the house hold you're raising 2 kids in. Which they have failed to do. I'm not really blaming that but maybe it had some negative effect. I don't know, I'm just shooting out thoughts. Sorry I don't know I just vehemently dont like the idea that my ""fate"" lies in the hands of a 17 year old girl. Fuck. Which is why I think talking to her maybe the worst option yet. Getting a lawyer, I'm not sure what that will bring about. Fleeing the country for 6 months doesn't realistic.

I don't know if its relevant, but sally mother(36) sally father(...I actually have no idea), my girlfriend(27), sally will actually be 18 in December. I'm about to have a meltdown. I don't even know if this the right sub to ask.

My wife and I (both 35) have been married for 2 years and I can't get any peace from her. She literally will not leave me alone for one second at home. She requires my full and undivided attention and usually actual physical contact at all times. She gets angry or creates some sort of drama if I try to check my phone, read a book, or just look out a window. I am not exaggerating when I say that sometimes I can’t even use the bathroom without her complaining and getting pissed off.

She keeps up a continual barrage of noise which is usually 99% complaining, self-pity and talking about whether she is fat. That is not an exaggeration. It would be funny if it wasn’t sending me to an early grave. 

She uses dramas of various kinds to get leverage, sympathy and attention. In the last year she has been through depression, migraines, an eating disorder, suspected food poisoning, allergies, insomnia, anxiety, cancer scares, and various kidney, bladder and lung infections plus a million others I can’t remember. She’s had three jobs all of which have been the worst job in the world for various reasons; each accompanied by months of non-stop complaining. She has gotten into bitter feuds with at least half a dozen people including members of my family, where I either agree that the person is the devil incarnate and enthusiastically join the ranting, or am accused of taking their side and essentially treated like I am the hated person. Sometimes these dramas happen multiple times in a week. It’s nothing for her to cycle between rage, emotional sobbing and then a medical drama in one day, all for unrelated reasons.

Quite often the dramas are blamed on me. For example I’ll cook dinner and it’ll turn out to contain something she’s allergic to which she’ll “discover” after she’s eaten three helpings. I suspect these things are mostly bullshit and used to maintain control over me. For example: in many relationships one person will stay up and read or watch TV or do whatever interests them after the other has gone to bed. Not so in my relationship, that would be too much like freedom. So she uses her “insomnia” and makes me go to bed when she does so I don't wake her when I come in. Yes, I get sent to bed in my marriage. For the same reason she is bitterly opposed to me going anywhere in the evenings. Also she has trust issues because of some bullshit in her past and If I do go out without her (or, God forbid, go away somewhere without her) she accuses me of having cheated on her and subjects me to hours of interrogation when I get home. I have never cheated on her.

She rings me at work. She wakes me up at any time of the night if she needs attention for any spurious reason.

The closest I can get to some peace is if we watch TV together. Then, provided I let her put her feet all over me like I’m furniture, provided I pretend to watch, and provided I am willing to hit pause every time she experiences a need or an emotion, she actually shuts up for small periods of time.

Of course she comes and goes as she pleases and does whatever she wants whenever she wants. But I don't object because the brief times she's out of the house are golden. Sadly she doesn't really have many friends because she is hypersensitive to any perceived insult and usually will take offense at something during a conversation.

Financially she does 99% of the spending and about 5% of the contributing but I actually encourage her to go away on shopping trips. I'd gladly pay for a $5,000 shopping spree if she leaves me the hell alone for a few days.

I know you are probably thinking “get her some therapy”, “stand up for yourself” or ""break up"". I have tried standing up for myself and the result was violent rage, screaming and sobbing such that at one point I nearly called the police. And I got her to agree to therapy after she said she would kill herself if I went out to play squash one day (I played terribly, she survived) but she was not honest with the therapist and then took offense to something she said. Most sadly of all I can’t dump her ass because now she’s pregnant with my child and I will be a good father to that child even if it means putting up with her relentless need for attention. Also I can’t talk to her because she can’t stand when people “judge” her; that’s a “trigger” and therefore off limits, and she claims some abandonment issues to do with her mother. Basically I've tried telling her to leave me alone repeatedly, I've been blunt and I've been diplomatic but it does not go down well (months in the dog box and no change in behavior).

What I’m hoping is that there is some method I can employ, perhaps designed for problem teenagers or psychiatric patients, that works with this type of person and shows them where the boundaries are without provoking a direct confrontation. I want my life back.

ANY advice would be appreciated otherwise I’m going to be one of those guys who spends every waking hour at the office.

TL;DR: my wife needs constant attention and uses drama, self-pity and anger to get it from me. Help!

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19lwkf/update_i_22f_am_staring_at_my_mostly_packed_stuff/)

Thank you everyone for the help and input you've provided me. I've been at my brother's for almost a week now. I visited and told my dad about my single status. He's simply happy to have me back and gave me the whole ""I knew he was no good from the beginning,"" rant. The rest of my nearby family knows I'm back in town.

There's been a lot of information going on from all different sources, I don't even know where to begin. I talked to my ex on Tuesday via phone call. As expected (and since I just up and left, I deserve it), he called me every name in the book. I let him rant and curse. I felt rather numb during the process. I was just tired and it was just something I had to do. I let him rant and them told him that I would not be coming back. 

He asked me why and I basically told him because he doesn't listen to me. He then got angry saying ""Is this really over f*cking clothes?"" (one of the more recent small incidents). I told him if he could only see clothes or dishes and nothing else, then I couldn't help him. I told him so many times that it was about the lack of respect I felt, etc. I didn't feel the need to to through that whole thing for the umpteenth time.

After I was able to get a couple of sentences in, that's when the cursing came (the most of it anyway). I think he was trying to get a rise out of me. I had my brother in the room with me and seeing him giving me calm down gestures helped me keep my cool.

I got ANOTHER call from his mother Tuesday also. Apparently, my ex told her the rent was higher than it actually was. She called me to ask how much I contributed to the apartment (not in a condescending way, I don't think. She just wanted to take care of her son). I told her how much and ended up telling her the rent. So she's pissed for giving him extra cash on top of his half of the rent every month for who knows how long.

She also called to see how I was doing. She's not a dumb lady, and she seems to know I'm not telling her the whole story, but frankly, it's no one's business (no disrespect to her, but I don't like sharing those details, especially to parents). She had a bitter divorce with her husband (ex's father), and has an extreme fear that he'll become like the ex-husband. That's why I wasn't more assertive; I could understand where she was coming from.

I don't know what the story is with my ex's social circle, and I don't care what he tells them. I have no desire to prove myself or anything. Besides, I was only there for so long because of him (I'd finished school earlier). So I'm fine with that.

One thing has left be a bit disconcerted. I told him not to contact me anymore, but he's kept texting and calling (he can't leave messages because I have left my voicemail full). I've been getting a host of texts from my ex, and some of them are borderline threatening. Not blatant ""I want to kill you,"" but ""you're lucky you left,"" ones. I didn't think he had this kind of side to him. It's been dying down since Wednesday, so hopefully this will taper off. If not, I'll change my phone number.

That's where I'm at. I'm probably going to settle in this area at least for the foreseeable future. I'm starting work again soon since I was able to recoup one of my old jobs. I have been social and not been holed up in my room. It's nice to have a host of old friends since elementary near by. 

I'm rebuilding my foundation, and each day I feel tired, but I know I accomplished something. I think I'm going to seek a little counseling in the near future. I want to know why I let myself stay so long and how to stop myself sooner if it ever were to happen again.

That's it, I think. I feel raw and tired. Sometimes I feel like I'm going through the motions, but I feel better at my core. Does that make any sense? I hope so. Thanks again for everyone's help.

I left this morning, arrived at my brother's house, unloaded some of my car, ate dinner, and am now trying to rest.

I ended up leaving a note. I'm paraphrasing, but I wrote that I was leaving, I wasn't happy, and that it wasn't fair to either of us to keep it going like it was. I ended up leaving all the kitchen ware, except the stuff I bought myself. So, hopefully, there won't be any contention. I only took my clothes and books and the things I bought and it all fit in the car easily enough.

The lease on the apartment expires in 2 months. This month was paid and we paid next month (the last one) at the beginning of our lease. We didn't commit to another apartment even though we were looking. I'm thankful for that. He can find an apartment that he can afford on his own.

I don't know what to say really. I don't think it's hit me fully yet. Or maybe it's because I have so much to do. 

Either way, the drive wasn't bad. My brother was home when I got in. I didn't tell him the fine details, but I told him I split form my boyfriend. He's doing well for himself and has extra space, so he said I could stay with him until I decided what I wanted to do. I already have a room here because my brother and I are close and I've visited for periods of time before. It was nice to feel welcomed and have a space.

My ex-boyfriend probably isn't at the apartment yet. I did get a text, and it was to say that he was hungry and that he would be back soon. Seeing it made me laugh in that crazy way. I wanted him to text me for almost a week, and the only heartfelt one I get is for me to make him food. I haven't responded to it. My phone is on silent. According to his text, he'll be back in an hour or so from now.

The sadness in me is still very present, but now I'm starting to feel angry. I feel mostly angry at myself. I can't believe I put up with being so unhappy for so long. I'm upset at myself for allowing myself to be treated in such a way and for letting myself get hurt (both physically and mentally) multiple times. It wasn't that he didn't do things. What he did and didn't do didn't bother me as much as the lack of respect I felt. It was the way he deflected me that stung more than a ruined sweater or dinner he forgot to put away.

I'm scheduling an appointment with the OBGYN soon. I just want to make sure everything is okay down there. I honestly doubt he was unfaithful, but it doesn't hurt to get tested while I'm there, too.

I need time to work on myself and to reflect on what happened. I know I still have to deal with my now ex in some fashion. I thought about changing my phone number, but 1) I don't want to, it would be a hassle, and 2). I'll talk to him and let him know it's over. I don't know if I'll answer tonight if he calls. I'd be lying if I said I will or won't.

Some people were mentioning to talk with him for closure, but I don't need it. I think I broke up with him mentally a while ago. I am sad and upset, but there's nothing I want to say to him. I really, honestly, just want to be left alone. That's why I'm going to talk to him on the phone soonish so he can understand it's over and so it can be done.

I'm thinking of staying for at least a couple of months, so I'm going to find work and be productive. I lived in the area before, so I can probably get into some older jobs easily enough. I'm also an art model, and I could model at the nearby colleges here. My brother and other family members are in the area, so I feel safe and loved.

That's where I'm at right now. Even though I feel like utter crap, the one good thing is that I'm back where some old friends are, and I missed them. It's nice.

I'm going to take time to heal, readjust, and just enjoy my family and friends. My brother has an amazing, cuddly, pomeranian that is cuddling with me as I type. I feel weird, but relieved. Thanks for helping me out before.

TL;DR: I left, feel better overall, and am looking forward to the next chapter in my life. My ex-boyfriend didn't return to the apartment yet. I'll have a phone call with my ex soonish just so he understands it's over. 

EDIT: I left the phone on silent and went to bed. Was a broken sleep. This morning I woke up to 22 missed calls and about 6 messages (my voicemail was mostly full). The missed calls are mostly him, a few from a couple of his friends, and one from his mother. He seems to be sharing the news. His mother was nice to me, so I'll call her probably later. I'm going to tell her it wasn't working and that I had to go. She didn't do anything wrong, and I didn't expect her call (maybe in the future, but not so soon). 

I have to add this in regards to finances. I made the income with my jobs. He is funded by his parents. 

EDIT 2: I talked to his mom and let her know I wouldn't be coming back. We got along well throughout the relationship, and the conversation was completely amicable. I didn't give her extreme details and told her that we grew apart from each other and that it's best I go. I have no desire to trash him to his mom. He's still calling me. I've gotten less than pleasant texts from him, but it's to be expected. He's calling me every name in the book. Then it goes to ""how could you"" to ""come back"" to ""bitch"" and so on. It hurts a bit to see, but his reaction is making me feel better for my decision.

Maybe you can help me out.

I've been with my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last few months, I have had increasing thoughts of leaving him (though, these thoughts started about a year ago). In sum, I feel unappreciated, neglected, taken for granted, and disregarded or trivialized. 

My boyfriend has some great qualities. He's smart, can be caring, and was (until recently) a very compatible living mate.

However, the last few months I feel pushed to the side. He ""forgets"" a lot. Yeah, he'll forget to do chores I ask, but that's one thing. I'll calmly express things I don't want him doing, like not dumping clean clothes in the floor, not leaving dairy products out to rot, how not to ruin my clothes, and so on, but he just keeps doing it. It's cost me money, time, and aggravation.

This one is sexual, so be warned. An extreme one is that he keeps bruising my cervix and I now get anxiety whenever sex is brought up. I communicated this multiple times (and it's obvious when I cry out in pain when he does it), but he says sorry and does it the next time. It makes me feel like I'm just being used and that what I feel doesn't matter.

There are many other examples, but it's like this. I'll ask him to NOT do something and he just says ""he forgot"" and he feels like that gives him a pass. Then he makes me feel guilty for being mad.

He's away right now. He's been gone a few days for family things. I've also expressed (this issue for over 2 years now) that I would really like him to at least text me goodnight at night or call. I know people are busy, but I'd like a small acknowledgement within a day. He doesn't care how it affects me it seems because he just doesn't communicate with me at all when he's gone, and barely responds when I initiate communication.

He hasn't contacted me. And I feel like I've snapped a bit.

Today I cleaned and segregated our things. It didn't start out with any intent, consciously, anyway. I had a spring cleaning fever (which is normal for me), but then i started separating our clothes and stuff. Now I'm staring at a clean place and realize ""it won't take much to finish packing up and go."" I don't own a lot of stuff (he owns much, much, more junk, and I always have to pack and move it because he doesn't like to pack, yeah, another issue).

Logistically, rent is taken care of, so I'm not financially leaving him in the lurch. The apartment came furnished, so there's no furniture between us. We each have a tv, so I'd take mine. The only thing that may have some contention is some kitchenware since many of them were gifts to both of us. I was thinking of just taking what I need, like 1/3 of it, and thinking it's fair. 

I'm staring at it and the adrenaline is telling me to go. I'm calculating it in my head on how to leave. I'd simply go to my brother's house. We're close and he's always wanted me to live with him. It'd be a drive, but I don't care. It's just a phone call away.

I don't want him to even contact me. I'm almost startled at how much I don't even want to see him. I feel no appeal to him. I'm wondering why the hell I'm here.

Perhaps my mind is made up. Or should I not leave? Should I sleep on it? I could still leave tomorrow before he came home.

Is it wrong to just leave? I feel that I've tried to talk to him, so much, for years, and he hasn't listen. I feel he doesn't deserve me even trying one more time.

I don't know what I'm asking, but any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR: Cleaning spree turned into me mostly packing my stuff. I have the urge to leave, for good, before my boyfriend comes back tomorrow.

EDIT: Okay, my mind is made up, I'm leaving. I'm finishing up my packing. I'm taking pictures of the place, just in case. It'll be too late to leave safely when I'm done, so I'm going to call it a night once my stuff is packed by the door. He doesn't come back till tomorrow evening. So I can wake up, finish up, eat, caffeine up and go. It's a 6.5 hours journey to my brother's. I sent him a text, and he said I'm fine to come by. I have a key. I'm just leaving a note, and I'm working on that now. I don't want to wait or have drama. I hope I'll be able to sleep okay.

We are both in our early 20s and generally have an active, healthy sex life. The problem is that I have gotten many urinary tract infections lately, suffered from e. coli twice, and two yeast infections within the last year.

I just recently had my worst infection that lasted about 2-3 weeks, took expensive antibiotics and it finally went away. My boyfriend doesn't feel the need to shower every day. He says just washing his penis in the sink with water will suffice, but every time we have ''dirty'' sex, I get another infection.

We had a huge fight the day before yesterday because he wanted sex but I asked him to shower. He said it's not his fault if I get another infection, it's my body's fault. So yesterday I caved and had sex with him even though he didn't properly clean himself.

Well, today I got another infection. I don't know what to do. He says it's not his fault even though I properly clean myself, shower every day, drink cranberry juice and lots of water.

Is it that unreasonable to ask him to clean himself before sex?

TL;DR: Bf doesn't shower often and I am prone to UTI's. Is it unreasonable to not have sex with him unless he showers?

",Todramolo,541,125,813,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/151ypd/i_40f_am_pregnant_after_unsuccessful_attempts_and/,"Me: 39F
Him: 30M 
Length of relationship: 2 years

For years, I struggled with fertility. I have had countless chemical pregnancies, 5 miscarriages, 1 late miscarriage, and 1 extremely early birth where my son passed away just hours after being born. It was heart wrenching. I was married ( to someone else) at the time and the struggle this created led to our divorce. 

We tried IVF and even considered adoption. All to no success. The adoption thing could have happened, but my husband and I at the time decided to keep trying. 

The death of our baby really shock both of us. I still can't look at a photo of him. It just hurts too much. 

Then my husband got really depressed about it all, and this led to eventual suicide. I blamed myself for a long time. It took me almost 5 years to start dating again. By then I was quickly approaching 40 and ,in what my doctors would tell me, going through a possible early menopause ( hot flashes, hormonal changes). I assumed that my time was up. I wasn't meant to have kids.    

I started to turn my life around and started to date a bit. I even moved to a new state for a new lease on life. I started dating a younger man. 

We used protection, and nothing happened for two years. Then it did. And now I am pregnant. And I am 40 and this might be my last shot at this. 

I found out 5 weeks ago and I kept it a secret from him because I had been in that situation so many times that I couldn't take having to tell someone I had a miscarriage again. I figure it is probably going to happen anyway. 12 weeks rolls around and I see my doctor. I am still pregnant. The traditional danger zone is finished so I decide it is time to tell the fiance. 

He was livid, and frustrated and a ton of other emotions that are completely normal for someone in the situation. He tells me that he doesn't ever want kids and that is why he was with someone like me. 

I understand where he is coming and I consider the abortion just like he asks me to. For three days that is all I think about. We discuss it at length. I even talk to a therapist about it. 

Then one day I am sitting in the park by the river and I see these kids on there bikes and all I can think about it that I want a chance. I want a chance to be a parent, and this looks like it might be my one and only. I am not even sure if I can carry a child to term, but what if this is the one that survives? 

He knows about my past fertility issues and all the problems I had. He even knows about the baby that died. He knows I tried so hard for so long. "" Why do you want to put yourself through that again?"" He says. "" Why are you doing this to our relationship?"", he adds. Like I am the only one that did this.   

I tell him I can't do it. He tells me to choose between him or the kid. I refuse and he leaves. 

I am thinking that I can do this by myself. I have a great job, a house, a savings, a wonderful support system, a 401K, health insurance. I have enough money to raise this kid. It won't be easy, but I can do this. I am ready. My parents have been waiting ages for a grandchild ( I am an only child) are ridiculously happy about this. They throw all of their support behind me and tell me that I don't need anyone else. They say I can do. 

I know I could give this baby a wonderful home. I would love him/her like no one has ever loved a child ever. They would be the most wanted baby in the entire world.

He is refusing to tell him parents or family (even though I know they would be thrilled because they have talked about us having kids with hopeful eyes in the future). He says that he will move to another country just to get away from me, and he feels like I betrayed him.

I understand where he is coming from, but come on. I told him I would never force him to be in the kids life. I would never want that for either of them. I could love them enough for both of us. He says that isn't enough and he would hate me forever if the child was born. He only calls me to discuss the abortion and how much time I have left to get one in our state ( I am 15 weeks now)   

I don't want to hurt the man I love but I can't do this to myself. I can't get an abortion when I know this is my only shot. I just can't. 

Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? Has anyone been in this position?

Notes: I know the risk for me. Although the finance has never discussed it or brought it up. I talked to my doctor. He says the risks are there, especially with my history, but that stranger things have happened. He says he supports my decision and that he would do whatever he could to make sure the pregnancy is successful. He even gave me some information about the risks and facts about my situation. 

Also, I know that in a perfect world he would have a say. I understand, but look at my past. All the hell I went through. I owe it to me to try once more. 

And I understand by doing so that I am walking away from my relationship. 

**tl;dr: Had a bad history with pregnancies and not being able to carry. Got pregnant. Now fiance is unsupportive.  I can support the baby only. I know this will end our relationship. How do I deal emotionally?**

To recap: Questions: 

How do I deal emotionally with a break up during pregnancy?
Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? 
Has anyone been in this position?
Any advice from someone is an older single mother?


Any advice would be appreciated. Kind of new to reddit so please forgive any breaking the rules. They aren't intentional. Thank you!

Edit: Found out I was pregnant 5 weeks ago, not 13 ( mistyped that). Waited until 12 weeks to tell fiance. I am now 15 weeks. 

Edit 2: For the last time, I am not asking anyone here if they thought I made the right decision. I am asking for advice on how to handle the break up. Please read the questions. I have made the choice. It is done. Enough. I am not getting an abortion.   

Edit 3: everyone seems to be adding a lot or filling in a lot of details that actually never happened to justify their stance. Stop that. You weren't there. 

To clarify: he was present at all my bc shots. He saw me get the shots every time I went. I didn't not fail in taking my precautions. I did not get pregnant on purpose.

He knew I wanted kids from the start. I told him, repeatedly.

I never once said he had do anything for me and I have not/ will not force his hand. 

He keeps contacting me to push abortion at me. I never call him.

I waited 5 weeks to tell him because I assumed I would miscarry yet again and wanted to save myself a little grief. Should I have told him sooner? Yes. Why did I wait? See my pregnancy history. 

The kid is here. Well, the pregnancy is here. I am not having an abortion. I already made that decision. He doesn't have to be in his life if he doesn't want to but I don't have to sit around and feel bad about my decision just because he wasn't ready.

Haven't I been through enough already?

I came here for help with a breaking up issue, and I got attacked for my decision and for what people falsely believed I was doing despite my repeatedly assurance that I wasn't forcing him to do anything.

It really has helped me a lot. As much as I'm hurting right now, I can see that things would have been much worse if we had stayed together. A lot of you guys had great words of encouragement and are great examples that there's light at the end of the tunnel. I also appreciate those who tried to provide insight and I will work on growing as a person. And trying to work on several things that I have neglected over the past several years. I travel for work almost 100% of the time, which must have given her an opportunity to cultivate such a relationship without my knowledge. It would have been easy for her to have a double life. I don't plan to confront her fiancé about this situation right now. It's probably better that I take some time to focus on getting better rather than jumping back into that mess. Again, big thanks to you guys.

Please help me. I have loved this girl since I was 10. She was always the girl of my dreams; had all the qualities i could have ever asked for. Shes the only girl i have ever loved. We had been great friends since age 10, but finally had a serious relationship since 2 years ago. In June, she agreed to marry and finally my dreams were coming true. I had gone ahead and planned out the wedding finances, created a budget post-marriage, and even planned our honeymoon (week trip to Bora Bora). I also had chosen a house to live in after getting married and I was in the process of purchasing it.

I turned 23 last Wednesday and i thought everything was going fine. Only that 2 days later, I find out that she was actually engaged to a guy I thought was only her friend. We were planning on getting married June 2014, but she plans to marry the other guy December 2013. She just walked away from me without any explanation. Not even an apology. Now, I'm sitting here alone. It hurts so much. I dedicated my entire life to her and now I have no one to go to. This is consuming my entire life. its affecting me at work. I've lost my appetite and I have trouble sleeping. When I do fall asleep, I dream that she comes back and begs for my forgiveness. Reddit, please help me.

I've known her for about a year.

So anyway, Stepmum and father invited me over for stepsisters 10th birthday.

I asked stepmum what she would like for a present, and her daughter had said a brand of doll , Lala loopsy dolls. So i looked them up and realized they're around $45-$50 each. 

After shopping around online, the cheapest is $40 so husband and i decided to go halves seeing as though we don't earn much money.

So anyway, we go to her party, give her the present and she just totally flips out. Starts being all sulky, and cranky. Then gets upset and says she already had one. Husband immediately took it off of her, and told her that we struggle and our once a week luxury went on a present to her, all the while still screaming and crying.

Now, stepmum is pissed off at husband for taking the toy off of her and giving it to our daughter..

We moved in together together early in our relationship (~2 months) so we could afford an apartment closer to  university. Everything was great for 8 months. Then, her sister [20F] moved in.

Her sister was fine at first. She would occasionally flirt with me, but it wasn't a big deal. All the problems seemed to start after I accidentally walked into the bathroom one day while she was fixing her hair. I apologized and went to my GF and told her what happened. Throughout the day, they both joked much about it (""Did you like what you saw?"", ""I bet it wasn't an accident!""). 

The next few days were okay, then it all became strange. The sister began to wear less clothes around the house (until the bathroom incident, she had never worn underwear through the house). She started walking around in her underwear or see-through clothes, and greatly increased the flirting.

At this point, i talked to my GF and told her it was making me uncomfortable, and she should speak to her sister. She laughed it off and said it's just what she does, but said something to her anyway. This made things worse.

Now, when my GF leaves for uni/out, her sister will walk around the apartment topless. She moans loudly through the house, and will stop to ""stretch"" near me. She says inappropriate things, and makes suggestive motions. She finds reasons to walk into the bathroom when I go (one of the doors to the master bathroom does not lock).

 The worst incident was 4 days ago. My girlfriend had gone to uni, and I was still asleep in the apartment. I woke up to the sister standing naked at the side of my bed, in sweat, and she was just staring at me. Even after I woke up, she stood there for what felt like a long time, then walked out without saying anything. The room smelled very strongly of sex.

I have told my girlfriend repeatedly that I do not feel comfortable around her sister, and she needs to talk to her. My girlfriend ignores all of the things I say, and just says things like ""Yeah, that's my sister."" It is not at all like her, she has gotten into fights because girls flirted with me at a bar or store. The sister just giggles and says ""you like it."" when I tell her to stop.

 I have considered moving out, at least temporarily, but this would be a financial strain on not just myself, but my girlfriend as well. I stayed at my friends house last night, as my girlfriend would not be at the apartment in the morning today. I don't want to leave my girlfriend, but I can't get her to understand the stress and amount of inappropriate things her sister are doing to to me. How do I handle this?

Tl;DR : My girlfriend [22F] doesn't care that her sister [20F], makes sexual advances towards me [24M], while we all live together.
Throwaway account because my girlfriend checks to see what I've posted to Reddit.

EDIT: I talked to my friend, and he is going to let me stay with him a few nights longer. I do not want to lose the relationship - it has been the best I've ever been in, until now, but I went and packed some bags at the apartment, and have them in my car. My girlfriend is meeting me for dinner, I have looked up the words I need - I'm going to try to be very clear with her. If she will not admit there is a problem, I will not go back home with her, I will stay away. I will tell her that it is harassment, and as someone suggested, I will mention a restraining order. 
---
Edit 2: Dinner did not go well. During the meal we talked like normal, she was still just normal. After they took the plates, I asked her to tell me how she about what I was saying about her sister. She told me that I was taking her friendliness and playfulness as sexual. She didn't walk around in her underwear before because she wasn't comfortable around me, and she is now and doesn't mind being around me. She is not worried that I would cheat on her with her sister, and that her sister would deny my requests anyway. She said that I just have a crush on her sister, and it will just go away.
  I told her that I felt harassed, her sister continually put me into situations that were uncomfortable to me, and knew it. I explained that it didn't matter if they didn't mind, that I did, and it feels wrong to me. I explained as much as I could how badly her sister was making me feel. I told her having to tell them both to stop repeatedly should never have happened. I told her I could leave, or her sister could leave. Her response was that I was over-reacting. In frustration, I started yelling at her, and was asked to leave the restaurant. I waited outside for her, but she didn't come out. I went to my friends, she hasn't tried to call or text me. I feel sick, like I've made a mistake.
---
Edit 3: A few updates from today. Still no contact from my GF. Her only update on facebook was 'Major stress"", but was hidden from my account, and her sister blocked me. I went to the apartment to pick up more of my things when no one should have been home, but our driveway was packed with cars, so I didn't stop. I sent a text to the only person whose car I recognized, ""Have you talked to ____?"". No response from her either. I'm just sitting here waiting to see what comes next.

Right off the bat, he started pursuing me. We lived in the same dorm building and we started spending a lot of time together. One night I used his laptop to check my Facebook and I apparently forgot to log off. The next day he confronted me saying he had looked through all my messages and was concerned with one of my flirtatious friend's comments towards me and basically saw him as a threat. At this point we weren't exclusively dating AND this conversation with my friend took place before my current boyfriend and I became intimate. Although I felt he had invaded my privacy, I assured him everything was a misunderstanding and we moved on. He felt guilty about looking through my stuff and he told me I could look through his Facebook if it was any consolation. I told him I didn't care about his Facebook and life went on normally for a couple months. 


Then one day we got into an argument. I don't remember what it was about specifically, but it ticked me off enough that I decided to take him up on his offer and look at his Facebook. Bad, bad move on my part. I was not expecting what I found. The conversation took place the night before our first date. He was talking to one of his guy friends from high school and told him he was taking a girl out on a date the next night. As expected, his friend asked if I was cute. My boyfriend responded with, ""Nah, she's not that hot so we will see how long I talk to her lol. She's a butterface. When drunk she's not that bad but I've had better. On a scale of 0-1 she is a 1. She has a nice personality so I guess that makes up for it"". At this point we were officially dating and my stomach dropped and my face started to burn with anger. 


I waited a few hours to compose myself before confronting him, plus he was also at work. When I did tell him about my discovery he was in shock. This conversation had happened about 3 months prior and he completely forgot he ever even had it. At this point the relationship was so new and I was so hurt that I was ready to end things and walk away because it simply wasn't worth it. But the way my boyfriend responded caused me to stay. He felt absolutely horrible and even described himself as feeling like a monster. He even started to cry and told me how incredibly sorry he was and how he didn't feel that way whatsoever. He said he was just being cocky and trying to sound tough to his friend. He literally got on his knees and begged me for another chance. So of course I gave it to him. He has an incredibly sweet side to him, which makes this other side to him even more upsetting and confusing.


That incident was the first crack in the relationship and it has really caused a whole slew of problems(as expected). To this day, I am still not entirely convinced that he finds me as attractive as he would like me to be. The messed up thing is that I personally do not believe those things about me. I have never had problems with guys pursuing me and I have always considered myself pretty and at least a 7. Plus I love my body. The problem is that I don't think HE finds me attractive. 


The real kicker is that over the last year we have gotten into a few really big arguments. I'd say he has said about 5 or 6 times that he thinks I'm ugly during a fight which leads to what seems like endless tears. And it brings us right back to square one. Afterwards he insists he was just trying to upset me as much as possible and didn't mean it etc. etc. But every time he reiterated those words I started to believe him more and more and trusted and respected him less and less. My confidence is not where it should be at all, and I blame him for it. 


This newfound self consciousness has caused new problems that I never had in previous relationships. When I catch him checking out a girl, rather than shrugging it off like I normally would, it absolutely infuriates me and sends me off the deep end. When I caught him looking at porn, it reaffirmed those negative words that honestly eat me up. With my ex, neither of these things were an issue whatsoever. I saw porn as a normal and healthy thing and even watched it with him. I would never feel comfortable enough to do that with my current boyfriend. When he goes out to bars with his buddies it makes me much more nervous than it should because I'm convinced he will see girls more attractive than me and want them. I don't know what to do anymore and you guys seem to give good advice. Whats your perspective on all of this and how can I move forward?

[26F; 29M]",ExperimentalChild,512,103,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16xbho/my_boyfriend_wants_to_have_a_starter_child_before/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3.5 years. Everything between us is peachy -- except for the concept of marriage. We can't agree on when.

He says we should have our first child before we get married because that will be the ultimate test of whether we will make a happy family. (This would occur anytime after I graduate in May.) So, if we are still happy once the child comes, then we should take the final step -- marriage -- before having more children. 

This does not sit well with me. Besides the fact that I don't want to have an experimental child before making a long-term commitment with a man, I am slightly more traditional, and want to be married first and then have children. 

And besides this disagreement, there is another wrench in our machine. For career reasons, we will be moving out of the country in a year. I will have no job, no foreseeable income other than his, and will be playing the role of homemaker for 4-5 years, until we return to the States. 

If we were to use his plan, it follows that I would begin having children in a foreign country, as a single woman, with no income that is officially my own. I feel it would be risky for me to invest that amount of time and financial trust in him with little indication of whether he is committed to me. (He is offended that I would not simply trust him to provide for me and our offspring, but then I remind him of said trust when he mentions wanting a prenuptial agreement to protect his inheritance from any future spouse. We both just need to feel protected.)

My worry is this: I think when it is time to leave the country, he will begin planning our journey without having proposed marriage. (The proposal is something I know he wants to be in charge of.)  Whenever I bring up the subject of marriage, engagement, commitment, etc, he clams up or tells me not to worry about it; so, I've resolved not to speak to him about it again for a long time, since I don't want to nag, or ruin the potential of a romantic proposal that could be just around the corner. But if he doesn't propose before it's time to go, *how on Earth do I handle this without issuing a contemptuous ultimatum*?

I am simply not comfortable going away with him like this without being married. Or having a child before any of this!

Would that be my cue to break up with him? Or would it be best to make the journey but refuse to have children until I have a job? Or [insert some other suggestion here]?

Thank you for any words of guidance.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the advice and concern. I wanted to clarify that I'm not considering planning a child with my boyfriend before marriage. It's off the table for me, but I mentioned the ""starter child"" (what a dramatic term, in retrospect) to convey to you something he has mentioned in the past about preferring the idea of having kids over the idea of marriage. As far as not wanting to marry before moving away -- this is merely an assumption of mine, because he hasn't wanted to plan for it so far. He is being reserved about my protections as a (potential) mother and the less moneyed party, but he is not cruel or idiotic. My main concern here is **how to handle a lack of proposal or marriage when the time comes**. I think a couple people have said it best: I should simply offer a reminder that I won't be moving to a foreign country without the protections of marriage or job. If we cannot see eye to eye, then I suppose that will be that. Luckily, I have a while to enjoy him before that happens.

**EDIT 2:** I'm reading every comment, but can't respond to each one. All this input is great, guys, thanks. I'll be updating when there are changes. :)

TLDR: I want to be married before taking a risk on moving to a foreign country with my partner for years. He wants to have a child first and then get married later if the family unit works out. Nopity nope nope nope!

My evil boss has a kind of henchwoman  - she is a real ass licker and in many ways just as awful to be around. On Friday she took me to one side and started to have a real go at me for everything under the sun. She is not my boss nor my senior but I took each of her criticisms and addressed each e until she ended up apologising to me.... but then she followed this up with “ [Guy who sits next to her] has just told me that he overheard you talking on the phone outside the office. If you do insist on looking or another job, please be more respectful about it.”

I was flabbergasted. I basically said what I do on my lunch breaks in none of her concern and if my boss has issue he should take it up with me directly because I have no time for passive aggressiveness. I have not handed in my resignation so as far as anyone is concerned I am not leaving.

This weekend sucked.  It got to me really bad. I cried and took my bad mood out on my family and friends... not cool.

On Monday I noticed in my diary that I had an appointment for an electrician to pop around for 10 mins sometime in the morning the end of next week. I emailed by boss asking if I could work from home. I have not requested  this before and many people are allowed to – it’s considered a reasonable request in my office (they even gave me a laptop for this purpose). I was told “To be fair to the company, on this occasion we request you take it as annual leave”.

I came home and had a real heart to heart with my SO. He said he’s happy for me to leave any time I want, we’ll get by and he hates “seeing the sadness in my eyes”. That we’d get by financially and how much he believes in me.

On the back on my WFH denial, it dawned on me that the henchwoman had told my boss about me leaving and I was convinced that I was going to be asked to leave instead (I am on probationary still).

This morning I was a call from a recruiter. There is a company who lives 90 mins drive away from my home who have been trying to recruit a developer with my skills for 3 months without any success. They found my CV  online and are fizzing with excitement about me.

I have a telephone interview with them tomorrow and if that goes well a face to face a week on Friday (ironically when I’m being made to take annual leave!). There are no other candidates for the role and the job spec reads that it was written just for me!

If we like each other, it’s a big pay rise and it’s mainly home working... so I get to be paid more money to do a job I love whilst sitting in my bra and knickers all day :D And I will get to see more of my family too....and no evil boss.

Not there yet, but it looks hopeful and because of that glimmer of hope, I feel so much better about things. I have an SO and daughter that loves me, I’m respected professionally and this will get better!

My  telephone  interview is tomorrow at midday GMT, if the whole internet crosses its fingers, perhaps I might be able to tell my boss to go screw himself :)

**TL;DR: Work has been horrible but got a promising job interview. If I get the job, I can do the job naked if I want.**

**Previous TL;DR:** I (college sophomore, 17F) had a one night stand with an acquaintance from class and got pregnant. I'm not sure if I should contact him to let him know or just handle it myself. I'm also hesitant about telling my parents.

**Update:** I called Planned Parenthood this morning and made an appointment for Friday to talk with someone about my options.  I had already made an appointment with university health center for tomorrow morning for an exam and another appointment in the afternoon to talk with a counselor.  I’m hoping that by the third appointment Friday I’ll have a better understanding of my choices and what I want to do.  

I stopped by the guy’s place after class today and we talked.  It went much better than I expected. He was super surprised yet happy to see me.  I asked him if we could talk so we went to his room for privacy.  I started by apologizing for sneaking out in the morning.  He assured me that he wasn’t mad and that he regretted not making it more clear that I was welcome to stay.  Hearing this made me happy and helped put me a bit more at ease but I was still dreading telling him.  I got about half way through a sentence about my period being late when my voice started to crack.  I tried to keep talking and repress the tears but I couldn’t hold it in.  I went from somewhat calm and collected to a blubbering mess in two seconds.  I could tell he was freaking out, unsure what to do.  I somehow managed to get the words out and say I’m pregnant. As soon as the words were out I got up and tried to flee.  I was a complete mess and just wanted to go home and hide.  He stopped me and asked me to stay so we could talk this through.  I tried to stop crying but I was too far gone.  He awkwardly tried to comfort me and tell me it was going to be ok.  I eventually got the waterworks under control and he left to make us tea and get me kleenex.  After calming down more we talked for almost an hour.  He assured me that I am not in this alone and that he will support whatever decision I make.  I told him about my appointments and he offered to come.  I declined for the two tomorrow but he is driving me to the planned parenthood appointment on Friday.  He was shocked to hear that I’m only 17 but didn’t seem too worried about legal repercussions.  He said that if I do decide to go through with the pregnancy he would talk to my parents and take responsibility.  He also volunteered to drive me to Chicago and pay for an abortion if I wanted but made it clear that he didn’t want to pressure me into getting one if I wasn’t decided.  We decided to keep our options open for now and talk to the doctors to make a more informed decision.  

**TL;DR** I talked with the father and let him know that I’m pregnant.  He’s being super supportive and we are waiting to talk to doctors to make an informed decision about what to do.

Please read [my other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j1r1b/i_35m_dated_her_30f_for_35_years_she_kept_on/) for the extensive back story. 

This one is going to be long as well. 

Had our confrontation. Did not go the way I hoped it would, where she'd break through and just tell me the truth. It went even better. The conversation gave me absolute closure and I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I did the right thing and that there's no looking back.

Let's start from the beginning. I'm walking to our meeting spot. Call her up.

&gt;""Hey I'm almost there.”

&gt;""Oh hi honey. I just woke up. Let's go get some breakfast, all right?”

&gt;""You kidding? We're not having breakfast.”

&gt;""But I just woke up and I'm hungry and I have nothing at home.""

&gt;“Just meet me for a minute and go have your breakfast.“

&gt;“I just got up. Why don't you come up and meet me at home?” (she lives 5 minutes away) 

&gt;“Fine. I've got no time for bullshit. I know what you're trying to do. I'll be up in a minute.“

Come out of the elevator. She startles me by standing right there. Tiniest shorts. Sheer top. Full hair and makeup. Obviously didn't just wake up. 

I come in and sit down. I kind of want closure so I'm somewhat glad we're about to have a long chat. 

&gt;“Well,” I says, “did you have something to tell me?”

&gt;(long pause) 

&gt;“I just want to say... Darling... That I've realized over the past few days... (world's longest pause) that I want to be with you. And nobody else. Let's forget this and have a nice happy future together?“

&gt;“What kind of future can we have when our past is full of shit!”

Should have said something about a throne of lies, but, wit of the staircase. 

Some highlights. Pretty much word for word.

&gt;“But you cheated on me!”

&gt;“I never cheated on you! How can you say that!”

&gt;“Because you lied to me about being with other guys!”

&gt;“It wouldn't happen if we were together! It's only when you leave me by myself and I don't want to upset you...”

&gt;“That's not true. Just three weeks ago we were together. I saw you off and sincerely wanted you to have a great time. You promised to keep in touch and tell me everything, and immediately proceeded to lie to me as you landed.”

&gt;“But we weren't together then.”

&gt;“We weren't together?”

&gt;“By together I mean living in the same house, having a family, planning a future. That time, I just don't know how I felt. I just want to be yours and nobody else's. I want your attention, but when you leave and deprive me of it...”

&gt;“That's not true either. Just last month I told you I'd be flying in on the 2nd. You asked me to come in on the 6th instead so, as it turns out, you could be with another guy for a couple of days. You could have had my full attention that weekend, but you specifically pushed me away and chose someone else’s.”

&gt;(pause) 

&gt;“Don't you have something to say?”

&gt;“I'm thinking it over.”

&gt;“Want to think it over out loud?”

&gt;(2 minutes of silence) 

&gt;“Well?”

&gt;“I'm still analyzing it.”

&gt;(another long pause, then she changes the subject) 

-snip-

&gt;“Listen. You've also constantly left me alone and made me wonder about who you were with. I forgave all that. Why can't you forgive me this little white lie and believe me when I say nothing happened? 

&gt;“Because I know something happened.”

&gt;“How do you know? What do you think happened?”

&gt;“Well let's just start at the very beginning. Just as we were getting serious you were sleeping over at the other guy's house every other night alternating with me.”

&gt;“What are you talking about! I never slept over at his house. I've never even been to his house. We've only slept together once and then we just hung out as friends.”

&gt;“You were never at his house? Then how come there were all those pictures of you at his house on you secret flash drive?”

&gt;“Well, fine, I came over a few times but never had sex.”

&gt;“Then why was there a topless pictures of you sprawled on his bed?”

&gt;“But, but, there was no sex. Not the way I see it. Maybe in your sense of the word but not for me.""

&gt;""What the hell is sex in my sense of the world? What the fuck? A blow job? What?”

&gt;“It was... Why are you doing this, why are you making me say it? I'm not a slut, I'm not a whore. I don't have sex with everyone...”

-snip-

&gt;“All right so what happened in Paris just now for your birthday?”

&gt;“Nothing happened! He's just a friend.”

&gt;“No sex in my sense of the word?”

&gt;“No!”

&gt;“No romantic walks?”

&gt;“Well...”

&gt;“No kissing?”

&gt;(deer in headlights) 

&gt;“So you kissed him?”

&gt;“But I didn't enjoy it! Just made me realize I wanted you. If only you came to Paris like I asked you to...”

-snip-

&gt;“All right. Look at it this way. Say we call up your best friend Natalie and she sits down on that chair right there. The one who keeps telling you to dump me because I'm not good enough for you and I'm never around when you need me?”

&gt;“Why? You want to call her? She'd tell you you're overreacting...”

&gt;“Really? If I told her all of your lies about men, everything I just listed, all your secrets I was counting off and ran out of fingers on both hands? You don't think her eyes would be the size of dinner plates? You don't think she'd ask me the same thing she asks you, why the fuck are you still with that person? Not only that. You'd probably lose her as a friend right then and there.” 

&gt;(This is what finally gets her to break down hard. She loses it and bawls her eyes out.) 

-snip-

After the conversation begins to go full circle a third time, I have enough. I tell her that and get up to leave. 

She jumps up, eyes swelling with tears, and blocks my way. 

&gt;“Don't leave!”

&gt;“Why not? You have nothing I want, and I have nothing to offer you.”

&gt;“... Don't you love me?”

&gt;“What does that have to do with anything ? This is not about love. I don't trust you one bit.”

&gt;(crying)”But why baby, why?”

&gt;“You spent three and a half years lying to me, starting on day one, and you kept on lying to my face to the very last minute.”

&gt;“I'm telling the truth now!”

&gt;“No you're not.  It's not just that you're still lying to me, you're lying to yourself about the kind of person you are. Nothing is your fault.  It's my fault you're driven to cheat. I'm a bad guy for checking up on you. I'm a horrible person for catching you in a lie. I'm a monster for confronting you. Can't you see why I'm done?”

&gt;“But...  Don't leave? Sweetheart?”

&gt;“Can you just let me pass? Please?”

I open the door. She doesn't move. I say”Good bye"" and walk away. 

Feels good, man. 

**tl;dr** Have a long talk with a habitual liar. She admits to some cheating, but none of it was her fault. Keeps begging me to drop the subject and start over. I walk out for good. 

P. S. I mentioned my reddit thread and how I was amazed by the consensus when no one took her side. Two hours after I walked away, I get an innocent little text. ”Hey baby which thread on reddit? How do I find it? Wanna read it."" 

I did not reply.

Help!",Takebreak,522,121,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c7oz1/my_wife_30_wants_to_set_up_an_ecovillage_stop/,"Hi everyone


So a few months ago my wife has a revelation. She's 30 and I'm 35. We've been married 5 years, no kids but we plan to. Her revelation is that the global economy is in its death throes. The result is that governments will collapse and civilization will end. She reckons there's 5 years left.


We aren't even particularly social people, so establishing a community is certainly a new concept. She has been reading a lot of stuff online and has found a group of like minded people but nobody near us (we live in Norway).


A week ago she told me that time is running out. She wants to start now. We have some savings but nowhere near enough to consider this. She believes that oil consumption is killing the planet, which of course I agree with. But she has basically said that she will never drive again and will not consider traveling by plane until a sustainable solution. She says she wants to stop using her computer and other technology. I bought her a MacBook Pro, an iPad and an iPhone over the last couple of years and uses them every day, but she will not consider buying replacements when the time comes.


I'm a software engineer, so obviously technology plays a big part of my life and my entire career. I've travelled all over the world and love it. I can't imagine not traveling, it's a big part of my life. I'm not opposed to the idea of being part of a sustainable community, I consider myself quite ecologically aware.


I don't know how to balance everything out. I feel like my wife will look down on me if I buy new computers or a new phone and will probably be very unhappy if I decide to fly anywhere for work... Clearly vacations are out of the question. I love my wife and respect her views but I don't know how to proceed without ending my marriage.

TL;DR Wife has revelation, wants to completely drop out of society and start a sustainable village, stop consuming any fossil fuels and stop using technology. I'm a computer nerd who loves to travel. Where do we go from here? Please, any advice other than 'leave her'.

Hey everyone, thanks again for all your thoughts and insights, I knew I was right, but wasn't sure the right way to express myself and some of y'all helped me with that and I appreciate it. Some of y'all had some hilarious comments so thanks for that too.

Last night she came over and I immediately took her upstairs to my room to talked to her.  I sat right next to her and held her hand and I said I needed to talk to her because I've had something on my mind all day. I feel like I can tell her anything and before I say anything else, that I want her to know I love her and don't want her to interrupt until I finish with what I have to say. I could tell she got really nervous and her body language changed and she sat straight up and said ""Oh God, whats up?"" and I said: 

**""The idea of getting you a specific gift made me feel as if I was
buying your love and affection. I want to feel as if you love me
because of who I am, not what I can buy for you. I will not accept
this behavior, it's not healthy and not how adults handle things.**

**I think communication is a healthier form to resolve problems.**

**I don't have a problem giving you gifts. It just hurts my feelings
that you are demanding a present to buy your forgiveness for something I think isn't that big of a deal in the first place. To me that means your love can be bought and its conditional and that hurts.**

**Gifts are only gifts when they are given, not demanded.**

**I dont want you to interpret my unwillingness to buy you stuff as an
indication that I'm not invested either. I love you so much, but I know this is the wrong way to go about fixing the problem. You've made a mistake in the past and we talked it out and solved it, I expected nothing in return, as should you now.**

**You are setting the stage for me to give you things
when I upset you in the future - even if it's over nothing. And I refuse to be in a relationship like this. I do not approve of materialism or any form of buying forgiveness when we have an argument. We work it out by talking.**

**I hope you can take this as a learning experience and grow from this. I'm not your father and I'm not going to spoil you. You need to know that right now if you want this relationship to continue. Ok, I've said everything I've wanted to say, what do you think?""**

To my surprise, she didn't even get flustered. She said she had no intentions to hurt my feelings. I said it didn't hurt them, I just don't approve of that behavior. She said she 100% understood. She was sorry for even bringing it up and that she was glad I brought it up and she thinks I was right. Of course she eventually said she was kidding, and I said, no your weren't, be honest, if I didn't get you something and not had this talk you would have gotten upset. She agreed and said that since I put it that way she thinks she was acting stupid and immature. 

So we worked it out, but I was slightly not sure, so later I just said ""You know, I was really expecting you to get angry and leave or at least complain or something"" to which she replied ""That would be very shallow of me, I'm not throwing this away over a stupid gift, I love you way more than that any gift you could give me and I'm sorry for putting you in that situation to begin with""

I personally believe her. But I will certainly watch out for this behavior in the future. If it happens, I'll make sure to end it. Also, the way I've made her seem is terrible. She buys me a lot of things, like groceries, cooks me dinner and we switch off buying dinners when we eat out (as it should be) That is also a reason I believe her. Because she doesn't ever act that way, until now. Also, I let about alot of the email that was very sweet from her, and she said she cried reading it because it meant so much to her etc. I just showed the part where she mentioned the present. All in all though, I have a pretty good understand how a healthy relationship should be and I've been very ""alpha"" in this relationship, not supplicating to her childish behavior (which is rare) and i will continue to be that way, but I do love her and I hope it works out.

Thanks for all your messages. I know this is screwed up, my GF is not dumb but she's a bit sheltered. This is a long update because a lot happened and I'm trying to make sense of it. 

When I confronted her a couple nights ago, she kept reiterating that it is a marriage with no romance attached to it, and that it will be the best day of his life and they'll probably have media attention on it because he was a soldier. She said she will still live with me and still be committed to me. She was saying I have no compassion or understand her intentions and that made her sad. It made zero sense, but I could tell she was being stubborn and trying to justify it.

She let me talk to him on the phone finally. Right away I knew he sounded off mentally. He told me he got his heart broken recently by someone who cheated on him, and was planning to give my GF the ring he got for the other girl. He said he doesn't want the ceremony for himself but for his parents to feel like they have a normal son, because it was their dream to watch him get married. I told him this makes me angry because I was planning to propose to her already and I will never be able to marry her now. I then lost control and told him that if he does this I am going to ruin his life, and then he said calmly that his life is already ruined. He didn't give a shit. I seriously wanted to fight him and I felt he enjoyed having that power. 

So then there was a big argument. Her father was furious about the whole thing and was just screaming at her. He was saying some mean stuff calling her an idiot, immature, delusional. Then after a while after he tears into all her arguments she backs down and says it was never going to be a legal marriage anyway. Her mom kept on defending her saying ""let them do it, it's just for innocent fun, it'll make the boy's year, he was suicidal, blah blah,"" and her father kept saying over my dead body, this is real life not make believe, we spoiled her, she should be focusing on her career etc…. 

I didn't know what to do so I was starting to plan on how I would break up with her. But then the next day she contacts me and tells me the entire thing is dropped. She said it's not going to happen and it was stupid and she was never serious about it, that she just wanted to do good for somebody who was suffering, who she grew up with, but she didn't want it to come between her and me. She said she was being selfish and got tunnel vision. 

Today I proposed to her. I love her too much to dump her. She is a 9.5 and I'm only a 7, I would never be able to do better (I know, looks aren't everything, she is more than just a body). I told her it was on the condition we will have a long engagement and I'm disturbed about this whole situation that happened and that if she didn't come to me with this news today I would've ended the relationship. She told me to just forget it ever happened, and then to prove it to me, she took the friend off her facebook list in front of me and said she won't even talk to him again. 

TLDR: Either the guy relayed to her I was planning to propose, or she really was this naive and her father talked some sense into her. I decided to propose to her and make it a long engagement so I can see if she really is committed to me or will pull something like this again. She also took the guy off her Facebook and promised she won't contact him.

EDIT: I see you're all perfect and don't know what TRUE LOVE is. You all think she is a cheater but she is not. She just has a really big heart. She goes out of her way to help people, even beggars on the street she will give them money. It's a headache still, like she wanted to keep the guy's ring now because it's her 'first proposal ever'. She is really sentimental that way, but I told her that's not acceptable to me and she's going to send it back to him with a letter explaining why she won'to continue contact with him. 

Lastly, as for the comment about 9.5 and 7, I don't see what the big deal is. I said she means more to me than just looks, but her looking great is a sign of the beauty of what's inside her. Everyone wants to be around her and be in her life. It is really hard to deal with that as her BF, always has been. So many times people drunk dial her or obsess about her with tons of phone calls, she still hasn't learned to be able to say NO though and she told me she will work on it, but in 8 years she has never been unfaithful. I want to give her the best wedding now to prove to her I'm worth it, you guys might be right that she was testing me somehow. I do feel hurt and I don't completely understand it, but it isn't enough to dump somebody for just being naive or for wanting to get married. If I dumped her like you all wanted, that wouldn't solve anything.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1355556961.0,,,True,t3_14ue5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14ue5p/update_my_gf_29f_was_proposed_to_by_her_disabled/,

We told her parents today. I brought in my pay stubs and bank balance (and I know my 3,000 in savings isn't enough to support a baby.. I just thought it would show that I'm capable of saving, I don't blow all my money, and also show that I could afford to move into my own place (I have roommates now)). 

Her attitude towards the pregnancy had really changed from the initial panic. She kept texting me all day asking stuff like, where would we live? Would I be able to go to school? Would you take parenting classes? Do I want to go to school? What aid do we qualify for? She was impressed that I had ideas.

But I knew it hinged on her parents reaction. If they screamed and kicked her out, she would be back towards adoption. 

But they didn't. Her dad cried a little and was stern. I felt like trash when he did. And her mom just shook her head and looked sad. They asked what we were going to do.

She said if they thought it was the only way, we could do adoption. Which horrified them. Her mom asked if that's what she wanted and she said she thought it's what they would insist on. They assured her that they would support her and the baby in whatever way they needed. Wow, I was really impressed by that. They really meant it.

So, I told them that I could get us a place and with financial aid she could do college, find subsidized daycare and we'd work like hell to make this work. I had spreadsheets and papers and everything.

Her dad straightened up and said I was an idiot if I thought I was moving his underage daughter into an apartment and making her count pennies to feed her baby. But I wasn't going to get to play weekend daddy either. 

They turned their garage into a den with a bedroom and bathroom and I'm moving in their. She can move in with me after the baby comes. Her mom is a housewife and will watch the baby while my gf is in class, but only in class. They don't even want rent, just for us to buy everything for ourselves.

I'm overwhelmed. I didn't know people did stuff like this for other people. Nothing is in it for them, they are just helping us out. Afterward her dad said he didn't think much of me or even like me. But he liked what he saw tonight and that could change. That it had to change because I was going to be his grandchild's father and his grandchild wasn't going to have a loser dad. He said I needed to go to school, that I wasn't an idiot (which honestly I'm not sure about, none  of my teacher's ever seemed to think I was even average in intelligence) and could start one class at a time but I needed to go.He said I could be a plumber or an electrician or something. He said he would go with me if I needed him to.

I don't know what to say, except that I'm speechless almost. I swear I won't make anyone regret this. I'll do anything.thanks everyone.

tl;dr[update]My(19m) gf (17f) of a year and a half is pregnant. We are really confused and feel pretty different about it. But she came around towards the idea of keeping it, once panic wore off. Her parents did not freak out, they were just sad but they want and insist on helping. I'm moving in, so we can focus on school and the baby. I'm overwhelmed by the support and genoursity they showed us. I won't let them regret it.

1329854533.0,388,self.relationships,pzqvn,Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  A plea from a guy who cheated to those who are thinking about it.,ta929,458,70,411,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pzqvn/dont_do_the_crime_if_you_cant_do_the_time_a_plea/,"This is the deal. I have been married for 14 years, and together with my wife for a total of 18 years, we have 3 children.   Our relationship is almost perfect, we get along, we enjoy each other’s company and we love each other.  However, we have never been compatible sexually as my drive is higher than hers and she has never been comfortable with sex.  Early in the relationship this led to a lot of frustration but I found that communication is the key.  She is now more comfortable with sex, but still has a much lower drive than me.  She never initiates sex and we might have sex once a month – when we do it’s the same thing again and again and really not that satisfying.  Other than that incompatibility, which is an important one, I love her more than anything.  So how do you make something that is hurdle in a relationship and make it worse?  You cheat.

On two occasions, once last year, and once in the first month of this year, while travelling on business I utilized a high class escort service in order to try and fill a hole I had in my heart and in my relationship.  There is no excuse for what I did.  I took a legitimate issue I had with my marriage, and handled it the absolute worst way.  Other than these two indiscretions, I have never been unfaithful in our 18 years together.  After both occasions, I felt terrible, guilty, and that I had betrayed my wife (which I had).  After the second time I did it – I thought about what had happened, realized that it was not fixing anything and in fact was making it worse, resolved myself that it would never happen again.  Dealing with incompatible sex drives is easier than the guilt of cheating if you really love the person.  Meanwhile my guilt was extreme.  I wanted more than anything to tell my wife what had happened as I have never kept a secret from her and believes she deserves the truth.  The only reason I have not told her up to this point is that I know how badly it would hurt her.  Here is someone I love more than anything in the world and I have done something that will hurt her and puts her at risk.  That is something I have been thinking about continuously since the I cheated.

Last week, about 1 month after the last time I cheated, I started exhibiting symptoms of an STD.  Although not confirmed yet, I believe it probably is.  In both times I cheated, protection was used, but there are no guarantees.  I immediately saw a urologist and ran a full panel of labs.  I get the results today.  There is a very good chance that this evening I am going to tell my wife of 14 years that I was unfaithful and furthermore have infected her with an STD.  At this point, I don’t give a shit about my own fears or feelings, my only care is that I am about to hurt someone I love.  

I am not posting this because I want pity, or understanding, and I expect plenty of flames and rage.  I want to reach out to every guy out there who is reading this right now who is considering cheating for any reason.  If you give a shit about your relationship and think there is something there to salvage, don’t do it.  It does not fix your problem and can only cause hurt while putting a loved one at risk because of your indiscretion.  I know I am not the only guy out there that is frustrated with sex in the marriage, what I did is not the way to fix it.  It will not fix your frustration, it will not make your marriage better and make your issues go away.  If you care about the person, it will only make you feel guilty, make you feel like a liar, and put you in a position where you have the option of living your life as a cheating asshole, or hurting the person you love the most.  Talk to your wife, work the problem out, get a divorce if that’s what it leads to, but don’t betray the trust of someone who you love and are supposed to respect.  Don’t put that person at risk. 

I get the results this afternoon.  Whatever they are, I am going to tell my wife what happened.


Edit:  The tests all came back clean.  I am still going to tell her.  I’ve read most of the posts in here.  I hear what some of you are saying about not telling her.  I actually thought about this for some time, just to make sure I am not telling her simply to make myself feel better while trying to relive my own guilt.  The bottom line is that telling her can cost me my family and my life as I know it.  I genuinely fucked up and I put her at risk.  Although my actions do not attest to it, I do have enough respect for her to tell her and allow her to make the choice – give her back the control if you will.  

One last thing, just to make sure my post stays on point.  This is not about telling or not telling your wife if you cheat.  This is about not cheating.  I dealt with the frustration and then temptation for years.  And then in a test of my relationship, I failed that test.  I could have tried harder with my wife but I made the choice to cheat instead .  For those of you in my position, I am reporting from the front, don’t do it.  It doesn’t solve anything, it doesn’t fix anything, the issues are still there and now more complex.  Not to mention you are putting that person in harm’s way without them even knowing.  If you care about the person you are having issues with, try anything else, or consider ending the relationship.  At best, cheating on the person you love is a lose lose and it's just not worth the harm and pain it causes.

1321370849.0,396,self.relationships,md534,Update: Seriously considering having an affair...,hrnitemare,474,78,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/md534/update_seriously_considering_having_an_affair/,"UPDATE: So, after all of the advice I received(very helpful and it made things very clear for me) I decided to talk to him about all of this last night. I told him about the other man, I told him how I was seriously considering sleepign with him, and I showed him this post.

He was angry and hurt, but what I didn't expect was his honest reaction at first. It was of pure compassion. He apologized profusely for not being my husband and partner in every sense of the word. He told me that he completely understood why I would feel the way I do, and he also informed me of his own depression lately. In all of this, I never once stopped to think about how he may be feeling about his wife being so unhappy. My unhappiness has caused him great unhappiness as well.

We have never fought(as in yelling and screaming) but we have had some serious arguements(always with respect) and he said that because I told him about it before I did anything stupid, his respect for me will remain intact. I just never expected any of this. I expected him to yell and be angry and hate me, but what he said and did was the total opposite. He said the reason he refused therapy was because he didn't think he could handle anything else emotionally at the moment, which to me, is totally understandable. This completely re-affirmed why I married him and how much I love the man with everything that I am. He promises to be a better partner and father, and he has vowed to find a job within the next two weeks, even if it's something dead end and minimum wage.

I told the other man that I didn't want to continue a friendship or anything else with him. He told me that he has been feeling guilty as well, and though he wants to still seek the company of another woman, he will respect my decision and leave me be. I did encourage him with the same advice I received here...to tell his wife what his feeling and to really have a heart to heart with her because he does love her very much as well. I am not sure if he will or not, but he is no longer my concern.

I wrote this post because I was so stuck in my head about all of this. Putting it out there for scrutiny and advice has helped me put everything into perspective and helped me make a very good decision. I am giving him a few weeks to prove to me that he is willing to really work on things, but if they do not improve, then I did suggest a trial seperation. I hope it does not come to that, but I will do what I have to do to remain emotionally healthy.

Thank you guys so very much, from the bottom of my heart.

Honestly, he is more like my husband except we aren't married as it would affect some legal issues that don't matter. All of our stuff is mingled. I am part of his family and he is part of mine. We *are* a family. We have our issues but it's more like ""Why didn't you do the dishes"" than ""Why did you cheat on me"". 

Until now. 

Last month, I reconnected with a friend I used to play sports with in HS. He and I were always super close and our friendship picked up with vigor. We texted all day while we were at work. I told him all about my life, and he told me about his. He knew I had a BF, but the last time I talked to this dude, I was in a Poly relationship at 22. I'm sure he assumed I was either still with the guy or in an open relationship. 

None of our texting was flirty until I asked if he got any new tattoos. Well, his whole chest, all the way down his stomach was tattooed and he sent me a picture. It was really sexy. I told him so. It took off from there. This was last week. Now I've been deleting texts, hiding his pictures, keeping my phone on silent while I'm home, and other super shady dumb things. 

He old me our mutual friend (female) still lived in the same town as he does and that I should ""go visit her"". This pretty much means he wanted me to come to him without directly crossing any lines. I fell for it. I call up my friend, ask her if I can come visit. She says yes, and I tell her I will get back to her on the dates. Today at work I get onto Priceline, and get once click away from booking the tickets (CC # entered and everything) and it hits me: This is WRONG. It is dead WRONG. I picked a weekend that I knew my BF had to work. I would have to lie to him. I was lying to myself. I wasn't going to visit an old friend, I was going to fuck some dude I had zero feelings for. 

Now, this guy is a cool dude. He's smart and funny, but not datable in any shape or form. I wouldn't want to. He's a perpetual bachelor. I know he is just a fantasy and the grass is always greener. 

I texted him to tell him that I was monogamous, that I led him on, that I am fucked up over it, and that we shouldn't talk. He understood completely. I removed him from FB and deleted his number. 

I am in shock from all this. It escalated so quickly from ""OMG I MISS YOU BEST BRO BUDDY"" to ""I want to feel your skin on mine"". Ugh. UGH! 

The whole thing disgusts me. If the tables were turned, I'd be wrecked. I am never EVER doing this again. Ever. I will not do something that makes me sick to my stomach. I don't want to hurt my love. 

What do I do? Am I a total shit head? Is there hope? Should I tell my boyfriend? Should I break up with him?

I've ending up teaching him all about tools, car repair, motorcycles, football, snakes+reptiles, chopping wood, building fires, BBQ, etc.  And maybe a thing or two about boxing......

Then the kid tells me today, ""My dad is on vacation.  My mom says he'll be back December 2020.  I ain't got no brothers.. if you didn't show me this, no one would've.""  Hit me right in the feels.

(20m, 20f)      

We had an angry pseudo-breakup conversation about how to proceed when she moves back to a town about 3 hours away from me. The conversation and the ensuing thinking period showed me a few things very clearly:

1. I don't really want the relationship anymore, and would much rather prefer to be on my own. 
2. She is much more invested in me than I in her. The thought of breaking up sent her into an unhealthy panic attack.
3. I'm not very committed when it comes to breaking up, and I often flake out. 

So my questions are this: how do I properly end it when 3 days ago we came to a shaky agreement to just see how we felt going forward? How do I keep her from going into a tailspin of sorts? And how do I resist the common attempts to negotiate?

TL;DR: Girl moving 3 hours away, I'm not so invested in the relationship. How to break up if she is going to freak out.

UPDATE: Broke up last night. She went a little nuts, and mentioned that she was considering hurting herself. Eventually I had to go, but I contacted her friend to tell her what happened, and that I was worried about what she might do. All in all, she took it very, very hard. I was firm, however, and stuck to my very honest reason that it was no longer something I wanted to be involved in, not because of anything she did, but just because it was no longer working for me.

UPDATE 2.0: Wow, there's a lot of action here. Much debate on Throwfromhere's comment, which is great. I think the comment was well thought out and comprehensive. Much of the debate stems from the fact that there is no reasoning behind it - this is precisely my problem, as I can't point to anything in particular about the relationship that went wrong - I just changed and faced upfront what I feel like I need going forward.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_sx5hf,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sx5hf/breaking_up_at_the_end_of_the_school_year_girl/,

Wife (31F) says she won't live in the same place as me during chemo",cancerdisliker,509,128,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kd4ya/i_32m_diagnosed_with_aggressive_testicular_cancer/,"My wife and I have a 2 year old. We've been together for over four years. Everything was great until she got pregnant. Afterwards she suffered from post natal depression. We have been in counseling. Things had improved immeasurably, there was still more ground to cover though. Her mother lived on the same property in a self contained flat. She had been a very dominating and controlling influence in her life. I did not understand its extent until after I invited her to live with us. She had been ignoring both us and our child for months and also stopped paying rent. She would run away from me when I tried to talk to her. It became impossible. I was shocked and very sad at this.

I was diagnosed with a testicular tumour that may be cancerous (it was) right as the conflict with my wife's mother peaked. The day I needed my testicle removed, her mother said something terrible to her, so bad that she still hasn't told me. I stayed as strong as I could that day but late that evening she began to cry about her mother. It was past our child's bedtime and I didn't have the ability to support her, I was in too much pain. She got more upset and began to shout that I was kicking her out. I told her I just needed rest. The nurses came in after she left and comforted me. That night I texted her mother, as she doesn't answer my calls. I told her she had to leave.

She moved out and locked the doors and took the keys. It took a while to get in, but when we did we saw she had left all of my wife's childhood mementos that her mother had collected over the years. She wrote a very bitter letter to my wife. She didn't let me read it. I helped my wife as much as I could during this time. I held her, I listened to her, I gave her all the love I could. My mind was on cancer admittedly, but I know I was there for her.

Since then, although she agreed that she had to go, my wife had been struggling. She didn't ever want to talk to me about it, what was said. Since then, my cancer has been discovered to have spread to my lymph nodes. I am to start a 4 round course of chemo, starting with a 6 night stay.

Since my testicle was removed, I have become more tired, I can't think properly. Sometimes I get upset. When my wife gets upset or shouts at me, I get angry. I know my hormones are unbalanced and my wife knows this too. The stress of all of this is hard on us, but she occasionally takes things out on me. I get upset, then I get angry.

When I get angry, I try and move away from her
I tell her I need space, I need to be alone. At these times she will follow me through the house, sometimes shouting. She will carry our child. He watches us fight.I beg her to stop, to go away. She will stand and shout or bang on the door I'm on the other side of. It's too much for me to bear.

Recently, we fought again. This time, our child was asleep. She told me she couldn't let our child witness my anger, my rage. She thought I would be better off moving closer to the hospital and hire a carer. When I was finished chemo, in three months, and had time to heal, we could be together again. She would bring our child to visit.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I need my family, I love my wife, I love my child.I know it's hard on her to have her mother move out, but I never imagined that she would not be by my side during chemo.

I was so upset. I started shouting, so did she. I broke down on the floor, she stood and watched. She said I would never beat cancer like this. I was horrified. She had become so cold. I tried to hold her hand, I told her my body is dying. I can feel the tumour in my lower back, I can feel it grow. I need you, I need my family. I can't do this without you.

She pulled her hand away and I carried on pleading. She yelled that I was hurting her. I didn't know what she meant and realised she was really pulling on her hand and I was clutching desperately onto it. She said I was being violent and it was proof she can't let our child around me. I ran into a room and slammed the door, she swung it open and carried on shouting. I pushed her out and slammed the door shut. I could hear her rant about domestic abuse and I completely broke down. 

I can't do this without her. I am fighting choriocarcinoma which doesn't have the usual stellar 5 year survival rate expected from testicular cancer. I know my anger is caused by hormones and triggered by shouting. There's so much stress in my life and it's really peaking. I have support from my friends but without my wife and child in the same home as me, I think I'm lost.

I do not want to leave her, I don't want her to leave me. I want to keep my family together. How do I convince her to stay with me and see this through with me? 

**tl;dr**: Wife and I have been together four years, have one 2 year old. MIL lives with us. My wife is very dependent on her. She treats my family like crap, then stops paying rent, gets evicted by me. Wife accepts this, but finds it hard. I then get diagnosed with aggressive testicular cancer, need one ball removed and then four rounds of intense chemo. My hormones are imbalanced, I become less patient and more prone to anger, but only when anger is directed to me. Wife wants me to move out for my entire course of chemotherapy, three months. I can't do this without her support. I need to know how I can convince her to stay.

Right away, she looked down and with a disgusted look on her face said to me, ""Ew!  How can you even think about sex right now?  I thought you were hugging me because you were sorry!  You're just like every other guy!""  Then she left.

I don't want to get into it in too much detail, but the birth control method we were using failed, and I found out I'm pregnant a few days ago. I told him right after I found out, and he was kind of irritated and told me to make sure I was actually pregnant. So, I waited another day and after another positive test told him.

He starts to FREAK OUT. About how he can't have this right now, and how I lied to him about birth control. He said a lot of things, some of which I'm sure he regrets. He basically called me a whore (which I'm *not*... I've only slept with 3 guys ever), and said since we weren't dating he has no idea whose baby it could be. He hasn't told me have an abortion exactly, but he has made me feel like shit for being pregnant. 

Now this is the part that is confusing to me. When we first met, we met because he was friends with a very goody two shoes, republican friend of mine. They were in a few organizations together, and he is really strongly pro-Life. Like to the point where I've seen him get in hour long debates with friends of mine, and he can be pretty persuasive. He is in law school, and he is a really smart guy. I've always been kind of torn about it, but I would say I am more pro-life than pro-choice. 

I don't have many people I can to turn too who won't judge. He hasn't answered a single text in two days, and I don't know who to go to. I can't go to my family, and my friends wouldn't understand. They don't even know we've been sleeping together.

So, the other night, my boyfriend and I were making love, and when we were done, I felt that surge of emotion again.  I just let go, like a few of you told me to do.  He was holding me, and when he saw my tears, he stroked my face and said, ""Well someone is just a big ball of emotions tonight.""

I smiled, and I decided to talk to him about it.

""I'm not sad,"" I said, ""I just love you a whole lot.  I've never felt this way about anyone before, and it's a lot to handle.  So I cry.""

He smiled, then a sliver of tears showed up in *his* eyes!  

""I feel the same way sometimes, I've just been stopping myself from crying.  I didn't want you to think I was a sissy or something.""

We layed there in each other's arms, kissing and stroking each other's hair, crying.  It was single-handedly the most beautiful experience I've ever been a part of.

He often talks about her and tells me she was very special. I really do not want to get into the ''jealous'' zone, but it makes me uncomfortable to hear about her. I really want to be understanding and nice to him but I don't know how to handle the situation. Any help?

It's been a crazy day, but reddit was super helpful.
[Original link here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11a0ri/best_friend_23_f_got_too_drunk_and_tried_to_sleep/), long story short my [23f] best friend and I [31m] are with my mates at their summer house, she got way too drunk last night and tried to hit on me.

This morning when she woke up she was immediately sick. I brought some tea to the loo for her, where she was being sick. Her memory was hazy, but she remembered something went down. She asked if we did anything, and I was honest. I told her No, but that she tried. She asked me why I didn't go for it and I said it was because she was too drunk and I didn't know if that was what she really wanted. 

She thanked me for it, but the conversation didn't go much farther at that moment, because she was still being sick and everyone else was getting ready to go out. When she was feeling better we went about our day as planned, which didn't provide much opportunity to talk. End of the day when we got back from the pub, but neither she nor I drank. We didn't get a quiet moment from everyone else until later at night, getting munchies in the kitchen.

I decided to bring it up again, so I asked her if I should just write last night off as a drunk mistake or if that was what she really wanted. She tried to avoid the question, but I pressed it until she said something generic about booze being liquid courage. She did thank me for being a gentleman and not taking advantage of her, and I told her that no matter how turned on I was or how much I adored her, I would never take advantage of her, and that our friendship was more important than a night of drunk sex. We started talking about our relationship, what exactly we were. We got to a point in the conversation where I simply said that she was beautiful, intelligent, kind, and would make someone very happy. She'd make *me* very happy. 

We both leaned in and kissed. It was a great fucking kiss. Like a hauntingly great kiss. But it didn't go very far, because my mates wife walked drunk into the kitchen. We split apart, then she decided to go upstairs and take a shower, and told me she'd see me up there. 

This is where I fuck up: My mate came in too and he and his wife started pretty brutally fighting. They're at the point that they're getting a divorce. My mate was in pretty bad shape so I calmed him down and talked to him for a while.  I mean, my good mate is getting divorced, so of course I talked to him for as long as he needed. For a really, really long while. Like when I finally got up to bed, she was already asleep. I poked at her a little to wake her up, but this girl is a super heavy sleeper. When she is out, she's out.

So, I've made lots of progress, and yet I'm pretty much in the exact same place I was last night. And if I know her well (and I certainly do), she's going to avoid talking about it on the train, so I won't be able to talk to her until we get home. Hopefully I'll manage some sort of game plan on the train as to what the fuck to say to her or do. Somehow I'm even more nervous about talking to her about what happened tonight than I was about talking to her about what happened last night. 

**TL;DR**: We talked a little in the morning, I told her that she tried to have sex with me. Were busy most of the day, so talked again in the evening. I told her my feelings, we kissed, I got cockblocked by my mate's divorce. Don't have a game plan for tomorrow, and somehow I'm even more nervous than last night.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_11c54k,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11c54k/update_best_friend_got_drunk_and_tried_to_sleep/,

It started out perfectly.  We were introduced through a mutual friend.  He was funny, charming, handsome, great socially, never put me down.  Great with animals and old people.  He brought me coffee to work for the first 6 months.  Never shady.  Doesn't text other women and doesn't hide his habits.  Invites me out and tries to keep me involved.  The only downside is that he lies, casually, to everyone.  Nothing in particular, just small stuff he doesn't get called out on.  Everyone likes him.

Last week I went over to his place to get tickets to an arena football game.  I didn't mean to snoop but he put them on the cabinet in the dining room and I accidentally kicked a chair over on my way to it.  It broke and collapsed against the sideboard and the door swung wide open.  Inside the cabinet was a stack of VHS tapes and cassettes.  Every one had a name written on it.  Women's names.

I assume I found his private conquest stash but didn't have the guts to put in any of the tapes.  I grabbed the tickets, fixed the chair, and ran.

That night, he said, ""Did you break my chair?""

Not ""Did my chair break,"" or ""what happened to the chair,"" or anything like that.  Straight up, point blank, ""Did you break my chair?""

I told him I did.  He didn't seem to angry.  The night went on as planned.

Ever since, he's seemed sketchy as hell.  He won't call, he won't text when he says he will, he won't kiss me on the lips.  He knows I found them, I'm sure of it.  He smells like other women now and I'm sure I'm not just being paranoid. 

I sat him down and asked him yesterday if he was cheating on me.  He started to laugh -- incredulous at first, so I almost believed him.  Then he just started laughing harder, like it was some big joke, and I had no idea how to react.  I just left.  He called me to apologize but I hung up on him.

We've been together 2 years.  Those videos were seriously in the hundreds.  Several of them was labeled with a date within the last 6 months.  How could I have not seen this happening?

**tldr: suspect I found SO's ""conquests"" on VHS tapes in his house in the hundreds.  He refuses to talk about it.  Should I leave or bother with a fact check?**

edit: he just called me and left me the creepiest five minute message I have ever listened to.  He talked a lot to himself in the background and he was breathing *really* shallow and heavy.  He sounded frustrated and kind of angry.  He said he'd ""be right over"" and I texted him telling him not to bother since I'm not even home.  I'm getting more creeped out.

1375150647.0,373,self.relationships,1jbkjk,UPDATE: I [20/F] have been with my partner [27/M] for two years - he wants our relationship to involve domestic discipline.,lejla_bb,446,73,283,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jbkjk/update_i_20f_have_been_with_my_partner_27m_for/,"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j7647/i_20f_have_been_with_my_partner_27m_for_two_years/) is my previous post.

Hi everybody,

I'm making an update because I've gotten a few very heartfelt messages from people asking me what I decided to do, since they realized I was not in control of my situation and about to make a poor choice.

First, I just really want to thank everyone who replied to me - even those who called me stupid and immature and my boyfriend crazy. :) By way of an explanation, he told me two days before I made that post that he wanted to involve DD in our relationship. Since that time, I hadn't slept, eaten, showered, or left the house, because I have a bad anxiety disorder and this entire process has been EXTREMELY stressful for me. All I was thinking when I made the thread was ""god, I don't want to break up with him, I don't want to find somewhere new to live by myself, I don't think I can make it through a single day without him.""

I'm just hoping you can understand my mindset here, not really trying to defend myself. I was NOT in a good place psychologically or physically while I interacted on that thread.

So, here's my update: I decided not to enter a DD relationship. I couldn't find ONE person, online or in real life, outside of the DD community who advised doing so. After reading through a lot of the discouraging/angry responses on the thread, I told my best friend about the proposal and she just stopped short of threatening to call the police.

A lot of responses in the thread I made were EXTREMELY helpful in arriving at this decision. I believe my personality and character are inherently incompatible with this kind of relationship, and that although I still think Ezra is exactly who I want to be with, and have no actual interest in breaking up with him, I would rather be alone and miserable than miserable because I'm in a relationship with someone I love that's so far from what I want. Someone kind on the thread suggested thinking of it as though Ezra had died, because the Ezra I know has. I won't take it that far, but this is basically what I'm thinking. I'm mourning the loss of the relationship I thought I could have, because it turns out I can't have it no matter what choice I make.

I spoke to Ezra yesterday and told him that I decided not to consent to a DD relationship with him. His response was, ""Well, you said you needed a week to decide - why don't you take a little more time and we can come back to this later?"" Basically, I responded that I had taken all the time I needed. However, I was highly emotional in this conversation (crying the entire time) which made it difficult to really articulate to him that I was 100% serious and was giving him an ultimatum. This conversation ended with the agreement that I could have more time to decide, and with him reasserting that DD is a dealbreaker for him in any relationship (not just with me, but in general), although he was very comforting and spent a lot of time telling me that he still loves me and wants to marry me one day.

I feel like he basically steamrolled me last night and refused to listen to any of my reasoning. I believe he did this because it probably LOOKED like I was reacting out of emotion rather than reason. He was able to accuse me of being irrational and rash even though I know, having thought about it constantly since he brought it up, that I've come to the most reasonable conclusion. I don't think I can have this conversation with him and actually get through to him in a way that makes it clear I know what I'm doing. I'm working on writing a letter to him explaining that MY ultimatum for him is no DD or no relationship. I'm willing to work on the bad habits he wants me to change, I'm willing to help him through his anger, and I'm willing to serve him occasionally, but I'm not willing to let him spank me or give him total control of the decisions I make.

I actually doubt this compromise will mean much to him, because he was extremely clear with me that he'd have no qualms about leaving if I didn't consent to DD, but I'm feeling more confident about that possibility. I want to be with him forever, but if it's not possible to do so and be happy, I'll take short-term pain over long-term pain. I'll be extremely depressed if he breaks up with me, but I won't be miserable forever or lose my sense of identity. If he breaks up with me, I can handle that pain. If our entire relationship changes to one where I'm being controlled constantly, I don't know if that pain is manageable.

**tl;dr: I'm not agreeing to a domestic discipline relationship with my partner, and thank everyone who helped convince me I'm making the right choice.**

EDIT: I'm so amazed and overwhelmed by the massive amount of support in this thread. I haven't replied to everyone who wrote, because I'm not sure how to get to everyone who helped me, but I'm just feeling really supported and strong after reading through this thread. When I feel like I can't make it without him, I'll come back here and read the kind comments from all of you. This is really an amazing place and I can honestly say that you've stopped me from making a huge mistake. I haven't given the letter to Ezra yet, but I'm going to do so tomorrow and will provide an update when I know what direction we're going in.

After reading all of the comments on Reddit on my thread, I called her and broke up with her. I told her I wasn't looking to get married anytme soon, and she said she was fine with that.  I stayed adamant anyway about breaking up. She told me she thought to break up over this was stupid, especially because we could take further steps to make sure she didnt get pregnant.  

After thinking about it more, I decided that she may be right.  I was punishing her for telling me the truth BEFORE she got pregnant.  I adore this girl, I just don't want to get married in general (that may change, who knows) and she knows this and is still fine with seeing me. So I decided to let her know I want to be with her and give it a shot, now that we've been honest with each other.  So we're back together and we're going to use condoms in addition to the pill.

**LESSONS LEARNED**
1. I never knew that abortion was such a big deal and potentially so invasive and traumatic and even life threatening. I thought, hey if she gets pregnant, we'll just get an abortion.  NOPE. I am way more aware of how big a deal it is.  Call me stupid but I just didnt know. To me, pro-choice meant easy choice to abort.
2. Birth control is not a woman's responsibility, it is both parties' responsibility.  I will start using condoms as well. If I wanna be in control of my life, I have to make sacrifices, too. Condoms NO MATTER WHAT.
3. Be honest with your partner and don't punish someone for being honest.

TL;DR - I am going to be more safe and give it a shot with her.

1341410608.0,368,self.relationships,w14vs,Girlfriend passed away in a car crash yesterday. Advice about funeral and family?,saladsixshooter,473,105,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w14vs/girlfriend_passed_away_in_a_car_crash_yesterday/,"Hello reddit, throwaway here. I'm still reeling from yesterday, but I wanted to get your opinion on these matters sooner than later, because the funeral will be soon.

Background: I'm a 21 yo male, and my gf was 20. We'd been together for eight months and had been talking and semi-dating for months before that. It hurts too much to talk about it right now but trust me, we loved each other very much. We were starting to have the big talks...but I digress.

Yesterday morning she was killed in a car crash driving home from my college town to her town. I haven't seen her or her family yet, as they live an hour away from me and I know I need to give them space. I'm trying to think ahead to the funeral though, and ran into some (I think) dicey questions.

First off, I want to see her one more time. It's very possible she suffered disfiguring injury, and her family will insist on a closed casket, but what I want more than anything is to kiss her on her forehead (whatever's intact) and say goodbye. I know if I don't do this I will regret it, but I don't know how to ask her family about it. I'm not super close to her parents and my girlfriend had issues with her mom for a long time, so I feel a little strange asking for such a personal request.

Secondly, my girlfriend loved music and concerts, and one song in particular I would sing to her sometimes, and we'd always say the chorus line to each other before we hung up the phone at night, ""baby I'll be dreamin of you."" The first time I cried after I heard the news was when that song came to my head, and I sang it and I reached that line. I play guitar and sing decently, and I wanted to play that song at the service (slightly modified, slower and some changed lyrics), but I have aboslutely NO idea if this is okay or if this is even ever done. I've never heard of it being done, I've only ever seen solo singers/guitarists at weddings. But the song helps me express my grief. Do you guys know if this is done, or have you been to a funeral where this was done? Is it awkward? And again, how could I possibly phrase it to her family if I did decide to ask?

Finally, I am utterly at a loss as to what I should do about my girlfriend's family. Despite her issues with her mom, she's been crying ever since she heard, and my gf had three younger siblings, including a 14-year-old sister who pretty much idolized her. I've already offered my help if they need it, but I feel like I could be doing more to help, and I don't know how to handle my relationship with her family after the funeral. Advice please?

Thanks for reading, I appreciate the time. And if I left anything out that you need to know then please tell me. This is so fucking hard to write about, so I'm sorry also if it doesn't flow well or is confusing. Thank you.

**Tl:dr;** My girlfriend died in a car accident, want to see her body and say goodbye (even if disfigured), play a song that meant a lot to us at her funeral, and need advice on how to handle her family.

**EDIT:** Wow, you guys are truly amazing. I severely underestimated the amount of response this will get, and severely overestimated my time and capacity for answering all your wonderful responses. I'll try to get back to you all, but know that I've read all your posts at least twice, and you've all been so incredibly supportive and helpful. Thank you so much for the condolences, and the advice, and the perspective. I've spoken once with her family and am going back tonight to deliver some photos that they requested of us both and of her and her friends. I've decided not to play the song; I identify with all of you who say that it may seem too presumptuous of me to do so, and also I've been rehearsing it on my own and I simply can't bring myself to sing it without choking up. I've decided instead to courteously ask her family if I can buy her a ring to wear; her birthday is in a month and I was going to give her a promise ring, she knew and was very excited about it and if at all possible I'd like her to go to sleep wearing it. Obviously I'll defer to their decision, but it seems like a less intrusive way to pay my respects to her.

I'm blessed to know that she did not suffer disfiguring injury in the crash, obviously I haven't asked for specifics but her parents have been to see her and they said she was beautiful, and just how they remember her. So the funeral will be open casket, and my request to see her again before she sleeps is moot. Thank you for your advice on this, and my heart goes out to everyone who shared those gut-wrenching stories of relatives and loved ones whose bodies were irreparably damaged. Thank you so much for sharing. Just to clarify, I have seen and dealt with a fair amount of gore with respect to people I've cared about, and for me not seeing her one last time was simply not an option if it could be done. But to all the people who advised me to preserve my memory of her, I understand and I thank you.

I just want to let you know how much all your responses mean to me, and how truly affected I am by all that you've said. Thank you, advice givers, for your experience. And to all those who have said that they can't imagine dealing with something like this: never idolize your woman, or man. But if you find the one that you really identify with, who gets you completely, who's sweet and caring - never let a week or even a day go by without reminding them how much you care. I count myself as so lucky that I was able to say goodbye to her in her final hours, even though it was an ""I'll see you in a couple days"" goodbye. If they're worth it, then by god make sure they know it every day.

We made each other happy, spent most of our free time together, and stayed the night at one another's home at least three nights each week. We have a lot in common and enjoy similar activities so getting along and finding peace and harmony with one another was easy.

We have been very open with each other and share pretty much everything (or so I thought). We've both been cheated on in the past and I've made it explicitly clear that I don't want to be with anyone who could do that to someone and that I would never put myself in a position where that would occur because I know what it feels like and don't want to put anyone else through that hell.

After about four months into this relationship she told me she loved me and that she's never felt this way about anyone before. That she has been hurt bad in the past and had never intended to find someone like me or even get into another relationship again because she was so jaded from the past. I didn't say it back right away because I won't say something that meaningful unless I actually mean it. It took me a few more weeks to tell her I love her but after realizing how happy I was with her and how happy we seemed to make each other I knew that is what love is about; pure happiness. I may be wrong about that but to me, that's what it means.

She has always had a lot of male 'friends' and early on we each talked about our past which ended up sharing some similarities as well. We've both been with a lot of people (sexually) so I have never felt any feelings of jealousy or contempt for her as that would not only be hypocritical of me but also an unstable foundation to build a relationship upon. She just claimed that she gets along better with guys than girls and has been somewhat of a tomboy since she was a child; not a problem, I trusted her.

Even though everything seemed like it was going fantastically and that we were falling in love there were occasional 'red flags' that would pop up in my head or give me a bad gut feeling. I chose to ignore those at my own peril because I thought they were just my own insecurities creeping out and did not want to let a personal issue like that negatively affect our relationship. 

A few examples of the red flags

* In the five months we've been together she has told me about no fewer than 10 male 'friends' of hers that have miraculously come out of the woodwork and contacted her after years of not hearing from them
* There were minor inconsistencies with her stories of past times or descriptions of these friends and their prior relationships
* When we were around her family I noticed that they tend to watch her rather carefully, her parent's and sister's facial expressions would seem slightly incredulous and at other times downright skeptical of whatever it was she was saying (talking about plans, schedules, or what happened last night or last weekend, etc...)
* She talks a lot and tends to divulge more information than necessary on a lot of topics and would go to great lengths to ensure me that some of these men from her past were interested in her but she did not share that feeling, that she was not attracted to them in any way, or that they haven't spoken or seen one another in years (more on this later).

Her family has shown me nothing but kindness and welcomed me into their home as one of their own since I first met them. I genuinely enjoy them as they all seem like good people who want the best for their daughter. I have a great relationship with her father and he's even taken me aside a few times to ask me how things are going and if there's anything that seems of or that I don't like (a few minor things have come up but I spoke with her about them well before telling her father). If anything has come up in those side conversations he has spoken to her alone for the benefit of our relationship and he seems to really want us to succeed.

We've only had one fight since being together and it occurred a few weeks ago when she asked me if I would be uncomfortable with her going on an 3 day long fishing trip with a few of her friends from fire school (she wanted to be a firefighter but was unable to due to medical reasons). I told her the truth that yes, it would make me uncomfortable for her to go on a trip like that with a group of people that I've never even met before and that's when the fight started. Things were calmed down shortly after and she said she understood why I would be uncomfortable but also noted that it would be hard to continue our relationship if I could not trust her.


Earlier this week while we were at her house cooking dinner she asked me to go up to her room and get a movie queued up on her computer for us to watch. While waiting for the website to load I decided to check my email. I loaded gmail then went back to the movie site to pick something out. When I switched back to the gmail tab I saw her inbox pop up and went to log her out but noticed that there were a few emails toward the top that caught my attention and severely worried me. At this point I know that I should have logged her out and not done anything more about it as what I was doing was very wrong and a violation of her trust. I sat there for a few minutes looking at the subject lines of the top few emails and had an internal debate with myself as to what I should do. Unfortunately my integrity was momentarily suspended by what felt like a wrecking ball hitting me in the stomach and I had to know more.

Once again, I am fully aware that what I did was wrong and feel terrible about this and what is listed below. Her actions, as bad as they were/are will never justify what I did. 

The three offending emails that caught my eye were as follows:

* A flight confirmation (going out of state) purchased and forwarded to her by a guy (one of the ""friends she hasn't seen in years"") for a weekend trip that was bought the day before her flight which happened to be the day that I left for a weekend mountain biking trip with two friends.

* An email from another male ""friend"" she told me about where they discussed plans for her to fly out to see him sometime in August.  Further down in the email chain she had sent him a few screenshots of potential flights in the coming weeks asking which one was best, she had signed off the email with ""I love you.""

* A craigslist confirmation email for a ""missed connection"" post she created earlier that day seeking what she described as a tall extremely hot guy she saw during her lunch break that day.


At this point I was crushed. I had no idea what feelings were going on inside me or how to handle them and I broke down crying for a moment. This was the girl who told me she loved me (I reciprocated because I do love her) on a daily basis and consistently reminded me how happy I made her. We shared the same bed together and talked about potential future plans as I'm sure most young couples do; but this time I thought it was genuinely real. 

I logged out of her email as I was afraid of what else I might find if I looked any further. After gathering myself I went down to the kitchen to help finish the meal so we could enjoy our 'dinner and a movie' night. It took everything in me to keep it together the rest of the night, sit in the same bed with her and act like I believed everything she said and not just jump up and tell her what I found.


It's been a few days now and I still haven't confronted her about it as I'm not quite sure how. I haven't been eating very much and my stomach has been in knots. This is so painful and at this point I don't know what caused me to do the following.

Using my memory of that craigslist ad I stupidly searched for it and replied the two days later. To drive the knife of infidelity even deeper she included the fact that she was single and was hoping that this guy was too in the posting description.

After sending my reply including a few details about a tattoo and pretending to be this tall, attractive guy she saw on her lunch break she replied being shocked that I actually saw the post. She stated that she's never done anything like that before (lies) and that even though she was in disbelief she wanted to take me out for a beer, including her phone number so we could text.

For the past 24 hours she's been texting who she thinks is this other guy (but is really me and a google voice number) and after three times of me asking if she's sure that she's single or doesn't have any recent ex boyfriends I need to worry about she has explicitly stated in no uncertain terms that she is in fact single and has been for a while. 

We've texted about many things; what we each do, what we enjoy, past relationships, lying, and even cheating/being cheated on. We both agreed that it sucks. She's told this fabricated persona that she's been cheated on and would never do that because of how much it hurts (sound familiar?) but that she really wants to meet him for drinks and maybe more.

Last night she told him she knew of an amazing, hole-in-the-wall sushi place in the city that they should meet at but that she couldn't remember the name.  About 20 seconds after she sent that text I received one from her, as her boyfriend, stating that a woman from work was looking for a good sushi spot in the city and she wanted to know the name of the place I took her to on our first real date. Seeing that text pop up on my phone felt like getting hit by a dump truck. 

Last night she made plans to meet him for dinner at that sushi place in the city. Earlier today I asked her if she had plans for saturday night because a few friends from my tough mudder team were getting together for beers and s/o's were welcome. She declined saying that she promised her parents she would go to their house and cook them dinner that night.

I cannot continue in this relationship and have firmly made the decision that I will be ending things within the next 48 hours, however, the method is uncertain.

The two options I am currently considering are:

1. Just breakup with her and say that things aren't working out between us and that we should see other people, leaving out the details and reasoning behind it. Immediately stop replying to texts from this fake persona that I've created who she plans on meeting for dinner.

2. Uphold the dinner plans she has with this 'guy' and then show up to the restaurant with a print out of the texts shes been sending and the craigslist ad to confront her about the lying and cheating. I also plan on telling her how I found the ad (that I saw her email, full disclosure) and that I saw the other two concerning emails between her and the two other guys.

I don't know what to do /r/relationships. I'm obviously in a bad situation and will be breaking things off soon but am looking for advice on how to proceed, anything helpful would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.


**tl;dr**: Accidentally opened my gf's email and saw three very recent incriminating emails including past flight confirmation to meet with another guy in a different state, future plans to meet with some other guy in another different state, and a craigslist missed connection post confirmation that she created. Fully intend on breaking up very soon but unsure of the approach, please help.



**Update**: Thank you all so much for the advice, recommendations, and the support I was looking for in this decision making process. After reading through this entire thread and discussing the situation with my hockey team (had a game last night) and a few coworkers I've decided to just cut off all contact with her; as her (ex)boyfriend and as the craigslist guy.

She doesn't deserve the satisfaction of knowing why and it's blatantly obvious that she does NOT care about me so I've already mentally and emotionally checked out of this 'relationship.' While confronting her at the restaurant in any one of the manners suggested below would make me feel like a boss I don't think it's worth it. She will be shocked, no doubt. But it's rather clear she feels no remorse for her actions and I'm sure this isn't the first time she's done this so she may just have a moment of shock and then move on to something like, ""yea, so what? I cheated on you because of..."" 

Not having the closure of this relationship will drive her crazy. She will think everything is going great, that she's getting away with this, and that she's going to meet some new hot guy to suck into the vortex of deception; but then it all stops. Without warning. Without explanation. A small portion of her dishonest life will disappear into the darkness and she will be left racking her brain as to why. She'll continue to look for the reason, look for something, even look for the tiniest shred of evidence that will justify her actions and provide that reason as to why; but I'm not going to give that to her because she deserves nothing.

In due time, her family will begin to ask her about what happened but she will not be able to provide an answer because she won't know. She'll more likely than not spin up another lie about me to paint me as the villain in an earnest attempt to save face in front of her family but they'll know. They won't know for sure what the reason was but they already have enough evidence of who she actually is (26 years worth, in fact) to know that it was probably just another failed relationship like so many before. They know the only common theme between all of her failed relationships is her.

Fortunately enough we do not live together but merely sleep at one another's house a few times each week. One thing that will make this a bit tricky is that I have a female roommate who my ex has hung out with and considers a friend; well maybe more of an acquaintance as they've only hung out one time without me being present. Either way, I need to ensure that my roommate does not give her any info on me, my future actions, or why I severed all contact with the liar because even something as simple as a text saying ""he thought you were cheating"" or anything like that would give her an ounce of closure; something she doesn't deserve. 

And now what you've all been waiting for, the plan.

* I'm going to cancel our dinner plans for tonight (as the boyfriend) and tell her that I won't be home until late tonight
* I will tell all of my roommates that she is no longer welcome in our home and that if she shows up she is not to be let inside.
* Every phone call and text will be ignored. I will NOT communicate to her in any way, even by telegraph or smoke signals
* As the craigslist guy I will not contact her with the exception of a text tomorrow to confirm the date but I will not show up to confront her (as the bf) or provide any reason for standing her up. 
* All of her belongings currently at my house will be placed in a box outside as she will certainly show up at my house after a day or two of no contact and seeing a box with her things in it will confirm that she is nothing to me anymore.
* Her family was always kind to me and I'd like to thank them but will not as this will undoubtedly provide some information to them which will be relayed to her. The kindness of a word of thanks to her family is not worth the chance that she may have a bit of closure
* I will schedule an appointment with my doctors office immediately for a full battery of STI testing, including HIV/AIDS
* I will look at this as a learning experience and will lead an amazingly happy life and enjoy everything I do because I can

I know a number of you prefer that I not pursue the above method and that I should just serve up a nice steaming hot cup of justice to this shrewd harpy and for that, I apologize. I realize that it would make a lot of people happy to know that a liar and a cheat was caught in her own web of deceit but unfortunately, I cannot provide you this satisfaction. Many of you have been in a similar situation but not have had the opportunity that I do to provide the coup de grâce of confronting her in the act. Trust me when I tell you this, it would not matter. Doing this to her will be a momentary blip on her radar and someone of her moral character, or lack thereof, will get over it quickly and will continue their ways regardless of being caught.

In the interest of providing some evidence to everyone I've taken screenshots of the craigslist ad, the email I sent to her as the other guy, her response, and text messages between the two over the past week. **[The Evidence](http://imgur.com/a/JEewl)**


**Edit 2** After I stand her up tomorrow (as the other) and cut all ties (as her boyfriend) I predict that she will continue to text/call over the next few days. She will most likely contact my roommate and the only other mutual friend we have in hopes of seeking information about what happened, where I am, what I'm doing, and what is going on. Within minutes of standing her up I will begin to execute the plans listed above and also talk to our mutual friend (who she met through me) and my roommate to tell them that things are over between us and kindly ask them not to provide any information to her about me. I need to be careful with how much information I reveal to these two loose ends as do not know how capable they are of keeping quiet.

I will provide a follow up to this within the next few days, please stay tuned.

**Update**

There was a slight deviation from the initial plan and a special thanks is in order to /u/Spam-Monkey for the suggestion. As the guy she had a date with I kept texting her while she waited at the restaurant saying that I hit traffic, got lost, couldn't find close parking, etc...and kept her there for 2.5 hours before she finally gave up and left; she must have really wanted to go on a date with him.

She has been texting and calling throughout the morning but I have not responded to anything. She's had a few of her friends try to contact me and she contact one of my friends and my roommate trying to get an idea of what's going on but I've been leaving details out so no one really knows exactly what's going on yet. Earlier this evening she figured out that I've been intentionally ignoring her and sent a text acknowledging the end of our 'relationship.' 

Without giving her any clues as to why things ended like this I think the mindfuck was successful. She has no idea what happened and doesn't deserve to have the closure she's looking for. Thank you all for the kind words of encouragement, the excellent advice and recommendations on how to handle the situation, and also for the support in numbers. I had a pretty fantastic day today hanging out with a close friend and feel at peace with the way life is going. 

I wish you all the best and hope you're able to find happiness wherever you look.

Cheers!
 

**Edit to add a few details previously left out**
One fun thing I forgot to mention is that she was texting this 'other guy' while sitting next to me on my couch a few hours before her date, showing me that she clearly lacked the ability to pause her infidelity for any amount of time. 

Also, the one fight that we had (mentioned above - ctrl+F ""fishing"") took place one week after she flew to Portland to be with another guy while I was out of town on a mountain biking trip. The fight was centered around how I don't trust her and that I should if we wanted to continue dating.

When we graduated from college, I got a good job; he did not. He was unemployed for a year and a half. He was trying to make it as an actor. He treated me like shit a lot of the time, because he was depressed. He would criticize me and almost broke up with me, telling me that the ""magic"" was gone. It devastated me but after a short break we worked it out. He has big mood swings. He is brilliant but he is also very vulnerable, has low self esteem and lives in his brilliant, but troubled head. 

Things had been going OK... and then he got a part on a TV show a month ago. I was thrilled! I had helped him get the part and he was so happy. But that was when our troubles seemed to start over again. He now has no time for me; and he feels that I put pressure on him to see him. I do; I miss him after 2+ days. We live in the same city and it can be so hard to not see him. I have no family, and his family is like my family... I live by myself too. But he gets tired working in the day and wants alone time in the evenings. I see him on the weekends which I feel very blessed for considering others have LDR but it can be hard knowing he is a 15 minute drive away and all I want is an hour with him alone every couple of days.

The fame seems to be sort of going to his head. It is all he talks about, his tv show. He spends a lot of time reading his fan mail. He walks around thinking that people will recognise him; but they don't. I try to talk to him about my life, and he seems very disinterested. He'll respond, and then immediately go back to talking about what is happening in his. It is becoming tiring, it is starting to ruin my self-esteem, like nothing I can do can match up. When I was employed and he wasn't I didn't spend hours upon hours talking about my job, I tried my best to engage him in his life, I feel it is no longer reciprocated. 

Last night, we had a bad night. He got to bed late, because he seems to get distracted when around me. And he  started to freak out about not getting sleep, not being able to perform the next day. And he started to get viciously angry at me, and started yelling at me at 1am. He would be incredibly cruel, then stop and apologize, then go back to being cruel, then apologize, then start on an even crueler tirrade again. The entire time I merely cried and apolgoized; he was angry because of the pressure I have been putting on him. At one point he threw a pillow directly at my head very hard; I did not see it coming, and the foam was quite hard and it actually hurt. He apologized and told me that he would never hurt me. 

The whole time, he just talked about how he no longer has time for me like he used to, that I don't get it and that he doesn't know how to handle his new-found fame (again, no one recognises him on the street). He told me multiple times that I am now further down his priority list and I need to understand that. When he was being cruel he would blame me for all of the bad things in his life, then when we was apologetic he would blame himself. I never once got angry, I was so broken and tired. He finally stopped at about 3am. He told me that he ""can't do it anymore"" and ""I need to change"". I had been doing my best to change; I give so much and support him so much. And I have a big fault, and that is I want to receive some attention from him each day, but I am trying to get better, I am trying.  

I am just so tired. I thought that when his life got on track that he would be happy. But he has never thrown anything at me before. It was just a pillow but it was thrown very hard, fast and it hurt; and it happened in a context where I wasn't even yelling at him, I was crying on the bed instead. 

He has contacted me today and apologized profusely. I am just really, really sad though. I am scared for how this is going to play out. Because I was abandoned by my family I have trust issues and I am really fighting them right now; I am struggling to understand my new position in his life. 

**How do I deal with not being as important/as big as a priority? Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I am legitimately trying to get better.**

**THIS IS REALLY LONG**


So I decided that I'd let him tell me his story and invited him over last night. I made it clear this wasn't an ok or an acceptance, but that I was willing to let him talk. He was pretty gracious on the phone, it had only been two days but I'm pretty sure he didn't think I was calling back.

I tried to go into the conversation as objective and collected as possible. I had notes prepared, mostly (from the last thread, thanks) and a list of questions and topics I wanted to cover. This was really weird, it felt like I was preparing for an interrogation, not a disscussion with a potential partner. The main bullet points I had writtten down were; **Sex offender registration, jobs, kids, the event itself, victim, therapy/rehablitation, and access to offical documents**. This was the order I wanted to bring them up. I wanted to get the technical details of his life now out of the way before the actual meat of the disscussion and I wanted his story before I told him I intended to inquire into offical documents.

He arrived at my apartment, after dinner. I'd told him that tonight wasn't a date, we'd not eat together before or during, there'd be no hanging out. Afterwards he would go home. He'd prepared himself. He was well dressed, shaved and button up shirt. like a job interview almost. I had butterflies in my stomach, nervousness I can't remember feelings.

We spoke for a very long time, well into the night and I couldn't hope to give a transcript in this post, but I took notes so I'll try and relay the important bits.


**Sex Offender Registration;**

He lives ""almost entirely free of supervision"". After initialy being released from prision his freedom was quite restricted, but he has been gradualy allowed more and more. He has a supervisor he reports too, but he's down to yearly checkups, and advising him if he moves or goes on a vacation, etc. He's allowed in bars now (he wasn't for some time). He is ""registered"", but says the lists don't work the way the public think they do, that they're a tool for the police.

""In the last seven and a half years I have had no none-positive interactions with the authorities. I've lived entirely within the bounds set for him, even when they were ridiculious and source of humiliation. I've not even gotten a speeding ticket.""

**Jobs;**

This is a problem in his life. He works as an accountant, which I knew. What I didn't know is that the company he works for is his father's. 

""I would not have this job if not for preferential treatment from my father, which is a source of personal shame. I've been trying for years to find another position, but no one outside of a teenager service postion would have me. I have a degree, skill, experiance, and ability, but it doesn't matter. I get interviews, nail them, and get rejected after a criminal record check because ""we're looking for someone with a wider skillset"". This is unlikely to change in the near future.""

**Kids;**

After I brought up children, he was silent a long time. Put his face in his hands. It felt like an hour.

""I am not, and never been attracted to children. I am not, and have never been a threat to children. I do not have and have never had any legal restrictions regarding children.""

I asked if he wanted children

""I always wanted a family. I wanted to be a husband and a father. Accepting that these dreams are unlikely and perhaps unwise because of my mistakes has been very difficult.""

 **The Event Itself;**

 **This is the part everyone's been waiting for.**

It was long, detailed and complex story. He started by saying ""I'm going to give explanations, descriptions, feelings, and thoughts. In the past, when I've told this story in detail I've been accused of trying to make excuses and rationales. This is not the case, I know that I was wrong. But I think that details are important to understanding what happened.""

I'm going to be a big tease and say that I don't think I can repeat the story he gave and do it justice. Fear not, however, I will give you an abbreviated, albeit emotion light version.

* He was at party with friends, and was driving, so he was sober.

* The party dispersed, and the only friend who ended up needing a ride was a close female friend, who had gotten very drunk.

* He took her home, but she wasn't able to get into her home, keys had been misplaced.

* He took her to his apartment.

* That night he forced himself on her. It wasn't violent, but she didn't consent. explictly didn't consent, but wasn't in a state capable of resistance, ""and I was aware of that fact"".

* He ""felt immediate and terrible guilt"".

* The next morning he took care of her, dealt with her hangover, and then sat down next to her and opened a conversation. she wasn't really talking to him but he didn't know the extent to which that was a hangover. He started with ""how much do you remember?"" and when he didn't get a response ""I think I raped you last night"". at which point she started to talk. They spoke and he offered to cooperate in anyway she wanted. eventually he took her home.

* It was a week later that she decided to take to the police. He went to police with her, made a full confession. and has cooperated to the best of his ability since.

* This is the reason he was given such a light sentence (less then a year).

""It is unlikely I'd have been convicted of anything without a confession""


**Victim**

He'd known her for years and it was very close platonic friendship. I asked if I could speak to her and he spoke with anger for the first time ""NO. Absolutely not."" 

He went on to explain that this is why he needed to stress from the beginning this was his own fault, and that he was not a victim. he told me that his ex, the only other girlfriend he'd had since prision, had begun to believe that he'd been taken advantage of, and that it was his victim being a ""vindictive sex regretting slut"". He allowed her to continue that train of thought ""because it felt nice to have someone believe I was never a monster."" But then his ex contacted his victim and tried to get her to apologise. ""When I found out I was almost more humiliated then when I told my parents initially. I broke up her with immediately. Please just allow [victim] to live her life.""



**Therapy/Rehabilitation,**

He's been seeing therapists since prison, but its not longer mandated and his therapist is no longer in contact with the authorities. ""I'm doing it because its good for me"" he offered to put me in contact with his therapist.

**Access to official documents**

He was suprised and I think insulted when I brought this up, but I explained that I needed to be able to have full disclosure and trust if he wanted to try a relationship. I think he understood and in anycase offered to put me in contact with his supervisor. ""nothing you get will disagree with me, I hope that will allow you to trust me.""


**TL;DR** It was 2am and I was about to renege on my rules and offer to let him stay (on the couch) when he got up and left himself. I told him he was allowed to contact me, but that I would need time to process. That while I didn't want to kill him I couldn't make a call on whether or not we could be together yet.

1347985576.0,360,self.relationships,1032z1,My dad just died and left everything to me (I have two other brothers).,,430,70,340,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1032z1/my_dad_just_died_and_left_everything_to_me_i_have/,"Hey, Reddit, I'm having a family problem and I need some advice.  My father just died.  In his will, he left his house and some cash to his girlfriend and everything else to me (approx. $500K in cash, stocks, and land).  Here's the problem:  I have two older brothers.  Before he died, he made it VERY clear that he didn't want either of my brothers to have anything.  It's a really long story that I tell if need be, but my dad and brothers haven't been on speaking terms for a long time.  

The only request he made was that I use the inheritance to help put my oldest brother's son (who is 10 years old) through college if he chooses to go.

Basically, dad gave a huge middle finger to his whole family, including my middle brother's two kids, who are 16 and 14.  

So here's my problem.  If I don't give some of the money to my brothers, they'll basically cut me out of their lives (and the lives of my niece and nephews) all together.  My relationship with them is strained as it is, and following through with dad's wishes would end any hope of repairing my relationship with them.

Oh, and one more thing.  My brothers didn't know about any of this (that they were cut out) until the will was read.  One last ""Fuck you"" from the old man.

What would you do?  Give them some of the money in hopes of repairing the relationship, or give them nothing and respect dad's wishes?

Thank you for reading my post!!

**tl;dr:  dad died and left everything to me and nothing to my two my two brothers and it's straining our relationship.**


edit:  Hi, Reddit.  A few of you have asked for details about why Dad would have done this, so I'll try to explain.  First, it may be helpful to give some background info.  

I'm 28, currently in medical school. 

My middle brother is 38 (I'll call him Bob).  He's had a lot of money problems because he had a side business in real estate before the housing crash.  To add to his problems, he has a prescription drug addiction and recently lost his job with a very well known American company because of it. 

My oldest brother is 41 (I'll call him John) and he has been in and out of jail for drugs and burglary since he was 18.  He's also done about four or five stints in rehab to no availe.  He is currently on Methadone maintenance therapy.  I highly suspect that he is still on drugs of some sort.  He lives hand to mouth.

Dad was 66 when he died.  He was functioning alcoholic since before any of us were born.  I won't go so far as to say that he was outright abusive, but he was a beligerant drunk.  My parents divorced when I was 14.

My whole family dynamic has been really fucked up for as long as I can remember, so I'll go ahead and apologize if this sounds like a Jerry Springer episode.

The crux of the problem is that Bob and John gradually froze Dad out of their lives over a period of years because of an accumulation of real / perceived grievances.  Bob was borrowing money from Dad to stave off financial ruin (it happened anyway), but a couple of years ago dad cut him off and Bob hasn't had anything to do with him since.  And, to make matters worse, Dad utterly HATED Bob's wife for his own real / perceived greivances (I keep writing real / perceived because I all I hear are rumors long after the fact).  

John's situation is a little more complex.  John and Dad came to blows when John was 18 and was forced to move out.  John's life since then has been a downward spiral of poverty and drugs and he blames all of it on real / perceived abuse he took because of Dad. The straw that broke the camel's back came when Bob and John got into an argument with Dad in Dad's front yard and Bob pushed him down.  As they were leaving, Dad told me that John said, ""You bastard, you deserve everything that you get.""  Bob took out a restraining order on Dad for some reason, and it was still in effect when Dad died.

Was Dad right to cut them out?  Did Bob and John suffer due to abuse they took years ago?  I don't know.  Dad could be a real asshole, and became more and more so as he got older.  I know that Bob has used my Mom in much the same way as Dad.  Bob currently owes her about $1,200 in overdue payments on an ""invesment"" house that Mom was foolish enough to cosign on.  I don't really have anything to do with John anymore.  If you ask me, he's fried all of his brain cells with all of the drugs he's taken.  He really unpredictlable and has an explosive temper which is why I try to avoid him.  John's situation is the reason dad wanted me to provide John's son with enough money to go to college.

It should also be pointed out that we all grew up in a modest, lower-middle class lifestyle.  We had everything we physically needed, and took vacations about once a year.  It came as a huge surprise to me to find out that dad was loaded (I never talked to him about money, and have been taking out loans to pay for school).

I'll end by saying that even though I'm not really close to them, I still love both of my brothers.  This decision has taken quite a toll on me, and I've considered setting out enough money to pay for the neice / nephew's college degrees and giving the rest to charity.

First off, thank you all so much for all the well wishes, advice, and encouragement. I was really, deeply moved by all the kindness that came my way. 

I'm sorry. I wish I had a happy ending to give you all. I let him know about the situation after he came back and we had dinner. He said ""I can't deal with this...too much..."" and walked out looking really bad. I think he probably went for a walk around the park, as he does when he is stressed sometimes. Its been almost an hour now, though. 

I'm going to adopt a kitty and start looking for another place to live. To say the least, I feel pretty gutted right now.

I told her to get the f out or I would drive her to the middle of Indiana(next state over) and throw her out there.

The  bartender toldd her she had 5 seconds to leave or the cops would be called.  She left.  I then went to another bar that's really close to my house as I was getting tipsy and she showed up there too.  She said she didn't know I was there and left.  When I got up this morning there was a note on my truck saying how she didn't cheat and she was sorry.  Even if she didn't I can never trust her again so it doesn't matter at this point.

Inappropriate?,Throaway90m,490,128,582,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dircw/update_boyfriend_m23_invited_a_female_friend_from/,"I can't believe the response I got on my [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dfmyj/boyfriend_m23_invited_a_female_friend_from_school/), thank you all so much!

I'll start off by saying that last night was rough.  In my last post, I mentioned that I wanted to go over to his house and surprise him and his new female friend but I came to my senses and decided not to.  The last thing I wanted to do was come across as crazy, especially in front of his new female friend.  But trust me, I wanted to kick his door down.

I ended up falling asleep on the couch after bawling my eyes out and woke up this morning to no texts from him.  He did not text me at all that night.  Not even a ""Good night"" text which he *always* does.  So I texted him and asked him how his night went and he said ""It was fun.""  He didn't offer up any details, which made me really nervous.  So I asked if I could see him so I went over to his house and we talked for awhile.  When I got there, he appeared to be hungover but he claims he wasn't.

Apparently, she came over, he made her dinner (my favorite food actually) and then they watched a movie.  Once the movie was done, they went out back and had a bonfire and drank.  I asked him how studying went and he said they didn't study much because she said the test wasn't going to be very hard.  So I quizzed him some more and asked if he got drunk and he said, ""A little bit but not that bad.""  Then I said, ""Well, what time did she leave?""  He said, ""I think 1 or 2 AM.""

I honestly don't know what to think.  He acted like this entire situation was no big deal at all.  I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I found it shady that he was hanging out with another girl alone at his house.  That's when he said she was just a friend and that it's no different than when I hang out with guys.  He said he trusts me, so I should trust him too.

He also informed me that his female friend invited him to her birthday party on Saturday at her place.  He agreed to go because he said she really wants him there.  Ugh!  I can't win.  He thinks this whole thing's innocent and cool.  Well, I don't.  We agreed to not talk about *her* tonight when we hang out because he said he didn't want it to ruin our night.  I don't know whether I should let this go or continue to be suspicious.  He's being really clingy and lovey dovey towards me now so I'm not sure if he's sucking up or feels bad about something.... Hmmm... I don't know.

So that's the update.  I'll guess we'll see what the future holds.

I feel I am making the right decision but would appreciate an outside perspective,hismomisacunt,471,108,197,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i4ct1/i_20f_have_forbid_my_bfs22m_family_to_be_in_our/,"I know that it sounds harsh of me from the title.. but hear me out. I feel I am completely right in my decision but this is something my boyfriend and I have been arguing about constantly and I admit that I am ridiculously stubborn at times. I just want some honest opinions to see if I should go on with this decision or give them yet another chance. I apologize in advance for the long story. 

To make it a little easier this is a list of his family's ""names"" and ages:
Kelly [48] / Dave [50] / My boyfriend, Jack [22] / Mike [20] / Danny [18] / Chris [16] / Alyssa [13]
When I refer to ""the favorites"" that includes Mike, Chris, and Alyssa.


After about 6 months of being in a long distance relationship with Jack I moved in with my grandparents that lived in the same city as Jack to be closer to him and to also experience something new after living in the same small town I grew up in. He had recently moved back in with his parents while looking for a new apartment and so I was going to be meeting his family. He had told me about how his parents play favorites and that he wasn't one of them. I thought that Jack must just be insecure. What parents play favorites with their kids? And if they do, why would they make it obvious when they know it would hurt their child? Well I was in for a rude awakening. 

Kelly and Dave are extreme sociopaths. They are blatant about which children they care for more and see no problem with how it affects their other kids. Just so you have a little idea on just how unable to care for anyone other than themselves and the favorites, in the year &amp; 1/2 that I have known them they have given away 14 animals from excuses ranging from ""that dog was too jumpy"", ""she wasn't anything like our other dog"", and ""the kitten scratched too much"". They didn't even try to re-home them. His parents would just take them to a shelter. I have no idea how the shelter didn't start asking questions or refusing but I'm getting side-tracked.

The day I went to meet his family I picked out my favorite outfit, spent what felt like forever getting ready, and nervously anticipated what I was going to say when I met them. Little did I know that was something I didn't have to worry about. I got to his house and he went to walk straight up the stairs to his bedroom, I stopped him and asked if he was going to introduce me to his family and he reluctantly tried. His parents ignored us. They didn't even acknowledge that we were in the room. I was standing awkwardly right in front of them trying to tell them my name and neither of them even lifted their heads from what they were doing. I was appalled. They would occasionally say something to one of the favorites but they refused to even grunt a hello to me. Eventually while I didn't agree with it, I accepted that this was the normal treatment towards Jack and Danny and tried not to get too hurt over it. I couldn't imagine how Jack must feel having his own parents treat him that way, when I was stranger and felt like I was going to burst into tears.

After a year of dating, despite being told that I was infertile after having PCOS and a botched cyst removal surgery, I found out that I was pregnant. Even though I'm young I did not want to pass up what could possibly be my only chance at having a child. When we went to tell his parents I was pleasantly surprised. His parents seemed ecstatic and would not stop gushing over the idea of being grandparents. Even though I resented them for the way they treated Jack and I, I knew that now they would be in my life forever and that I needed to try and move past that. Unfortunately their seemingly nice behavior didn't last long. 

When I was about 2 months along Jack and I got an apartment together so we only had to see his family a few times a week when they invited us over for dinner. Suddenly Mike, Danny, and Chris started becoming extremely hostile towards me out of the blue (I now know it was because they thought I was the reason that Jack would no longer provide them with booze). Whenever I was at their home at least one of the boys would tell me how they wanted to kick me in the stomach, how they will lock my baby in a closet when he's born, and many other foul things. This all happened in front of their parents and his dad would often egg on the behavior and join in. When I told his parents my intended due date, they decide to book a cruise the week of my due date for their whole family... They would rather be on a cruise than meet their grandchild.  It got to the point that I would only go to their home on rare occurrences and the whole drive there I would be on the verge of a panic attack over what they were going to say to me next. Jack is nice to a fault and even though I kept telling him how much their words hurt me he tried to convince me that they were just joking. 

Jump to about 7 months along and we are having a family dinner with his family. Danny kept calling me a fat slut and I was doing the best I could to ignore it until I snapped. I lashed out at him bringing up his recent arrest after he was caught stealing for the 5th time, and in turn his mother lashed out at *me*. How dare I say something so nasty to him. After all they are just teenage boys and that's how they flirt she said.. I was fucking LIVID. His parents were not embarrassed or sickened by their children's treatment towards me.. they condoned, encouraged, and were now defending it. I had done nothing to deserve this treatment and I had put up with it for months. I told them that if this was the way they were going to act then they will never be meeting my son, because I'm not going to subject him to that kind of behavior and I stormed out. 

Kelly then started texting Jack almost daily about how selfish and self-centered I was. She tried to convince him to leave me and said that she would help him sue me for custody of our child and that she could raise my son. Oh yes, how DARE I want to be treated like a decent human being? I wasn't even asking to be treated nicely, just civilly. Jack finally stood up to his mother and told her that unless she and his siblings apologized to me for the way that they treated me he would support me in the decision to cut ties with them. About an hour later I got a text from Kelly saying ""Sorry that I stood up for my kids"". Yeah, some apology. I told Jack that was bullshit and that I wasn't going to accept something so fake. I finally got tired of fighting with him about it and just let it go for awhile. 

About 2 weeks before I was due, his parents and siblings started sending gifts for me and the baby constantly. I was so disgusted. This isn't what I wanted, I wanted an apology. A simple, ""I'm sorry for the way I treated you"" ""I'm sorry I let my sons harass you for months"".. but that was too much for them to handle. Like always, his parents were trying to buy their way out of the situation. Something they have made a habit of now. For Jack's sake, I started trying to tolerate them... cue situation worsening.

After I was home from the hospital and his parents were back from their cruise I reluctantly allowed them to come to our apartment to meet my son. Kelly immediately started criticizing me for formula feeding him.. I have tubular breasts. --May be a little uncomfortable to male readers now-- I produced a minimal amount of breast milk for 2 days before it stopped altogether. I tried to explain this to Kelly but because she has a degree in nursing she thinks that gives her the right to force her opinion on me. She told me that I hadn't tried hard enough and that I allowed my milk flow to stop. I was infuriated. I had cried over the fact that I couldn't breastfeed and have that bonding experience with my baby. It made me feel like less of a woman knowing that not only were my boobs horrid looking but that I couldn't even feed my son. I tried until my nipples were raw and bled but that was not trying hard enough in her mind. After that I told Jack that until his family's behavior starts to improve they would only be able to come over once a month. I couldn't handle the stress of a newborn baby and a panic attack every time his family wanted to drop in. Jack agreed because by this point he was also disgusted with this family and had been around my family enough to finally realize that normal parents don't act the way his do. 

Kelly then started guilt-tripping Jack. She paid off his $10,000 credit card and student loan debts. She transferred $1000 into his bank account, bought him $500 worth of new clothes, and a variety of other gifts. Kelly constantly texted him about how they have done so much for me and they are hurt that I don't appreciate it. Uh, I never asked for the gifts. I never asked for the money. All I asked for was to be treated civilly and they couldn't do that. They would rather try and buy me off. Like I mentioned before, Jack is nice to a fault. This was also the first time that he was getting any sort of attention from his parents and everything they did he turned a blind eye to so that he wouldn't jeopardize that attention. After Jack begged and pleaded with me, I agreed to see his family for a few hours. We went to their home, Danny started in with the insults again and I ignored them all. I didn't talk very much at all, but I was proud of my behavior. I had nothing nice to say, so I said nothing at all. Despite how uncomfortable and angry I was, I didn't say anything rude at all. I just stared at my hands and tried to make it through the visit.

When we left Kelly started texting Jack about how I had been such a bitch, that she feels sorry that my son has me for a mother, and that she wishes our son hadn't been born. She sent me a text that read ""You can try and block us out all you would like, but we will still be your son's family. I actually feel sorry for your son. Hopefully you will grow up and get over yourself one day. Best of luck"". I also received a text from Chris saying ""Everyone is trying to be mature and trying to get along with you but maybe you're the one that needs to learn to forgive people and accept our family. We don't want to push you away but everything we say you ignore and keep holding grudges. You're acting like the grinch. Really immature and hating everyone for something that one person said like 5 months ago"". I immediately just started crying. I was so hurt and just exhausted with the whole situation. I had never done anything to any of them. I have never deserved the way that they treat me yet they constantly go out of their way to make me feel horrible. I told Jack that this was the final straw and that they will never be in our son's life and we have been fighting over the issue ever since then. Kelly is still texting him about how horrid I am and recently made up some story about how I was using Jack's phone when he was sleeping to send Kelly rude texts then deleting them from his phone so that he wouldn't know about it. Jack went online and saw that there were no texts sent from his phone when she claims I sent them. When he caught her lie and called her on it did she apologize? No, but a new pair of shoes arrived at our house for Jack the next day. 

So even after the way his brother's and father have treated me, the horrid things Kelly has said about me, and Kelly even wishing our son had never been born Jack still insists that I let them be around our son. After how horrible they made me feel I never want my son to have to experience what I did. I don't want him to get attached to Kelly then find out later that she would rather he had never been born. I don't want him to pick up the disgusting behavior that Kelly taught her sons was okay. With her non-stop talk of wanting custody of my son I honestly would not put it past her to pick up and leave with him and that scares the shit out of me. I don't feel they deserve to be in our lives, and I believe all ties should be severed unless by some miracle they turn into decent human beings.

If you read my novella, please give me your opinion on this. I will admit that I can be overly stubborn and I'm not sure if I am in this situation. I feel like I have given them enough chances to try and just be good people and each time they have screwed it. I will never like them after the way they treated me, they can't erase the first impression they gave me. I think at this point they are in no way a positive influence in our lives and we would be better off severing all ties.

I've had a cat since then. I'm a 28m, now. He's 12 and he's been the only Constant in my turbulent life. He'll never be too far from me ever. He never left my side while I was homeless. He followed me everywhere willingly. He's 12 now, and he has this pride like a lion. 

I've been seeing a girl for about 8 months now. She's 26. We're both open and are both looking for something serious. It's going really well, but she HATES CATS. She shreiks when he rubs up against her. She has swatted 
Him when he laid down on her lap. I yelled at her over it. I was so flabbergasted he took too her so quickly and warmly (because I really liked her too) and he usually hides and observes people for a long time before being seen. And if you approach him too quick, he'll even hiss at you (never claws or biting)... but he'll snuggle her in ways he's never been affectionate with me.

It really makes me want to trust her - but she's told me to get rid of my cat or put him down before the relationship can progress. I want to dump a perfect relationship for him. Is that sad? My kitty even follows me to a bar, waits outside and follows me home. (he's almost always by my side - we don't acknowledge eachother.... but he's never too far away except for work).  


Am I stupid. I owe him the final years of his life for being so good to me, and i deep down think she's a cold-hearted bitch for even implying to put him down, or even get rid of him. She's not even allergic! 

I'm not getting rid of 12 years that quickly, and she should know this a testament to my loyalty and commitment. I can't treat another living thing with such disregard. The only weird thing I admit is he gets a closet wherever I live. That's just HIS house. Which is my linen closet. When I got by my own place, he did too. 

Idk. I want to dump her for implying I should kill cat for her. That's justified right?

I told him. I figured he had a right to know, and frankly if we were to progress in our relationship after this, I wouldn't want to keep something of this magnitude from him. 

He was nothing but supportive - a little shaken for sure even though he tried hard not to show it. But he's not going anywhere (so far, anyway) He didn't blame me, he wasn't angry, he still wanted to see me as we planned. 

Telling him was absolutely the right thing to do, for me. I feel so much better for being able to share it with him. We've decided to terminate the pregnancy. We're both agreed that it's the right course of action for us. He's also very much aware that my parents or family cannot know.

He is kind, loyal, and very affectionate. The only problem is we are VERY mismatched when it comes to intelligence and it's starting to become a huge issue for me.

I was raised by parents who always encouraged reading and learning. I was taught that education is something to take very seriously. I enjoy learning and have been an avid reader my whole life. School was always fun and the subjects came very easy to me.

My boyfriend, by contrast was raised by parents who seem to almost glorify ignorance. He has, by his own account, read maybe two or three books in their entirety in his whole life. This is something he seems almost proud of. He barely graduated and got terrible marks in school, yet he maintained that he could do the work easily, but is just ""too lazy"". I've tutored him before, and I know this isn't true. He has a hard time grasping the most basic of concepts in almost every subject. His spelling is atrocious, to the point where he screws up very basic words to where they are almost unrecognizable. He can't get a job because he can't fill out an application without making a myriad of spelling errors (going over one of his applications, I saw he had misspelled cashier as caseir, and didn't capitalize anything, not his name, address, or the beginning of new sentences) but he blames his unemployment on the job market. He has no intention of improving upon his spelling even though I've told him he really should.

He has embarrassed me quite a few times in front of my family, the most notable being at Thanksgiving when he told my extended family that his cat was half raccoon. When I discreetly told him that it was impossible and explained why he refused to believe me and kept saying that he knew better. I could tell my cousins were all laughing at him and it was extremely embarrassing. What was frustrating was that even after showing him various sources stating that raccoons and cats were of two different species and could not mate, he went on to say that they were wrong. To this day he still believes his cat is half raccoon.

All conversations between us are very shallow. Having a meaningful, intelligent conversation just doesn't happen with him. He is a kind and wonderful person but he has no depth to him. It drives me crazy because he does not provide the mental stimulation I would like from a boyfriend. 

This all came to a head a couple days ago. This may sound silly, but we were watching that awful mockumentary The Fourth Kind. For those who have not seen or heard of it, it's a sci-fi thriller that purports to show evidence of aliens. The ""real people"" are very obviously actors and the ""archival footage"" is so obviously faked, the movie, as one critic put it, ""insults the viewer's intelligence"". My boyfriend was completely enthralled and afterwards started talking about how it was real and when I told him my doubts, he said I was crazy for not believing. This was too much for me. I later looked up a variety of articles on the movie that completely discredited it as having even the smallest degree of truth and showed them to him. He immediately dismissed them like he does with anything that proves something he believes is wrong, and got upset with me for challenging his belief. 

At that moment I couldn't help it, two years of pent up frustration just exploded out of me. I yelled at him, telling he must be an idiot for believing it. I started to cry and told him that I really worried about him in life and basically let on that I thought he was dumb. I'm not proud of it at all, but at the moment I couldn't stop it.

He was understandably mad at me and asked if I really, truthfully thought he was dumb. I didn't have an answer. He left and we haven't spoken since then. 

My question is, is there any hope for this relationship? I love him dearly but I don't think I can keep this up. I'm going to be attending a college not so far away next month and I know I'll be meeting plenty of guys. My boyfriend has no plans on attending college. He's been saying he's going to join the military for two years now but has made no steps to do so. His life consists of staying home and doing nothing unless he is out with me.

I'm sorry if at anytime I came off as arrogant in this post. I really don't consider myself to be an extremely smart person, I just enjoy learning and having meaningful conversations and wish this was something I could do with my boyfriend. I've told him this, but it's just not something he is capable of. Should I just end it? He is my first boyfriend and love, and I am really attached to him.

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is very below average when it comes to intelligence and it's getting to the point where I can no longer deal with it.

**Thanks to /u/advice47 I got the wife's facebook, and messaged her last night. Just got home from work but no reply yet.I feel like her husband deleted my msg.**

**I called her husband and told him that his wife is going to find out, but its up to him if she hears if from him first, i wish my ex told me. He said if i talked to her he fucking kill me,ha. So i messaged his wife right after
 The ex is out and staying at her dads, she took the dog, who is like my fucking daughter, because i got it for her for her birthdays a year ago. I think the worst thing about this is losing my dog.
This is weird and i feel weird.  Thanks again for everyone's insight you guys helped more than you can know.**

 **I will keep you guys updated, also sorry im not responding to individual post, theres so many and typing these things out hurts a bit.
also tons of spelling mistakes,but im ok with that**

EDIT:Thanks guys, it feels good to have some back up right now when i have no one else.  I glad you all think its the right thing to do, She is not far along with the pregnancy so i am going to tell her. I would feel 1000x better if i do.  Thing is, i dont know her name and i dont know how to get in touch with her. I found him but he does not have a Facebook. I dont know how to go about this. Any internet detectives out there want to lend a hand? 

Also his wife does not know whats going on,my ex has been begging me not to tell her. 

Im going to keep this short cuase im still a fucking wreck right now.
**TL;DR at bottom**

Me and my fiance(both 24 engaged for 1 year) have been together for 7 years, happily i thought.
We have our random fights but nothing ever big. Ive been living with her since we started dating. She is the most perfect thing i have ever seen.

I had my fiances old cracked iphone thats just been sitting around the house for a few months, I was going to take all the data off of it(music,photos of us) but as i was doing that i noticed the top text was from her ""sister"", but it said ""sorry i couldnt give you my pussy last night, my legs were all stubbly"" and i was like that is weird as fuck to say to her 12 year old sister. that was the only message in there so obviously she deleted some before it. but must of missed that one.

So i recoved all of her deleted SMS to that number( which is surprisingly easy) and came across 2 years of the most graphic dirty talk i have ever read. and how they meet up and how good the sex was and for her to send more pics of her pussy to him.
There were certain times where she would respond to my text and tell me she loves me and literally seconds after tell him she wants his cock in her. Mine and her sex was always pretty good. at least i thought

this destroyed me, i still cant belive she could do this, she is the most amazing person.

Anyways i wait for her to come home to ask her about it. I was shaking like crazy, it was fucked up, never felt like that.

She tried denying it after i asked her who the number was. then showed her the text and she admitted it was a co worker that shes worked with for 5 years.

Hes 35 and has a wife and a kid on the way....me and her are both 24.
She told me its been going on for close to 4 years and fucking him for 3.

Thing is he has a wife and a kid on the way. Ive never been so hurt in my life, i never felt like wanting to die so much. Ive lost everything because of this, My fiance my dog and my home(cant pay rent), the only things in my life i care about, I have no friends because we moved closer to her family, and i dont have much of a family

I feel like his wife deserves to know, should i tell her?
I cant believe a human could lie for so long and have no guilt about this. Or at the very least just break up with me before she continued to do this. And i feel like they will continue to fuck unless i let his wife know

I feel like this guy should lose everything hes loves just like i did.
I really want to tell his wife but i just want to see what other people would do, I feel like its the most moral decision. Please help

**TL;DR- found out my fiance of 7 years has been cheating on me for at least 3 years with a married man who has a kid on the way,I have months and months of sexual text between the two. Should i let his wife know? I feel like she deserves to know the truth, am i wrong? **

Now married, we have no sex",redditanon1,471,119,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15mh49/wife_mid_20s_and_ilate_20s_waited_for_sex_for/,"So my wife and I waited until marriage to have sex, which was a big change for me, but I had no problems respecting her wishes. We dated for a few years, and have been married for about 6 months. No sex on our wedding night, she was ""tired"". Now, anytime I try to attempt it, I'm told no. Outside of sex our relationship is the best I've ever had and I am deeply in love with her.

Not sure what to do, she hates porn, and doesn't want me to watch it. So no sex, no porn, just me and my thoughts.. I'm clearly not going to divorce her, but am at a wits end. She's made mention that it's because of my weight, which is ironic because she knew how much I weighed when we started dating and I've actually lost weight since then.

TLDR; Waited until married to have sex, now married and still no sex, wife suggested it may be due to being overweight.

**Final Update** Holy shit! Logged in this morning to a mountain of replies and messages. Been sitting here for about 30 minutes reading over all of them. So last night went really well! We ended up talking, first it started out like all the others, but I finally just told her, ""This is something I need, and something I both want us to experience. We have no intimacy and that's not ok"". So we talked about it over dinner, after dinner and a lot of things came to light. While she didn't go into everything, (but will as we have more talks), she did state that she did have a bad experience in the past with her most recent ex. Also she stated it wasn't my weight that was keeping us from having sex but rather the angles that we had tried. 

We tried a few different angles and they all were hurting her, instead we happened to come across one and it was like instant magic for her. No pain, just instant orgasm. The rest of the night was nothing but amazing, just straight up sex. It was the best sex in my life, I saw a side of my wife that turned me on even more and I feel like a damn champ after hearing, ""you have the most perfect cock"".

There are still some issues that we've got to talk about. One being why she had pain with a lot of positions, so she's going to be going to the doctors, and we both agreed to go see a sex therapist/therapist to talk about our issues.


What can I really say, I threw this post up yesterday thinking someone might reply and instead I got almost 400 replies and probably about 200 more messages. Sheer insanity. For those who told me to work through it, just want to say thanks. For those who say divorce/annul/lose it, wasn't going to happen and for everyone who read and replied. Thanks. While I didn't follow any one particular advice, all of your posts made me think about a lot of different things and it has seemed to re-awake my marriage and re-kindled my wife's and I passion for each other.


**TLDR**  Wife and I talked, had a shit ton of sex. She's going to see a doctor about pain, we're going to see therapists.


**Update 2: So over 200 comments... holy shit.** I've got a good idea of what I need to do. And sorry, that's not a divorce. Going to try to have a talk tonight and find out what's going on. This can go horrible wrong, or bring some light on things. Either way, I'll be back tomorrow for some kind of update. I've messaged some of you, and just wanted to say thanks. Out of the 200 comments, some actually helped.

No need to post anymore, i've just about answered any questions you've had. If you must know something, you can PM me and depending on the question/comment/message i'll reply. For those who did, and were legit, I thank you. Really gave me a lot to think about and go with.

**Update: Wow**... never expected to get so many replies. So the consensus seems to be

  * 1) divorce her  
  * 2) I'm obese and should have expected it. Become Healthy
  * 3) Do therapy and it won't work, so see #1
  * 4) She's just not interested in sex
  * 5) Medical issue preventing sex

Here is the [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19ol29/im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends_30f/) 

I (24f) took the kids (10f, 8m, 6m). I am considered a temporary foster parent and have custody. My friend will receive custody of them again a week after rehab. She will be checked up on and evaluated to make sure she is fit. It's been about 20 days since I've gotten them. 

The kids are good for the most part. The youngest now has the habit of calling me mom every now and then. I'm hoping it's because my actual name that they call me by starts with M. He has had nightmares for two weeks and ends up sleeping in bed with me. This stopped but after seeing his mom over Easter it's come back. I'm hoping he doesn't wake up tonight.

The oldest girl has been snippy with me a few times, but over all they have been great. The times we have visited their mom has helped the oldest to not feel so angry. It took a few times for her to realize her mom was in an actual hospital and didn't choose to leave them. I took them to their back to school night, took lots of pictures, and was very vague to the other parents... Over all they are doing better than I expected. They all have /are visiting a therapist. The middle boy has been more emotional lately and has cried about minor things. I'm a little worried about him because he always puts up a happy strong front better than the others. Their schedule is consistent. They are eating, getting homework done, seeing friends. It's been okay. They really like that I take a good half hour tucking them in like burritos and talking to them before bed.

As for me... I'm tired all the time. I didn't know what I was getting into but I don't regret it. Only had one melt down to my boyfriend that may or may not have involved tears. I have not seen my friends, but that's okay. Oddly enough my boyfriend and I have been doing quite well. He has been wonderful and keeps thinking up things we can do with the kids. He's started talking about the possibility of us having our own and really thinking through the future. That's very new. I mean I knew we are serious, but we never really sat down and thought trough how to make us work. It was always 'in the future when we move in...' or 'when we get married'. Now he's actually working and starting to plan. That took me by surprise and I'm not sure how to take it. I'm so tired I don't know what to say...

The last thing I would note is that suddenly all my guy friends are popping up and willing to 'help me'. A few have offered to take us to dinner, the zoo, and other activities. They suddenly seem very flirty and it's making me feel uncomfortable. I'm trying to not get pissed off about it, but honestly it's upsetting. It's like they want to play house or something. Like they are trying to charm the kids or do a good deed and save me. I feel like they see the kids as cute little puppies or accessories... They don't have to deal with the laundry, nightmares, and checking homework... It's just surprising to me. I keep telling myself they are just trying to help, but it rubs me the wrong way so I keep refusing... If anyone could explain it to me that would be nice.

So yeah, that's where I'm at. I don't know how things will be when their mom comes back. I'm just trying to get through today. I don't think I'm mad at her anymore, but that may be because I'm so tired all the time. Thanks to anyone who commented before!

TL;DR: I took the kids! They are doing pretty well, with a few minor bumps. I'm tired, and my guy friends are acting weird. 

Edit: I can't believe this blew up so much. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm reading all of it. Thank you to whoever got me the gold as well.

As for my male friends, I know I painted them all as bad guys. That was not my intent. A few are really great people who just want to help me and love kids. There have been two or three I have not spoken to in over a year who have popped up. I've had to firmly remind them that I have a boyfriend who has been wonderful and that comments such as 'one hot mamma' are not wanted. 

The fact is the kids are going through a difficult time and I am being over protective. The youngest is painfully shy and needs to meet a new person two or three times before he will talk. I do not want to stress him out with new people if it will only be a one time thing. If my friends (male or female) what to help and interact with the kids then they must be willing to be around for more then just one day. If they can't then maybe they can go to the grocery store or stop by for an hour or so. Nothing too stressful for the little one at this time in his life.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1365178406.0,,,True,t3_1bpttx,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bpttx/update_im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends/,
1363709985.0,340,self.relationships,1alljt,"I (F23) just found out that my older brother (M30) has been molesting his son, my nephew (M8).",confusedlilsis,413,73,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1alljt/i_f23_just_found_out_that_my_older_brother_m30/,"Has anyone ever dealt with something like this before? I have no clue how to even handle this. I will try to keep it simple.

**Back story:** My dad had a son from a previous marriage before marrying my mom and having me. My big brother lived with his mother in another city, but visited us for all the holidays and summers. I was always so excited when he would visit. We were always very close. We became even closer after he had a baby. Since he was born my nephew stayed with me and my parents a good amount of the year and I feel like I kind of raised the kid. Now that I've moved out, he comes and stays with me when he's out on summer vacation and winter holidays.

**Getting to the point:** Almost a year ago, there were allegations of sexual abuse between my brother and my nephew. It stemmed from something my nephew had told his teacher one day at school.  CPS (child protective services) became involved. This led to a full legal investigation and criminal charges being brought onto my big brother. My brother went to jail and everything.

This entire time,  I was 100% behind my brother, because there was no way in my mind that he could do anything so terrible. My nephew is slightly behind in some speech skills for his age level (due to several open heart surgeries when he was less than 6 months old).  It was a misunderstanding. People were twisting his words. Not my big brother. There's no way any of this was true.

The trial for my brother was held in another city yesterday and I was unable to attend, but my parents went. My nephew had to do an interview and my mom watched it.

My mom texted me this morning telling me that they found my brother guilty. Not only did the court find him guilty, but she herself *knows* now that he is guilty. She said there is no way my nephew could have made up all of the things he said in the interview. (I do not know what he said at this time.) She said its been going on for YEARS. Fucking YEARS! My mother couldn't stop sobbing. (It is her step-grandson, but in our family that is just as good as blood.)

**What the fuck do I do now?:** My heart is broken. How could my big brother who I've always looked up to do something like this....... to his own son? And my nephew, who I love like he's my own kid, who I've taken care of since he was an infant has been going through all of this and no one knew? I'm balling my eyes out. He's just a fuckin' lil kid, man. He's going to have to deal with this shit for the rest of his life!

I'm so angry. I feel hate and rage and sadness and loss. I love my brother, I know his life is now ruined. I know no one will ever treat him the same. I don't want this fate for him....but at the same time I fucking hate him for doing what he did.

How do I ever face my brother again? Do I act like he doesn't exist? I can't fathom forgiving him. He was supposed to be in my wedding..... Hes supposed to be the big brother he always was! I hate him. I'm scared for him. You know what they do to child molesters in jail.

I know I'll need to continue to be a great aunt to my nephew, I'm just so hurt for him. I want to whisk him away and protect him from everything. He's already been through so much and I never fucking saw it! 

My parents are in a world of grief. My Father having to see the pain in the eyes of his son and grandson...it physically hurts.


TLDR: My brother is a fucking monster, I feel betrayed by someone I thought I knew my whole life. I'm brokenhearted for my nephew, and scared for the future of my family. How does one cope with something so dark?

How does a family get past something as horrible as this?

I'm 26 years old and I've never had any romantic relationship of any kind. I've never had sex. I've never kissed a girl. I desperately want something to happen before I turn 27. At least I want to lose my virginity this year. But I have absolutely no idea how normal people form relationships. I don't have the faintest idea where to begin if I see a girl I think is cute or interesting. Anything I think of I just end up looking creepy and I never get around to doing anything. I don't know what's wrong with my brain that makes it so impossible for me to even conceive of how to start a relationship, but I definitely need some help if I want to break the foreveralone cycle in my life.

Can someone just give me some step by step details on the process people go through to form a relationship? And I'm not talking about PUA deception, or anything like that. I don't want to deceive a girl into having sex with me. I want a normal, genuine (sexual would also be nice, though), relationship. But I assume there are things I'm going to have to do in order to get that, and I have no idea what they are.

I know every relationship is different and absolute universals can't be given, but I assume there are a few general steps that show up in a large portion of relationships. Can some just give me a few bullet points on what I'm supposed to do if I want to try and start a relationship with a girl?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice this far. To answer a few questions posed, I have a few male and female friends, but not really CLOSE friends. I guess I have terrible social anxiety and have difficulty interacting with people. There are a few people who I probably could become friends with if I got out a bit more, if that makes sense. Secondly, in terms of my physical appearance, I don't think I'm notably attractive, but I also don't think I'm notably unattractive either. I'm not excessively overweight, nor am I deformed/disfigured. I'd rate myself about a 6. I have one or two hobbies, but I haven't been successful in finding groups with people around my age.

I do have a female friend I have a crush on, but I have no idea what to say to her, or how I can progress from initial offering of romantic intent to a relationship of some sort. 

EDIT 2: Wow, this got more responses than I had anticipated. Many people have pointed out that one of the biggest issues is my lack of confidence. I guess I had known this all along. The problem is that telling me to gain confidence in myself feels like asking me to grow six inches taller. I guess I have to work on my confidence alongside my suicidal depression. But thanks for the feedback on how I should proceed once I get myself sorted out.

 First of all, her holistic beliefs have some great effects when it comes to massages, healthy eating, vitamins, special diets etc. Recently, like the last 6 months, she has been watching more and more YouTube videos on massages based on lymph, chest, legs mostly from that Psychytruth channel, youtube reference below.

 Then she started to watch more of Jaiya, a self proclaimed sex therapist thy has a semi serious following. My gf was inspired by her story and decided that if Jaiya can ""make discoveries"" than so can she.

 Since then she has been experimenting on me with what she calls ""holistic sexual massages."" At first I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world. She would take her time discovering my body and bring me to climax like I never had experienced before.  As awesome as it was for me on my end, she has been discovering  more of the ""health benefits"" of these holistic sexual massages on herself as well.

 This is where it gets a little creepy for me.  For one of her sexual massages she would save my cum and masturbate with it. Sexy right? But now she has been saving my cum for when I'm not around to continue her experiments. She said she has used it in cooking, massages and for her own sexual pleasure. What's getting me even more concerned is that she is getting the support from her friends and now they are coming to her for sexual advice.

 Should I be concerned about where this could lead? Or should I let her continue with her explorations and just support her? Here are my concerns:
1. I don't want our sex life to be publicly talked about
2. I now have to masturbate into a cup so she can save my sperm
3. She is going more and more down the road of ""new age"" beliefs and I don't believe in some of the stuff she is talking about. 

[Here is a video from Jaiya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUhVek5Gpls)

[Here is a sample of the Pschetruth channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvC9Tb3dhUE)

EDIT: She has an IUD from 8 years ago - no chance of pregnancy. She wants to start a blog about her discoveries.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all your comments. I will be discussing with my GF the following points based on the comments from the thread. (She does not use Reddit so I am positive she will not see anything posted). 
1. Boundaries 
2. Future beliefs and effects on our future family and friends
3. Where she really wants to go with this

My boyfriend was naturally devastated, but after discussing it with him, he and I decided it was best to break up.

He and I are not currently talking, and there's no furniture in this apartment (I moved in on the first!) but a mattress, but I am okay.

So there is a happy ending to this story!

That's right, yesterday morning, after pondering this for the last 3 days (also on &amp; off the last few years) I told her I want to end it all - the wedding most of all, then our relationship... everything.

Mind you, I did the very same thing a few months ago but we kept on living in the same house, eating meals together, just sleeping in different rooms and pretty much not talking to each other. Eventually, she cried me out of it and even convinced me I was wrong fro trying to break up with her.

This time, I packed a few clothes, took the dog and moved in with my brother for a while. This will allow her to sort he shit out and move out so we can sell the place and also not have any influence on my decision. 

She also took it better than I ever hoped. No crying, no screaming... She just tried to turn it around, making it all my fault and pretty much saying I'll be back after a few days. This time it's permanent!

I'm actually kind of enthusiastic about all this. I know it won't be easy, it's hard suddenly not having your own place anymore but being with my brother (and dog) helps me out a great deal. I have this glorious feeling of relief and it's like I'm slowly taking my life back. In all those vain attempts to make the relationship work I had really lost myself...

Here's to the future.

For educational purposes, I moved away from my husband’s home-country last fall, and only after living on my own for 9 months have I found the courage to share my story anonymously. My story is a long one, but I am grateful for you reading it.
 
When I was 18, I moved abroad for the first time and very soon I met this guy who was foreign, handsome and cool and who to me was a window of opportunity to escape my previous life of a small country, emotionally abusive family and friends. So I decided that I would fall in love with him no matter what and make him love me in return. He was very calm about me and almost never tried to hide it. We moved in together almost immediately, although both of us were living abroad, so moving in was not something massive: I only had to move my suitcase in with him. He almost stopped French-kissing me 2 weeks after we started dating. I tried to ask him about it, but he would always say that he liked kisses on the cheek much more. So it was. I was very attracted to him and was very excited to have sex with him in the first weeks we were together, but after the first attempt failed, he explained me that he was too big to fit in a condom and that this condom experience traumatized him immensely, so every time he saw a condom he would be turned off. I believed him and started taking pills, but then he came up with new excuses: what if the pills were not reliable enough and what if I got pregnant. Again, I believed that and tried my best to help him find a solution.
 
During that time, right from the first night when we were ‘trying’ to have sex, he explained me that men cannot be hard for more than 5 minutes and that they need to cum, otherwise it hurts them a lot. So I needed to give him hand jobs. I was a virgin and it was very easy for him to make me believe all those fantastic stories. He, however, would never touch me in return. In fact, he would never even look at me. He humiliated me for wanting to have sex with him, for wanting being naked and for wanting to touch him even. He said I was a ‘bad girl’ and that I was into ‘naughty things’. At some point he played it so well that I almost had to beg him to give him a hand job. And all that time from the first week we dated I cooked, cleaned and washed for him, I took complete care of everything and he was quite cool about it all along. I thought that he was negative about pre-marital sex, so I was even proud of how honest and highly-moralized my man was.
 
He was never excited about getting married with me, but I wanted him more than anything else in the entire universe, I wanted to keep him. Finally, he agreed to marry, saying that it would be the only chance for me to get residential visas in his home-country. The fact that he, by marrying me, could get visas and work permits to the EU could never be part of the narrative; I tried to say that it benefited us both, but he always was cool about it and ‘never needed it’, although he has of course used it extensively afterwards. However, he would only marry me in a private symbolic ceremony with no wedding, no festivities and no guests. On our first night, when I was happy, excited and ready to give myself to him once and forever, he kissed me on the forehead, turned around on the bed and fell asleep. He never attempted having sex with me ever since, although I begged for it and did everything to have it. I am a very slender, tall girl and where I live now, I am often told that I am attractive; however, when I have been told so before, I always found a way of excusing it: that particular man who hit on me was probably extremely lonely, or that men looked at me because I had spilled something on my blouse.
 
Needless to say, hand jobs had to continue because I wanted him to feel good and healthy; it’s a common belief in my home country that people can only be healthy if they have regular sex. Consequently I felt that even though I was deprived of it, I could never take it away from him. As for not having actual sex – we have never had that even once, in the course of 8 years - he would come up with new excuses every time: sometimes there were other people staying in the same house (!) with us and they would hear me ‘screaming’, sometimes it was the fear of pregnancy although I was on the pill all the time. Sometimes it was just that I was too pushy for it and that this was a turn-off for him. My whole body hurt from the pain of being close to the man I loved madly and selflessly, from giving him sexual pleasure and from being completely and utterly rejected. Every time after a hand job I needed to run to fetch some napkins. He would never touch me and he made me believe that I was disgusting, dirty and unclean. And oh, I believed that! I tried to talk to him about the sexual problems millions of times and every time he would tell me to stop pushing him, he would say that he was working on solving the problems and that we shouldn’t talk about it at all. He would push me when I tried to kiss him, he would make me sleep on a separate bed whenever there was a chance and he never even once called me by my first name. Ever.
 
I also did ALL of the house work, not only routinely, but very nicely. I wanted him to have a beautiful cosy home, great food, superb desserts. I wanted to give him the best. He, however, cooked for me only once when I was in bed with severe fever and vomiting and he cooked me a cup of instant soup. He would quit jobs after doing them for a week, claiming that the jobs/environments/people there were unbearable and that they were destroying for his personality. So, his parents and I had to take care of the finances, which he was completely cool about. At some point he said that he wanted to be an academic, so he quit a job where he worked for a month after being unemployed for 1,5 years and I helped him get into a graduate programme at the university. He was very happy and very excited about it, but he claimed that he was not good at academic writing, so I needed to help him. This help was that I did his every single assignment, which made him rank school’s first and got him into several Master’s and PhD programs, including ones at Oxford, Cambridge and LSE. And he didn’t even do his applications himself, all of it was my job, because ‘I was helping him as spouses are supposed to help each other’ and ‘I was doing it for myself as much as I was doing it for him because it was for our family’s common good’. And every time he would tell me that either the assignment was crap or that my English was insufficient. Each of the papers I wrote for him got top marks; I did even better with his papers than with my own.
 
The reason why it all lasted for so long and why I never suspected anything was that he would always victimize himself, cuddle on my lap and cry about how tough life was for him. And he would always blame me, make me apologise for everything, including his mistakes (sometimes I did it on my knees) and he would strictly forbid me talking to anyone including my parents about it. He even tried to forbid me seeing some of my friends, who would ‘contaminate me with feminist ideas’. I had to cut contact with all of my male friends. And the worst thing was that he made it in such a nice and sacrificing way that I believed that a really loving couple should not spend time with their friends, and should only seek each other in this world. That lovers just want to spend all of their time together and should not waste it with other people. So, I was deeply ashamed when I spent time – especially when it was fun – with other people. I was shamed and blamed for everything, and I believed myself to be a deadly sinner who would rot in hell; a person who should spend her whole life on charitable activities to save the people I love from the ‘spill-overs’ of my sins.
 
We’ve been together for 8 years. 8 years of sexual humiliation, myths, hard work and self-disrespect. Of course there were happy moments, too, when we would eat the dinners that I cooked for us, or when we watched movies at home. I was a very happy person and I was a very cheerful one, because every time I complained about something, he made me feel as a traitor and as a selfish, ungrateful tart. When I finally gathered strength to tell my story to my best friend, I was sure my friend would be judgemental about me and would stop talking to me, because I was sure I did everything wrong in this relationship. I was sure that everything was my fault and that I was never able to help my loved one and support him in the way he needed it.
 
I tried to break up, but my husband threatens me with suicide all the time and says that he has always loved me, but has just failed to show it clearly. Moreover, he says that he has never realized that good relationship, signs of love and sex were somehow important for me. And he openly says that I was very good at showing him that I loved him immensely, that he never thought that I could eventually leave him and that he just had fun pushing the limits to see how far I could go.
 
The worst thing is that I feel deep guilt and sorrow for him. I developed a feeling that he was my child and that there was only me in the whole world to take care of him, to listen to him and to help him through life. And now when I live away and have a wonderfully rich social and professional life, I feel that I don’t deserve happiness and respect, that I am a sinner and a wicked creature and that I need to stop wanting being happy, that I need to stop my life, return to him and continue taking care of him for the rest of my life. I can’t even realize whether he has actually done anything to me or whether I’m just complaining about something entirely normal. My perception of truth is so wretched that I don’t understand what is normal and what is outside the framework of normality. Even when I am writing right now, I am afraid that I present my story too single-sided and too subjectively. Generally, I feel like a traitor for talking to people about it. I don’t know what to do and how to live on with that. I would love to hear what you think about my story. Thank you for taking your time to read it.

TL;DR Was in a relationship for 8 years, but never allowed to have sex, told to be guilty for wanting it, did chores and academic papers and finances for him. 

**edit 1:** Thank you so much everyone for reading my story! I never expected anyone to actually care. I was afraid that even my friends would turn their backs to me, because the bizarre thing is that, no matter what, I feel guilty and as the one to blame. I guess that's the dynamics of an abusive relationship (even now, after seeing 73/73 comments supporting me, I considered if writing 'abusive' was too judgmental). Sadly, I'm not a troll; if only it were a fruit of my imagination, yet it's 1/3 of my life. It really is helpful to hear the opinions of people who have no stake in the situation and who have a clear outsider perspective. Thanks again everyone for taking your time, I really appreciate what you are saying. 

**edit 2:**  I also hope that someone else in the same situation might be seeing this. Thank you all for making it clearer to me, and hopefully others. 

**edit 3:** I'll get to answer some of your comments a little later, but I hope that you understand that it's been overwhelming just to write the story itself, and to see that anybody cared to comment.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1337220743.0,,,True,t3_tq7qk,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tq7qk/married_for_8_years_never_had_sex_but_pleased_him/,

UPDATE #2: it's 5:30 AM and I just found out the guy has been cheating on me with one of his clients... I'm guessing he's been lying to me about it for several months now. I'm moving out this week, hopefully finding myself in Chicago this weekend to start up my life. I'll post an update when I settle down... I really want to help anyone else out there who may be in a similar situation. I feel stronger already after breaking up... But damn, it still hurts. Thanks for the love Reddit, you saved me tonight :) 


UPDATE:

So things didn't go so well. 

He got home and immediately started yelling at me, saying things like ""you don't own me"" and ""don't you dare act like that again."" 

I walk out of the room to ease the tension. I get back and ask where my new pack of gum is. He said he took it and brought it to work because he ""felt like it."" I knew then it was going to be a weird night. 

He was uncharacteristcally rude to me. He just kept saying over and over that I don't own him, his money means its his decision, I'm just jealous of him, I don't pay for anything (that REALLY got under my skin), and I'm a self centered bitch who is just mad because I can't afford a Maserati. 

But what hurt the most was when he got on this high fucking horse, looked me in the eye, and said ""I don't need you anymore. I have everything I want, and I just don't need you in my life anymore."" He notices I start tearing up and he calls me a child and told me to come back to him when I stop crying because he ""only likes to talk to adults."" 

I leave the house and go sit in my car to get away and clear my head. I come back and he's still an asshole... Basically knit picking every single mistake I ever made in the relationship and saying how he doesn't forgive me for anything (basically for having guy friends) and he's going to start ""doing him"" and told me he really doesn't care about what I think. 

When I asked about the car, he said ""I don't need to discuss it with you."" He was strangely protective of his phone. When he gets into these ""fuck you"" attitudes, 9 times out of 10 he will start talking to other women behind my back. I can only assume history is repeating itself. 

So, I essentially looked at him, told him I am disappointed in the man he has become, that his head is getting too big for him to be a respectable person, I don't appreciate being called names or being hurt on purpose. I said ""fuck you"" and walked out of the room. It felt good, I can't lie. 

So I'm here, crying, ugh. I'm calling my parents... Just trying to figure out a way for me to get out of here. I know I deserve better than this but damn, if you've ever been in a relationship that lasted years, I'm not so sure I'm ready for this long road ahead of me without him, tbh. Any advice on coping with that is appreciated. 

Thanks again to everyone for their input. It hurts now but I'm sure in the long run I will be better off. :( 

**tl;dr** my boyfriend came home and was very rude to me, told me he doesn't need me in his life anymore because he has everything he ever wanted, we fought, I said ""fuck you"" and I am planning in leaving as soon as I figure out my exit plan.

One daughter, 14 months old. Im 28/m and she is 27/f. The marriage hasn't been great for probably the last year, stress with the baby, family, work, etc. In October, I took a position that had me working abroad. Ten weeks abroad, two weeks at home. Great pay, but stressful and long distance with the wife and baby. We needed the money so I took the position. 

At first the distance was bearable, we were skyping close to daily and we were missing one another a lot. But eventually, work became stressful and she started to kind of distance herself from me. I didn't worry about it enough and let it happen. I came home in March for my two weeks, and we were just not close. She wouldn't have sex with me, which was hurtful and we were fighting a lot. I thought something was up and ended up finding some messages between her and another guy. I confronted her and told her I understood (because I did) and that we both had to work harder on us. That I knew the distance was tough but I was doing it for us and so that we could be better. She admitted that she had been too friendly but swore nothing else happened. We made up and started to talk about our future more, and about buying a house and when I left again I felt good about things. 

Once I left, it didn't take long for us to fall back to the same fighting. It honestly felt like she was picking fights with me, and she just wasn't being kind. That is the best way to describe it. She was just being a bitch. Again, I started to feel more suspicious because of the messages and I hacked into her accounts. I know I'm supposed to say I felt guilty, but I didn't. 

What became clear was that she was fucking another guy and was very, very serious about him. The sex was bothersome, but it didn't bother me that much. I understand how tough the distance can be. What bothered me was the emotional talk and then being such a bitch to me. I didn't confront and just watched her activity, and I saw her becoming closer and closer with this guy. Emailing him several times a day, telling her she loved him, and then finally some pictures with him, her, and our baby. Which was probably the final straw. I asked one of my close friends to go by our house on his way to work and back to just see if anything was up, and he told me he saw a truck in the driveway of the house we are renting, multiple times. 

I'm due to come home at the end of this month and want to be smart and careful when I go back. I really feel like her actions are divorce worthy. It is a betrayal in every single sense and it makes my heart weak. I cannot believe someone would do this to me. Especially since our relationship has never gone through things like this... she is a normal, kind person. What I think is unforgivable is parading this prick in front of our child. That shit hurts. While I'm working for our family, she is essentially replacing me while living off me. 

The only positive in all of this is that my work is going really, really well and the company I work for loves me. They have offered me a full-time position and would be willing to sponsor me for immigration purposes. At first, I wasn't too eager of leaving home, but seeing as home doesn't have much for me this fresh start option is becoming very, very attractive. I really think its probably the best move for me... let my wife be with this guy and get a divorce. Its not a great situation for my daughter, but I just think I'd be marginalized moving forward anyways. I don't know. I do feel like our situation is beyond marriage counseling or anything like that. I confronted her and she lied to me and kept up her affair... and even jumped in further. She has chose the other person in every sense over me, and it fucking hurts. And we haven't even been married that long. 

**tl;dr My wife has been cheating on me for months while I have been working abroad. The affair is serious, she loves him, brings him around our child, and she has lied to me and been very hurtful. Feel like the marriage is dead, and I'm better off staying abroad and pursuing a divorce.

Thanks everyone for the positive advice and support. I decided not to worry about it and just enjoy my time with this woman. 

We went on our third date and she was asked for ID yet again - I used that as a way to bring up my own age. She asked if the age difference bothered me, as she didn't really think about it. I said it didn't, only that I wanted her to be in the know. She thanked me for that and explained she typically finds she's drawn to men older than her, so nothing about our mutual attraction seemed out of place.

Since then we've seen each other at least twice a week, and I feel like I'm the kid here. Falling pretty hard, not going to lie. She's a gifted young woman, scary smart and very sensual. I feel like when she's focused on me I'm the most important person on the planet. She reaches out to put her hand on my arm or to touch my cheek, subtle, but always making it obvious we're together. She's interested in my work, my actual work, and not just how much money and ""stuff"" comes with what I do. That's refreshing. 

My only real issue now (and it's a great one to have) is slowing myself down. She was very upfront that she takes sexual relationships pretty seriously so she's slow to crawl into bed with a partner, and so we've yet to sleep together (though we're very affectionate physically otherwise). I'm fine with that but in having trouble stopping myself from asking her to travel with me already and making her a real center of attention in my day to day life. 

I just have to remind myself we have plenty of time!

**TLDR**: so far so good, the age difference doesn't really seem to matter to anyone involved.

[Update 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19y78g/update_2_i_22f_am_staring_at_my_mostly_packed/)

It's been a circus in some ways, and I don't know where to start. First, I'd like to say thank you to those who responded and those who sent me messages. I got quite a few, so I apologize if I didn't respond to all of them.

I have to say, sometimes silence is golden. I haven't volunteered any information to people my ex is friends with, but it appears that I did make friends with some of his friends as well. I guess our friend circles weren't as separate as I thought. Some of his (our?) friends have been giving him a hard time, so much that I asked them to stop. I don't want to be blamed as leading their behavior and it's only going to cause me more crap. Some of his friends have stopped talked to him and I'm the one who got blamed for it.

It appears my ex tried to stretch the truth a bit, embellishing our breakup with things that made his friends disbelieve him. I don't know all the details and don't care to. I told his friends that I'm not interested in hearing updates anymore, and they seem to be listening. I guess they thought they were doing me a favor, but I really, really, don't care to know.

And as I say that, the most interesting information came from his mother. Yes, I accepted her call. She hadn't contacted me in a while and she also sent me a birthday gift, so I felt a bit obligated. It looks like my ex was either unfaithful, is rebounding, or is just plain insane. He is moving in with another woman when the lease is up and they are someway involved. She was an acquaintance and I didn't really think anything of her. Supposedly it's all over facebook, so much that even his mom figured it out. I basically told her good luck (politely) and ended the conversation. She hasn't called me since then. I don't know what her motivation was there.

My ex is also still trying to contact me. I am not getting cursed as much. It's mostly me getting blamed for ruining his social life and him curious about what I've been up to. I blocked his number, but he's a sneaky SOAB. Most recently, he made a user name that was almost like one of my good friends except for a character difference and tried to chat with me. Perhaps I should have been more aware but it's one of those usernames with too many numbers and he even had her thumbnail/avatar on it. Other than that (which was very brief), I have not responded to him.

So that's what's going on by him, whether I wanted to know or not. TIL people are pretty damn nosy.

On my side: I'm doing better. I am disease free and healthy. My brother and I are getting along great. I got a more reliable job that starts this summer in the NYC area. I can actually commute from my brother's home, but I do want to get my own place soonish, but it's going to take some time. I kind of want to do the Reddit thing of getting a pet when I get my own place. While a dog person, I think I'll get a cat. It's a bit in the future, but it's something I am looking forward too. 

On the romantic side: I have no intentions of being in a LTR anytime soon, but I am enjoying talking to people and learning how to flirt, which is kind of fun. I have reconnected with old friends which is nice as well. I did establish a relationship with a counselor and I think it's starting to help. When I feel upset or frustrated I try and think back to why. I was told that I doubt myself even if I'm sure I'm correct about something, so I'm trying to get some confidence in myself.

I'm not done, but I feel *good*. I don't feel like I'm just going through the motions. Seeing how things are unfolding makes me happy I made the choice I made. Could I have handled it better? Maybe, but I do not regret my actions that have led me here. Live and learn, right?

TL;DR: I'm happy and doing better with a job and want a kitty soon. Ex is a sneaky SOAB and is still trying to contact me, but it's manageable. He's moving in with some new chick (according to his mom).

We became empty nesters several years ago. Last fall she took a job working for someone who was a friend of ours.

During the time she worked for him, she assured me he was gay. She would go out to his home after hours (with my knowledge) to help him with his computer or similar stuff. I missed her, I wanted her home, but it made her happy and I felt it was innocent, since he was gay.

Turns out he isn't gay - I caught her having sex with him February 7.

Over the next week she continued to contact him secretly while she said she was trying to work out things with me. I finally said I needed to see her Facebook, phone, etc. to see what had really been going on.

Looking at her Facebook, I found out she had a number of single female friends whom she had been messaging about him and about me, and that she had been telling them awful lies about me for the last couple years, mirroring the negative things they were saying about the men in their lives.

She claims she said those things to fit in. To be liked.

She had done similar things a few other times in our marriage. Each time she had gotten together with a group of women who were upset with their partners and said terrible, untrue or extremely exaggerated things about me. Each time she has promised she would not do that to me again.

Looking at her Facebook and text messages, I also found she was ""coaching"" the man she was having the affair with to do the things she liked in bed. I guess that makes sense, but it's a hard pill to swallow.

I love her, I am committed to her, but I have to have loyalty, fidelity and partnership. I am 50. This is the only life I have. I can't wait another 10 years to ""see"" if she will be true to me.

I don't feel I can talk to family or friends about this because it will permanently taint her in their eyes. No one has any idea what is really going on.

I am coming to reddit mostly to help me think through the process. She is away for the weekend at one of our son's houses, so I have a couple days to think.

Here are questions I have:

Am I being naive to think she will be loyal and faithful now when she hasn't been in the past?

How do I determine the best path for my own life going forward?

I went over to her place and explained what my deal was. At first, she was hesitant, still a bit mad at me. As I let my story unfold, she began to understand and tried to comfort me. It went from ""What did you want to talk about?"" to ""I'm sorry I accused you of using me for sex."" She tried really hard to assure me that she's not attracted to standard issue fratbros.

To be honest, I was stressed out when talking to her in such a personal manner. It's the first time I've let someone in, dropping feelings and such. But, I'd like to believe I smoothed things out, and I told her that if she was still mad at me, I'd understand. 

She had a greek life event to deal with, but before I left, she said ""I love you. Trust me."" to which I responded with an ""I love you"" of my own. You best believe she was giddy. Said she'd text me and we could hang out after she was done.

Anyways, that's my story. It's funny, because if this all works out, I would have never thought I'd be in this situation with an incredible girlfriend 1 year ago.

So, my previous post didn't get a ton of attention but I thought i'd post an update because I'm so over the moon, even though it's pretty bittersweet. After hanging out two weeks ago and texting and talking madly leading up to the 20th, she actually revealed to me that she had been in love with me for about as long as I had with her. She said she couldn't stop thinking about me, dated other people to forget about me, basically the exact same thing I went through with her. 

We ended up deciding to get a hotel room and just getting out all of the sexual tension that had been built up for so long. Needless to say, it was amazing. She is adamant on wanting to try long distance and won't take no for an answer (of course I had already agreed to it). It may or may not work but I'm glad things worked out the way they did and I know I would have regretted it forever if I didn't try. 

If anyone has any tips for someone starting a long-distance relationship, I'd love to hear it. 

**tl;dr** : Girl I've been in love with has been just as much in love with me, we hooked up, and are going to try long distance.

*TL;DR- Called my wife by a co-workers name during sex and now she doesn't trust me to work with her.*

I realize I'm hosed....trust me.  I just don't know what to do at all to recover from this.  

The co-worker is a woman that works for me.  She's contract and has been there about 3 months.  She's attractive, I'll admit, but I don't have feelings for her or anything like that.  She's just another co-worker but I have been training her so we've had to work closely together lately.  I honestly have no idea why I said her name.  My wife and I were having sex and I was doing the normal ""letting my mind wander so I can go a little longer"" and my mind drifted to work, a project, then her and it just happened.  My wife was inconsolable.  I talked to her at length and she does believe me now when I tell her I have not cheated with this woman. I offered up everything....access to my phone, text, logs, email, everything and she knows that I'm not missing any time that can't be accounted for but I can't convince her that I'm not sexually interested in this woman.  

The sticky part is this:  her contract is up and we have the option to hire her. She's a good worker and there is no question that I want to hire her. It's not fair to her to let her go through NO fault of her own but my wife is convinced if we continue working so closely together, something will happen.  And she is not a jealous person so this isn't just a passing thing that she thinks about every woman.  I mean I called her by this woman's name for Christ sake....I can see why she's rattled.  We have a wonderful marriage, rarely fight, have sex like rabbits, etc. so I don't want to do anything to mess this up.

So what now?  My wife hasn't made any demands but this just happened two nights ago so she's still digesting it.

hope I did that right, anyways...

He came home that night and I didn't say anything, I wanted to wait till the next night when hopefully I'd have a clear head and stuff. 

When he came home the next night, I had a hard time finding the gusto to flat out tell him how I felt and to leave him. So I pussy footed around for awhile asking shit like ""why didn't you invite me out last weekend?"" and ""what do you have planned this weekend? am I invited too?"" I got the same answers I always did. Half assed ""OK you can go if you really want to..."" type shit. 


Then all I did was tell him that I want to be with someone who wants to spend time with me. He said that he does want to spend time with me, just like at home on the couch watching star trek and eating dinner. I told him that I wanted a partner who wanted to take me to the parties he went to, and I could take him to the parties I wanted to go to, etc. I told him that it made me question his committment, it made me question his intentions and his fidelity, and it made me wonder if he was embarrassed of me. 


He first tried to say that he felt awkward when I was around, like he had to take care of me (at parties). When I asked him why he had no real reasons. It basically went on like this for a few hours. 

Finally, when I realized this was going no where, I just told him that I was going to put in my months notice on the apartment tomorrow. He could either stay and keep the lease or move too, I didn't care. I told him I was going to stay at my mother's for the night. He also didn't care about that. I've been here for a 2 nights now and he calls me begging me to come back/for another chance. Although it was tempting (I do care about the guy. I am attached to him and the idea of starting all over fresh is scary) I did what I knew I had to do. I stuck to my guns, even if it means having to live with my parents for awhile. 

I told him that as soon as I was off the lease I'm going to change my phone number.


The end! I am free of this horrible relationship and although I feel like I'm in limbo I know that it's for the best, I will be just fine/better off, life goes on, and a year from now I can look back and be proud of myself.

TLDR: Left that d bag in the dust, thank you all for your support. I feel wonderful about it, even though it's a little weird. 

Thank you to everyone who responded to my first post. Although I consider myself a pretty strong young woman, it really helped to hear some validation regarding my feelings.

Today I filed to divorce. I ended up finding out so much more as to the extent of his cheating - including accessing all his emails to and from one girl who considered him her ""boyfriend"".


We went to counseling, but it devolved into him blaming me for not fufiling his ""needs"". He became verbally abusive every day. He had his sister come stay with us to talk to me about staying with him. Both of them seemed to think that this is ""just something couples go through"" and it would make us stronger.

But in the end, I couldn't do it. I couldn't forgive him, and I saw a side of him in those emails I can't forget. A controlling man who sought out young women to manipulate.


So, I am living in a much smaller apartment far into Brooklyn (no more Manhattan condo). But I am happy, and free, for the first time in many years.

**tl;dr of original post: FIL with history of gambling issues and money problems wants to move in with us only after 2 months of us getting married. I am working, my wife is currently unemployed. Torn on whether or not we should take him in.**

So I just first wanted to thank each and everyone of you for providing opinions and insight. I read every single one and took it to heart. This is what I love about reddit, I get all sides of the coin and it helps really evaluate the situation from an internal perspective as well as external.

*****************************************************

**Now to the update:**

Before meeting FIL I discussed with the wife again her feelings about the situation. She re-iterated that she would still like for me to take the lead on the situation and just told me to let him down gently. She assured me that it wasn't going to create any resentments and wouldn't be upset. 

I ended meeting FIL to discuss things over a beer. After exchanging some pleasantries and talking about the hockey game that night we got to brass tacks.

**Here is a paraphrased version of what I said:**

*Your daughter and I spoke about what you asked of us and ultimately she left the decision with me.*

*First of, I want to say that we definitely want to help you and we will.*

*The day I put that engagement ring on your daughter's hand was the day she and our future marriage became my highest priority above anyone or anything. Right now as newlyweds we are trying to build a life and a foundation for a loving and healthy marriage.*

*Right now, introducing a third person into our day-to-day is going hinder that foundation's growth. Taking you in is not something we can do at this very moment and I would be having this conversation with any of my other family members if they asked me the same thing at this very point. I know this is not what you want to hear but right now we're trying to do what's best for us without leaving you out in the cold. So we're still going to help you in other ways.*

Then I briefly outlined a plan where we could help him with getting his business site up and cover costs like business cards. I also offered to help him with the job and apartment hunt. Finally I said that we could offer limited financial support where ever we could afford it. I said I was sorry and felt terrible that this is how it had to happen.

He actually took the news quite well. Told me not to feel bad and that he'd figure it out, like he always does. We ended up shooting the shit for an hour talking about, his plans, our relatives and just our lives in general.

I called the wife to update her on the situation. She seemed a bit stunned/numb on the phone when I told her what happened. She didn't really know what to say when I asked her how she felt about it. When I got home she seemed fine but I know that she's probably feeling a bit guilty about the whole thing. Won't press the issue until she's ready to talk about it again — possibly later tonight.

TBH I'm feeling really bad about the whole thing. It sucks to have to do that to someone. I know the right decision was made just can't help but feel a bit guilty. 

**tl;dr: I told FIL that we cannot take him in because we need time to be newlyweds and be married but that we could help him with job hunting, the apartment search and limited financial support. He took the news well and didn't put up a fight. I just feel like shit about having to do that.**

Alright, so we had the party. My boyfriend was completely surprised. (He nearly cried a little later because he never had many friends before. Seeing them all in one place made him realize just how many people liked him.)

So, she backed out. The only person she ruined the party for was the friend who got her pregnant. He kept having to baby her in our room and wasn't able to actually join the party. She summoned me a few times to ask me to quiet the party down so she could sleep (At around 11, the party started at 9). She took more offense to my other roomie who is naturally a loud person. And kept asking her to specifically be quiet. 

But she didn't really have too much of an issue. My boyfriend was a little miffed when she'd wander into the party to tell me to quiet down, but she didn't ruin his night. 

**TLDR: She chickened out and did nothing. Asked me to quiet down early, but we ignored her.**

PS: A bit of good news. I'm moving out in about a month with my boyfriend and a close friend of mine. I found out that our last roomie (not the loud one), is moving out this week. Brittney and her are pretty close and have a lot in common, so she's been a buffer for how nice I am to Brittney. Once she's gone, I don't have to keep playing mock nice. 

**EDIT: There is one thing I want to add. I found this out this morning, so I was a bit pissed off. The reason she came home early was, according to her boyfriend, she was at a party the night before with her cousin. Her cousin got shit faced and couldn't drive and suggested they drive home in the morning. She didn't want to spend the night there, so called her boyfriend at 1 in the morning to pick her up. It's a 2 hour drive to her mother's place. She had been sleeping most of the day before the party because they didn't get home until 5 in the morning.**",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1343688171.0,,,True,t3_xeuym,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xeuym/update_my_roomie_is_planning_on_ruining_my/,

I have a wedding page - I'm not super into weddings (It's literally called, ""I'll probably elope, but..."") and occasionally pin something I see off my page - lots of my friends are getting married and post a lot of pretty dresses and flowers, etc - it's not like I'm planning a wedding or on wedding sites, they pop up on my home feed mixed in with cakes and clothes.

I'm PISSED. I'm annoyed at the girl for involving herself in this and blowing it out of proportion, and really angry at him for thinking that this board means I'm doing something I'm not. Occasionally pinning a few pretty things to a board suddenly means I'm a huge nag shrew itching to get married.

",confusedlilsis,414,85,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aqtng/update_i_f23_just_found_out_that_my_older_brother/,"Original thread is [here.](http://redd.it/1alljt)

I'm sorry for not replying to all of your heartfelt comments. I read every single one of them. Your personal stories have made me feel less lost and alone. The past couple of days have been a blur, but you all have offered such kind words and given me moments of clarity. Thank you. I mean that.

I noticed that in the OP I did not offer my brother's defense and what he says actually happened and I figured you all might be curious. His side of the story is that he was only teaching his son how to properly wash and take care of his uncircumcised penis as my nephew has had a history of not properly washing himself and getting rashes/infections. (This is confirmed by my nephew's mother and his pediatrician). However, during my nephew's original interview when he was initially taken into CPS custody, it is my understanding that my nephew said that he was made to also touch his fathers penis, and demonstrated how he touched it using a crayon as a prop. Now I know kids learn dirty things in school, but I don't think he would say this about his father for no reason. 

It's important to note that during the trial, my nephew testified via closed circuit TV from another room in the courthouse and stated that *nothing ever happened between him and his dad, and that he doesn't even remember what he told his teacher the day CPS took him*.  I believe he was embarrassed and scared. It is my understanding that many victims recant their original statement out of fear or embarrassment. 

**One point many of you made was that most abusers have been abused themselves.** In the case of my brother, unfortunately that is true. My brother's mother (who is bat shit crazy, btw) had many boyfriends who walked in and out of my brother's life when he was a kid. As it turns out, at least one of those boyfriends abused my brother sexually when he was a child. He never told anyone about it, but it came to light during the investigation. For me, this was a pretty strong indicator of his guilt as I know sexual abuse is a cycle.

**THE SENTENCING:** My brother was sentenced to 12 years prison on 2 counts of indecency with a child. I looked up his mugshot online. Why the fuck did I do that? Bad idea. (From what I understand, he can be up for parole in a little over 2 years.)


**Many of you asked about the mother of my nephew.** Her and my brother have been divorced for about 4 years (since my nephew was about 4 years old). They separated because they got married too young for the sake of the baby and knew it just wasn't right. It was mutual, therefore not an ugly or drawn out divorce. Since they separated, my brother had primary custody of my nephew who visited his mother on weekends and holidays. In the state I am from, it is rare that the father is granted custody over the mother, but custody arrangements were handled and agreed upon by my brother and his ex-wife outside of court. He had a more stable job than she did and lived in a better neighborhood. Now of course, my nephew is living with his mother and her new husband.

Now that my brother is actually in prison, the entire family knows. And of course, the family is beginning to take sides. Many are adamant that my brother is innocent. They've asked me what I think and I've just stated that my first concern is for my nephew, and making sure he grows up as normally as possible. I really hope my family can keep it together and just be supportive. 

I will take all of your kind advice to heart and be the awesome aunt I have always been by treating him the exact same as I always have but being watchful for any signs something may be wrong. (even though I was blind to the abuse all these years.)

I'm deeply hurt by/for my brother. I'm filled with rage and sorrow for him. The love and memories I still have of him are tainted now, I know we will never have the same relationship, especially since he still says he's Innocent. I'll be the sister that **betrayed** him. (he has another half sister from his bat shit crazy mother who believes him)

I've suggested to my mother that my father see a counselor. I've never seen my father so heartbroken. He blames himself for not being there enough for my brother as a kid. (My brother's bat shit crazy mother made it very hard for my dad to see my brother, while all along her boyfriends were abusing him) 

Thank you again for opening up your hearts to me to share your very private stories, and giving support and advice. I don't feel up to talking out loud about it to anyone really, even my closest friends or boyfriend, so this has really helped me get it out in a constructive way. 

**TLDR: 12 years prison for my brother, family torn apart. Thank you all again so much for your input and support. I can't put into words how much it has helped me deal with this internally. Now go hug all of your families.**

She had been running with our dog nearly everyday (and I don't mean jogging, I mean nearly sprinting). I started to join her and would pretend to get tired about half way through and tell her to wait up and we'd jog/walk the rest of the way. Then I told her I was concerned about our dog if she runs too fast too long. She agreed to slow down. 

A week or so later I got the flyer from our university's counseling program and slipped it into her diary. This way she would know I had read it, and that I was concerned but I wouldn't have to tell her to her face. I hoped to keep her from feeling attacked.

She didn't bring it up at all for a few days, although she acted a little differently. One night while we were spooning she turned around and told me that she had made an appointment with them. I apologized for reading her diary, but she seemed shockingly okay with it, that being said I won't do it again. She deserves the privacy and what she writes is none of my business.

She went once and then was referred to a specialist outside of the school. She's been visiting this doctor twice a week and I already notice an improvement. She's cut back on exercising, and even eats junk food once and a while (something she NEVER did before). 

I try to stay awake until she falls asleep to make sure she isn't crying by herself. She still does every once in a while, but not nearly as much, and I'm glad there is an improvement. I was really worried after reading her diary that she may be on the verge of an eating disorder and thanks to those who responded to my original thread I think we safely avoided that.

I just wanted to thank you guys so much. I really had no idea what to do and hearing from others and their experiences really helped me decide how to handle this situation. It's baby steps, but she and I are definitely going to get through this.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_ujkqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ujkqw/update_really_worried_about_my_girlfriends_mental/,

**UPDATE** So reading the advice I got here, I(24) went with the feelings I initially had and decided to dump him(27). I don't want to go into details because I'm still shaken up by it, but he first threatened to harm me and when I told him I would call the cops, he threatened to harm himself. He called house this morning and told my parents about us and lied about me having sex with him on top of everything else in addition to lies about me stealing from him (which I didn't). 

They confronted me and I told them the truth about what had happened and about everything in general. I never really shared my personal life with my parents and I started crying uncontrollably. I told them how pathetic I felt and how I felt like I was always a piece of shit and a failure. My father was especially upset, but with my now ex boyfriend more than me. 

He told me he was disappointed in me that I would behave in a non-chaste manner, but he understands that we are in a different place, and that I am a part of a different culture than him. He told me that his duty is to protect ME and to love ME unconditionally no matter how old I am and he forgave me. My female cousin recently committed suicide because of her family not approving of her and we all loved her to death - she was around my age and I guess this drove home a lot to my dad about how to approach situations. 

 He apologized for not being there more and not being available enough and my mother told me that she is just glad that he didn't actually hurt me. She actually joked and said ""don't you wish you had of let me choose your SO's?"" 

I just got done changing my phone number and that doesn't change much knowing he knows my emails, but I've blocked him on there too.  I'm not too afraid, though: if he comes around or tries to hurt me, I have plenty of cousins and uncles, some of which came up the hard-way back home. My brother is already riled up, but 1,200 miles away (thankfully). I just want this to be over with as soon as possible. 

**TL;DR** - *broke up with boyfriend, boyfriend goes thermonuclear and threatens me and himself. Father and Mother are angry, but very supportive - much more than I expected. Waiting to see how it's going to go in the next couple of weeks. Still hurts to be betrayed, but glad to be out of that bad situation.*

Thank you, reddit, for giving me the courage to finally dump that jerk. It's going to make things awkward in our circle of friends, and it hurts a lot that a friend like him would betray me like this and I feel like I wasted so much time. I know that people change, and I have to change myself in order to become stronger. I need more self-esteem and I'm realizing that I only dated him because I was so alone, not because I actually liked him. This bad relationship and how it spiraled out of control was a wake up call to me about how empty my life was.

 I had nothing else going on in my life careerwise. Knowing this, and reading a few things online, I decided to make some goals for myself: 

Goal 1: Work on myself and get to know myself again.

Goal 2: Try to move out, get my shit in gear, ACE the PCAT (sick of being only a tech with a BS) and build a deeper relationship with my parents

Goal 3: Meet a nice brown boy that understands where the hell I'm coming from and do everything but sex WITHOUT a hijab on :)

Goal 4: Get a cat.

Thanks, guys. : )

Super helpful everyone, thank you so much. Here is the outcome today.

I asked my husband if we could put our phones on silent at night to avoid phone calls and texts, I said nothing about his mom. He immediately launched into a tirade about his mother, and how crazy she has gotten since we moved. I let him talk...a lot. He basically feels like she needs to chill out, and she's being over the top. I agreed, I did not mention what happened on Reddit here today, he basically did all the talking. 

We are going to give her a few weeks to calm down, we won't ignore her if there is a real issue, but if she's just flaking we give her a couple days before we engage. If that doesn't work, he is going to say something to her. Turns out, even when it comes to his mom, my husband is a stand up guy...

Thank you everyone for all your help today, even if all it did was calm me down, and give me ideas of future action. I like how this community really gets down to business.

Let me explain...,craigersmith,383,56,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17bj7d/update_my_wife_25f_is_cheating_on_me_27m_without/,"[Original post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/179bsy/my_wife_25f_is_cheating_on_me_27f_without/)

Thank you all so much for your comments and advice. It has all been very eye opening and helpful. 

I came to realize I was in denial and that, whether my wife realized it or not, this was a problem that needed fixing. 

As I posted already yesterday, I left her a letter at home explaining my feelings and packed a small bag. I went to spend the night in the hotel and asked to meet with her tonight to talk this thing out. 

In the letter, I posted about a dozen of the comments from your folks, just so she could see what other people think of our situation (I also included what **I** posted, so she would know I didn't exaggerate). *Don't worry, I didn't include your handles, so she won't be coming after you.*

When she got home and read the note, she called me. I didn't answer, but in her voicemail (in which she was bawling, which is very uncharacteristic of her), she begged me to come home and talk.

She said in the message that yesterday she was at lunch with the other guy and they both had already decided to end the friendship, because they both realized they were developing feelings for each other.

After a while, I decided to go home and talk with her.

We had quite a long conversation. She told me that the other day, he admitted to having feelings for her, but promised not to push. She told me that the day before yesterday, she realized she was developing feelings for him too, and it scared her.

She said she REALLY thought they were just friends, that she was refusing to believe it was becoming anything more, and then it just happened.

She told me that they didn't do anything physical yet, that it hadn't gotten that far, which is why they decided to end the friendship, because neither wanted to cross a line they can't uncross.

I'm choosing to believe her in that.

She told me that even though she was already backing out of the friendship with him, that the letter I left really opened her eyes at what she was doing to me and to us. It killed me to see her so broken and ashamed. I've never seen her like this before.

We both cryed for a long time, I said everything I had to say and asked the questions I needed to know the answers to. I believe she was honest with me, finally, about everything, including some things that were hard to hear. This went on for a couple hours.

Instead of staying at the hotel by myself, I invtied her to come with me. We went out to dinner, went to the hot tub at the hotel, and then had a wonderful night together.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking, but this isn't the end of it. We've got a lot of stuff to work through. We're talking about some counseling and it'll take me a while to fully trust her again.

I'm not just letting it slide like nothing happened. But I'm also not giving up on my marriage. I will not. I never will. Some of you may think that makes me a chump, but I don't care. This is the woman I pledged to spend the rest of my life with, and as long as I have a say in the matter, I don't intend on breaking that promise. For better or for worse, right?

Today, I also sent a text message to the other guy, telling him that my wife told me what was going on and that I wanted to make it clear that if I ever see even just a single non-work-related text from him on her phone again, that we will be having a different discussion and in person.

My wife and I have a long road ahead of us, but I'm positive we are both committed to getting things fixed between us and moving forward.

I really wanted to thank all of you (at least those of you who offered real advice) for yesterday. I needed to be woken up and I think it happened just in the nick of time. I feel like this dark cloud is finally starting to break up.

**TL;DR** I left my wife a letter expressing all my feelings and fears and left for the night. She called and begged me to come home. We talked for several painful hours, as she explained that, while nothing physical happened between her and her male friend, they both admitted that they were developing feelings for each other and decided it would be best to part ways. My wife and I are going to work on our relationship and move on from this. It's going to take some time for me to trust her again, but I'm not giving her up without a fight. Thank you Reddit for giving me the courage to stand up for myself. It may have just saved our marriage.

**SECOND UPDATE 1/27** Hello again everyone. Thank you all (most of you, anyway) for your wonderful messages of encouragement! My wife and I have been having a lot of deep, emotional discussions over these last couple days. Having been with her for 12 years, I can honestly say that I've noticed a big change in her during these past couple months, but these past few days, she's finally back to her old self again. I can tell that she's sincere. Found out that the other guy and his wife and moving away soon, which makes me happy. My wife has felt so terrible, she is committing to being transparent, allowing me to be as ""nosey"" as I need to be, and to check up on her as much as I need to until I feel comfortable again. We are going to be starting up some counseling with our pastor soon, which I think is going to be a great help. It still hurts that it even got as far as it did. I've been cycling through anger, hurting, disappointment, and hope. I'm sure it will take a long while before those bad feelings go away. But we're going to be okay.

I know it has taken a while for an update, but I finally have the chance to sit down an give one. For those of you that read the original post and gave me advice, thank you. And even those who might have just now, thank you. After reading all the comments, I took the best advice I possibly could.....I moved on. After the original post, I mentioned to her about the post and she read it. Of course she promised to change and I agreed to work with her on it. Well, that lasted a whole two weeks. It just got worse and worse. So finally I just sat her down and broke the news to her. Of course she didn't take it well and was trying to put me on a guilt trip, but I stood strong and put my foot down. Instead of her having her way with me as before. 

I moved into my own place since then and it's amazing living in MY own place. I couldn't be happier with my decision. I've already made plans to start my traveling, alone. I really can't thank everyone enough for all the help. It was all mixed, but a majority if it pointed to opening my eyes and seeing what was happening and to move on. So again, thank you all.

**TL;DR!** UPDATE: My gf(21) and I(27m) went on vacation and she ruined it.

**EDIT** A moderator must have deleted the original post because I had a picture link of myself in there. I will copy and paste story right here shortly. 

**EDIT 2** here's the story....I've been with this girl for around a year now. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me and a definite diamond in the rough. She's perfect to me and I love everything about her. Well, when we first for together I had already paid for a one week stay in New York City for myself and of course I extended the offer for her to join me. Which she did. Well as the time got closer and closer to go, I could tell she would have rathered going to an island or beach somewhere. Of course she insisted on going to NYC and she promised she would have a good time.
This is after explaining to her that it has been a life long dream for me to visit the city and do it alone..well...of course we fly to NYC and begin our week stay. We are from Louisiana by the way. Well from the instant we got there, there was constant complaining and whining , etc etc coming from her. And needless to say, it didn't stop. I didn't get to do anything I ever wanted to do during our time there, including missing the Yankees and Mets series which was the biggest reason behind me wanting to go. Well so we returned home from a crappy time and I still haven't heard the last of it.
Well anyways, my other two vacation spots are Europe and Japan. And I want to go alone. I love the girl with all my heart, but it's something I feel I would enjoy more by myself while I still can. Should I be willing to take her on anothe vacation as such? Or should I break it to her that I want to go alone? I know she would still stay with me regardless, but I'm not one to take advantage of certain things like that. Is there a possible way I could break it to her nicely or just risk it and take her anyways? Please help, because I just want to be nice and make sure everything goes smoothly.
I just don't know what to do and I'm split on the situation. Oh and another thing, she mentioned he would like us to go on a cruise to the Bahamas. Which is fine, except fr the fact that I work in the Gulf of Mexico for thirty days at a time and see enough water! Please help!! Tl;dr my gf[21] and I [27m] went on vacation and she ruined it.
EDIT: this is me by the way. I'm not the most attractive guy, so it could be a confidence thing leading to my problems of just not putting my foot down and moving on or doing what I need to do.  and also I want to thank everyone here for posting and opening my eyes to what's going and hopefully this will end up leading me to new adventures and a happier life.

**********************************************************
** EDIT:** To everyone so far - I really do appreciate the honesty here. Thank you. 



If this gets muddled up and strange, I'm sorry. I'm not a fantastic story teller to begin with, and now I'm trying to get it all to make sense. It's also my first time posting here so.. sorry ahead of time. 

I found out last night that my boyfriend of 1.5 years is thinking about proposing to me.  I am freaking out.


I have two main computers I use. My laptop, which goes with me most places (student) and is used for documents, internet, etc. Then I have my desktop computer, which is used for projects and bigger deals (I'm an artist of sorts). Mostly I use my laptop, and it hangs out in my dining room when I'm home. 


Last night though,  I was working on some photos, and clicked on facebook. I was going to send my boyfriend a message (hey, just thought of this... ), and typed in his name, clicked message, and saw there were messages there I had not seen. Then I realize - Oh shit, I'm logged into my brother's account. 


My brother had recently come to visit me, and asked me to set up his facebook with lists and security, random stuff (he is really horrible with computers). No problem, he gave me his password and I set everything up, and closed the browser. I guess it had the keep logged in thing on or something. Whatever, did not notice until I saw the messages.
I should have stopped right then and there, but I scrolled up real fast (not really even reading), and saw 3 images.


Oh my god, it's a ring. I just stared at my computer. Made the images bigger. Stared more. Noticed he said something about Christmas, and immediately lost my shit. Started crying, getting sick, shaking head to toe, the whole shebang. 


It took me about 20 minutes to calm myself down enough to call my brother. I told him the entire thing above, apologized profusely, and we started talking (brother is awesome beyond words and did not care). 


Apparently boyfriend has had this ring for a good 6 months, brother thinks it might have even been April. He's thinking about asking my parents for their blessing come Christmas (when we will be flying to see them). I HAVE to stop this before then. 


I've always held to the mindset that when people are dating, they should stay with eachother as long as it's still a ""maybe"" to their future. If it's a no, it's best to leave. It's a yes, plan for marriage (together). I'm at the maybe-probably yes stage. I only want to do this once. Filing for divorce is something I never want to even consider. I have talked to him about all of this in the past, and told him there were certain things that would need to be done before we'd be ready for marriage. Mostly, it's this: 

* Boyfriend still lives with his parents. That has to end. I've been out on my own since 18, but he has excuse after excuse. He keeps saying his credit sucks (in our city, this doesn't mean much really), that it's tough, etc.  What the hell is his plan with marriage?! Go live with his mom? Him move in with my roommate and I? He is a hard worker and smart, so I hope I'm not making him out to be a moocher - I'm just furious.

* He is beyond horrible with money. The kid makes more than I do (only by about 5k a year), and his only bills are car insurance, cell phone and gas. Kicker? He lives almost paycheck to paycheck. I don't understand what the hell he spends the money on, but he realistically could put half of his paycheck into savings. Then when he gets money in there, he blows it all on some toy. 

Then there's our careers and our future and how ridiculous it's going to be for us. There's the arguments that he doesn't understand me sometimes. There's this, there's that. I'm not going to write all that out. I just know that NOW is not right time. I'm so scared and mad that I can feel myself wanting to just get out of this all together, but I know that's just my emotions. Marriage COULD happen one day. But not now.

So, Christmas is fast approaching. I'm not about to let him do this and crush him publicly/in front of my family. I will NOT be saying yes, no matter where this happens. I need to talk to him before we leave. Hell, he might not even come with me after I do talk to him. He might not want to talk to me ever again. 

I will most likely HAVE to talk to him tomorrow (I can usually put on a happy face no matter what, but my body is so betraying me right now), so advice is beyond appreciated.

**TL;DR?: Semi-snoop, find pictures of ring, cry, puke, freak out, and now have to say no, before I'm even asked to say yes**

Sorry for the wall of text.  I've been talking to and dating this girl for about 3 months now.  Nothing physical has really happened as she shoots down any attempts by me under the guise of her being ""lady-like.""  That's cool with me, she is a sweet girl, and I genuinely enjoyed spending time with her.  Two weekends ago she went over to a guy's house and spent the night.  She told me about it, and I wasn't about to dismiss her plans.  She's allowed to do what she wants.  But the guy is, quite honestly, good looking and is set to be pretty successful.  So I couldn't quite shake the notion of nothing happening.  Since then she's become increasingly withdrawn.

Flash forward to the other night some friends, her, and myself all go out for a few drinks.  She ends up coming back to my place and spends the night cuddling - she's done this twice before.  Again, nothing physical happens.  Around 2 in the morning I'm wide awake and can't sleep, and for some reason I can't shake the notion of her and that guy.  I am a pretty trusting person, but I decided to get some sort of affirmation about what happened.  I looked through some texts on her phone and found out that she made out with this guy then blew him, told her friends she thinks she loves him, and eagerly awaits his texts.

This came to me entirely out of left field, and I was pretty distraught, but I asked for it by looking.  I composed myself walked over to the bed, and she was rustling around.  I asked if she was up and she said yeah.  I told her to get dressed because she was going home and that I didn't want to speak to her again.  She wanted to know why and quite frankly, I didn't even want to begin to have the conversation because I figured she would try and refocus the issue on me looking through her phone (I'm not vindicating my actions there).  I said I wasn't going to talk about why and I drove her home.  I suppose my question is, was I an asshole?  Did I handle this appropriately?  I've never had an issue with trust like this before.



tl;dr: after not believing the events of a night, looked through this girls phone and found texts indicating she lied to me about what she did that night (gave a blowjob, said she loves this guy, and eagerly awaits his texts).

Me and my boyfriend ""Roger"" have been together for 3 years, and everything has been going perfectly. He is The One. We've been living together for the past 18 months and have discussed marriage and kids, we are completely on the same page. 

Recently, since his 30th birthday, Roger has been going through a bit of a crisis about being old. I noticed that he was making comments about our respective ages, and how I was so young compared to him. I tried to appease him by saying that I wanted the same things he did. I think he thought I wasn't ready for lifelong commitment.

Our sex life used to be brilliant at the beginning, we'd both want it all the time and anywhere. But recently i'm the only person who's been initiating any sort of physical contact between us. I thought this was down to his birthday crisis and just thought that maybe I needed to give him a little time and we'd get back to normal.

And this is where my life turned shit. I was round my Mom's house whilst she was out and borrowed her computer to check my emails, and saw that she'd left her email account open. What I didn't expect to see was numerous emails from my boyfriend!! There were pornographic pictures of him, messages about what they'd done alreadt and what they were planning to do, etc. 
I could only bear to read a few of the emails, and didn't even bother checking the sent box before getting out of there!

This was a few days ago and i've not seen or spoken to my Mom since as she's visiting friends. I've been trying to act normal with my boyfriend but it feels like our whole relationship has been a lie. I don't want to make a rash decision and end up regretting it. I love this man, and cannot think of a life without him. I'm also scared that if I bring it up I will also lose my Mom who I thought I had a really good relationship with. But I hate thinking of what they've done and how they've both betrayed me. If I lose them both, I will have nothing left. I don't know where I will go or what I will do.

Our relationship was wonderful until my father died very unexpectedly about ~7 months ago. My family was and has been devastated. I (naturally) became depressed - and my boyfriend couldn't understand how this loss could affect my life so deeply. He has never lost anyone or anything.

I lost interest in things I used to love doing, and gained about 10 pounds. This seems normal after a family death for many people, but this was a very strange and confusing problem for my boyfriend.

He came clean last night and admitted that he isn't in love with me anymore, not like he was before my father's death. He fell for the happy, ambitious girl he met two years ago. I quickly decided to move back in with my mom for a week to give him time to think about whether or not he truly wants to be with me. I'm leaving this morning. We are truly on the brink of breaking up.

I'm absolutely heartbroken. I'm so in love with him, and I never in a million years thought my loss would make him lose feelings for me. I can be sad and hard to be with at times, but if he were in my position, I would have loved him even more - made sure he knew I'd always be there.

TL;DR: Missing my dad has changed me, and now my boyfriend isn't in love with me anymore because of it. I still love him and hope more than anything he will come to his senses.

1365578604.0,315,self.relationships,1c1tbt,A woman has emailed me claiming to be my father's mistress for the past 2 years. It appears credible. What do I do?,10042013,417,102,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c1tbt/a_woman_has_emailed_me_claiming_to_be_my_fathers/,"**What's happened**

Today I opened my Linked In account to find a message from a woman I've never met claiming to have been having a relationship with my 56-year old father for the past two years. Aspects of the email's content give me reason to believe that her claim may be true (i.e. she refers to details about my family a stranger wouldn't know).

The tone of her message is bitter (""I've had it basically. I've been taken on a bit of a ride I'd say."") She accuses my father of ""living a double life"" and declares ""I didn't want to do this but I think it should come out. He will feel better for it in the end, though of course I will lose a very close person to me as I doubt following this email I will ever hear from him again"". 

She requests that I confront my father and make clear to him that I have received credible information that he has been having an affair. Other than that, the purpose of her message appears to be to merely ""inform"" me about my father's ""double life"". *Importantly: she makes no specific threats in the message against me, my father or my family.*

**Background**

I am 26-years old, male. I am the eldest of my parents' two children. I have a 23-year old sister with whom I am very close. Ours is an upper-middle-class family. We live in a white-picket fence home and both my sister and I attended expensive private schools, for example. 

My parents have been married since they were 22 years old. They were high school sweethearts in the country town they grew up in and they have since forged a wonderful life together in the local big city of 4 million people. Their entire adult lives have been devoted to each other.

My father is a highly successful businessman; a workaholic who travels interstate very frequently (i.e. at least two, often three or four, nights a week). He has excelled at providing for my mother, my sister and me; I had a privileged upbringing.

My mother retired after 30 years as a schoolteacher about 5 years ago. Since then she has lived what many would describe as a life of leisure. That said, she is without a doubt the most loving human being I know. She is a truly ""good"" person and she is the beating heart of our family.

**Context**

The Woman's message is not exactly a bolt from the blue. My parents have been having marital problems for about the past 12 months. My father moved out of home in February-March this year (a ""trial"" separation) but recently moved back in to the suburban home he has shared with my mother for 18 years. It appears that my father's decision to move back home was the catalyst for the Woman's message to me (""I guess I'm just a little furious about his having moved back home"").

The trial separation period was an extremely difficult for my family. Essentially, my father claimed that my mother was ""impossible"" to live with and he also claimed that he found their suburban life ""boring"". The trial separation – he went to live in an apartment next door to his office – was his initiative. During the 8 week period, my mother was a wreck. She just wanted him to come home. My father appeared more or less indifferent to the pain his actions were causing my mother and us. He kept claiming that this ""apartment living lifestyle"" was something he needed to try.

It's important to realise that throughout their marital difficulties of the past 12 months, it has been put to my mother (by me, by their therapist) that my father may be having an affair. No doubt many of you who have read this far think it is so blindingly obvious that he was having an affair. It's not so obvious when it's your family, your life, your reality. Perhaps it's wilful blindness on my mother's part, but she has steadfastly said to me many times that she truly believes that my father has been and will always be faithful to her.

My father moved back to our family home about 2-3 weeks ago. The atmosphere has been tentatively ""happy"". We have all experienced a sense of relief (that he finally ""came to his senses"" and decided not to leave my mother) combined with caution (that his dissatisfaction with his life with my mother would flare up again and he would again flee to the apartment in the city). My personal relationship with him has been strained, mostly because I think he has behaved appallingly over the past 12 months. I feel that he has taught me more in the past 12 months about how *not* to be a good man than he has taught me in my entire life about how *to* be a good man.

**The crux**

I'm having trouble organising my thoughts in reaction to this. I feel I need direction as to the best path to take from here. 

Here is where I'm at so far:

* I have resolved to not respond to the Woman's message.
* I am confident that if I were to show the Woman's email to my mother, it would have such an effect on her as to be dangerous to her health.
* I fear for my father's mental stability if I were to be too ~~confronting~~ provocative in my next steps. He has shown signs of mental instability over the past 12 months and I cannot tell what his reaction would be. Honestly, I also fear for the Woman's well-being if I reveal to him that she has taken the action she has. I'm not saying that my father would be violent, but I recognise the gravity/offensiveness of what she's done (i.e. sending such an email to the son of your married lover) and I can only imagine the ferocity of my father's reaction.
* My sister adores my father; she historically idolises him. To bring her in on this would shatter that. I feel I need help bearing the load of the Woman's message (and my sister is the logical choice), but I want to protect her.

Basically, I feel too close to this. I'm confused about what my objectives here should be. I'm confused about whose welfare I should prioritise. Before I do anything, I want to hear reddit's thoughts on what I should do next. Perhaps there's something obvious to an outside that I'm not considering in all this?

I would really appreciate some direction.

Thank you for reading this far.

I got many replies encouraging me to be straight forward with her and tell her like it is and I did that. The essence of what I told her was that we aren't moving forward when we meet less than once per month and I hinted that I would be willing to back away if that would make things easier for her. Instead of suggesting a time to meet she went on the offensive and apologized for having a job. 

But I was hellbent on not letting her derail the conversation away from my point so I brought it back and said: ""That wasn't what I meant, I just feel that if you wanted this it would have already happened"". Then she played the martyr and did a pre-emptive break up:

""Go and find somebody wonderful that can spend more time with you than I can. You deserve somebody better than me &lt;3"" 

I knew exactly what this is, this is an attention seeker trying to keep me orbiting her planet but she will never give me permission to land. I lost all my interest in her and even if she starts texting again, even if she suggest that we should meet I'm done. I have no problem filling my days with activities so I'm not in need of her to have a life and I actually feel fantastic now.

Once I decided to let her go it felt like I sobered up after a six month hang-over. Sure it was nice walking around with the impression that I had a relationship on the way but that was just that, an impression. It wasn't real. 

I had a long talk with a friend about her and he came to the same conclusion, he said that she sounds like an attention seeker . That she is using me because I flatter her and that's the only reason she keeps me around. She only wanted to meet up after I withdrew, and she withdrew when I pushed for more. Instead of being with me she was sending me texts about how wonderful it would be to be with me. I don't know about anybody else but I want to live in the real world with real experiences, not sit around at home and think about how things could have been. Hope you are proud over me reddit, because I am. 

**EDIT** The response has been phenomenal, you people really made me feel great with all your support. I stand even stronger now and I have zero doubt that I made the right decision here. It's nice to see that reddit can provide this kind of maturity. 

**TL,DR** I perused a relationship with a girl for more than six months but she only wanted dates every other month and she was always apologetic because she wasn't meeting me more often. I decided to put my foot down and it resulted in breaking contact with her.

After reading a lot of the comments I'd mostly just decided that it was best not to push anything, and to  let her open up to me on her own time and when she wants to. 

She's really amazing with children and she's really fond of my younger sister (which is good, because I guess my sister doesn't really have any amazing female role models in her life right now). The day before yesterday, my girlfriend, my sister and I are all eating lunch at some place when a man started raising his voice at something in the street, and she looked like she was getting a little anxious. This happens a few times a day now and when it does I sort of just hold her hand, let her know it's okay and try to distract her. 

But then my little sister spoke up. She pretty much straight out asked why my girlfriend always seems so scared around men. All she said was, ""A little while ago now, I was hurt very badly by a man. Sometimes they can scare me now, but I'm trying to be brave and not be scared anymore.""

My sister: ""Are you scared of [me]?""

My girlfriend: ""Not at all. I trust him very much.""

I know this isn't much of an update, but I'd gotten quite a few messages asking for one, so... here it is.

I had been on the verge of tears all day, and he just went about his life like everything is fine. We broke up. He knows what he did was inappropriate, but he hasn't changed his story at all. Not that it matters anymore. Due to some financial decisions we made together, we will still be living in the same house.  At least for a few months. The conversation we had was surprisingly simple. We are both being mature and level  headed about this which is all I ask.


My boyfriend 23m and myself 22f have been in a relationship for just over two years. We have known each other since sophomore year of high school, so we are pretty close. We have also lived together the majority of the time we have been together. I have always known that he has a lot of female friends, which isn't the problem. The problem is that he is kinda tour nsecure, and he will flirt with these girls to get any kind of response from them. We have talked about this, and he knows that it upsets me when he does this. 


Fast forward to last night: I come home from work at about 11:20pm. I notice that the bed is made (which it NEVER is) and that there are womens shoes beside my bed. I walk in the other room, toward the bathroom, and my bf comes out of the bathroom, shuts the door, and is trying to get me to go back in the other other room. I notice his heart is beating super hard and he is trying to get me away from the bathroom. So naturally, I see what he is trying to hide from me, and I find a 19 year old girl hiding in my shower, with her bra and shirt off. To put things lightly, I flip shit. I turned the shower on cold and shut the door. 


When I calm down enough to think, my boyfriend said she was just over playing video games (which the game was paused when I came home, and he showed me the time of the last save file 11:18pm). I asked why her shirt was off and she said he gave her a back rub, and she went into the bathroom to adjust her bra. This particular girl is supposedly bisexual with a girlfriend. I do know that they have been friends for 4 years, and that he has fingered her shortly before we got together. I don't think much else has happened between them, because every time they do talk now, they talk about computers and video games. I had personally never met the girl before this, and my bf said that he brought her over so I could meet her. He knew what time I got off work, but I was done about 15 minutes early, so he said he didn't plan out how to introduce us, and he was scared that I would flip out, so he went in there to tell her I was home. 


I don't really know what to believe. I'm confident that they didn't have sex (our condoms are in the same spot, and there's none missing). But I don't really know what to make of the situation. Should I break up with him? I don't really see myself trusting him again anytime soon. I want to, but it seems like every time I give him my full trust, he fucks it up somehow...  I do love him a lot, and don't want to break up. I need advice. Please.

I packed up all of his clothes and the rest of the stuff he had here, and waited til my boyfriend got off of work. When he got here, I called Kevin and told him to come get his stuff, that he couldn't stay here anymore, then hung up. He started texting me. This is pretty much the conversation:

Kevin: Wtf, you know I don't have anywhere to stay tonight, what the fuck am I supposed to do now?

Me: I don't know, maybe get a decent job and keep it so you actually have somewhere to stay instead of couch-surfing.

Kevin: Wtf is that supposed to mean? I didn't think you gave a shit how long I stayed, you have a spare bedroom, it's not like it matters.

Me: Yes, I have a spare bedroom. I, meaning mine. The spare bedroom in my house, that I went to college, and got a decent job, and saved up money to afford buying. I didn't buy it so my ""friends"" could crash in it, and live here rent-free. 

Kevin: Fine, be like that. That's a really fucked up and bitchy thing to do. I'll have my shit in a few hours, I'm busy right now.

Sooo.... it ends up being around 1AM, and still haven't heard from him, and my boyfriend is getting pissed. Boyfriend calls him up and says, ""Look, you have fifteen minutes to get here and get your stuff or it's going out by the road."" 

Get another text from Kevin, calling my boyfriend a douche and that I do whatever my boyfriend says, and then- ""That's why you're kicking me out, you don't give a shit, you're doing it because Josh told you to."" Obviously that isn't true, my boyfriend doesn't care who stays at my house, and he's never been mean or anything to Kevin. 

I don't text him back, and about 20 minutes later, Kevin and two of his friends show up. They all get out of the car and start to come in, and my boyfriend just blocked the doorway and tells them that they're not coming in, and that his stuff is already packed up. Kevin comes in, grabs his laundry basket of clothes, and starts handing off his stuff to the guys from the doorway. 

Before Kevin leaves, he turns around to me and is like, ""This is really fucking bullshit, I thought we were friends."" I just said, ""So did I,"" and shut the door.

He hasn't tried to text me or call me anymore, but his mom did. She was nice, and just asked if I had some time in the next few weeks, if I could meet her at my storage unit to get the rest of her things. I have no problem with his mom, and I'm certainly not going to keep her away from her furniture, but I have no plans at all to talk to Kevin.

First, I want to thank everyone for the wonderful advice you gave me. I sat down and talked to him, told him I was concerned with where his life was headed. I talked to him about getting into the military, and he seemed fairly open about the idea. But I told him first that he needs to get all of his criminal charges taken care of, before we can fix anything. He agreed. 

Over the last couple of weeks, I've let him come over and cook food for himself at my house, and gave him a warm place to sit during the day when he didn't have anywhere to go. This last week, I had only seen him once, and only for about five minutes. He said he had been working temp jobs. I was proud of him. But I still encouraged him to take the right steps in getting his warrants and other criminal things taken care of.

Today I got a text message from him telling me that he is turning himself in at the jail today, and will be in there for up to a year or so. He told me to come sign a property release form and get some of his stuff, as well as some money for food. He told me he was really sorry he didn't come have coffee with me at all this week, but he worked all the temp jobs he did so that he could give me money for food because he knows I'm having trouble taking care of myself right now. 

I am glad that he is taking the right steps, and once he serves his time, he will have his warrants taken care of and can move on to getting his life on the right track. But I has an extreme sad today.

I'm not just saying that. i love her so much and she and our family are the only things that matter to me. 

Yesterday afternoon, I got a call from an old college friend asking if I wanted to meet up and spend some time because he was driving through our city. I asked my wife and she agreed to let me have the night to myself. We went to a bar and had a couple drinks and talked. He started talking to some girl who was at the bar and that girl and her friend joined us. Friend was making moves on his girl and I was just politely talking to the girl's friend. To get to the point, the other girl started to flirt with me. I went with it. We kissed for maybe a minute... long enough that its bad, but not long enough to make out. 

I immediately snapped out of the haze I was in and I regretted the kiss that moment. I talked to the girl for maybe another ten minutes, but ditched my friend and just sat in my car alone. I did get the girl's number earlier, but I deleted it. I was lost yesterday night and I'm still lost now. I feel like complete garbage. What I did was awful, and I hate myself for it. 

I've always had a zero tolerance policy towards cheaters and I can't believe I cheated. But I did, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my wife and I feel like a coward for feeling this way. She trusted me and I let her down. I betrayed her and acted like a complete asshole. I know I'll never put myself in this sort of position again. At the same time, I've always thought if you cheat, you should confess. So its a struggle there... I don't want to be a coward along with a traitor. I just am so, so lost. If anyone has been through anything like this ever before, I would love to hear from you. Any advice or calling me an asshole is appreciated. I just need to talk this out. 

tl;dr I betrayed my lovely wife by kissing another woman last night. ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_1dk9d2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dk9d2/i_30m_made_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life_i_dont/,

We've been dating for almost 2 years.  We get along great, except when we play board games.  Whenever she's losing or perceives that she's losing, she immediately gets into a bad mood, acting bored or dismissive or angry or flustered, saying things like, ""I don't care."" or ""This game is broken.""  The thing is, she does care, but she acts that way to try to deflect blame or inexperience.  She doesn't like saying ""good game"" or congratulating the other player when she loses.  She feels that saying ""good game"" when you win is acting smug, and saying it when you lose is disingenuous.

It's gotten to the point where it very unpleasant for me to play games with her, because while she is competitive, I don't feel like I can be competitive with her, because she'll get upset if I win.  It pretty much sucks all the joy out of playing games with her and games are a pretty big factor in my life (without getting into details).

Additionally, it's a major sticking point with me because I see that behaviour carry over to other tasks and events in real life where she'll become easily flustered and be in a bad mood.  

I've talked to her about it, and she says that she just says it and keeps on playing it, but I tell her that when she says that, it's no longer fun because of the negative attitude.   

For me, playing the game and enjoying it is paramount to winning the game.  Winning the game is enjoyable, but if that's the only thing that matters, then people are losing sight of what else games have to offer.

I care about her deeply, but I'm not sure if I can deal with this every time we play games/do something together.

I guess I'm asking if people have perspectives to help me understand her POV, or ways to explain my perspective better to her, or ways of coping with the negativity.

**Original TL;DR:** I (college sophomore, 17F) had a one night stand with an acquaintance from class and got pregnant. I'm not sure if I should contact him to let him know or just handle it myself. I'm also hesitant about telling my parents.


[Update #1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jgjal/update_i_17f_need_advice_on_what_to_do_after_a/)

**Update #1 TL;DR:** I talked with the father and let him know that I’m pregnant. He’s being super supportive and we are waiting to talk to doctors to make an informed decision about what to do.


[Update #2]( http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jkti2/update_2_i_17f_need_advice_on_what_to_do_after_a/)

**Update #2 TL;DR:** 1) Confirmed age of consent laws and learned that maximum punishment is $10,000 and 9 months in jail. 2) Went to a bunch of appointments, found out I’m having twins. 3) Decided I want to keep the babies and put them up for adoption. 4) Things are going well with the baby daddy but I’m confused about my feelings for him, his feelings towards me, and what to do.



**Clarifications to FAQ in previous posts:**

I just wanted to start with a few clarifications to some questions I kept getting.  This is pretty much a summary of responses that I've already given but I think they got buried in the comments so no one saw them. 

There were multiple questions on my age and how I’m in college.  I’m 17 and will turn 18 at the end of the month (prior to officially starting my sophomore year of college).  Besides my summer birthday I also skipped 4th grade. 

There were also a number of people questioning how I knew I was pregnant so fast.  We had sex June 29th. I should have gotten my period around July 11th but wasn’t really tracking/was in denial until almost the end of July when I finally took a pregnancy test. As of today I am about 8 weeks pregnant (they count from the first day of your last period, not when you actually had sex). 

Next I just wanted to address the differences between adoption and foster care.  The babies will be adopted and brought into a permanent home soon after birth. Adoption is nothing like the stereotypical foster care home.  I know kids who grow up in foster care and I am aware how bad the system is (or can be in some cases; I’m not saying it is all bad).  There are thousands of couples looking to adopt healthy babies.  There are a lot less people looking to adopt older children.  Putting the babies up for adoption now would give them a loving family as soon as they are born.  They would have new parents from day one and would not be tossed around from home to home (and adoptive parents do not get money from the state for raising the kids; that’s only foster parents).  

Finally I would like to attempt to answer some of the morality questions that have been brought up. Ultimately I know it doesn’t matter what some stranger on the internet thinks of me but I would just like to try to explain my rationale for doing the things I have done.  As I’ve said before, I grew up in a very religious home.  I went to parochial school and lived a very sheltered life.  Going to college was a huge eye opener for me.  For the first time ever I realized that people can be successful and good without God and religion.  My views on many issues changed.  I realized that line between good and bad is not so obvious (and might not be where I thought it was). I still tried to be a good person but I worried less about what my parents taught me and more about what I thought was the right thing.  No one else around me viewed sex as immoral.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized that (as long as it’s consensual) it is not bad; it is a way to show affection.  It wasn’t until the party that I even had an opportunity to consider having sex myself. I seized the opportunity for a multitude of reasons, most of which were foolish.  First off, I wanted to fit in.  I wanted to be able to talk to other college girls and not feel like some dumb baby.  Secondly, I was curious.  After hearing so many other girls talk about it I wanted to experience it for myself.  Finally, I did it because I wanted him to like me.  As I said, these were all foolish reasons.  I should never have worried so much about what others thought and should have instead waited and done what was right for me.  I believe in the right circumstances sex is good and binds two people together in love.  But in my case it was a mistake.  I was too young, too naïve, not ready, and didn’t know the guy well enough.  In summary, I’m not sure what my stance is on the morality of premarital sex.  I was taught it was wrong but I’ve seen that in some cases it is good.  In my case, I think it was a mistake.  As far as my willingness to have premarital sex and unwillingness to get an abortion, those are two separate issues.  I’ve already discussed my views on abortion but would just like to use a comment that /u/ktrex made: “I don’t want to smoke weed, but I think it should be legal.”  For me personally, abortion is not an option; I would not be able to live with the guilt.  However, I understand and don’t judge girls that do get one.  I know this doesn’t fully answer all the religion/morality questions but it’s the best explanation I can give. 



**Update #3**

Things are going really well with the father.  We are taking things slow and are not going to attempt any sort of physical/romantic relationship while I’m pregnant.  Despite this we still have been spending a lot of time together and are really close.  He told his parents about the situation.  They were super understanding and invited me to dinner so they could meet me.  Meeting them was a little awkward at first but they were super nice and I’m looking forward to getting to know them more. 


Yesterday I told my dad that I’m pregnant.  He had come to move me out of my summer dorm and take me home for the rest of the summer so it was just the two of us.  He was really calm when I told him (which scared me more than him just yelling at me) but after talking seemed more concerned about my safety/health/future than upset.  When we got home I told my mom.  She did not handle it so well.  She’s acting as if I did this on purpose just to spite her.  She won’t talk to me and leaves the room whenever I try to approach her.  My dad said he’ll try talking with her but that she probably just needs space/time.  So far no one has questioned me about how it happened or the father’s identity and I don’t plan on letting them know until everything has calmed down.  


**Update #3 TL;DR:**  Things are going well with the father but we decided not to become physically/romantically involved.  I told my parents that I’m pregnant and am waiting for them to calm down so I can talk to them more.

I was just about to post something in relationship advice that asked how I could get my girlfriend to forgive me for saying something so rude and insensitive and she told me she already made a thread. I don't know what I was thinking when she asked me that. Like I am probably the most tactless person on earth (if she confirms it she can tell you that) and I guess I thought that I could be open when really I should have just shut up. I instantly regretted it after i said it. It was a horrible thing to say and I make big mistakes like these once a month at least (at the beginning of the relationship it was like every other day). She has been patient with me from the start (it's my first relationship) and I know that I have hurt her feelings many times because of my insensitivity. If you downvote me I deserve it, every day I wonder why such an amazing person is still with me.

So, I did and they had two beautiful kids. The boy was born when I was on spring break and they sent me plenty of pictures. I felt good. Not weird at all. I gave them a beautiful baby. When I eventually met him in person, he was really attached to them and not that into strangers. He didn't feel like mine.

But then they used the rest a little later and had the girl. I was older than and living in town when she was born. She was all tiny and I held her.  I saw the kids more frequently after that.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jzc13/my_m25_mothers_funeral_is_monday_and_i_refuse_to/

My mother died last week.  She was the most abusive, manipulative, and most loving mother all at the same time.  When I was six my mother started taking me on her trips to a Baja California, Mexico to get pills/drugs that she was addicted to.   She would leave me with a mexican family while she went with her boyfriend to get the drugs.  She would be gone for weeks.  I didn't speak spanish, didn't know them, and they mistreated me.

After I refused to stay at that house anymore she instead took me to a mental institution there in Baja.  She would pay for me to stay there and pick me up later.  I would spend most of my time there sedated.  They just drug you, and feed you, and you either stay in your tiny room or you walk around a small yard, a rec area, and a library with other presumably crazy people who were all older than I was. 

By the time I was eleven I wouldn't even get in the car with her anymore so she drugged me at home and drove me downthere anyway.  I was at home in the U.S. and next thing I know I'm in Mexico being carried out of the car, totally out of it.  She would come for me after about three months.  My longest stay was nine months cause she was late picking me up and didn't have enough money to pay for my stay as she was signing me out so I had to go back in.   She came back six months after that with enough money to get me.

To this day I still wake up sometimes not knowing where I am.   I'll reach back to touch the head board on my bed cause I momentarily don't know if I'm still at that place.  As soon as I feel the smooth wooden head board it's relief beyond belief that I didn't reach back and touch the thin metal bars from my head board at the mental institution.

I remember twice being drugged and taken to that place but I don't know how many times that happened.  My older siblings were told that I had stayed behind in Mexico by choice because I wanted to live there.  To this day they still ask me why I would want to leave my family to stay in Mexico when I was little.  That was just tip of the iceberg of the cruel things she did to me.  She wasn't even close to a good mother to my siblings either, but I'm the only one from a different dad.  So that's my guess as to why I got the worst of it.  She always claimed she hit me more and did other things cause I was more rebellious.

But she knew that wasn't true.  My siblings know to this day that wasn't true.  I was the only one of my brothers and sisters who actually liked school, got good grades, and graduated high school with my class.  I often brought home award certificates for good behavior.  They were problematic at school, always ditching, horrible grades, etc...

A few years ago while she was hospitalized, I asked her why she'd taken me to a mental institution.  She said I was too little to leave behind at home and that the neighbors would've called CPS on her.  She would refuse to talk about it beyond that, and complain about pain, and call a nurse to bring her pain medication.  She would just shut down after that.

My siblings are appalled that I refused to attend our great mother's funeral.  My girlfriend sided with them.  I think they all know enough about the abuse that took place to understand me.  But they still pushed me.  My GF said it was a deal breaker for her if I didn't attend.

I didn't attend, and I think they're already getting over it.  My girlfriend didn't talk to me for a couple of days so I moved out.  I left her a note and broke up with her while she was at work yesterday.  She's been calling me and texting me non stop since last night.  I feel too far gone from her.  I'm moving on with my life.  I will talk to her, and break it off in person, I just don't know when.  I'm gonna get counseling and just try to fix myself so that someday I can have a healthy family.

I'm a little concerned about the kind of parents my siblings have become.  But I refuse to continue the cycle of abuse.  It has to stop with me or my mother wins.

**Edit**  My girlfriend and siblings don't know all the details of the abuse, only that there was a lot of it, and tons of manipulation.  They know about specific incidents, but not the worst of it.  Still, I think they knew enough to respect my decision.  I would definitely respect their decision if the roles were reversed.  She knew enough but she was of the mindset that it would help me heal and get closure if I went. I don't agree with that mentality. In the end, I don't think I belong in a long term relationship until I get some counseling to help be better.  I really think I'm a little crazy.  That's the one thing my mother was right about.


**Edit2  I now have almost 200 missed calls from my ex-girlfriend along with over 40 texts.  I don't have the energy or will to engage in a discussion with her.  I feel like I've been gone for weeks and it's only been hours.  I have moved on, but I do feel a little bad for her.  I know I've mishandled all of this but I still feel emotionally too far away from her.**

[Crosspost from /r/offmychest],craigersmith,403,102,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/179bsy/my_wife_25f_is_cheating_on_me_27f_without/,"**FINAL UPDATE:** [What happened next!](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17bj7d/update_my_wife_25f_is_cheating_on_me_27m_without/)

Sorry, this is long, but there is a lot of information.

My wife and I have been each other's closest (and often, only) friend for the longest time. Both of us are very shy and have a hard time making friends.

Recently, she made a friend at her job, who is a guy. She's had guy work friends before and it never really bothered me. But this one is different.

First, she started texting him a lot (A LOT) out of nowhere and I didn't know about it until I discovered she went over our texting limit, which she never ever got close to before. She hid it from me for fear of me getting jealous.

She is adamant about him just being a friend, and one that she needs. She goes to lunch with him and goes to get coffee. Once a week or so, they talk on the phone for a couple hours. They've also been sending pictures of themselves to each other (not racey ones or anything, just normal stuff).

They often text each other all day long (literally), even to the point that they have to say goodnight to each other.

Now, for the most part, she has been open about it all. Every now and then, I'll discover something she didn't tell me or catch her in a small lie (that she said she was doing to protect my feelings). But, still, for the most part, she isn't hiding it.

I'm fairly positive they aren't spending more time together than I think because there isn't any missing time in her schedule that I've seen. No time unexplained.

But I still feel like she is having an emotional affair. I've told her (in no uncertain terms) that this makes me uncomfortable, that I really don't like her having this level of friendship with another man. But, I also know that it's wrong for me to tell her she CAN'T have this friendship.

The problem is, he is also married, and their marriage is going through tough times. And HIS wife has told him not to text my wife anymore. So, they've started ""texting"" through Hanging With Friends, so she won't know. Which I think is disrespectful and wrong.

People at her work have been speculating that they are having an affair, to the point it spread to the whole store.

I've asked my wife, in one of the many fights/discussions we've had about this, if she would tell her mom what she was doing? She said no. I asked if she thought what she was doing against my wishes and his wife's wishes was okay? She said no.

But this is not enough to get her to stop. I'm not even asking her to drop him as a friend, just to treat him like a normal friend from work, no platonic dates or long chats or all day text marathons.

She has even told me that if the situation was reversed, she would hate it if I had a girl friend like this, but still, this is not enough for her to stop.

I cannot talk to anyone about it, because every friend or family member of mine is also close with her and I wouldn't want anyone thinking less of her or knowing we're having this issue.

So, I have to suffer in silence. I don't know what I should do. I'm trying to respect her and not be overbearing, but this whole thing just feels like it has gone way too far and I feel I am justified in hating this.

It feels good just to write this all out. Sorry I rambled and jumped around a bit. Just so much information.

Anyway, what do you think? Am I just being too sensitive/paranoid? Or am I right in being upset?

**TL;DR** My wife has a guy friend that she spends way too much time with and energy on, to the point that everyone at their work think they are having an affair. I've been clear that I am uncomfortable with this, but don't want to be controlling, so I let my feelings be known, but stop short of ""putting my foot down."" My wife hasn't backed off even a little bit, but she has been mostly open about everything (not really hiding it from me). Should I be worried? And if so, what should I do? I will not be leaving her and she knows that, so that threat is not an option.

**UPDATE 1 (1/25 2:22pm MST)** Thank you all so much for your comments and advice. It has all been very eye opening and helpful. I realize now that I am in denial and that, whether she realizes it or not, this is a problem that needs fixing. I left her a letter at home explaining my feelings and packed a small bag. I'm spending the night in the hotel and have asked to meet with her tomorrow to talk this thing out. I don't know if this is the right step to take first, but I feel like I need to wake her up to the fact that I am not going to be okay with this. I'm sure she'll try and call/find me tonight. Don't know if I'll answer when she does. Not sure what is going to happen, but whatever is going to happen, it happens now. I'll post a proper update soon. **(Also, sorry for the confusion about the gender thing. I didn't even realize I listed myself as a female until someone directly asked me if I was a lesbian. That explains a few other slightly puzzling responses too. Haha.

I want to thank all of you guys for my previous post, for all of the encouragement and advice.

I've read and reread all of the comments, even the downvoted ones. 


**TL;DR:** Went full out CSI interrogation and convinced Kop to stop harassing me.



I just got the news about my family's booting today, and when I arrived at practice my coach pulled me and my sis aside to say that we were formally removed from the team. It wasn't caused by my problems with Kop.

My mother, along with me and my little sister, waited for practice to be over so that she could talk to the board about why we were out (turns out to be the chair wasn't happy my little sister was trying to bring back a coach who was well trusted, but fired because the board was receiving complaints of harsh training methods by parents. In my opinion, I see the parents' comments ridiculous, because he was a great coach who pushed his swimmers far enough to improve at a great rate, but not enough to exhaust them).

After two Starbucks visits to kill time, the practice ended and I went inside to talk to Kop. The memory is still fresh, so I can recall most of the conversation:

Me: Hey, did you hear?

Kop: Yep... What are we going to do? 

M: I want to talk to you about that. I don't think there will be any ""we"" in the future.


*Initiate nervous signs from Kop*


M: How many times have I told you I wasn't interested?

K: *mumbles something I couldn't catch*

M: How many times have I said your ideas and plans for a relationship for us doesn't satisfy both sides?

K: *silence*

M: How can you still expect a future for us if I have clearly stated, in person and text, that this will not go well and said I am not interested. That these plans are only good to you. That you are ignoring my needs. That you are still pushing me even when you know that I will not be shoved by you just to date.

*still silence*

M: Why do you never try to talk to me in person? Everything is texted or chatted or messaged. 

K: You should know that answer, you idiot. We never get to hang out or talk outside of practice. 

M: Why did you call me an idiot just now? 

K: *sputter cough mumbles of shock*

K: I would never insult you!

&gt; These ideas of dating aren't different then what you said before. Did you really change them? 

&gt; I did! I changed them a little to serve your highness.

&gt; I don't see any big changes at all. How about we would spend time together for only an hour a day so that we still have time for school work?

&gt; Why should we care about school? It's stupid and just takes time away from us to be together.

&gt; I have priorities you know

&gt; You and your stupid ass priorities list needs to change 


M: Do you know what you did?


K: Yeah...


M: So you know what you are texting me, and you understand my texts too?


K:...yes.


M: So you have seen and heard , multiple times, that I said I wasn't interested?


K: yep


M: Why do you still try to chase me then?


K: *silenece* 


M: You have no reason?


K: *nod*


M: You have no reason to chase me around, you have seen that I am not interested, and you deny things you have done. Tell me why I should be dating you.


K: Because you know you're going to regret wasting a chance like me.


M: That's a threat, not a reason. That isn't true anyway.

He just repeated his texts that tried to pressure me, and I tossed his ideas away like he did to me.

I don't remember anything else after that, but I know that I told him to back off, and I wouldn't be seeing him anymore. I had all of these reasons to tell Kop to stop texting me, and I think it worked. Hugged him for the last time and left

Well, I have been blowing up his phone and he accidentally hit accept instead of ignore and I could hear him talking then her, then silence for solid minute, then she started moaning...and yeah...I heard everything. She started moaning his name then I heard her say she's coming...then the big finale and then him gasp and say that was the best sex he had ever had in his life. I'm still listening to them right now... I also kind of want to crawl into a hole and never come out.
He and I live together so I have to see him again (it's my house and I can't move out). We also just had sex yesterday before he left town. 

What the hell am I supposed to do now??

TL;DR - I called my sort of ex boyfriend while he was on a trip out of town and heard him having sex with another woman.

EDIT: Thank you for all the support, everyone. It really does help to know there are so many kind strangers out there who are willing to listen and empathize. I have talked to some of my girlfriends and we are going to either move his crap into my garage or into a storage locker and change my locks before he gets back on Tuesday. This may get me in some legal trouble if he decides to fight it, but I don't give a shit at this point.

My SO and I have been together 5 and half years with 2 kids (3 and 4). On January 10th I will be filing income tax. This is D-Day. 

We are getting roughly 8000 back. We are low income. We only had one income this year... Mine. I worked all year and he has been unemployed for over a year. In this year he has sat around the house and smoked weed all day. 

This 8000 will be spent on roughly 1 acre of wooded land if the decision is up to him. Not a place to live on that land, just the land itself. I don't agree with this but if we are together it is his way or no way. 

My other option is to run. Take the 8000 and create a new life for me and my boys. More than enough money to get us settled in. Here are my issues:

-everything will have to be kept hidden. If it is found out that I am filing by myself it will not turn out pleasant. He has one hell of a temper. 

-if I file on the 10th by myself he will then know what is going on. Which means I need to be out of here by then. I have nowhere to go. I have no money until that check hits. What do I do until then? 

Please help me. I am so lost. I have never been on my own before and I am so scared of it and of leaving him.

I [16M] broke up with my girlfriend [17F] a few weeks ago. We are in High School, and the relationship was only around half a year, but that's not the root of the problem.

I've been questioning my sexuality for a while now, and I decided that I didn't want to let this relationship go too far should I determine that I'm gay. So, a few weeks ago, I broke up with her for that reason. She seemed relatively cool at that moment, but the next day I recieved multiple angry messages from her friends saying that I raped her. Apparently, she didn't take this breakup well. We have never had sex, and only really got to 2nd base a few times (she's a Religious Christian).

I was completely surprised by this. I thought she would accept my reason (which I believe was perfectly valid) and move on. Around half of my friends stopped talking to me, and many people at school couldn't even look me in the eyes.

This puts me in a tough spot. I don't really want to reveal my sexuality to the public for a variety of reasons, but I can't let this stand. This rumor she's spreading could have a major impact on my life. I have absolutely no idea what to do. Any ideas, Reddit?

**tl;dr I broke up with my gf because I may be gay, she tells the whole world I raped her. I don't want to reveal my sexuality to the public, but this is escalating quickly.**

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your various perspectives and advice. I read every single comment and really took what you all had to say to heart. Last night my fiance and I had a great talk after laying our son down for bed. He is also a redditor (hello honey), and I showed him this thread in hopes that we would have some points to talk about. My fiance admitted to me that he has a voyeurism/exhibitionism kink, and that he was both too ashamed and embarrassed to tell me. He told me that he was only using camming to explore this feeling as well as for the ""thrill"", and that he was in no way trying to replace or hurt me. I understand this now, and I wholeheartedly believe him. During our talk, I reassured him that, while what he did was wrong, the sneakiness and lies hurt more than anything. I also told him that I am not totally against him camming...as long as we do it together as a couple! Yeah, last night was a good night ;) We stayed up late talking about all aspects of our relationship, we took a bath together, we had sex twice (and once on cam! lol), and then we snuggled to sleep in bed. So once again, I thank you all for your support. While my trust in him isn't completely at 100%, I forgive him for what he did. I can't wait to further explore this kink (as well as possible others) as a couple because hey, I'm up for new things, and if it makes him happy, I am happy.

We were both arguing and she all the sudden back-hands the hell out of my nose, slams on the brakes and starts yelling even louder. I was crying bc I couldn't believe she did that and I was scared, too. A week later when I asked her why she hit my nose, she said ""well, I meant to hit your mouth.""  That doesn't solve anything. 

Then it comes to my attention, which I was blind to see, that the past 3 months she showed no affection toward me. She said she didn't show love bc I never showed it, just when I wanted sex. 

Now, I'm her second partner and she's my first. She's the first woman I had sex with and I know that's influencing my decisions, but should I stay with her or go?  She says shes lost interest and only loves me as a person, not as a husband.  We've been married 10 months and don't actually own anything together. 

I'm bipolar, so that doesn't help the decision situation at all. One day I'm set on divorce, then the next I'm begging for her to come back from her moms. 

I Know spousal abuse is the same whether the suspect is male or female, but is it right for me to ignore that she hit me? 

Also, she's a cop, but I didn't want to call the police bc she has worked her to get where she is. Thanks so much for reading and replying. 

TL;DR: Wife back-handed the hell out of me. Should I leave?

EDIT: I'm taking everything from reddit, friends, co-workers, etc. and I think the best move is to just get divorced. I was set on growing old with her, but that's not gonna happen.

EDIT 2: I talked to her on the phone for a while and she didn't understand why it worried me that she struck me. I almost put the phone down. So, it's no question in my mind that I'm leaving her for SURE.  I'm going to try to read everyone's comments, but just know that I'm VERY grateful for the love/care/support you all have shown to someone you don't even know. Thank you!

so they're going to stay in a hotel, they refused to let me pay, and told me to calm the fuck down. i think my brain has been haywire b/c the thought of them in a cage for days on end made me unable to think straight, not to mention the fact that my husband returns from his one year deployment today - i'll see him in a freaking HOUR - hoooray for me!

He just smoked way too much pot and was too lazy, and I needed someone that could keep up with me. Now I find out that not only was he filming me naked, he's been sending pictures from the video to his friends.

Together for 3 years.,throwawayissue1,396,106,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hmzt0/my25m_gf25f_has_become_obsessed_with_interracial/,"I've(25/m) been with my gf(25/f) for three years now. Our sex life had slowed down over the last year, and a few months ago we made an effort to revive it.

We took the mojo upgrade test and had a great time exploring some things we were both into, but had been uncomfortable discussing. This led us to make an effort to be completely open with our sexual desires, kinks, and fantasies. Our sex life improved dramatically. We started to explore really crazy stuff in the bedroom and we were happier and hornier than ever.

Over the last few weeks though, it's taken a turn that makes me uncomfortable.

One of the things we’ve been doing is talking about our fantasies while we fuck. As I talk about mine, she would push me for more details, and vice versa. Really hot stuff to be that open and free.

Lately she’s started talking about how much interracial sex (specifically black men with white women- we're both white btw) turns her on. It started out pretty normal, and I didn’t have any issue with it, but it’s morphed into something strange.

She'll say stuff about how she wants to be defiled or made impure by a black man. She's also said something really weird about how white women and black men share a special sexual bond and she's dying to feel this bond, how she wants to be bred and degraded by black men. I feel weird typing this out.

I have no problem with interracial sex, but the way she’s talking about it comes across as really racist and I don’t know what to do. I honestly believe nothing’s wrong with people of different races getting together. I also think it’s totally fine for people to be attracted to features that might be particular to one race or another. But the whole thing about “a white woman changes forever once shes’s sexually bonded with a black man” (something else she’s said) bothers me because it’s dehumanizing and in my mind, pretty racist.

I worry that she might be prejudiced (which I had never picked up at all), or that her views on race are unhealthy.  I also worry that she’ll be offended if I tell her how much this makes me uncomfortable. We’ve been brutally open and honest about every kink, and I’m worried about what will happen if I’m the first one to say “this is too far.”

But indulging in these fantasies makes me personally uncomfortable, and it makes me worry about what else is going on in her head.

More?). He and his ex were together for 7 years on and off. They'd break up once a year for weeks at a time. Nearly 4 years ago, she cheated on him, got pregnant, and married the guy before she even moved out.  Classy. She and I were friends but I cut her out completely after all that.  They were renting a house I own so I actually had to evict her since she stopped paying rent. 

Most of his friends took her side. She was the partier, and loved to drink/do hard drugs/etc. Fine, she can have them.  However, some of our more chill friends are still in denial. They will say things like ""I can't think of you guys being with anyone else!"" Even her mother said they need to get back together. I'd be upset too if my daughter picked a jobless coke head over the awesome person my husband is. It was annoying at the most. 

That is... Until yesterday. We got a wedding invite in the mail from a couple who not only attended the exes wedding, but ours as well. It was addressed to my bf and his ex... Uhhhhh. We thought it was just a weird oversight because wedding planning can get nuts.  I emailed the couple saying, ""You addressed our invite to Claire instead of me... Haha!"" Well, they assured me it was NOT a mistake.  They meant to invite Claire and Dave (my husband) as a couple because they knew them as a couple for many years. Wtf? We have all hung out together many times since Dave and I have been together. Not to mention that I was also friends with them long before that. I explained how totally mind blowing that was and asked if Claire knew this and how her husband felt and according to this couple they are ""cool with it"".  I didn't even respond.  There is no indication that they don't like me and we all got along really well.

Needless to say, my husband is pissed. He wants to call them up and yell but I figure It's best to RSVP no and leave it alone, and silently walk away from these people.  He also wants to address it with his ex, which is totally on him, but I don't think it will do anything but create more problems. What would you do here?

If I lived closer to them now, like I used to, wild wolves wouldn't be able to keep me from attending his funeral! I however, live 1300 miles away (the distance has never seemed so great) and flights are expensive. 

Have you ever missed a funeral and greatly regretted it? Would you attend if you found yourself in a similar situation to mine? Would you send flowers? Being as young as I am I haven't encountered tragedy like this before and I'm just not sure how to help or react.

tl;dr: My best friend from my home town found out her boyfriend died yesterday. I'm not sure if I can make it to the funeral since I moved last year and am now 1300 miles away from them. Looking for perspective and advice.

EDIT: I am moving in 60 days to a much closer location (only a 6 hour drive, huzzah!) so with the moving expenses and the already requested time off of work it is not something I can afford without dipping drastically into my savings. I'm only 23 and still in school so I don't have gold rimmed pockets, that is for sure. 

EDIT: I just booked my flight! Luckily enough for me I have this boyfriend who is crazy about me and also racks up frequent flyer miles. I broke down to him after reading your responses and said I needed to go and I truly had every intention of paying for it myself. I didn't even know he had any points left! But he went online and used his points, he refused to let me pay for it. Further more I had no trouble finding a sitter for my puppy while I'm away or rides while I am there. My boss is also understanding. It seems like the stars aligned. I can't wait to get home, I just wish it was under different circumstances. Thank you for the nudges in the right direction reddit.

I was [incidentally] looking for a past Reddit link, when I came across it. I decided to investigate, seeing ""sex"" as part of the name. He says he never watches porn, so I thought I'd playfully catch him in an innocent lie. What I found was not so innocent.


It was a sex-seeking website that he had signed up for. I looked at his profile, and saw he was seeking a female for ""flirtatious exchanges"". He identified as single (no surprise). He even had a suggestive photo of himself on it. Needless to say, I was shocked and heartbroken. But then I saw that he had provided his e-mail address, which I know the password to.


So, I created a fake identity, and contacted him. The chat has progressed far beyond the boundary I had hoped he would enforce... He has even said that he would hook up with this [fake] girl. 


We've been together for 3+ years. He says, sincerely I think, that he loves me. That he wants a future for us. But all of my trust has dissipated... Sadly, I've suspected this before. He thinks that as long as it isn't physical, he's done little wrong. I feel otherwise. I guess what I'm asking is... Now what?

Well, I've been drowning my sorrows in Newcastles and biographies when I got a text from my ex girlfriend. I obviously hoped she was begging for forgiveness and pleading me to come back to her. Both because I missed her and I wanted to turn her down (I'm a complicated fool of a man).

She was not:
I wanted to let you know I'm sorry for what I said. Once you compared my entire career to that of a prostitute I lost my temper and said a lot of things I regret. I hate to end on a bad note because we were both hurt and lashed out. I also wanted to let you know you are right about Rob. Just because I would want to know if I were you and you deserve to know you weren't crazy. I didn't think he felt the same way and I resigned myself to trying to love someone else. I didn't do a good job. How could I when he was constantly there? But then it turns out he's felt the same way all along. He just didn't think he could cross the line. It had to be me because Rob felt as my superior there was no appropriate way to confess his love. Two years of us being stupid and stubborn but we are finally together. We are hashing through it with HR now and they're not giving us any problems. Sorry we put you in the middle of our personal games.
I wish you all the best.

So fuckkk. She is going to live happily ever after, never loved me, and I wasted five months. Gonna become a monk now reddit. g2g find God.

tl;dr They are living happily ever after. I am drinking Newcastle and exploring the possibility of eternal celibacy. 

EDIT:
I don't want to do an update because there is no reason to do one but I would like to just say that I don't begrudge her happiness or want her to catch on fire or anything like that. I'm a little bummed out that it ended this way (because despite this, she was a fun girlfriend, we did a lot of fun stuff together and she even reddited so we had a lot to talk about and she is EXTREMELY smart ((honestly she does a lot of her boss's work and gives great throwback, if it weren't for her fucked up family she would have gone on to be an executive.. not an assistant) but I'm not getting drunk or wasting away. I am just having a few cold ones and playing videogames because I'm an introvert and this is how I cheer myself up.

Anyways, my point is I'm not a hero and she isn't the villain. We never said we loved each other or anything. I saw it maybe going in that direction, unless I end up teaching in Nebraska or something. 

I said a shitty thing to her and it all unwinded from there (and I did start the shit in that conversation- now that it's done, I realize that). 

I'm a little dissapointed and a little bitter but I don't hate her or want her to lose her job or get crabs. I just kindof want everyone to be happy and maybe to get laid this weekend. Not that we'll be friends, I just don't have time to hate her.

I was just looking for confirmation. He won't be living here anymore. I own the house. I plan to get STD tests, and I'll somehow stumble through child support and custody agreements. Thanks everyone.**


My boyfriend and I have been together for about four years. We have a two, almost three, year old daughter. Today when I was buckling my daughter into the car I found an empty condom wrapper next to her car seat. 

I immediately assumed it meant he was cheating but decided to wait until we got back from the store to discuss it. When we get back, I hand him the wrapper and he doesn't say anything. I start to put up the groceries I had bought and he comes in. He nervously asks me ""Oh, heh. Where did you find this?"" 
""Where do you think? Your backseat.""

A bit more time passes before he tells me he has no idea how it got there, maybe he picked it up to throw it in the trash? I told him that it's clear to me that he's cheating. He doesn't respond with anything. He's very quiet, all he has done is deny it's his. He doesn't even deny(or confirm) cheating. We can't really have an all out discussion about this, since our daughter is there. He has to leave for work at this point. 

We had an issue about a year ago where he was texting several girls and he denied actual cheating. I gave him another chance and told him that he can have female friends but he shouldn't go to extreme lengths to hide it. I told him it's really suspicious to never mention them to me, and hide all evidence. Because of this previous problem, after he leaves I log into the phone company's site to check who he's been texting. 

I found out he's been texting one number every single day since at least May. Sometimes 2-3 times, sometimes 10+. I text him to ask who this person is. He plays dumb, no idea who it could be and then finally after more pressure he says maybe it's a coworker? I ask why he is texting them so much with no response. So, I call the number. A woman answers, and I just hung up. 

I inform him that a woman answered the phone, and he then tells me the story about how he likes to jerk off in his car with a condom and how this woman from work is his friend. They apparently have tons in common, they talk about video games and Lord of the Rings all the time. 

I ask why he was hiding his friendship with her from me. He's never even mentioned this woman's name to me.  He said he didn't want to ""freak me out"", despite us previously having a problem with this.

He didn't want to tell me about jerking off before because it's embarrassing. I've never had a problem with masturbation, and I know he does it. I flat out don't care. He knows this. He IS still embarrassed about it and I've rarely *seen* him do it. I've never heard of him using a condom or doing it in the car, though. I know he often does it at home after I go to bed. 

Could that embarrassment have been so bad that he didn't even tell me when I flat out accused him of cheating earlier in the day? Or did he come up with this false story after I found out about his coworker?

He doesn't explain why he was hiding it, or offer me any sort of reassurance. He's deleted the text messages already ""out of guilt"". In fact, he had been deleting them often because I randomly check his phone and haven't even seen her number in his phone book(trust issues).

I've kicked him out of the house for at least the night. It's tough because our daughter doesn't understand why daddy isn't here. We told her he's staying the night at a friends house. 

Am I doing the right thing? Could he really just be jerking off in the car, and be afraid to tell me about his platonic female coworker?

We rarely fight, we have common interests and work in the same fields, and we're pretty much best friends. I know her in and out and trust her completely. She's a great person through and through.

However, recently there have been some things about her that I just don't understand. At first she told me she had been masturbating to lesbian porn and thinking about trying something with another girl. I understood and was supportive about it, but that phase came and went. 

Next came the penis envy. She's insanely jealous of my penis, and it's getting borderline obsessive. She constantly wants to hold or touch it in some capacity, talks to it, takes pictures of it all the time and desperately wants it to be sentient, or be able to talk back to her. Her having penis envy isn't just wild speculation on my part either, she's explicitly told me several times that she wishes she had one, they're the coolest thing ever, etc.

At first I thought it was cute and played along with everything, even making up little fake penis stories to entertain her. I even bought her a ""Mr. Limpy"" fake penis for trans women so she'd have one just to play with. At first she was ecstatic about it, but soon it wasn't enough. For months I thought all of this was just another one of our inside jokes until last week.

We had just finished having sex and I was at the computer looking at something, and she reached in my pants to play with it. Ok, no big deal. After 5 or 10 minutes it was getting kind of annoying so I said ""hey sorry, I think that's enough for today"", and she immediately withdrew and started acting really weird. Eventually this led to a full-on breakdown in tears, and when I asked what was wrong she said ""I just want to touch your penis all the time, and when I can't have it the rejection just crushes me""

I just don't know what to do. I feel that it's endearing and sweet, but at the same time I really don't like being messed with constantly. I've told her it's akin to someone poking and prodding you all the time, and she understands, but it just kills me to see her so heartbroken over this. The other day she even mentioned that she had been looking at prosthetic penises to wear around all day. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Are there any other women who feel this way? I'd really love to hear what you think. Thanks for reading this wall of text.

Welcome to my nightmare.  I've been seeing Jack (fake name) for 4 years.  We have a very open and honest relationship together.  Initially, my son Mark (fake name as well) didn't seem to have a problem with him.  Once I realized my relationship with Jack was starting to get serious, I encouraged Jack to start bonding with my son more.  He did everything he could.  We started out doing things with him together but in each of these outings he would cling to me and ignore Jack.  I think Mark began to realize that Jack was more than just ""Mommy's friend"".  Eventually Jack began to take Mark out alone.  They went to baseball games, played in the park, etc.  Jack even tried to teach Mark how to ride a bike.  Unfortunately, Jack had horrendous stories each time he returned.  Mark would start screaming, yelling and throwing temper tantrums.  At first, Mark denied all of this so I ended up following and secretly observing Mark and Jack at a local high school baseball game.  Jack was right.  Mark was screaming at people saying he didn't know Jack and that Jack was scaring him.  Jack and I discussed this at length and I could tell how frustrated he was with the situation.  We decided to hope that it was just a phase and chose to postpone the bonding efforts for a later date.  This did, however, take a large toll on our relationship.  Jack expressed an interest in buying a house with me many times but I had to shoot each offer down because of Mark.  Last month, Jack proposed to me.  I know that I love this man more than anyone in the world (except for Mark, obviously) and I easily said yes without hesitation.  Mark didn't take the news well.  When we told him he threw a **huge** tantrum (this was the first time he threw a tantrum in front of me).  He was crying, screaming and throwing stuff at Jack.  We hoped we could ease Jack into Mark's life but things just got worse. One day, Mark started crying (we were alone) and told me that he didn't want to live with Jack; he wanted to live with his ""daddy"".  He told me that if I married him he would go live with grandma (who has tried multiple times to take my son away from me, but that's an entirely different story).  Basically, Mark gave me the ultimatum that I was afraid Jack would give me.  Mark wanted me to choose between the love of my life and my son.  I confronted Jack with this and tried to tell him that we could introduce him into Mark's life more gradually but Jack didn't want to hear any of it.  He told me that he didn't want me to make the choice and he knew I would pick my son over him anyways (he said that's what he would've done if he were in my situation).  After that, he left.  A couple days later, he sent me a text telling me that he was initiating NC and he told me about his plans to move away.

I know that once Jack makes up his mind it's nearly impossible to change it.  I don't think there's any hope for my relationship with him until Mark accepts him.  I tried calling Mark's dad and asked him if they could have a conversation (him and Mark) about everything but he just laughed and told me that my love life was my own problem.

I feel so broken right now.  I know I'm supposed to love my son more than anything in the world but I've begun to resent him.  It's not only his tantrums with Jack anymore.  All of the little things that I used to ignore now annoy me to no end.  Please, if anyone has advice for my situation I would greatly appreciate it.

He was in a really good mood yesterday so I brought up my issue gently but firmly. Before I even had to explain myself beyond ""I don't like having the dog on the bed, at all, ever, because of my allergies..."" He stopped me and responded with this:

""Honey, I wish I would have known sooner. I am so sorry. We will keep her off the bed. I didn't know it made you so uncomfortable. You deserve better than that. I need you in my bed, not the dog. We'll bathe her more regularly, too. I'm sorry you were so nervous to talk to be about it. I know I've been a douchebag about this stuff in the past, but YOU are the most important thing in my life.""

There was lots more discussion after that. It was such a relief. He explained to me that he doesn't get implications. If I need something, I need to be more blunt and straightforward. I agreed. He knew I was disgusted by the bed situation but since I never told him what I wanted to be done about it, he did nothing. We are both to blame. Thank you all for your great advice!

I thought after all the help everybody gave me, you deserved an update on the situation. 

I decided to firstly get the locks changed, the day after the original post was submitted. It didn't take long and didn't cost much, which was good. She had a key for the original locks so she could have entered my house at any moment. 

I then attempted to get some kind of evidence of her making these threats. Unfortunately, the iPhone Voice Memo recording idea would have been unlikely to work, I doubt she would have fell for that. I attempted to coax her into telling me by text that she was going to accuse me of rape and violence. For example, I sent her, ""Were you being serious when you said you'd accuse me of those things?"" She rarely replies to texts and usually comes and sees me herself so when she didn't reply I wasn't surprised. 

I decided to break up with her via e-mail. I told her that we weren't working, her actions weren't normal, she was scaring me, I couldn't live with her anymore and I wanted us to break up. I never received a reply, a couple of times she tried to call me on my home phone, but apart from that I haven't spoken to her since. I blocked her from Facebook, despite the fact she goes on there once or twice every few months, if that, and I'm no longer listed as in a relationship with her. 

Thank you all for your help and, as yet, I've had no policemen knocking on my door informing me of an accusation made against me. That's not to say it won't happen, hopefully it won't, and I really do hope she gets professional help and comes through this because at one point I really did love her. 

Thank you!

many upsetting comments to pornographic subreddits.",nicotine_espresso,390,104,237,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aq3ld/i_22f_decided_to_google_my_boyfriends_25m/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half. It's honestly been the best relationship I've ever had so far. We get along really well.

I am very aware of his sexual appetite. I understand that (for the most part) men perceive sex differently from women. I also understand that looking  at porn is a normal behavior that nearly everyone does.

I have never had a problem with my boyfriend watching porn or masturbating, and I still don't.

It may be because I suffer from bouts of paranoia, but I sometimes feel my boyfriend is being secretive about his life. 

Although I can be paranoid at times, I take pride in the fact that I am not the type of girlfriend who constantly asks ""Where are you? Who are you with?""

I also have never looked through his phone, his facebook, or e-mails, or any other personal accounts he has. I feel that if I were to do so, I would be invading his privacy in a way that says I don't trust him. I respect his privacy.

I do trust him. That statement that frightens me due to the fact that I have been hurt in the past when I have trusted others with my heart.

I honestly don't know why I decided to google his username, but I definitely was not expecting to see a litany of comments to pornographic subreddits. In my defense, anything posted to the internet is public, as are his comments. I could be wrong, but I don't think this counts as snooping. Curiosity killed the cat, I guess.

It was kind of shocking. I knew my boyfriend looked at porn, but I wasn't expecting him to be commenting on these women's photos, saying things like ""you are stunningly beautiful"" and ""incredibly sexy"" and the things he'd like to do to them.

I was a little angry at first, until I saw that he commented something along the lines of how he'd have been much happier spending his new year's with the naked woman in the photo.

He spent New Year's with me. That one hurt, bad. 

And as I began thinking about it, all of his comments began to hurt me more and more. This man I have spent a year and half with has been sitting online calling these women stunningly beautiful and lovely... the same things he says to me. How can I not think about that the next time he says something like that to me? It almost feels like the fact he thinks I'm beautiful is now meaningless, because he uses the term so freely online.

I am also paranoid now that I have found these comments that this may be only the tip of the iceberg. What else don't I know about? What if he's been privately messaging these women? What if he's been cheating on me? I mean, to be honest, I highly doubt that he's cheating/ed on me, but anything is possible.

Am I wrong to be hurt by these comments? On that note, what should I do about this? How do I bring it up to him that I have seen all of these sexual comments to other women and I am hurt? This is really the first time I have been seriously hurt in this relationship and I am not sure how to handle it...

I love my boyfriend dearly. I don't want this to hurt our relationship.

Any ideas?,justthestep,348,65,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10cvet/my_stepson15_just_backhanded_my_wife33_of_7_years/,"Context: My wife had Connor* when she was 18 with her abusive husband who has a barrage of mental issues. She left the husband when she realized that the next beating might be the one that kills her- I've seen the pictures (during a custody trial) and it's obscene what he did to her. Connor was four. The bastard still gets to see him every other weekend because the state thinks that since he's never laid a hand on him that it means he has a right to it. Nevermind that he terrorized my wife and this means she has to have him in her life or that he is obviously not a good role model..

I met her when he was 7 and we got married when he was 8. Due to him being already being 8 and his father being so abusive, I've never been the disciplinarian in his life. I mean, the occasional take your clothes to your room, have you done your homework? But no grounding or deciding the punishment. Which has been fine. We share equally the discipline of the two children we have together. 

BUT, Connor has always had a temper. He punched a hole in our wall last year (wife made him patch the hole and pay for the materials, and grounded him for two weeks) and has always been prone to almost tantrums. We worry that he has inherited his father's mental issues or that the time he spends with his dad makes him think this is okay behavior... He sees a counselor but the counselor seems to ,think that he is a pretty normal, if angry kid.

Lately it seems like he is grounded or has privleges taken away more than not. Tonight he was not, but when I went to pick him from the movies he wasn't there and didn't answer his phone. Great. I go home. The wife is angry. He comes in after midnight. Which is passed his curfew unless he has special permission and is in trouble for not answering his phone anyways.

I am already in bed and don't get up. My wife has always handled him fine before and it's hard for me to let her take control when he's become so aggressive lately. He also is 5'11 and she is 5'1 and dainty. I hear them both shouting, cursing, when I'm about to get up I hear the door slam. 

I go out and she's got his fistprint on her face. He left the house. I would've followed him but I am afraid I would've killed him. I've never been so angry before. She just had this look on her face. And all I could think was how his dad used to do that to her all the time. 

He hasn't come home yet but I am not sure what I should do when he does. I'm a bit of a country boy and if I had ever done this my dad would've whooped my ass. But at the same time, he's a minor and I'm not sure I should beat the shit out of him. 

I KNOW that if he's doing to use his size and be aggressive that it's past time for me to take over his discipline though. Right? My wife is very upset and went to bed. saying she needed to sleep on this.

Any advice?

tl;dr: My stepson(15) comes from an abusive marriage and spends every other weekend with the asshole. He currently sees a counselor but is still in trouble more than out. I have never been a disciplinarian to him, in our 7 years of marriage. Tonight he came home and hit his mother (I was not there). What is appropriate? Should I kick his ass? Should I take over disciplining him from his mom?

My wife [22f] of 2 years will not talk to me and I dont know what to do",apostle228,384,102,249,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1eyywb/i_22m_am_in_the_military_currently_deployed_my/,"Ok first off I want to say sorry as this is going to be a long one.

I am in the military, currently deployed to the middle eastern area of reponsibility. I have been deployed for 5 months now with another 5 months to go. I am having trouble with my wife. She wont talk to me, and I dont know why.

The first 3 months I was gone, she was fine. Everything was fine, and normal. She answered the phone when I called, and emailed me back every time I emailed her. Then literally overnight, she changed... something happened or something maybe, I don’t know what, but she went from being normal and talking to me almost daily to being unresponsive, cold, and heartless :( And that’s the way its been the last 2 months now.

She started screening my calls, not answering, and when I asked why she wasnt answering any more, she told me that I was less important than anything she is doing and that unless she isnt busy she isnt going to answe the phone anymore.

Then she started ignoring my emails, and responding with one word answers to everything like she doesn’t want to talk to me... She hasn’t given me more than ""one word answer"" conversation killers in over a month now. 

The last time I called her, about 3 weeks ago, after trying to get her to talk with me for 20 min and her not saying anything, I decided to talk about myself, and share what I had been up to recently, thinking that would possibly spark some conversation. She immediately interrupted me with ""I really don’t give a shit about anything that youre doing out there,"" then said, ""so, unless you have something important to say, i'm gonna go."" Thus ended our last phone call. I have tried talking to her about it on multiple occasions, and she doesn’t even answer me. Then it gets worse.

A week later I brought it up again, for the 3rd or 4th time, that I didn’t understand why she wouldn’t talk to me and why she killed every attempt I made at conversation, and she threatened to leave me! She said ""I am so tired of hearing about this and if you bring it up again I am going to leave you. I am not kidding, if you aren’t more understanding towards me, im gone.""

First off... What the fuck. Second off... What the fuck :( She literally threatened to leave me for asking her to converse with me! Then she had the nerve to say I am not understanding towards her!

I email her, every day, asking her how she is. What she is doing, how she's feeling. I ask her every morning if she slept well, and tell her sweet dreams every single night, and even tho she doesn’t respond 90% of the time and when she does its only a one word answer, I still ask her how her day was, every single day. Guess when the last time she asked me how I was? When the last time she asked me how MY day was? Not once since I left for deployment. In fact she made it quite clear now that she ""doesn’t really give a shit about anything I am doing"" in the last phone call I made to her. But I STILL make sure to ask HER. Every single day. And she has the nerve to tell me I am not being understanding enough with her... 

She doesn’t even tell me she loves me anymore. I tell her every night before I go to bed that I love her very much and I miss her. Most of the time she doesn’t even respond. About a quarter of the time I get ""okay"" as a response. And occasionally she goes as far as to reply with ""whatever"" after I tell her I love her.

I don’t understand what I ever did to warrant this kind of treatment from her... All I have done is poured out my love and kindness to her. Given her anything she ever wants. And I get treated like this? I don’t understand why. And I cant even ask her, I cant talk to her about any of this because last time I tried to she threatened to leave me if I ever brought it up again. I am so lost and distraught, its eating away at me.

What can I do? I am scared to talk to HER about it because of her threat to leave me, but I cant go 5 more months like this! She is killing our marriage and I dont know why, and I desperately need advice on what to do here and how I can help remedy this situation. If you have any suggestions please... help

tl;dr I am in the military, currently deployed, and my wife has stopped communicating with me for reasons I cannot comprehend.

Edit: To answer some questions asked. 

We already have seperate accounts and I give her an allowance that she can use for whatever she wants. All the bills are set up as allotments out of my pay check. The rest goes into my savings account. So, me getting financially screwed, thankfully, isnt possible.

As for if there was something she could have ""found out""... Certainly not. A little more back story perhaps, I grew up her. She was the girl next door, literally. I have known her since I was 9 years old. We both have been best friends since I moved into the neighborhood, started dating in high school, and got married 2 years ago. So, basically... She knows everything about me, I have never kept anything from her. I dont know if I could say the same about her, but I would like to think so.

Edit 2: The best advice I have recieved so far is to talk to a third party, friend, relative, etc and try and figure out what is going on that way... Fortunatly my sister lives down the road and hangs out with her regularly, I think I will try and ask my sister if she knows anything. I havnt talked about this to anyone, and I was really wanting to avoid that option as the last thing I need would be ""your talking behind my back??"" added on to everything. But I will ask my sister if she can talk to my wife, and not tell her I told her anything.

Edit 3: I decided to knuckle down and man up about it and send her an extremely lengthy email laying at all out... Everything I feel, everything she has done to me emotionally, and layed out all the possible reasons I see for her behavior. After much thought I had decided... If she was serious about leaving me for bringing things up again, then she no longer values our marriage so it wouldnt matter anyway and I have nothing to lose. But if she was throwing an empty threat, this could mean a breakthrough. So, the deed has been done, the email sent, I am awaiting her reply. I will post an update on her response, if she even responds at all.

Edit 4: Update. So, after the extremely long email I sent her, she ignored it for 2 days. The her reply to it was to give me the ""I miss you so much and I cant wait until you are back"" treatment... So in other words, she is avoiding the confrontation, but possibly has taken everything I said to heart?... I am still unsure. But that is more than she has said to me in over a month, so... If this is the beginning of things getting turned around and she continues to treat me like she cares from now on, we shouldnt have a problem, but we will see. I asked her if she was going to avoid the email I sent her, and her response to that was to tell me how she cant wait for me to be home and do the gardening in the back yard with her... So I took that as a yes, she does intend to avoid my confrontation.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1369726021.0,,,True,t3_1eyywb,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1eyywb/i_22m_am_in_the_military_currently_deployed_my/,
1368377475.0,282,self.relationships,1e6uof,[UPDATE] Condoms in LDR bf's (both 25) wash bag ... we don't use condoms :/,washthatcondom,339,57,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e6uof/update_condoms_in_ldr_bfs_both_25_wash_bag_we/,"[Link to original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e0qh6/condoms_in_ldr_bfs_both_25_wash_bag_we_dont_use/)

Just to recap: We are both 25, dating 2 years.  I am woman, he be man.

In the end, I didn't need to bring up the condom conversation because he did.  We had just moved to another room (we have been trying to settle into a place since I arrived, and we have just found a permanent space to rent together in a friend's place) and, as we were unpacking, he emptied his wash bag onto the bed and said, 'Ugh, I have so many condoms, people kept giving them to me'.  I questioned him some more.  He was in South Africa for a work conference about 2 weeks before I arrived and he told me that they were giving out free condoms in the bathrooms to prevent the spread of AIDS.  I had a look at the condoms.  

In my last post, I said that they were all different brands and ages.  In fact they are all manufactured in 2011, one is from 2010, they just look very very new.  Some of them are in English, some in Spanish/Portuguese.  The Spanish/Portuguese ones are from a time when we were several-months-honeymoon-dating-together in London.  The English ones, he pointed out, are a cheap Chinese brand they like to hand out over in SA.  I didn't question him any more.  I was advised to watch his reaction to figure out how truthful he was being and I felt like he was being honest.   

tl;dr We talked about the condoms, they are all from 2011 and given to my SO in SA (whilst he was there for work conference) to prevent AIDS.

Am I overreacting?",kaygeeeff,355,72,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bm219/update_incident_at_work_between_myself_29f_and/,"I wrote this up in a big ol' hurry, so I apologize if anything is confusing or unclear. Just wanted to get it all out while it's fresh on my mind. 

The tl;dr from my previous post: 

My coworker (50F) of five years has been on my (28F) back for ages, which culminated today in an IM she accidentally sent to me calling me a ""fat, useless bitch."" I'm not sure if I should quit, file a complaint with HR, or ask to be transferred. Am I overreacting to a little bit of name-calling, or am I legitimately upset?

First, I’d like to thank everyone who responded to my first post. The support and advice I received was invaluable, even from (maybe especially from) the people I didn't agree with 100%. You all gave me so much to think about. Because of your input, I walked into my meeting with a much more solid idea of what I wanted to get out of it. The results were not what I wanted but at least I know I handled things well.

My supervisor and the county supervisor met with Jane before they met with me. They spoke to her for quite a long time. I wasn't in the room for their meeting but I believe she was given a written warning. When she came out she was visibly upset. 

My meeting was short and not as productive as I had hoped. My supervisor and the county supervisor both agreed that Jane’s actions required a disciplinary response, but they wouldn't tell me what specific actions (if any) were taken. The county supervisor said up front that it was an “on the record” meeting, so I took the opportunity to explain what I had been through with Jane over the last couple years. Basically, I quickly re-told the story from my previous post- Jane’s anger at my absence when my father was dying, reviewing my casework without permission and for no real reason, monitoring my enter/exit times from the building, etc. Those were all either public incidents or things that I could back up with paperwork. I left out the weird creepy thing where she told me to watch my back simply because that’s her word against mine and I have no way to prove that she said it. 

I feel like I was able to present my story to my supervisors calmly, rationally, and clearly. The whole “leaving in tears” thing from yesterday is not my style, but I was worried that going over it all again would upset me. Luckily, I felt well prepared for the meeting and remained totally calm throughout the whole thing. After my supervisors told me they couldn't tell me if/what disciplinary action was taken I asked to file a formal complaint with HR. My supervisors told me that there was no guarantee any action would be taken as a result of the complaint to HR, but they didn't try to discourage me from filing it. I believe that creating a paper trail is worthless to me, but may be very valuable to the next person who gets into this position with Jane. 

After hearing my side of the story and that I wanted to file a formal complaint, my supervisors asked if I had given any further thought to leaving. My immediate supervisor complimented me on the quality of my work and my professionalism and said he hoped I would stay. The county supervisor said the same thing, which was surprising to me. She was another unit’s supervisor until she was promoted to county supervisor last week, so she hasn’t had much direct contact with me. She said I had an excellent reputation in the office and she also hoped I would decide to stay. I know they're just words but it was nice to hear them.

I mentioned in a couple comment replies on the last post that I was planning on transferring counties anyway. This definitely lit a fire. My husband is deploying this month and he’ll be gone for nine months. We were already planning on moving when he got back (closer to my family, closer to his son) but I'm going to go ahead and start the transfer process now. I told my supervisors that I appreciated their kindness and was grateful for how they handled this situation, but that I wanted to start the transfer process and move in about 90 days. That gives them plenty of time to prepare for my absence and hire my replacement.  I'll have more than enough time to clear out my caseload and make sure I’m not dumping unfinished work on anyone. Plus it buys me some time to get my house packed, get a couple rooms repainted, and get it ready to sell. 

After I had said what I wanted to say, my county supervisor asked if I would be willing to speak to Jane. I guess when they talked to her earlier they told her to apologize directly to me, if I would allow it. It’s extremely doubtful that she volunteered to do that on her own. I agreed, they brought us into the same room, and I listened to what was hands-down the most half-assed, insincere apology I’ve ever heard. When she finished, I told her that I was badly hurt by what she said but I appreciated and accepted her apology, and I hoped that we could work together without any further incidents. Who knows if that was the right thing to say. At least I was telling the truth- she did hurt me, but I want to work out my time here in peace. Accepting the apology seems like a pretty empty gesture but I couldn’t imagine receiving an apology- even a lame one- and refusing to accept it. So, here we are. 

I can’t thank you guys enough for all the advice you gave me. I wouldn’t have gone into that meeting so calmly and with such confidence if I hadn’t heard so much good advice from everyone here. It is really, truly appreciated. 

**tl;dr** Unsurprisingly, the disciplinary wheel turns slowly (if at all). Jane was, I think, given a written warning. She was not fired. My supervisors supported my decision to file a formal complaint with HR and my decision to transfer in the next few months. Jane apologized- probably because she was told to- and I accepted, expressed my hope that we could work together peacefully for the remainder of my time in this office, and we shook hands. It wasn't a perfect outcome, but I feel like I handled the situation today as best as I could. Thanks SO MUCH again for the advice, opinions, and support. You guys are awesome.

There's no one else for me to talk to about this, so please, if you have a few minutes, read this.**

----

Late one night, two years into our relationship, I decided to surprise my girlfriend at her apartment with a six pack. There was a six pack shop right across the street, so I went there. I'm walking out, and what do I see? Her and a close male friend - who she's confessed to having an attraction to - are coming back drunk from a party, and she's inviting him up to her apartment (her roommates are still out).

My immediate reaction was to make my presence known. Not confrontational, just a normal greeting, showing the 6-pack and asking how the party was. She immediately explains that he was only going to come up for a few minutes to get some food. In my head, I'm reeling, but I figure the best thing to do at the moment is play it off and accept that story, so we all head up, eat some food, and drink some beer. He leaves. I tell her I'm going home, and she insists on coming with me back to my place. We fight in the car - I demand to know the real story - and the tearfully insists that it wasn't what it looked like.

We get to my place, and she rushes to the bathroom to throw up. She gets a text from the guy, phone's right there where she set it down, I see it - ""But you have him"". I freak out, check the sent messages. While we were fighting in the car, she'd texted him ""Why do I have to like you so much?"" I confront her about it, tell her she's a cheater and to get the fuck out, etc etc... but she's sobbing uncontrollably at this point, and after a few minutes of screaming I break down and we hug and she explains that her feelings are all mixed up but that nothing happened and she'd never cheat on me. I don't completely believe her, but I decide that I'm not going to break up with her in a moment of anger, and make it very clear to her that if she ever gives me another reason to doubt her it will mean the immediate end of our relationship with no chance for explanation.

----

Fast forward three years, and there hasn't been another night like that one. We've been living together for a while, we have a dog, we're looking at houses and marriage. I'm absolutely in love with her, and I want to spend my life with her... but I don't trust her. She hasn't given me any reason to doubt her since then, but part of me wonders if she's just gotten better at hiding it, or if she was *always* good at hiding it and it was just dumb luck that I caught her that one time.

Sometimes I check her phone, or her Facebook if she's still logged in, and there's nothing. When she asks me to call before I come home from work, there's always a thought that says *maybe she has someone over, and wants advance warning*. It's paranoid and stupid and I hate it, but I blame her for that, too - I was never like this with anyone else. I think I actually want to find something, anything, that would vindicate me for the fact that I haven't forgiven her, give me an excuse to let her go and move on and not feel like it'd be a horrible mistake. But there's nothing, and I just end up feeling shitty for not being able to let the past stay buried, and kick myself for not being able to look past that one night and see what a wonderful woman she is.

It's come up a couple of times - where I'd beg her to just tell me the truth, tell me that yes, she wanted to cheat, she was going to cheat, but that fate swooped in and stopped it and she couldn't be happier about that. I'd understand that and love her for it. But still she denies it, and to this day maintains that she would never have cheated. It's an open wound - how can we close it and let it heal, and let me stop being so damn paranoid, if she's *still* lying to my face about it?

But then I put myself in her shoes, and I know she's terrified of losing everything. She fucked up and probably regrets it, and is afraid to tell me the truth after lying for so long. At least that's what I hope it is.

I love this woman. I want to marry her. I want what happened three years ago to fade away and stop casting a shadow on our relationship. But I really don't think I'll ever truly trust her 100%, and part of me is saying that I shouldn't settle for that and I'm better off walking away from everything and finding someone I'll have no doubts about, and another part of me is saying that I should be realistic and realize that no relationship is perfect and that it's just something we'll have to work through, and another part of me is saying that I'm just one of those dumb fucks who keeps dating someone long after they should have called it quits, and it's all incredibly confusing. I feel like I'm overthinking it and overfeeling it and I'm just so *saturated* with this shit that I can't tell what's wise and what's not.

Since then, we have alternated weeks with my son. While I was gone, my son never went to the doctor except when I managed to come back on leave (twice) and take him due to a chronic cough. I have been back for a year and a half now, and during that period we were alternating weeks with my son - exchanging on Sundays when the whole family met at my parents' house for Sunday dinner.

As of 1 January, my son was going to come live with me for a year, since his dad had a year with him while I was gone. During his year with me, I told his father that he would have as much time with our son as he wanted (staying overnight during the week, full weekends, etc) so long as our son primarily stayed with me.

On Monday, 28 Jan 2013, his father picked him up from daycare.

I was under the impression that he was going to stay there for one night, so I called his father to tell him that I would pick up our son from daycare the following day. No answer, so I sent it in a text. No response all day, until I got this from him Tuesday evening:

""I didn't take [our son] to daycare because it is raining. he is going to stay with me until we get this figured out because i dont trust that you two [myself and my husband] wont try to take him. i went over my decree and contacted a lawyer""

When I asked where our son was, he told me that our son was with him and that his boss (my brother-in-law) told him he could take as much time off as he needed until ""we get this paperwork changed"" Again. All through texts, he hasn't answered any of my calls, and will only communicate through text messages. 

I have not received any responses, phone calls, or texts, from his father since that conversation on Tuesday, 29 Jan 2013.

I spoke with an attorney yesterday, as well as DHS, and the military legal office, and all have told me the same thing: since (if we were still under the every-other-week system) this week is technically his dad's week, that nothing can be done until and unless his father fails to return him on Sunday.

My son has not been to daycare all week, and as far as I know, his father hasn't been to work, so I called the police station at noon today and asked them to go do a 'welfare check' - basically just go over there and see if anyone's home, make sure they're alive. The officer called me back, and told me no one was home, no vehicles in the driveway, and all doors and windows locked tight.

I called the police station again for another welfare check at 9pm, and it was the same. No one home, no vehicles, doors locked. My son goes to bed by 8pm, and he and his father are not home. 

His father has threatened to ""just take [our son] and leave, go back to Texas"" when we argued about custody in the past, and I'm worried that he's run off with our son. Is there anything else I can do in the meantime? I just want to know my son in okay, and that his father hasn't kidnapped him and disappeared.

**EDIT** Just some points for clarification: Since I've been back stateside, I have had him every other week, with the off weeks being with his father. How has he been an unstable parent? My son had spider bites all over him after staying at his father's this summer, and his doc said they were fine, just itchy. My ex then asked my parents to pay to have his house bug bombed since he couldn't afford it. I've also been weighing my son after picking him up from his dad, and he generally weighs 2-3 lbs less after being there. Doctors have frequently told me that he is underweight for his age, but he eats just fine at my house. I even give him PediaSure with his breakfast every day. My brother-in-law(his boss) pays for his car insurance because he cannot afford it and he needs his truck for work. I drove 20 minutes each way every morning on my weeks so my son could go to daycare near his dad, because he can't afford to drive to a daycare near me. My ex also has had his utilities turned off frequently due to non-payment. So, no heat, hot water, or stove use in the dead of winter. And my family has always bailed him out when this happened, because we couldn't have my son living in those conditions and I have never wanted to tell his father that he couldn't have him. This is ancient history now, but when we were still married, he went on an 800-mile road trip with our son (I couldn't get leave to go) and did it all in one trip, no stops. My son was 9 months old at the time, and his dad fell asleep at the wheel at night on a lonely stretch of highway in the Middle Of Nowhere, CO, and flipped the car at highway speeds. Both he and my son were okay, but I could never understand why he didn't stop and get a hotel...he HAD THE MONEY FOR IT. I told him to stop and do the trip in two days, and made sure he had enough to stay at a decent hotel. His father (who didn't work when we were married) routinely emptied my bank account to buy guns, which I then had to register with my commander because we lived in base housing. So my entire squadron knew that my civilian husband was buying lots of guns when I was the sole source of income and an E-2 at the time.

A couple months ago, a guest speaker came to our Careers class to talk to us about something. My friend whispered to me that he was hot and I agreed (because he kinda is), but didn't really think about it too much.
Fast forward 2 weeks, my friend comes to school and asks if she can speak to me about something. 
I ask her what's wrong, and she explains that after the guy finished his speech thing, she convinced him into getting coffee with her, and it escalated from there. 
She said that they had been involved sexually (with protection), and that he is very sweet and she likes him a lot. The thing that got me, however, was the fact that he was married, and had been for 23 years.

Needless to say, I was shocked, and basically told her that it didn't sound like the greatest idea, seeing as how she barely knew anything about him, but I would be there for her regardless. I tried to reason with her.
She told me that she was going to end it and up until this past weekend, that's what I'd thought had happened.
She confessed that she had tried to end it, but went back to him the next day and didn't want to tell me because she was embarrassed. 

While I've met him since and he's very kind and sweet, I worry for my friends well-being as she seems a little *too* attached to him, not to mention the fact that he's married. 

**TL;DR My 16 year old best friend is in a romantic relationship with a 42 year old married guy. What should I do?** 

**Edit**: (fixed some spelling) let me rephrase something, sorry. I am NOT supportive of this, I thought that I'd convinced her to end it, I was very upset when I found out she lied. However, she's not the type of person you can tell to stop doing something, because she will get angry and do it anyways. I figure it's better she knows I'm here to talk so that she doesn't feel hopelesss. I am at school right now, I will reply when I get home

**edit2**: We are not in the U.S., the age of consent where I am is 14 if the other person is under 18, and 16 for any older. Calling the cops would do nothing.

12-13 years:    
You can only consent to sexual activity with a person who is less than 2 years older than you. That 
person must not be in a position of authority or trust over you (i.e. teacher, coach, doctor, lawyer).
14 - 15 years:    
You can only consent to sexual activity with a person who is less than 5 years older than you. That 
person must not be in a position of authority or trust over you (i.e. teacher, coach, doctor, lawyer).
16 - 17 years:    
You can consent to sexual activity with a person who is older than you by any number of years. 
That person must not be in a position of authority or trust over you (i.e., teacher, coach, doctor,

She has her own place that she shares with a roommate she hates, so she comes over to my place a lot of the times because I live alone.

This is a problem I've had with girlfriends before in the past. They all love that I'm self-employed, work hard, make decent money and have my own place and car...but what most don't seem to understand is the amount of work I need to do in order to keep this lifestyle. 

It's not out of control, mind you, I maybe have to work one weekend a month and work late one night a week. 

I've had a discussion with her in the past about finding it difficult to work while she's here...my house isn't very big and I can't find a quiet space away from her to concentrate...even then, she drives me crazy without even realizing it. This is our typical conversation:

Me: ""I need to work today...""

Her: ""Oh...okay. I'll be quiet as a mouse. You won't know I'm here.""

Me: ""Uh. Yeah, look, I don't want you to be bored and I really need to concentrate today.""

Her: ""That's okay! I promise I'll just read! You won't know I'm here!""

Me: ""...alright, fine.""

10 min in:

Her: ""Can I get you a drink?""

Me: ""No, I'm good.""

Her: ""You sure?""

Me: ""Yes, thanks.""

Her: ""You don't want some water or some coffee or something?""

Me: ""NO, I'm fine, thankyou.""

Her: "".....you want a snack?""

20 min in

Her, talking to my dog: ""Oh silly puppy! Where's your toy?"" 

Her: ""Do you think dogs know the difference between their toys?""

Me: ""Look, babe, I REALLY need to concentrate on this...""

Her: ""Oh, sorry sorry................what are you working on?""

Today I, again, told her I need to work:

Me: ""I've gotta work today.""

Her: ""Oh okay, I'll leave and let you get your work done...in a few hours.""

Me: ""I need the WHOLE day to get this done.""

Her: ""Gotcha. Let me just finish this sandwich...and have some dessert...and finish this TV show...and then take a shower...and then get ready...and then I'll go get us lunch and give you an hour or two to work.""

Honestly, I'm trying to let her know that I need her to GET OUT of my house on the days I need to work. It's not like she doesn't have her own apartment. When I bought my house, I did not buy it for TWO people, so there's no office bedroom I can escape to and shut the door. 

How can I make it clear to her that I need some space to work without completely hurting her feelings. Every time I try to drop a hint, she just ""promises"" to not make a sound.

So after reading everyone's advice on my first thread I got my game plan together and called her out on the bullshit.  My fiance broke down into tears and told me that she knows she is acting like an idiot and is feeling really nervous about the wedding/ getting cold feet.

As far as the deleted text messages she explained that she has been having a lot of problems with her phone and she had to delete several conversations the night before b/c messages were getting sent over and over again, stuck in her outbox.  She had the capability to retrieve the deleted conversation and I asked her to do so b/c I wanted to see it.  She showed it to me, and it honestly was very innocent.  Mostly just talk about work and him bitching about his kids.

Despite the text messages being innocent, I explained to her that the fact that she is so concerned with this guy, and was willing to brush my feelings to the side is something that needs to change.  I told her that cold feet is one thing, but if she wants to go forward with this wedding she has to make sure that I am the number one guy in her life, always.

She told me she knows that.  She said that for whatever reason she is getting really anxious about the wedding in a month and, like I said, is getting cold feet.

I told her that I don't want to get married unless she is 100% sure about me.  I told her she needs to go to her parents for the weekend and really think about what it means to be married.  She wasn't happy about it, but didn't argue.  As of this morning she has been texting me constantly.  I feel better about the situation, but it remains to be seen if the issue is totally resolved.

But after dinner we walked down a local hot spot street for a few hours, and just talked about random things, did a bit of shopping, etc. We had a really good time

She also randomly wanted a hot dog - which since she's woken up she thinks she's still a vegetarian, so this was a surprise. So I bought her one and she loved it, and that was a great moment - for reason I don't really know how to explain but it was.

And then this morning she randomly called and asked if I wanted to join her to go dancing/gym. So we went and wasn't the best/most focussed workout but it was fun.

As far as her memory, a lot of it is still gone. But she has been getting bits and pieces back. Mostly random stuff, but she does remember me - not the relationship but she recognizes who I am. And she found some of her journals she kept and has been reading through those which have helped. Not bringing back specific memories but it has been helping her get a bearing on what's going on day to day and the dynamics of relationships with friends and such (few things about us too, but she hasn't gotten to those yet).

But all in all, things have been good and getting better. Hopefully they stay on this up-trend or at least level out and maintain. Thanks for those who has given advice, taken the time to write something helpful, and just for the simple support.

*sorry for the new throwaway, it wouldn't let me post because I didn't add a TL;DR the first time*

Alright, I figured I'd do this again since everyone was so interested the last two days...

I went over to her house last night and told her I needed to talk to her about this again and just clarify things. Again, she didn't get mad or defensive and she listened.

I sat her down on the bed and I asked her what, exactly, she thought the party was going to be. ""It was just supposed to be a jam with all the musicians from (bar). We were gonna smoke a ton and play music and drink.""

The bar has 3 other girls that play there. 2 of them were supposed to be there. I guess when he said there would only be 2-3 other guys, he meant just the male population.

So I asked her what exactly SS meant. Unfortunately for most of you- and this is probably mostly my fault - it doesn't mean Safe Sex party, or stripper party, or smoke sesh. And I apologize that I assumed it was any of those and made the situation seem worse. But I was literally just going off the initials, the stripper pole reference, and some advice from friends on what it could possibly mean.

It means ""Secret Society"" party. I was weary about that answer until she showed me texts from another girl that works there, in which they talk about (boss)s secret society parties.

Even then, I needed one more thing from her. I needed her to tell me straight up that she was going to take action against him. Whether it was with HR, a lawyer, or written disapproval of his actions that can later be used in a case against him if the treatment continued.

She said, Yes. Confidently, and assertively. She said she was going home to talk to her parents and her friend who is the law student for the best way to approach the situation.

To that I said, ""Okay, but I need you to know if you don't, I won't feel comfortable with any of this. I want you to know this isn't an ultimatum, but I just need you to know where I stand.""

She promised me she would. Then, and this was pretty awesome, asked me if I had any other questions. ""Just keep asking. Ask me everything. I promise I'm not lying to you."" And again reinstated, ""I would never do anything to jeopardize this. I never want you to lose respect for me, and I feel so stupid for not just saying No immediately. It's disrespectful toward me and even more so toward you.""

So I did ask, and I asked her about Vegas, and many more questions about the party and it all lined up. And it felt real and my gut tells me we're okay. Again, if she doesn't take action when she gets back from home, it's over. But as of now I have every reason to believe she's been faithful and upfront.

She didn't hide the texts from me. She just didn't think it necessary to tell me because she didn't see the outrageousness of his attitude. She told me about the party before it was supposed to happen, but she just didn't tell me about the texts.

I truly believe this is a case of her misjudging a situation she previously felt comfortable with. Again... I'll update when/if the action towards the boss takes place if you guys want me to.

TL;DR Went to my girlfriend's last night. Talked about every question I had in my mind. She calmly answered and explained and clarified. And reinforced the idea she was being truthful and honest. She promises to take action against the boss when she returns home. (She doesn't work until then anyway)

**EDIT** okay everyone. Thanks again for sticking it through with me. Thanks to all those who continue to give me support, PMs, and advice. Thanks for all those whose opinion keeps me honest and open to potential dishonesty. Like I've said multiple times already, I feel so much better about all of this. She's already started the process of putting something together toward him. If you all want, I'll update when and if that happens. Till then, I'm off. Thanks again for everything, Reddit!

This is great and I'm happy for her. We have 4 great kids. She is in great shape and is really enjoying tennis. I really can't play tennis very well due to an old sports injury. My issue is the time she is spending with her training partner. He is a really good, long term friend of mine and my wife. He has a great wife and family too.  

It didn't really start bothering we until lately. She has been meeting him at his house alone before playing. Now she meets him to play tennis and no longer even bothers to mention it to me. This last weekend she left in the middle of a beautiful sunny day to  play for 2 hours leaving me with the kids. She has on occasion driven right past my work and gone to play tennis with him and then was too busy stop and see me. Last night it really dawned on me when she left her facebook open and I noticed hundreds of messages between them. So here is my wife exchanging hundreds of messages with another man, going to his house alone, and sometimes spending hours a week with him.

Now I'm certain that there isn't anything physically going on between them but I just think that she should consider how this makes me feel (please no lawyer up and hit the gym comments). How would she feel if I was spending alone time with one of her best friends? The best word I can come up with for how I'm feeling is emasculated. I don't even know how to bring it up without appearing jealous and controlling.

Maybe she is attracted to him I'm just not sure anymore. I think what really bothers me the most is the fact that she doesn't even consider that this would bother me, if it was me doing this I'm pretty sure she really wouldn't let this slide. Her typical reaction to me when I'm upset with her is much like the ""you mad bro"" memes. Kind of like 'wow' no reasonable person would be mad right now.

Should this bother me? Am I over-reacting? If I bring it up with her does it make me look petty and weak?

Hi guys


Thanks so much for your kind words and advice. It's been a tough time. I convinced my wife to go for one more counselling session so we could agree an arrangement for me to see my son. 


I know a lot of you believe I should have took my son away from her and out of that environment. I couldn't agree more. However, I know that if I were to do that it would infuriate my wife and I was worried what she might do, to herself, to me, to the house. My main concern is my son but I also don't want my wife to hurt herself. I want to explore every avenue before going to the courts. There is no turning back when we stand in front of a judge. I take my wedding vows extremely seriously. I vowed to be with her in sickness and in health. She is very sick.


The counselling session went better than expected. We agreed that I would take my son for half the week, my wife the other half. The counsellor told my wife that she was severely depressed and has anger issues. She referred her to a psychotherapist. My wife took this news much better than I expected. She wants to get help and improve her life. She wants to get better and accepts that she is sick. Most important of all, she (at least claims) to have given up for weed. She accepts she had disrespected it. When I visited the house I couldn't see any papers, which before had been littered around on tables and other surfaces. I can't tell for sure, but she does seem more lucid. I didn't smell it in the house.


In the meantime, I have been back to my house to get some of my things. I have taken photographs of the mess in the case of us going to the courts. 


Right now, it's far too soon to know how this will all play out. In the meantime I am able to provide a safe environment for my son 3 and a half days a week and my wife will spend this time tackling her own issues and trying to get our house in order. I told her if it's too much then I'll hire a cleaner. She's open to the idea.


Thanks for everything guys. I'm cautiously optimistic.

We've told each other we love each other. We have soooo much in common and so much fun together it's ridiculous. 

So he left his gmail open on my computer. I sit down to check it a few days later forgetting it is his account signed in and find emails responding to adds he has posted on craigslist asking for NSA M on M sex. It's detailed. He went into great detail about what he likes, what he wants done. He gave 2 people his address and phone number. There was communication that seemed like at least one of them went to his house. So I look in the sent mail. over 15 messages replying to adds. Pics of him, pics of his penis, pics of his butt with a dildo in it. His phone number. In the trash there are emails that seem like men may have went to his house. 

Also, there is a link to an ad he posted on backpage advertising his services as a manwhore. With prices and everything. 

The dates of the emails range from 2 days ago to four months ago.

When I asked him about it- over the phone- he says he was just playing around. I didn't mention the most extreme pics. He said he never expected anyone to show up. He said he isn't worried about someone coming over because people are just playing around on craigslist. 

I think this is crazy, I feel betrayed, I feel like he may have cheated on me, I am hurt. We won't see each other till Sunday evening. We will talk about it again but I don't even know if it's worth it. I think the emails and pics went WAAAAAY to far for joking. If he would admit he had a problem we could talk about it but he is adamant that it was all jokes-just messing with people. We have begun to include some BDSM in our sex life and he wanted me to be the dom....just like in his emails to random men. 

He has met all my friends and I am too embarrassed to ask any of them for advice. Please help!!!

EDIT: I texted him and told him it was over. I told him it was not because of the bisexuality but because of the dishonesty. He replies and says he is very sorry it happened that way, that he is ashamed and embarrassed. We ended up talking on the phone. I asked him if he actually met anyone. He said no. I asked him about the address, phone number and pics. He said he has been down, lonely, when he gets off work sometimes he drinks way too much and replies to adds on craigslist. He said lately he started taking it further to see what people would do and how far he could take it. He said he would never actually meet someone. That he has never had sex with a man but has thought about it. Said it's something he doesn't need to be happy. I asked him all sorts of questions about the emails and ads and he was transparent. I am still not sure if he is honest about meeting people.


He is from a small town in the midwest. I am too so I know the stigma and prejudice associated with homosexuality or bisexuality. He told me the replying to ads started shortly before he met me and then continued. He said he now understands how it was cheating-even if he didn't meet anyone. He said he told me it was a joke at first because he was caught off guard. I told him all he needed to do was talk to me-that I am open and if I love someone and they need me to stick a dildo up their ass then I would-for real. I told him there are so many different facets of sexuality and it's ok to be different but of course it is not ok to deceive people-myself or the people in the ads. I told him went on a few dates with a bi man and I discussed it with him-that this man was very up front with it and comfortable with his sexuality. He and I never ended up going that far. 


Anyway we talked about much more. I am still not sure but I feel good about it. I feel like he hid it because he was ashamed. He does have an addictive personality, I knew that from the get go. He had no problem agreeing to get tested together and I made an appt for us for Monday. I had already called about me so it was easy to call and add him. I told him I didn't know when I would be ready to have sex again and he said ok. He agreed not to drink for at least 2 weeks. We were planning a float trip the first week in August so that was the cut off (who doesn't drink on a float trip?!). He said he would go to bed at a reasonable hour when he gets off work. He works evenings and I work days so we only see each other a few days out of the week. He had already taken the adds down but of course he said he would never do it again. I asked him what he would do if I asked to see his phone or see his email out of the blue and he immediately said he would show me. I mentioned counseling for him and he said he would think about it if this talk, our openness and his his new found motivation didn't help get him out of his funk. His motivation- he said he sat up all night thinking about what happened. He realized it was wrong, that he didn't want to be that person and he didn't want to lose me. He wants to continue with his goals he has been putting off and me catching this was a wake up call for him. 


I think I am going to try it. I may be completely wrong and get burned....but what if he is telling the truth? Everyone here save one is saying ""run and run fast"" and that is what I thought before I spoke with him. But I feel like he was being transparent with me and I can understand his embarrassment and why he felt like he had to hid his desires. As far as if I believe whether or not he acted on them, I don't know.  Will he in the future? I feel like he is being truthful when he says no. We are definitely going to talk about it more though-I have more questions. 


I know I deserve a good man. I am a good woman! I have a great job, my own house and rental property. Take this episode out of the picture and he is a good man. He is responsible, friendly, romantic, fun, adventurous and a helluva good cook. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I have one more thing. I can also understand because I posted a few ads myself. I am interested in BDSM and posted ads regarding that in the same place he did. I gave out my phone number to a few people and actually ended up meeting someone. Granted I was not in a relationship at the time. But I was way to shy to ever tell anyone I was in an actual relationship with. Way to shy. 


So fire away- tell me I am making a bad decision. Or am I? I hope not


Edit again: I broke up with him a few days ago. Too much way to early in our relationship and the trust is gone.

Hello

Thank you for all of your comments and advise on this matter.

I went to court yesterday. I went on my own. My SO did offer to come along but I declined saying this was my past and he was my future and that I didn't want to two to merge.

I saw my ex. There was no emotional twang at all. I wonder what I ever saw in him. He didn't even dress up remotely smart.

Because of my ex's late submission of evidence, I had prepared a verbal statement. The judge started by saying he understand that part of my argument was ""under duress"" and that is normally a hard one to prove. He said it's a lot of money so because it starts he wants to adjourn and give me the opportunity to prove my state of mind at the time. I have two weeks grace.

This time I am going to create a stack of solid evidence. I have arranged two witness statements from people in my life who were close to me when I had my melt down. I have paid the private fees for my doctor to give me a full disclosure on the state of my mental health at the time. I have spoken to my therapist who is going to write a candid report on my behalf to uphold this.

I have also contacted my bank and requested the last three years on my bank statements that show that no loan money was ever transferred since I met the guy.

I have to go full disclosure on my medical and financial history to have a chance I guess.

I am happy at least that the judge is willing to go into the details of the case.

During the judge talking about mental health difficulties, my ex interrupted him, looked at me and said ""Are you really doing this? What about your daughter?"" There was a moment of awkward silence and the judge asked him what he meant and he said ""Well if she's fit enough to look after a child, she was fit enough to sign a financial contract. If she wasn't maybe all of this should be taken into account in terms of her child."" He said that by looking at me straight in the face.

The judge kinda tore him a new asshole at that point.

TL;DR: Case adjourned, ex made a fool of himself. Have chance to make a strong case. We'll be back in April.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_1a5c5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a5c5u/update_being_sued_by_my_f30_cheating_exbf_m30_i/,

I know that he wouldn't want to know, and he'd rather live in bliss of not knowing. I didn't want to tell him, and I wanted to carry that burden on my own. However, I couldn't be honest when I say that everything is awesome if I don't tell him. Either we work through it or don't. Not to say anyone who responded was wrong in telling me NOT to tell him. If I was younger and with someone for much less time, it would be easier to keep it to myself.  

We are both off of work today, so I told him a partial version of the story. 

I told him I had cut Mike (the other guy) off because I felt like our friendship was unhealthy and that it crossed boundaries. I did admit that some flirting was going on and some pictures were traded, though nothing sexual, and all I sent him was photos of my face. The most sexual photo he showed me was that first one of his chest. 

I also told him that I became attracted to Mike, though I never intended to, and that's why I cut it off. I made it clear that he is out of my life. My boyfriend has my email passwords, including facebook, and I took the lock off of my phone (though he knew that, too) just to show him I had nothing to hide. I haven't heard from Mike at all since I told him that we needed to break it off. 

He looked at me like he was completely broken and said he needed some time to sort things out, so he went over to our neighbors house that we are taking care of while they are out of town. He's been there for 3 hours now. 

So. There we are. 

I guess I will let you guys know what happens whenever I find out...

Christ. The original question was whether my doubts about allowing us to videotape during sex were reasonable. I was surprised to find that many redditors said he was selfish and manipulative- the comments put certain things he has said/done in a new light, and I began to think really seriously about certain aspects of our relationship.
I did a lot of thinking. When I came home,I brought up the conversation with him, saying I wasn’t willing to videotape at all, even with the compromise I stated earlier. (No face in the video.)He insinuated that, without the tapes, he’d be tempted to cheat on me. When that didn’t work, he said, “You have a choice. Either we make new videos without your face, or I recover the old ones.” I could not talk him out of this. (One of you saw this coming, and sent me a link to something that would help permanently delete the videos. Hattmoward, you rock! Thanks.) 
This entire thing was really upsetting. I’ve decided to end the relationship. I’ve appeased him for now, and I’m checking the computer while he’s at school today- I want to make sure the files are permanently deleted, and if not, I will permanently delete them. After that I’m breaking up with him. 
All of you who commented, thanks so much for your advice and for your support. 
TL;DR: I am going to DTMFA.

We were so in love and excited to be together. A few months into our marriage, we decided to have a baby. It didn't take long, and I gave birth 6 weeks ago to a daughter.

Three weeks after she was born, my husband told me that he was not feeling as happy as he should and that he was going to therapy. He said it was because of his messed up childhood and an abusive prior marriage. Ok, great. Working on that kind of thing is good. But after his first session, he told me that he also feels like he doesn't love me as much as he should and that's part of the reason why he's going. He said these feelings were building up as soon as I got pregnant.

Then he told me that the therapist suggested that he move out in order to have a space to work through things that doesn't have a relation to me in any way. He also told me that he was going to do it, no discussion. After I got over the shock, we talked about it some and he said he wouldn't do it. The next day, he had changed his mind again. I literally begged him not to do it, but he wouldn't change his mind. He told me that he thought my reaction was extreme and that he had hoped I would be more supportive.

Apparently he's only going to spend a few nights a week there. But I feel abandoned. He's pulled back from our relationship. We barely kiss. There certainly is no sex, because he's pulled that off the table as part of working through his issues. He says he still loves me and he understands why I'm so hurt. He says he's worried about our relationship in the future and that's why he's doing this. He seems to think that if he doesn't, a divorce is inevitable. I'm afraid that what he's doing now will lead to divorce.

I had no idea this was coming. I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me, like the whole life we built together was a lie. I was having some issues with PPD and this is making things a million times worse. I thought I was bringing a baby into a stable home with two parents who loved each other and who would be together. But I'm so hurt. I don't know if I can make it through this without resenting him. I don't want to hate him before this is over.

I have also started seeing a counselor. My husband has also agreed to go to couples' therapy, although he thinks it won't do much good at this point because he hasn't worked out his own stuff.

I have a new baby to take care of, and soon I'll be back at work, too. I don't know what to do, or how to cope. How am I going to keep my marriage from disintegrating?

**Edit**: He loves our daughter very much. He is active in taking care of her when he is at home. He is more affectionate with her than with me, now. The baby was consensual; he actually brought up that it was a good time for me to get pregnant and we talked about it. I then kept him comprised of the status of my birth control and he knew full well when I was no longer on it.

**Edit 2**: Thank you everyone for your suggestions and kind words. I'll update as soon as there is something to update. In the meantime, we will be going to a counselor together next week (first available appointment) to talk about his part-time moving out. Last night was his first night at the condo. I did okay. Baby slept better than I did.

**tl;dr**: My husband has decided to confront deep-seated issues from his past by moving out on a part-time basis. I'm 6 weeks post-partum, devastated, and don't know how to cope.

Yes, I'm serious.  No, I can't believe it either!

Alright so fair warning - this is going to be a very, very long story because I'm going to lay it all out there - the entire relationship.  I'm going through hell right now and wanted to write about it since I know I won't be able to sleep tonight.  It's a completely fucked up story so it may be worth your while to read it.  I welcome any thoughts or advice, but that's not necessarily why I'm here.  I just need to type everything out and thought maybe someone would want to read it.  Also, this is a throwaway account.

**How We Met**

So I met a girl back in December.  She was a bay host for a large TopGolf location, and I got her number with no problems.  She was really into me, and I was kinda into her.  The very next night we hung out and had a few drinks, I took her back home with me, and you all know what happened next.  I've never been the type to pursue a one-night stand, but this girl was amazing.  Perhaps the ONS should have been my first red flag.  She was a blast to hang out with, extremely outgoing and personable, and oh my God she had one of the best bodies I'd ever seen.  She was/is a fitness competitor and fitness model and has been in a few fitness magazines.  The sex that night was pretty bad because it was awkward for her since it was a ONS, but that was the only bad sex we ever had.  Everything after that was unbelievably good.

**Growing Closer**

After that night we started going on dates.  She was living in a house with a guy that she called her brother who was really just someone that she grew up with that her family kind of adopted.  I always thought that was a little weird, but I'm a very trusting person so I thought nothing of it.  She was somewhat new to my city so I took her to all of my favorite restaurants and bars.  I introduced her to my friends and she introduced me to hers.  She would randomly show up at my place when she got off work to surprise me (about a 25 minute drive) and would often stay the night.  She was genuinely happy to see me and be around me.  I could tell that she was absolutely crazy about me.  I was very attracted to her and always treated her like a lady.  I'm without a doubt a one-woman type of guy, so I gave her all of my attention (or as much as I could while studying for the Texas bar exam).

**Confessions About Her Past**

During the first month of our dating relationship, she confessed a few things to me that I needed to know before we proceeded any further:

1. She had been married before.  She married a guy several years before that was busted in a testosterone drug ring bust.  FBI raided their house and everything.  I thought that was the reason she divorced him, but I later found out that he cheated on her 2 days into their marriage.

2. She had been arrested for felony theft almost 5 years prior and was on felony probation set to expire at the 5 year mark.  Her co-defendant was her jackass ex husband.

3. Her dad is now mentally retarded as a result of his rampant methamphetamine use.  Apparently she didn't even meet him until she was 10 years old or so.  She is his legal guardian.

4. She used to live with a boyfriend who turned out to be married with kids.  Apparently this guy had to travel a lot for his job.  Eventually his wife found out what was going on, traveled to the city where they had rented a house together, and caught them in bed sleeping.  My ex said she didn't know until that moment.

5. She briefly mentioned in passing to me early on that she was on her way to pick up some meds, but I didn't really ask what for.  I assumed the worst with bipolar disorder, and it turns out I was right.  I later found out she was diagnosed type II bipolar several years earlier.  She used to go to therapy, but no longer did.  To be honest, I didn't notice too many symptoms, but really I probably didn't know what to look for and overlooked what I did notice because this girl could do no wrong in my eyes.

As someone who was raised in a loving, nuclear family and with absolutely no criminal record, this was a challenge for me.  I struggled with it for a few days before telling her that none of it matters.  I promised her that I wouldn't judge her for her past - I would only judge her for what she does from that moment forward.  She appeared to be an amazing person, and I was already falling for her at this point.

**The Sex**

Oh God the sex.  I already mentioned the sex was good, but it only got better and better throughout the relationship.  So good that I wanted to talk about it again.  She was always down to get frisky with me, and I could get her off 7-8 times in a row when she could handle it.  I seriously doubt I'll ever have such great sex ever again.  Shit shit shit!!

**Falling in ""Love""**

So as time went on, I began to realize I was in love with this girl, but that wasn't until the end of April.  We both knew that we were dating, but it wasn't official yet.  I asked her to be my girlfriend at the beginning of May, and she exclaimed ""Finally!!""  She was happy and so was I, and all was perfect.  Soon I began to grow crazy about this girl.  She was absolutely perfect for me, and I knew I wanted her in my life forever.  Somewhere around the beginning of June, I told her that I loved her.  It was genuine, but she didn't say it back.  She joked that I waited to tell her after I already knew she felt the same way.  So basically she told me she loved me without saying ""I love you.""  That was okay with me.  I've been in enough relationships to know that I want it to come natural when she's ready.  The last thing I want is for her to say it and not mean it.  She did say, however, that she had made a personal decision not to tell someone she loves them unless she has decided they were the one she was going to marry.  Not sure why but yeah sure whatever.  She also told me that her therapist said she would never be able to be in a real relationship unless she fell in love with someone before having sex with them.  I always thought that was complete bullshit, but hey what do I know I'm not a therapist.

About a week later we went out of state for my cousin's wedding.  We had separate hotel rooms because I was staying with my cousin and brother, but I visited her every night to snuggle, have sex, talk, etc.  It was on this trip that she sat me down and, with tears in her eyes, told me that she loved me too.  It was completely heartfelt, and it made me cry too (I'm not a crier).  We had already talked a few times about what life would be like together, and this was validation that she seriously considered me to be marriage potential.

**The Rocky Road**

At about the same time, some issues began to arise in our relationship.  She lost her job due to a misunderstanding.  She was still living with her brother, and he was supporting her for the time being.  However, he was a complete asshole to her and they fought constantly.  In fact, he was such an asshole that she never wanted me to come over when he was there.  I met him twice, and he was nice to me at the time, but she didn't want it to get to a point where I had to stand up for her should the fight while I was there.

Anyway, she said that I changed when we started officially dating and began to smother her (i.e., kissing her when I felt like it, touching her, etc.).  It was all stuff she used to love and even initiate on her own.  But for whatever reason she just didn't like it anymore.  At the same time, she would often take her anger out on me.  She would occasionally want to argue just for the sake of it.  She also mentioned a few things that she disliked about my personality:  I'm somewhat arrogant and think I'm always right, I judge people a little bit too much, and I talk over people on occasion.  She was right.  She wasn't afraid to point out my flaws and I loved her for it.  So I sat her down and we promised to work on the issues that we each had.

**Things Start Falling Apart**

And then she began to grow distant, and this is where things get complicated.  While at my cousin's wedding, she got into an argument with her mother on the phone.  I don't remember the reason she told me they argued, but I definitely remember not believing her.  During that phone call, her mom basically disowned her, and my ex was distraught.  More on this later.  We began to get into more and more arguments, and we stopped having sex around the beginning of June.  The wedding was the last weekend we ever had sex.  I knew that she was extremely stressed and had a rough past with relationships, so I tried to be as understanding as I could.  She was trying to find a job, her mother cut her off, and she had been in a few abusive relationships in the past - one physical, a few emotional.  Fortunately for her, I'm an extremely understanding and patient person.

She asked for time and space, and I gave it to her as best as I could.  Keep in mind that I was still completely crazy about this girl.  I was considering asking her to move in with me and began to think about marriage as a real possibility.  I'll admit that asking her to move in would have been, at least in part, an band-aid of sorts as an attempt to bring us back together.  I know, I know, that's not how it works.  Even though I backed off quite a bit, we still hung out with about 2-3 times per week.  We would grab lunch together, take afternoon naps, take her dogs to the park, etc.  But she never would stay the night with me anymore.  Eventually she started working private poker games as a cocktail waitress, and that led to one particular man hiring her as his personal assistant of sorts for the games.  Basically, this guy had a lot of money and played poker up to 5 or 6 days a week.  As you can imagine, I was never okay with any of this.  It was a massive point of contention for me because I saw the whole thing for what it really was.  What scares me is that I think she saw it too.

Around the same time, she moved into another house with 2 other girls.  I helped her move and even built her closet for her at my own expense.  Once she was fully moved in at the end of June, she told me that she had been lying to me about something for a long time.  Her brother she had been living with wasn't really who she said he was.  He was her ex.  The married ex that had a wife and kids.  WTF right?!  I was in total disbelief.  She lied to me for nearly 7 months about who this guy was, and to this day I still have trouble imagining that he's not her brother.  She explained that she didn't really have a choice but she understood if I never wanted to talk to her again.  She didn't have the means to move out until the point she actually did move out.  She's hated the guy's guts since I first met her, they fought constantly, and she had always talked about wanting to move out.  So I empathized with her.  I knew she was struggling to get away from him and understood why she lied about it.  I wasn't okay with it by any means, but I loved her enough that I decided I wouldn't end the relationship over it.  We left two days later on a trip to a beautiful part of Colorado that I had planned for her a few months prior.

**The Poker Games**

Since she no longer had a job, she began to work these poker games up to 5 nights a week.  She moved into a house with 2 other girls and usually got home around 2:00am.  However, at times she got home as late as 8:30am on the weekends if the games went into the morning.  So we were no longer intimate, she wanted space, she no longer would stay the night with me, and some rich guy was paying her to help bring him drinks and give him neck rubs while he played poker.  Can you feel my insecurity?

I honestly believe that everything with this poker guy was strictly professional.  I mean he is a complete shit stain in my book seeing as how he's married but has a few girlfriends on the side and plays poker nearly non-stop.  However, I don't think he was paying her for sex or anything like that.  I knew that she was repulsed by the thought of sex with men that much older than her (he is in his late 40s).  Still, I began to grow insecure.  Actually, I began to grow suspicious.  I didn't think that she had cheated on me, but I can't even begin to explain the terrible thoughts that went through my head about what she could be out doing at these ""poker games"" while I was laying in bed.  Eventually I got to the point where I wanted to talk about what was wrong with our relationship.  We were clearly past the point where some aspects of the relationship were irreparable.  But she didn't want to talk about it.  I would ask and she would shut me down and tell me she didn't want to talk and to quit asking.  That wasn't a good enough answer so we'd fight and I'd leave.  But after every fight I'd eventually realize that I wasn't giving her the space she asked for, so I would apologize and reiterate that I loved her more than I even had the ability to explain.  But I still couldn't help but think that something else might be going on that she didn't want to talk about.

**My Breakdown**

During the past couple of weeks, I began to randomly drive by her house early in the morning to see if her car was there.  Sure, you say, ""But I thought you said you were trusting?""  I am, but I liken this to the old Russian proverb ""Trust but verify.""  I trusted her, but I'm not stupid enough to trust her completely when she's grown so distant and begun to act so shady.  I drove by maybe a total of 4 or 5 times and noticed that she would get home about 2 or 3 hours later than the times she would tell me the next day.

A few nights ago I'd had enough.  The guy that she worked the poker games for had picked her up earlier for a game.  I laid in bed and began to think that maybe he never dropped her back off at home, so I drove over to her place around 4:00am.  I waited down at the end of the street for about an hour to see what time this guy would actually drop her off.  You can probably tell now that my level of trust was dwindling, and I had become completely insecure with my relationship.  I got tired of waiting and did something incredibly stupid.  I knew she was staying with this guy and figured I might as well go ahead and call her to catch her doing it.  I called her and she answered.  I told her to come outside her house because I needed to talk to her about something imperative and it couldn't wait.  She resisted and hung up.  Knowing full well that I'd caught her sleeping at the guy's house, I called two more times until she answered and demanded that she come outside.  She resisted again, but maybe 15 seconds later she opened the front door.  Fuck!!  She came outside and I basically expressed to her that I feared she was cheating on my with this poker guy.  She absolutely flipped out on me (rightfully so) and told me to stay out of her life and never contact her again.

So a few days go by.  I texted her several times to explain that I was beyond words as I tried to express how sorry I was.  I made the biggest mistake of my life, and it was completely out of character.  I betrayed her and didn't deserve her, etc.  But she ignored me entirely for 2 days.  I then sent her one last text message on Sunday night reminding her that I forgave her for lying to me for 7 months about living with her ex while we were dating and that the least she could do was show the same forgiveness for my mistake.

**One More Night**

After sending that text, I laid in bed for a few hours trying to fall asleep.  I also prayed for a good 30 minutes or so.  I used to be pretty religious, but law school has a way of stealing all of your time, and I stopped going to church.  I'm still strong in my faith, but I know that I've been slipping away for far too long.  So I prayed a long prayer and had a heart-to-heart with God.  I apologized for wandering from Him and told him that even though I ultimately wanted his will for my life, I had to fix this mistake I had made first.  I confessed my love for her and prayed that she text or call me that night as I laid in bed.  About an hour later, she texted me and asked to come stay the night.  I knew my prayer had been answered, and I couldn't have been happier.  We cuddled, we kissed, and we were happy to be together again.  I dropped her off at her place on Monday morning and she began to prepare to start her new job on Tuesday (yesterday).  We texted all throughout the day on Monday, but she was short in most of her responses.  She started her new job yesterday, and I didn't talk to her until she responded to a few texts last night.  She told me she was busy and had a lot of stuff to do last night.

So fast forward a bit I'm laying in bed and I get the feeling that everything isn't going to get better as I had hoped.  God had answered my previous prayer, and I got what I asked for, so I thought it only right to ask for His will as it's what I ultimately want.  If she's the one for me, show me and I'll work hard as hell to give her the world.  If she's not the one, show me that too.  And if it turns out she's ever cheated on me or ever will, let me know so I won't waste my time.  And please let her call me as I lay here.  I haven't talked to her all day and am dying to ask her about her new job.

**She Wants to Be a Prostitute**

Sure enough, 3 minutes later she calls me, but I can tell she is upset.  We talk about a few of the things that are making her upset, including her recent financial problems, but it's not until later that she drops the atomic bomb on me.  She said, ""ThrowAway_02468, I'm going to be 100% honest with you because I don't know how else to say this.  I'm going to start sleeping with men for money starting on Friday.""  And there it was.  It was the single worst feeling I've ever felt in my entire life.  She insisted that she was dead set on doing it.  I offered to help her by giving her money or letting her live with me for a while or whatever else I could possibly do, but she didn't want any of it.  She had met a high-class prostitute a few nights before that was a friend-of-a-friend, and I guess this girl must have explained to her all of the positives without any of the negatives.

I still can't believe it as I'm typing this.  I'm in utter shock.  No fucking way am I letting this happen.  I used to work as an prosecution intern for one of the largest cities in the country.  I've taken a few prostitution cases to trial and I've investigated dozens more.  I've seen firsthand what happens when girls start down this road, and I absolutely wasn't going to let the happen to the girl that I love with all of my heart.  Granted, I'm done with her ass at this point.  This was the absolute last straw and is probably the worst thing I can think of that she could do to me.  I would much rather her cheat on me with someone she is attracted to even though I think that would have been unforgivable as well.

**The Confrontation**

So as I said, there's no way in hell I was going to let this happen.  After offering to help, I told her on the phone that I would never talk to her again if she did this to me.  She hung up on me.  I called back and texted, but she never replied.  I texted her that I was on my way and would bang on her door and wake her roommates up if I had to if she didn't come out to talk to me.  She swore to God that she would shoot me if I showed up (hmm felony probation violation for possession anyone?).  So of course like any normal person would I went to her house at 1:00 am.  I love this girl, and I will stop at nothing to keep her from ruining her life.

I must have called her 25 times while driving to her house.  She ignored every single one of them.  I had to say something to get her out of the house to talk to me, so I texted her and threatened to call her best friend from back home for help.  Her best friend is an angel and one of the sweetest people I've ever met.  That got her out of the house.  She asked to see my iPhone 5 to see my call log to see if I had actually called her friend.  Since I hadn't I gladly let her check, and after checking she proceeding to smash my phone on the ground twice.  She yelled at me to stay out of her life, etc.  Perhaps the most hurtful thing was her response when I said, ""You're going to pay for this phone.""  She said, ""That's fine.  I'll pay for it with the dick that's in me this weekend.""  Un-fucking-believable.

So that's pretty much it.  I flagged down a cop and made him follow me to her place to get a few of my things.  I am still in complete disbelief at all of this.  I was nothing but good to her.  Sure, we had our arguments, but I made sure she constantly knew that I was in love with her.  I supported her and stuck with her when she grew distant.  I wanted to marry this girl.  She was absolutely perfect for me.

**Going Forward**

At this point I'm considering going one of two routes:

1. File i) a claim in small claims court to recover the cost of my phone, my various other items in her possession, and my apartment key that I gave her and ii) requested a temporary restraining order (TRO) since she threatened to shoot me, has my apartment key, and threatened to take a baseball bat to my Tahoe.  God forbid she uses that key to enter my apartment with a gun.  If she does, she's dead.  I sleep with my carry weapon and wouldn't hesitate to use it in that instance.  The only problem is that I gave her that key, so I gave her permission to be there.  A TRO revokes that permission and would help me in the 0.001% chance that it actually came down to that, so I'm strongly considering it.

2. Do nothing and move on.  Buy a new phone, let her keep my stuff, and pay to have my apartment re-keyed.

Thoughts?  I'm going to get out of town for a few days to cool off.  Congratulations to whoever read all of this!!


**tl;dr**:  I completely fell in love with a girl that loved me back.  We had the perfect relationship for a couple of months.  She has a shitty family, has a history with bad relationships, was diagnosed type II bipolar years ago without showing many symptoms, and is struggling financially after losing her job.  She also lied to me for 7 months by telling me that her ex boyfriend she was living with while we dated was her brother.  But alas I forgave her because she hated his guts the entire time.  Things eventually began to fall apart as she grew distant, and I grew suspicious as she began to work private poker games late at night.  I stupidly accused her of cheating, and she completely flipped out and didn't respond to my texts or calls for a few days.  I apologized endlessly for what I considered to be the biggest mistake of my life, and she came to stay the night with me as if she was ready to work things out.  Out of the blue, she called me last night and said she was going to start sleeping with men for money.  I've done everything I can to stop it, but she's made up her mind.  I showed her nothing but unconditional love and support, and this is how she repays me.  I'm gutted.  Fuck her.


**Edit 4:30pm CST:**

Haha wow some of you guys really don't like me.  Awesome!  That means I have a lot of room for improvement.  Thank you for pointing it all out to me.  I'll admit that I have been somewhat controlling and narcissistic both in the relationship and when writing this story.  These are things that she has pointed out to me throughout the relationship and things that I have been working on.  Obviously I still have some work to do.

Yes, I know I seem like a creepy stalker.  What's funny is the fact that I felt like a creepy stalker the entire time.  I obviously did not completely trust her because of the fact that she was (1) working these poker games, (2) not wanting to talk about the problems in our relationship, and (3) not wanting to have sex or make out.  I became very insecure with the relationship and, as a result, became overbearing.  I had an unquenchable desire to know what was really going on.  Yes I was being controlling so far as that goes.  More on that in a couple of paragraphs.

I've known throughout this entire relationship that I was way in over my head merely because of the fact that I am not adequately equipped to handle someone who is bipolar.  I've never had any close bipolar friends or or family members, so this was kind of my first real taste.  I'm fairly confident that half of the problem is 1) my inability to understand why she does what she does, 2) 

Anyways, I know this is going to make me really unpopular with some of you, but I actually carried on a small text conversation with her a few hours ago.  It's kind of hard to do because she's at work.  DON'T WORRY, I'm not trying to work it out with her or anything like that.  I just wanted to know her reasoning for a couple of things.  For some reason, having answers to things gives me some kind of closure.  Yes, I know, that is controlling behavior, blah blah blah.  It's the kind of behavior that has likely driven her away from me because I want answers to everything.  Obviously I wasn't approaching this the correct way during the relationship.  But the way I see it, knowing 100% what is going on, regardless of how bad it may hurt, is better than being kept in the dark.  You may disagree, but that's just what sets my mind at ease.  Below are the basic points she made.  I'm not saying that I believe any of this.  I just wanted to present it to see what you all think.

1. She swears up and down that she is **NOT** going into prostitution.  ""Bullshit!"" you say?  Yeah I said that too.  Anyways she said that she was intoxicated.  In addition to that, in my opinion she absolutely had a manic episode last night and went completely bat shit crazy.  IF (big if) she is telling the truth now, then I suspect this is what happened:  she got tired of my shit for one reason or another (the things you all are pointing out) and was looking for a reason to piss me off and drive me away from her.  I don't know if she was trying to end the relationship or just get me to leave her alone.  She has a tendency to occasionally want to argue for the hell of it, so she does it with entirely unreasonable arguments and reasoning.  When that happens I tend not to realize what's going on until it's too late and I've already blown up the situation by trying to find some logic in her irrational reasoning.  Hint: There isn't any!  I'm just going to blame that one on being a lawyer.  The prostitution thing was completely out of the blue, and this explanation is MUCH more in line with what I've come to expect from her.  We've only had 2 or 3 of these types of arguments, but nowhere near this scale.  This was by far the worst episode she has ever exhibited.

2. She says she has never cheated on me.  She says this in the same text message where she says she loves me but wants nothing to do with me after all of this.  So she doesn't want to get back together.  In my mind, this is where she would tell me, if ever, that she cheated on me.  Maybe not, but she has nothing to lose by telling me if she wants nothing to do with me now.  Believe it or not, I'm inclined to believe her on this point.  And for those of you saying she was banging her ex (brother guy), that is not the case.  She absolutely hates the guy and has ever since I've known her.  Every now and then they'll have a very short time period where they get along, but 95% of the time it's volatile.  It's a weird situation, I know.  She got into a position where she was unable to move out and ended up relying on him after losing her job.  My city is not very dog friendly, and almost no one would rent her a house because of her 125 lb. Rottweiler.  When she did find a place, it was ridiculously outside the range of what she could afford.  In a sense she really was stuck.  However, if I had known about it from the beginning, I would have peaced the hell out.  Perhaps I should have peaced out when she eventually told me about the arrangement, but my knowledge of her situation their animosity toward each other was actually comforting for me.  This may not make any sense to you guys, but she seriously fucking hates the guy.

3. She says that I am the biggest source of stress in her life and that I push too much.  Now this I can concede to.  I chalk this up to me not knowing how the hell to handle things when the intimacy stops.  My reaction was to push to find out why.  I just had to know.

**My Question(s):**  This is for all you assholes getting on to me about not asking a question. :)  What do you think about all of these new developments?  Do you believe them *objectively*?  Why or why not?  And for those of you that know, to what extent do you think her BPD has to do with #1 as I suspect?  I haven't had as much experience with this as some of you.


Sooo it appears things have taken somewhat of an anticlimactic turn.  I apologize to all of the soap opera fans.  Maybe she's not really considering being a hooker.  It seemed out of character for her in the first place (yes, even though she was a poker cocktail waitress).  Maybe she's just tired of me pushing her too much and maybe alcohol + manic episodes + my dumb ass = nuclear bomb.  There is a lot more that I have to say, but I've forgotten a lot of it.  I'll be back with another edit later if anyone cares.  Not that you should.

So we broke up as in words she had severe depression and it wasn't fair to me to stay together, she felt she was being a burden, I didn't deserve her etc.

That was a couple of weeks ago, yesterday we got to talking and I pressed the issue as I didn't feel like I had been told the whole story - ""did you cheat?""

**Of course she did,** but not on holiday with this guy and not recently. 6 months ago she fucked a guy she used to work with, three times over the course of a month. Around about the time her depression became apparent and things got more difficult for us. Not hard to see the cause and effect in that one.

I don't even know if there's a moral to this story.. if something looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck, no matter how much you wish it wasn't.

Basically, it's a fantasy of his for me to have sex with another guy and he really wants me to do it, but I don't want to. For me, once I'm in a relationship that's it, that's the only guy I have any interest in having sex with while I'm in that relationship. I have never had a ""wandering eye"" or anything like that, it's just not who I am.

I told him that, but he keeps pressing the issue. It doesn't happen too often but every week or two he'll bring it up again and try to convince me to do it. He keeps reiterating that it wouldn't be cheating since he was giving his permission, that he wouldn't be mad or jealous at all that I was doing it with another guy, and that it would make him happy. He's really focused on the idea that I don't want to do it because I think I'd be betraying him, but that's not it. I just don't want to do it.

I've been trying to watch my tongue around him lately because if I'm watching one of my shows and comment on the attractiveness of a celebrity or make a joke about wanting to make out with them or something, it'll start up this whole debate again because he thinks I'm serious, but that's not even true either. I might say ""oh that actor is so hot, I would do him in a second,"" but I wouldn't *actually* want to do it. My boyfriend doesn't realize that though and takes it as proof that I actually want to do it with other guys deep down.

I really wish this whole mess would just go away. I feel bad for my boyfriend for having a fantasy that he won't be able to fulfill with me, but our sex life is pretty good otherwise. It's not like he's only able to get off on this one thing and he'll be completely unsatisfied without it. 

Another thing is, if he had mentioned it once and then let it go then I wouldn't have had a problem with it, but after bringing it up again and again it's actually stated to upset me that he wants this in the first place. I am a good girlfriend. He never, ever has to worry about getting cheated on and he's acting like that's a *bad* thing. Sex is important to me, not just physically but emotionally, and he wants me to just give it away to someone else.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend wants me to have sex with someone else to fulfill a fantasy of his but I don't want to, and he won't let it go.

**UPDATE**

I talked to my boyfriend after he got home from work and things actually went better than expected. I told him that I did not under any circumstance want to have sex with another man because I didn't have any desire to do so and never would. I told him it was very hurtful to me that he would keep pressing me to do something that I clearly didn't want to do, and I pointed out that if he acted jealous over me just mentioning a TV actor then would he really not get jealous at all if I had sex with another person in front of him? He insisted that he wouldn't get jealous, but he apologized for being so insistent about it.

After talking about it for a little while, he admitted that he felt ashamed for having the fantasy in the first place, and he felt like he really needed me to want it too so that he would feel validated and not so crappy and alone. I had never considered that before, so I asked him if he knew anyone else who had his same fantasy and he said no, and I asked if he knew what the word for it was and he said no. So I told him that I had done a little research on it and found out that it's a thing with a name that a lot of people like, and that seemed to comfort him a little, although he also asked some questions after that implying that maybe since I had done research on it I would be more inclined to try it. I told him again firmly that I am not going to do it and said to stop trying to twist things around so that I sound like I will do it because that's manipulative and it makes me feel shitty.

I was planning to tell him to never talk to me about it again, but I didn't know that he was ashamed of it and I didn't want to close that door on him, knowing that, and make him feel worse, so I told him that I loved him no matter what and I'd try to be there for him, but I couldn't be there for him if he kept trying to get me to try it or thinking that there was a chance of me trying it, so that needed to stop. Then the conversation was getting a little intense so we took a bit of a break; he made some food and I went on Reddit for a little while.

And then when we had cooled our heads a bit I asked him if he maybe had any other fantasies that would make him feel something like what he wanted from the cuckold thing that just involved him and me. He said there were a couple things he wanted to try but was too afraid/ashamed to ask, and I asked what they were. They were kind of unusual compared to what our current sex life is, but they didn't involve any other people and they didn't seem like anything that would make me feel uncomfortable. So I told him I would try some of it with him and see if we couldn't find something special that we can do together that we'll both enjoy. He was kind of embarrassed about the whole thing still, but he said he was truly sorry for being so pushy and that he didn't want to push me away. 

So that's pretty much where we stand right now. I will look up subreddits later this week for some of the new stuff he wants to try (basically me being really assertive and pretending to be mean to him, in case anyone knows where I can find that?) But I'm pretty emotionally exhausted and things are still a little tense and apprehensive between me and him, so I'm just going to try and relax for now and let things settle down a little. I'm going to keep an eye out for him being pushy about cuckolding thing, but I am actually pretty sure that we can work this out? I'm holding out hope at least that I'll like this new stuff and he'll like it just as much and it'll make the cuckolding not feel so critical to his satisfaction with our sex life. So yeah, that's basically the gist of it. I will post another update when something new happens but for now I appreciate all the advice that you guys gave me.

",ICANUSECAPSLOCK,343,77,370,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q8sha/my_fiancee_is_going_through_a_lot_right_now_but/,"Completely unacceptable isn't exactly accurate, as it's much worse. I just couldn't think of a better way to phrase it. I'm using a throw away because I'd rather not have this attached to my main account.

I (25) and my fiancee (26) have been together for 8 years. We've had a fantastic and healthy relationship; communication has been easy and we're crazy about each other. Our wedding is 6 months away.

My fiancee's father is currently in the hospital, and the doctors think he has about a week to live. She is close to her father, so needless to say, she is having a tough time. I've tried to be there for her, and I've done everything I can, but I'm terrible with emotional stuff. 

We scrounged together enough money to go to her parent's house. We're currently staying there along with her brother, whom she is very close with also, and his wife. It's an enormous house, so there's plenty of room.

Last night, she was crying because her father won't be there to see her get married. During this, my fiancee's brother and his wife started yelling and screaming at each other. I was going to go get up and tell them to shut up, but my fiancee told me not to. Not too long later, I heard some banging noises and more screaming from the wife. My fiancee again told me to just ignore it, but I got up to go see what was going on. 

He was beating his wife. It was quite savage, too. She had blood smeared all across her face, a desk and chair were shattered on the floor, and and she was curled up in a corner. I ran in and pulled him off of her and tried to see how much medical attention she needed. The husband didn't like this too much, so he and I started yelling at each other, at which point my fiancee runs in and tries to separate us. He then threw the first punch and I proceeded to whup his ass, but I cut up my hand badly in the process. 

My fiancee's brother gets up and my fiancee follows him to wherever he went. I try to call the police, but my fiancee's sister in law tells me not to, because he is on probation. Against my better judgement, I don't call. I wrap up my hand and make sure she's okay (she wasn't too injured. A few bruises and bloody nose, but nothing major.)

My fiancee then comes back in and yells at ME. She told me I was a shitty person for attacking her brother and abandoning her and how she never wants to see me again. She runs and throws everything I had in the house outside (my suitcase, phone, laptop bag, wallet, and keys). I tell her to calm down, but she literally pushes me outside. I'm not going to fight with her at this point, so I leave and go stay at a hotel.

She hasn't answered any calls since. What the fuck happened? She has never acted this crazy before. I know she's going through a lot now, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. I know we're almost certainly going to break up over this, and certainly if she doesn't talk to me soon. How do we go about breaking up? Both of our names are on the lease of our apartment. I can afford the entire thing by myself, she can't even afford her half by herself. Am I wrong for thinking about canceling her return ticket? Her sister in law isn't answering any calls either, nor is her mother. Am I being too extreme with anything?

tl;dr: My fiancee kicked me out for getting into a fight with her brother.

1330100258.0,268,self.relationships,q46q2,UPDATE: Boyfriend actually *did* rape someone.,neologismo,348,80,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q46q2/update_boyfriend_actually_did_rape_someone/,"Original thread: http://redd.it/q1noh

Well, this is awkward. It's kind of interesting that one of the first things I feel the need to do is tell the internet about this, but I think it'll be a good way to start to process some shit. People that research traumatic experiences say that one of the most important things that you can do to process information is to write down everything that happens as soon as you can, without censoring anything. So, here we go. 

Just a brief summary, I heard thru Roommate who heard from a Mutual Anonymous Friend who heard from a friend that my boyfriend raped at least one person and had a pattern of being really aggressive to ex-girlfriends and their new boyfriends. Sounds like hearsay right? And I guess it technically is. Reddit agreed with me. 

The new stuff:

I get an email, forwarded to me by Roommate, who I guess got it from either the source or someone else, that detailed exactly what happened re: the alleged rape. It was incredibly detailed, and featured some things that were clearly true and about my boyfriend (like scars that he has, etc) so I knew it wasn't just a rumor anymore. So I confronted my boyfriend, and he admitted that he did it, and it happened about 5 years ago.

So, here are the facts.

1) I was told in a really drama-laden way that my boyfriend raped someone.

2) He denied it.

3) I made a reddit thread asking what people thought, and most people thought that it sounded like a nasty rumor. I was just going to shrug it off and move on. 

4) The girl then emailed either my Roommate or Mutual Anonymous friend, and the gist of what it said was he raped her. It wasn't like it was an ambiguous thing that happened when they were both drunk, either. I'm not going to post anymore info about it just because of the possibility that someone could find this thread and put two and two together. It's more about protecting her identity than leaving out useful info for you guys. I'm sure you understand. EDIT: I forgot to add that the email alleges that the ex-girlfriend heard he also had raped someone else (also a long time ago), so take that for what it is. ALSO ANOTHER EDIT: Since I without really thinking posted some details about the situation down there a lot of people have gotten confused about it all, so I will just give the briefest summary of the rape: They had a fight, they made up, he wanted to have make-up sex, she didn't, but he had sex with her anyway, she was shocked and was even considering ""did I just get raped??"" before realizing, yes, she definitely got raped, broke up with him, he stalked her some or at least made her feel uncomfortable, kinda ambiguous but whatever, she moved out of our city after one interaction where he stared her down

5) I confronted him, and he admitted it. I asked him why he didn't just tell me about it from the beginning. He said he thought they had ""worked it out"" and there were other holes in the story. She never pressed charges or anything, but she did say in the story that he continued to harass her and her new boyfriends (they were dating for about a month when he raped her) which he denies. 

So, that pretty much did it for me. I drove him home and got him to get his stuff out of my car, etc. I did tell him that in his next relationship, he should be honest about it with her so that she doesn't have to find out this way. I guess I'm kind of in shock right now, but you know that ambiguous feeling that's at the end of relationships, that ""did I do the right thing?"" Yeah, I don't really have that feeling. I feel pretty certain I did do the right thing. I'm looking forward to just getting on with my life without him in it.

**EDIT: Since this is probably relevant information, looking back at our relationship I DO see things that could make me suspect he's less than 100% a healthy person. I don't want to go into those SO much because they're pretty personal and would be readily identifiable, but suffice it to say that, after discussing it with friends I realize the warning signs were there. There was never anything that in itself was so inexcusable, it was just a pattern of things that, taken together, I should have noticed, but I was too busy being a dumbass/in love/whatever. It's more like a pattern of thinking that perhaps he is owed something, or that he is entitled to things he really isn't, or that he needs to get his way all the time. But don't get me wrong, he's also VERY sweet and loving a lot of the time. Also I'm 100% sure he's reading this thread, so I'm gonna try to keep the anonymity to a maximum but want to send him a loud, clear, but indirect message, because I don't want to contact him but HEY YOU : DO NOT CONTACT ME, MY ROOMMATE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON INVOLVED. CONTACTING ME WILL RESULT IN ME CONTACTING POLICE.**

**TL;DR: Sometimes people aren't who you think they are, and there's no way you could have predicted the extent. There are some important things that no matter what are out of your control.  Realize that even your gut could be wrong, sometimes.**

*FINAL EDIT: Just wanted to say a huge thank you to all the people who were so supportive of my decision and said such kind words to me in this thread and through messages. I tried to thank everyone personally, but just in case I didn't, please know this: You may not realize it, but the things you said really made me feel better about what I think is the most painful relationship situation I've ever been through. It called so many things into doubt for me, but the worst was my own judgment. Thanks for taking the time to type a few comforting words. It really made a difference in this anonymous internet woman's life. I realize that he will likely never apologize (or even acknowledge how horrible his actions were) to me, her, or any of the other women he harmed, so I will have to find closure on my own. I don't know what kind of turmoil, if any, he's going through. However, I know that my IRL relationships with my friends and parents have been deepened through this, and he will be alone with his selfishness for the rest of his life, so there is some minor sort of justice that has been served. So many people have stepped up unexpectedly to voice support that it has prevented me from losing faith in humanity over this bullshit. I hope that one day I might come to view this as some sort of positive, formative life experience.

1361640570.0,266,self.relationships,19347a,[14M] My family and I have been going through hell because of my 7 year old brother. Some advice on how to handle him would be incredibly helpful.,Throwaway1293213,336,70,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19347a/14m_my_family_and_i_have_been_going_through_hell/,"I don't know if this is the right sub, but this is the only one that seems like I could ask this kind of question on. If there is a more relevant subreddit or website, please link me to it.

Before you disregard this because I'm 14 years old, please hear me out. This has been going on for a few years now, and my parents, who are 49 and 54, are at their wit's end.

Here's some back story. We used to live in a house, but it was foreclosed due to the bills not being paid on time. We moved to a ""town home"" It has 2 stories, and is one of the lower-end places to live in. It's the best my parents can do at the moment. We moved when he was around 5, so I'm not sure if he remembers it at all, or if this is affecting him in some way. He is very smart, and is about to go into the magnet school that I'm currently attending. My dad has been in and out of work, and was laid off about a year ago, and recently found a job about 3 months ago. He has to go on business trips often, and they usually last for about a week or so. He works in TV, so there isn't very much income through that. 

My mother is a stay at home worker, and she makes crafts such as dolls and doll clothes and sells them on etsy and ebay. She has been doing this for years, because of my brother being so young and the fact that she can't work because of his age. 

My brother has been screaming at us since he was 3 years old. He has had multiple problems with doing things that normal children should have stopped doing years ago, such as being potty trained. At first me and my parents thought he was just slow. He is now 7, and still soils himself a few times a week. If this is some kind of indicator for how he is acting, it would be a great help. He is incredibly smart, and is going to go into a magnet school that I currently attend. He is sweet, but he can switch emotions on a dime.

The way he is acting is terrible. He plays video games for hours a day, and if he is deprived of them, he screams about it non stop. Many of you will say this is the problem, but trust me, that's not all. If anything doesn't go his way, he screams about it. It doesn't seem like much of a problem, but it's the fact that he won't back down. Nothing my parents do seems to work, if he is yelled at, he yells back. He thinks that everyone has to be treated equally, which is true to some extent. But the problem is that he thinks that whatever we do he is allowed to do as well. 

He only acts like this at home. At school, he has problems following social queues, and he is very loud-mouthed. He speaks his mind at all times, and sometimes it ends up being disrespectful. 

We would try to get him some psychiatric help, but money is tight. I have to be on medicine for my ADD, and my brother refuses to brush his teeth and has to have six teeth pulled. There just isn't enough money to go around.

My mom cries a lot when my brother screams at her. She used to be bullied as a child, and she said that she used to let it get to her. She's picked up smoking lately, and I'm worried about her. I'm afraid she might do something drastic. Any and all advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr: My 7 year old brother is seperating my family with how he acts, I'm afraid for his future if he doesn't get some kind of help. Advice would be appreciated.

**EDIT: I talked to my mom, and she agreed to get some kind of counseling for my brother through his school. Thanks for all of the help, guys! Each and every one of you contributed, and for that I thank you.**

Raise your hand if you ever find yourself profoundly aggravated with your significant other for no particular reason.,SluttyShroudOfTurin,322,54,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/smftl/all_right_raise_your_hand_if_you_ever_find/,"I'm really just looking for confirmation that other folks have these days too.  I'm 26/F, he's 27/M.  And this weekend, every single thing he did aggravated the piss out of me.  Didn't do anything out of the ordinary, I didn't really have any reason to be annoyed, I just *was*.

For example.  Yesterday morning, I wake up and he's pulling his work clothes out of his ""clean clothes pile"" on the floor and looking like he's slept in them for a week.  Instead of just shaking my head and ignoring it as pre usual, it really aggravated me.  I mean come on.  Is it that much trouble to take your clothes out of the dryer when they're done and hang them the fuck up?  You're a grown-ass person.  

If I stand back objectively, I totally recognize that this (and other similar issues) are probably the source of my frustration.  Aggravation at a lack of perceived maturity/ability to take care of yourself/lack of care in regards to maintaining a professional work appearance.  Feeling embarassed *for* him, because I know he'll probably be judged by his coworkers and clients for the unprofessional appearance, and I know he's better than that.  Sort of a ""don't you judge him, you don't know him!"" feeling regarding others and a, ""don't you do that, don't you know that affects your professionalism?"" feeling towards him. 

//End of armchair psych assessment.  

Yeah, I know.  Communication is key and all that jazz.  And he and I have fantastic communication in general.  And he is a wonderful, *wonderful* man.  I recognize that.  He is good to me, and we're great together, and love the hell out of each other.  Things like today's aggravation I tend not to bring up because I feel it's way more my issue than it is anything on his end.  But there's still the problem of actually feeling annoyed towards him, and aggravated with his actions - even though they're pretty much the same as they always are.  They just happen to be pissing me off today.

What the heck do y'all do when you're having one of those days?  Say, ""Honey, I love you, but you're pissing me right the hell off today.""?  Just roll with it?  I ended up just giving him a heads up that I was in a shitty mood, and apologized if I was taking it out on him in any way, shape, or form.  But there's still this weird, transient aggravation bouncing around in the back of my brain, and I'm just not sure what to do with it.

Don't know how to deal with my family on this!,throwaway42713,339,76,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d7sg0/my20_sisters23_husband25_is_a_creep_dont_know_how/,"This story is quite a lot, so bare with me. Sorry if I make any grammar/formatting mistakes.

So my sister is in the military. She has been in the military for almost three years now. She met her now husband  in the military as well. They have a one year old daughter together, as well as one on the way.

So my problems with him are:
-He's a pervert, he will comment on mutual friends pictures saying things like he wishes to drink their bathwater, the things he wants to do to them- etc. And no, these aren't private messages, these are comments that everyone can see. My sister has been dealing with self esteem issues because of this. He sees nothing wrong with what he does. 

-He was kicked out the military due to a DUI, and has totaled two cars. Him and my niece now live with my mother while my sister is overseas for a year. 

-He's a pervert. Last weekend, I was at my mothers house. My phone was pretty much dying, but I had promised my niece and sister I'd take them for a walk. He was the only one who was in the house, and before leaving he asked if I wanted to take my phone with me, and I said no, it needs to charge. I don't lock my phone, because I'm never in a situation where it NEEDS to be locked. When I came back to the house, my gallery was opened, and in my sent emails, he emailed a picture of myself to hisself (I never have had his email prior to this).

There are other issues but these are the main ones. My mother wanted me to drive him to the airport with her the other day, and I just had to make an excuse why I wouldn't accompany her.

How am I supposed to deal with my family on this? I do not feel comfortable around him at all, and I also have a younger sister (13) who feels uncomfortable *(not in a perverted way, fortunately, she just doesn't like him)* around him as well, and he lives in their house! I don't want to cause strain on my family, but this man isn't good for my sister at all and I just don't know what to do or say.

I don't care if this seems unethical or whatever, but I wanted to fully know what was going on and stop being made a fool of.

I had her over at my apartment and while she was taking a shower, and I decided to snoop through her computer and email. I basically found out that 4 weeks ago she had one of her tumblr ""customers"" fly out to her (from Georgia to New York), and take her to some anime convention and stay at his hotel the entire time. She had originally told me that she was with her parents in upstate NY.

I really didn't need to see anymore. As soon as she came out of the shower and laid on my couch I told her I really don't think I trust her anymore and don't want to see her anymore, she left and hasn't spoken a word to me since then, which I'm pretty thankful for.

Good riddance.

I did not expect to get so many and varied responses to my problem. It seems that many people and many relationships have a difficult time balancing how much involvement family has. I learned a lot about the other side of the issue, and that helped me in solving it.

My wife and I spoke last night, and it went well. 

**Near term:** we compromised, we're going to the cottage but coming back in time to go to Thanksgiving dinner on Sunday. 

**Long Term:** I'm going to take the pressure off of her attending family events. School is stressful, her life is stressful, and that will be her #1 priority. On her side, she will make an honest effort to see my side of the family. We will both make an effort to understand the importance of those close to us: I will try and view her close friends as her family, and she will try and understand that my family means as much to me as her close friends do to her. (ie. her old roomate coming to town for 1 night only is important. My uncle coming to town for one night only is also important. Overly simplistic, but that's the idea.)

I'm also going to set the expectation with my family that she's going to be busy, and they won't see her much. It's not about them, not up to them, and not up for debate. I am going to go to more functions alone, and she's going to be supportive of that.

**Longer Term:** we discussed a rotating holiday schedule, both agree in principal it makes sense, but we tabled it for another time.

**Note:** I want to say how much the comments helped me. Reading how strongly people feel about this issue gave me a new respect for the gravity of it. It was much easier to be understanding, as I had spent the whole day reading, thinking and empathising about it.

I thought this was pretty good for 6 months into a relationship. It's almost 2pm and he hasn't said a word. We work for the same company and sit at the same lunch table. Not a peep. I am sad, but it is nice to get texts from my friends wishing me well today at least. He even had asked me about my birthday last week. What would you guys do?

Edit: I texted him saying, ""Forget something?"" and he said ""Your birthday? No.""
Then 5 minutes later he said Happy Birthday and said I can come over because he'll make me pasta and get some wine. I suppose that'll do, pig. That'll do.

Edit: So I went over there last night, was greeted with multiple kisses and hugs and he told me he wanted to say Happy Birthday in person. Then he made me a Manhattan and told me to go play some Skyrim and relax while he cooked. (I have a mild obsession with Skyrim). So I put my feet up and enjoyed my birthday drink. Then he served me dinner and opened a bottle of wine, and he said ""I know it's not the best birthday, but I promise you I'm trying."" Then he toasted a happy birthday and said ""to the best girlfriend I've ever had"". Then we spent the rest of the night watching BSG and cuddling. It ended up being pretty late and we were a bit drunk on the wine so we went to bed sans sexy times, but that's okay by me, I love sleep more than I can explain. And that is that.

But when she's out with others, like at a work function, she can't take the time to reply to my texts. I tried to ask her why it's okay to do it to me, but not okay to do it with others *for* me and she says there's a huge difference between checking your social networks and texting. I don't think there's a significant difference because the bottom line is: you're on your phone and it's disrespectful. 


Then we reach a point in the argument where she just goes ""Fine, I'll just throw away my phone when I'm with you."" and we can't talk anymore. What am I supposed to do when she won't communicate with me to try to come to some sort of agreement?? 

To clarify: I would like her to not be on her phone when she's with ANYONE as I feel it is disrespectful to the other party. But since she's so adamant about it, she could at least answer me, even a quick ""important dinner. might not be able to respond"".

I have yet to call him on it. It's something he's always done. We have been on and off for the past 9 months and he use to say it to me on occasion but not since we have been back together this time (about 3 months).


Is this something I have a right to be upset over if he has always said this to her?

I know if I say something it could lead to a big fight. I KNOW he will get defensive and be pissy about it.




**Update:** I confronted him about it. I told him that I thought she was trying to cause problems but if he is doing it that it's inconsiderate to me and to her fiancé who is suppose to be his friend. 



His first response was simply ""ok"". This made me even more upset and I replied ""is that all you have to say?"" His response... ""I don't know what to say. I'm not saying it isn't wrong but I just never thought it would be an issue."" Me.... ""Why, because you didn't think I'd find out?."" Which he ignored. Me again....

First, Not that its really relevant but because I would never act on it but the age of  consent in my state in 16, and they were not nude pictures but most certainly inappropriate and with a purpose.

Second, I'm sorry to the poly people I may have offended Ive had bad experiences and a bias opinion of them.

OK so I told my girlfriend everything when she got home. I love her to death, but her reaction was absolute hilarity to this, hence her the encouragement I mentioned by her family. I'm almost in tears telling her this and she is in tears laughing. I was a little upset about this but we did, eventually come up with a plan. She will take care of this, delicately. 

As I understand I am to pretend that I never received them and would have seen and deleted the text and pictures before I had ever seen them. I'm comfortable with this being the least embarrassing solution for both Sally and I. I'm uncomfortable with the idea that I have to look at her as I always have... as if this never happened. I suppose that the trials and tribulations of being an adult. Right?

I suppose I will provide another update after we talk to her whenever that may be. So that's were we sit...

I saw one message from that girl about 7 months ago, but he (M23) told me that it didn't mean anything, I was the one for him and I was being paranoid thinking that it's more than just a message. I found his old phone when he wasn't home, his messenger conversations from approximately a month ago was still there, with the same girl.

 He told her how much she makes him feel happier than ever, how much she makes him hard and how he likes to caress himself thinking about her tight pussy and so on, after that they start having sort of cyber sex. All this time this guy was telling me I was being paranoid thinking that he had something with someone else. He made me feel like I am being obsessed. The worst thing is he was telling her like ""oh I wish we could go back to 8 months ago when everything was so good between us."" apparently ""they broke up"" in between that's why. Ah also apparently they never met, they have been only talking through the internet but he assures in one of his messages that he will come visit her this summer for sure.

I am originally from the USA and I moved to Sweden to be with this guy. We had met in the USA when he came as an exchange student, after that kept contact and decided to be together. Now I am here, in Sweden, with no one to turn to and I am broke.
I had so big hopes with this guy, he was the first one I ever felt this much in love with, and he made me happiest ever. (once upon a time)

I really don't know what to do, I don't understand if he is that much in love with her why he kept lying to me? It's not forbidden to break up with someone if you don't want them anymore. But he kept swearing that he had nothing, I was the only one... and BAM. Found the messages.
Why would he do this? I seriously don't understand. And now I don't have any idea what to do, I can't stay in the same house with him anymore. Although there is a part of me, still madly in love with this guy and ""hoping"" he will notice his mistakes and return to me and beg for forgiveness..

She had a really friendly bond with me all through college when I'd come home on breaks and see them together, and that was getting increasingly flirtatious and teasing with me.

I don't even remember doing it with her it was on summer break and we were both drinking casually and my father was out for the night. They went on vacation a couple weeks later and it was never brought up or discussed (thank god). Now they're planning to get married he is really happy she is pregnant. I am praying to god that baby isn't mine, but the time lines up exactly right. I didn't even know it was possible at her age. She hasn't talked to me about it at all, except seeming a little nervous and I'm afraid to even bring it up. I want to pretend it didn't happen, for the past four weeks since they told me, I just have been silencing the voice in my head that we did not use protection. I feel so ashamed about this and hate myself. I haven't told a single soul this and I don't know what to do.

TLDR: I am 90 % sure that I caused her to get pregnant and my father is going to marry her soon. I am too ashamed to even talk to her about what we did, let alone try to talk to her about getting an abortion.

UPDATE: I went to his house while he was at work to speak to her. I made it clear that I want her to have an abortion if what I think is happening, is. She acted like she had no idea what the hell I was talking about. Then she said she knows I made a move on her but that she didn't allow it to progress beyond me just trying to kiss her. She said I should be very grateful to her she didn't tell my father that *I* tried to have sex with her, and I should stop getting ideas in my head. Problem is, I know she is lying because I do have the memory of being on top of her and orgasming inside her, and it is hazy which one of us initiated it. Her reaction has really messed with my head. I honestly don't know if she is knowingly lying or if she is in denial or doesn't remember, and her tone was like I tried to force myself on her. If it blew up, I do not want her telling people I forced myself on her all because she may or may not remember, because that is a whole other territory, and now I am thinking this was my signal to just leave this all alone.

Why does this bother men?,likessexalot,356,97,862,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rsojp/slept_with_80_men_am_i_unlovable_why_does_this/,"I'm a 30 year old female, and I've lost count of the number of partners I've had, but I'm guessing it's around 80. I'm attractive, I've always really enjoyed sex, and it has always been easy for me to reach orgasm, but I was also very naive when I was younger. I don't have any STDs.

I've always been honest with my partners about the number of men I've slept with. However, in my last two long-term relationships, they were really bothered that I had had so many partners, and it was frequently a source of tension. I'm now in a new relationship, and we haven't discussed numbers. I'm considering just outright lying to him, saying it's something around 30. It makes me both sad and frustrated that I need to lie about my past and who I am in order for a man to accept me. If I tell him the real number, and he thinks less of me, I can't take it back. 

It seems like a ridiculous catch-22: men want their partners to revel in sex and to be unashamed of their bodies and desires, but that is something that only comes with experience. Sure, honesty is noble and good, but, let's be realistic: double-standards for men and women are very well-ingrained in people, and women are still tacitly judged by their sexuality. If everything else about him and the relationship is wonderful, maybe I should just accept this one bit of hypocrisy about gender.

I'm also curious why men prefer women with very few partners to women with many partners, assuming both are STD-free. I'm looking for subjective experiences, not biological or evolutionary explanations.

TL;DR If a girl has slept with 80 men, do you think less of her, is this unacceptable/unlovable, and what is your subjective reasoning for your answer?

EDIT: Thank you all for the really thoughtful replies. To answer some comments, yes, most of my partners were one night stands or ""boyfriends for the weekend"", but 15 were relationships that each lasted at least 5 months. [forthelulzac](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rsojp/slept_with_80_men_am_i_unlovable_why_does_this/c48j2ld) brought up the point that the fact that I've chosen to be in a relationship with someone should make him feel special, which is somewhat my feeling on the issue. While I was very naive when I was younger, I've since become extremely picky, with a laundry list of ""must-haves"". I make it very apparent to my new boyfriend that he's one in a million because he meets everything on my laundry list, including that it is the best sex of my life (it is). I was similarly adoring and very satisfied in my previous two relationships.

EDIT: I started when I was 13, with my first boyfriend, so this number is over the course of 17 years. 80 is a complete guess, based on the amount of time I've spent in monogamous relationships, and the frequency of one-night stands, over a 17 year period. The actual number is probably lower, since I had far fewer one-night stands as I got older.

I didn't know my sister was on it and I would have started dialing had I of not heard her boyfriend screaming at her. He was saying things like, ""If you don't talk to me, I'll snap your neck,"" or ""Don't think I won't beat the shit out of you again,"" etc etc etc. 

I know I should have hung up. Something. But I didn't. I listened for about 10 minutes before I couldn't take it anymore and slammed the phone down. She heard this and about five minutes later was in my room yelling at me for spying on her and that I can't tell our parents.

Hey guys, I just thought I'd bring a bit of a resolution to this. Before I begin, I'd like to say an immense thank-you to all of you for your advice. You brought the clarity I needed in a tough situation. Now, onto the update!

Unfortunately (for me, at least) this story doesn't have the happy ending that I would've wanted, but this past week I finally had a mature and adult conversation with my girlfriend about our situation. We agreed to meet in a neutral location, and it was about then I knew what was going to happen.

I asked her to be honest with me and told her I wouldn't get upset. She seemed to be pretty cut up about it but did confirm that she felt like she had been deceiving me for a few months now. She told me that she'll always be there if I needed it, but she wanted to move on. I took this all on the chin to be honest, it only confirmed what I had suspected for a few months now. We both came to the conclusion that our LDR had become untenable and that to continue would hurt us both in the long run.

I should have left, but my curiosity was piqued. I asked her just when she made up her mind. She confessed that she had declared her feelings for Rob a week or so before, and that he had demanded she tell me ""for my sake"" - turns out he's actually not that much of a bad guy, really. She also confessed that there had been times before this incident when she had almost crossed a boundary, including near-initiations of make-out sessions and active attempts to hold his hand in public that she then (in an obvious manner) reconsidered.

I haven't really spoken to her since, but I feel okay - I feel like my ex-girlfriend has found true love and I'm optimistic that I will find the same soon. I'm just happy that this is all over and I can get myself back out there. My ""someone who is keeping an eye on them"" has confirmed that she is okay and that they have started becoming physical in public.

Once again, thank-you for the kind words and erudite advice you gave me three weeks ago. It's time for me to move on!

TL;DR: Spoke to (now ex-)girlfriend, agreed our relationship was at its natural end. Not feeling too bad!

I felt like I owed it to reddit to do an update. This community has helped me and driven me to make one of the hardest decisions I have ever made in my life, probably one of the hardest I will ever make. To all of you who sent messages or posted comments.. I seriously thank you for all your kind words and concern. I will never be able to tell each of you individually how much you helped me but I want you to know that you made a difference in my life.

So now for the update.. I talked with my SO about my feelings, I just let everything go and broke down. It felt amazingly good to just come clean about everything. At first... He was upset and had to leave to get air but when he came back we had the most personal talk I have ever had in my life.

He says he loves me for who I am but he can't be with me if its my choice to 'gender swap'. Which is understandable because he had made it clear to me earlier that he wants children. However, he has volunteered to be with me every step of the way and I am really grateful for that.

Hes coming with me to my doctors appointment in two weeks where I will confess my desire to become male and hopefully begin the process. He is also going to accompany me to my parents house this coming weekend where I will 'come out' to them finally. 

I am extremely nervous but I feel amazing. I am really excited for my future and even though I know the road ahead will not be easy for me.. I just know its the right path to take and the path I need to take in order to be happy in this life. 

I am grateful (honestly, beyond words) to my previous SO for being so supportive and understanding and like I have said, I am extremely grateful to those individuals on reddit who took the time to lead me to the answer I needed to choose. 

So, thank you everyone and wish me luck! 

**TLDR** Confessed everything to SO who turned out to be extremely supportive and caring but we mutually decided to end our relationship. Coming out to the parents this weekend and hopefully starting the process of 'gender swapping' in about two weeks time. Extremely nervous but finally happy. This is a good ending.

1355233633.0,254,self.relationships,14nx3z,I [28] found some mildly inappropriate text messages on my wifes [29] cell phone from a groomsmen from a recent wedding she went to.,fiend_factory,327,73,490,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14nx3z/i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/,"Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14q2m8/update_i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/

I am using a throwaway because my wife likes to use my reddit account.  My wife and I have been married for the past two years.  Our relationship has always been good but with the typical relationship ebbs and flows.  We are both very trusting and generally give each other a rather long leash when it comes to trust.  My wife and I like have fun and go out and drink, party, and just have a general good time.  My wife can be kind of a tease and I tell her it is kind of mean to do that to guys but nothing ever develops out of it so I generally don't care.

Over the weekend my wife went to a college friends wedding out of town.  I stayed home for various reasons that just made it not really possible for me to go with her.  As I stated my wife likes to have fun and can get flirty with other guys but nothing crazy that would ever worry me.  Mostly it consist of dancing with a bunch of other guys because I just don't really dance to white guy awkwardness.  Well while partying it up on the nights before and of the wedding one of the groomsmen, we can call him Steve, took quite a liking to my wife and made it very clear that despite her being married he would very much like to have the ol sexy time with her.  That is fine, my wife is attractive and it happens and I know the girls she is party with who would not let this happen.  After he made this clear she made sure to never be alone with him to avoid any sort of situation that my arise.  I generally believe this.

I pick up my wife from the airport yesterday and she tells me about all the fun she had and then she starts talking about Steve.  She tells me about how she proceeded to play wingman for two of the bridesmaids ( There are five bridesmaids and three are married, my wife included ) and Steve had his way with both of them.  She found the whole situation funny and showed me all of her text messages back and forth between her and Steve about how he should total get together with each of these two other ladies and how they are ready and willing.

While my wife hid nothing from me some of the other messages between the two of them bothered me.  When Steve would relay some of his sexual conquest with the other bridesmaids she would reply with, ""That is hot, it is making me wet.""  He would tell her to stop being a tease and tell her how he really just wants her.  She had a reply along that lines of that he is really hot and fuckable, what can she.  Also when she was waiting at the airport he texted her, ""Hey if our flights get delayed why don't you just let me slip it.""  Again, haha sure that is hot, this is making me wet, etc ...  Towards the end my wife summed it with stuff along the lines of, ""Hey this was fun, you sure had a great weekend.  You got with two bridesmaids, you should be proud.""  Steve replied back with, ""Yeah but I feel like I only got the silver and bronze, every one only cares about the gold.  It was like I was at an all you can eat chicken buffet but all I wanted is steak.  You have an amazingly lucky husband.""  He sent a few more things after we got home from the airport which were nothing but I feel like he should go away at this point.  I don't really like the idea of some guy pursuing my wife like this but again I feel  some of this is my wife's fault with how she acted with him.

I told me wife that I do trust her and honestly don't believe anything happened but I feel some of the exchanges were inappropriate for a married woman.  She agreed and said it was.  I'm not worried about anything happening beyond this because Steve lives almost literally on the other side of the country.  She let me know through out the weekend how she missed me wished I was there because she was jealous everyone was getting sex but her and that she is looking forward to coming home.  She came home and our typical good sex ensued, we both agree we have an amazing sex life.

This whole ordeal is just consuming me on the inside though.  I don't know if I am handling this correctly or how to really even handle this.  This probably stems from insecurity of two things.  First, I had a previous serious and semi-longterm relationship ended because of being cheated on and second, my wife is very attractive.  I have been told, and generally accept, she is out of my league and this Steve character is far better looking than me ( think Christian Bale in American Psycho build ).  What should I do?  Am I wrong in these feelings or is this just insecurities bubbling to the surface?  I don't even know how to approach this beyond what we have already discussed.  She has reassured me nothing has happened but I just can't let go of the though that she might be lying.

TL;DR 

Wife can be a bit of a tease at times.  She is out of town for a wedding.  Groomsmen seems to have taken a shinning to her.  A few inappropriate text messages were exchange.  Insecurities are consuming me over this.

[EDIT]

My wife called me and asked if I would like to get lunch with her.  I declined and she picked up very quickly that something wasn't right and I think she knows whats up.  I am at work ( obviously getting a lot done ) so I cant talk to her on the phone about this and I don't feel talking about this over a brief lunch is appropriate.

I ask though would it be appropriate to link her to this thread with a, ""Just so you know, this is what is going on.""  I don't know if that is right especially because I am putting our business on a public forum (albeit names have been redacted or changed to protect the innocent).  While I think she would understand, my friends are all jackasses and I really have no one to talk to about this to help flesh out what is in my head.

[EDIT2]

I invited her to look over this thread.

[EDIT3]

She has responded to my email inviting her to read over this and what not.  She reiterated that she knows she was wrong and she regrets doing it.

What bothers me in this is no apology and the word ""regret.""  Regrets are for liars and cheats who got caught, at least that is how I see it.

Email for the curious:

I totally understand. I thought you might discuss this with your web friends. I am sure there are plenty of ""yeah, she cheated"" and hopefully there are some ""your girl is cool and being straight up with you, and if she says she didn't fuck him, then she didn't"".  I am aware that I put myself in a shitty position and said things to him that I should not have, and I regret that. It was inappropriate and I've learned that the situation and banter I've created with Steve is not as funny as i thought and it has hurt you deeply.

[EDIT4]

She has been reading through the thread and has sent me a rather lengthy text message.  Still with that angle she thought it would be funny and for shits and giggles.  I simply replied with, ""Fucking Hilarious.""  I don't think she is happy with the light this is portraying her in.

TL;DR This thread is not making her wet.

[EDIT5]

Just to sum up somethings I have been asked alot.

He put his number in her phone.  A lot of the text before the ones that are an issue it was all horse shit like, ""Would you girls like me to bring you some chocolates"" and all this omg look how sweet I am you should totally touch my wiener.  Wife doesn't see him trying to be manipulative and strong arm the situation, I do.

He joked about calling in a bomb threat to delay the flights so he could ""slip it in.""

I guess we are what some consider to be quite sexually liberal but in no way do either of us want an open relationship.  If she does it has not come up in 10 years and considering the stuff that has come up about what we want sexually I would be surprised that if she does she hasn't mentioned it yet.

1375744211.0,252,self.relationships,1jrutc,I (32M) went on two dates with a (24F?) and I've never been more confused. Something's just off.,Ohhthatvoice,348,96,336,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jrutc/i_32m_went_on_two_dates_with_a_24f_and_ive_never/,"We met online. She had a lot of really nice pictures of herself, and she's rather good looking. She's 6'1"" with really long legs and most people who see her probably instantly think she looks like Mila Jovovich. She has very similar features, except a more pronounced nose and thinner lips.

Well, I'm kind of a catch myself, so we quickly agreed to meet and then. And then!

She walked up wearing a really short black dress, and when I saw her up close I thought she looked a bit bigger than on her pictures. Not fatter, just - larger. And then she said hello and I heard her voice. And I was like, fuck. It's a dude in a dress.

I was stunned. She kept talking and then a bit of doubt crept in. We went for a little walk and I just kept studying her. I have never been so thoroughly confused. Her voice is kind of right there on the edge of a really low female voice and a high female impersonator voice. Can't spot her adam's apple. Her hands are kind of large but smaller and more slender than most men. Kind of normal sized shoulders. Long very shapely legs. Medium sized feet. Her face is kind of larger and more robust, but not masculine or anything. Boobs? B-cups, couldn't see much more than that under what she was wearing.

Since I had no idea what to do, we ended up at the restaurant I invited her to. Everyone at the restaurant stared. It was really strange because she just looks like a tall good looking girl, but when you hear her voice, it makes you look her over again and start asking questions. The people at the tables next to us kept glancing over. The waiters all took turns bringing us food.

She seemed to be completely oblivious to everything and we just had a really nice chat and I kind of enjoyed myself. She was pretty flirty, but I held back from physical contact. She was very intelligent, liked a lot of the weird obscure things that I liked, had a great sense of humor, and I was just having an out of body experience the whole time.

She texted me after she got home, thanked me for a really great time, and said she wanted to see me again. I pored over her profile, her every picture, and found absolutely nothing that answered any questions. Simple gender-neutral office job. No pictures of when she was younger, but then who puts up baby pictures on a dating site?

She was either a good looking tall girl with a slightly masculine voice, chin, and hands - or the most convincing transsexual I've ever seen by far.

She texted me a couple of days later and asked if I wanted another date, and I said yes. We had a slightly more awkward time  because I avoided physical contact while she was trying to initiate it. I tried to talk about some related topics. She said she never much cared for gay marriages one way or another, had no opinion on the LGBT community, to each his own, and that kind of went nowhere.

That was yesterday. That date ended with a hug, and now I am more confused than I've ever been. I don't want a relationship with a transsexual, especially one who is not upfront about it. If she's just a girl who happens to have a deep voice? If I didn't have those questions swirling in my mind, I'd be hella attracted to her. 

I can't very well flat out ask her if she was born a female. I really want to avoid a Crying Game scenario and I just go exploring her anatomy. Besides, even if I find natural breasts and lady parts I guess that doesn't necessarily mean anything?

I'd like to know for sure if she's a girl before a third date, but how can I possibly ask?

**TLDR**: Went on two dates with a girl with a very deep voice - or an extremely convincing transsexual. If not for her voice, I'd never even wonder. How can I proceed?

**Original TL;DR:**  I (college sophomore, 17F) had a one night stand with an acquaintance from class and got pregnant. I'm not sure if I should contact him to let him know or just handle it myself. I'm also hesitant about telling my parents.

[Update #1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jgjal/update_i_17f_need_advice_on_what_to_do_after_a/)

**Update #1 TL;DR:**   I talked with the father and let him know that I’m pregnant. He’s being super supportive and we are waiting to talk to doctors to make an informed decision about what to do.


**Update #2:**

Sorry for the wall of text.  I have a lot to say and am bad at being clear and concise.  

First off, I just wanted provide clarification on Wisconsin age of consent laws.  I’ve looked into it further and since I’m over 16 it’s only a Class A Misdemeanor which has a maximum sentence of $10,000 and 9 months in jail.  So, not good, but not as horrible as I had been thinking (Class B Felony is up to 60 years).  Prosecution depends solely on my parents.  I am hoping they won’t go after him and if they do I will try to protect his identity and make sure he doesn’t get in trouble.  

Secondly, I wanted to update everyone on how my appointments went.  Yesterday morning I went to the campus health center.  It started with a pregnancy test confirming I’m pregnant.  After that, the majority of the appointment was just talking with a doctor.  He asked me a ton of questions (about my health, emotional state, and so on).  He didn’t pry too much for the father’s identity and I don’t think he’s going to report anything to the state.  He gave me a bunch of pamphlets and reading materials to look through and then we talked briefly about my options and what I wanted to do.  He tested me for STIs (will get the results next week) but warned that it can take months to test positive after being infected.  I talked to the father and he agreed to get tested too just to be safe. I had a second appointment yesterday with a counselor.  We talked about a lot of the same things that I did with the doctor but I felt much more relaxed with her.  She was super nice and helpful and I plan to continue meeting with her.  Finally I had my appointment today at planned parenthood.  I went through the same procedure that I did with the campus doctor (less the STI test) but she went a lot more in depth about my options.  She did an ultrasound (which by the way is not on the stomach like they show in movies) and we discovered I’m having twins.  I was shocked.  I know it doesn’t really change anything but in my mind everything became twice as serious once I found out there are two babies.  

Third, I wanted to let you know that I’ve come to a decision and am planning on keeping the babies and putting them up for an open adoption.  I know this probably wouldn’t be a popular choice on reddit but I think it is what’s best for me.  I grew up in a very religious family and was taught that abortion is killing and a sin.  This past year at college I have been trying to step back from what my parents taught me and reassess my beliefs and assumptions.  While I definitely now consider myself pro-choice, I don’t think abortion is a choice I could make.  I’m not sure if I consider it killing or just denying the opportunity to let life happen, but either way I think it’s wrong.  I sympathize with the girls that need abortions and don’t judge them for their choices but it’s not something I could do.  I know if I got an abortion I would never be able to forgive myself and I would not be able to move on with life.  I ultimately decided on adoption because while I don’t think it’s fair for me to deny the babies the right to life, I know I’m not ready to be a mom.  Even if the father or my parents were to support me financially I don’t think I’m ready to raise one baby let alone two. By giving them up for adoption they’ll have a chance to live a full life with a loving family.  I’d also be helping out a couple by giving them the babies they so desperately want. I know giving them away will be difficult; after the ultrasound I already feel attached to them.  However, I know it’s what’s best and with an open adoption I’d be able to watch them grow and flourish with a new family. The father completely supports my choice and we’ve already started researching online and looking at couples.  Like me, the father wants an open adoption so we have the option to see the babies and know how they are. We also think an open adoption (versus a closed) would be best for the babies because we would be able to explain when they are older that we gave them up so they could have a better life not because we didn’t love them. The father and are going to continue researching adoption on our own and we have a meeting with a counselor next week to help walk us through the process.  We plan to wait another week or two to tell my parents just so we have more time to figure everything out without them freaking out.  I know bringing the babies to term will definitely change my life (and not necessarily in a good way).  I am going to have to take spring semester off but I’m not too worried about that.  Age wise I was already a year ahead in school and on top of that I came in with a lot of credits and now my summer classes.  Despite a semester set back I would still be able to continue and graduate college in a timely manner.  

Finally, I just wanted to give you all an update on how things are going with the father.  He has been beyond amazing.  He’s made it clear that he is here to support me financially, emotionally, and in whatever other way he can. Over the past three days we have spent countless hours talking and getting to know each other.  The more time I spend with him, the more I like him.  He is compassionate, caring, funny, and by far one of the best people I have ever met.  We had a class together last semester and I spent most of the semester crushing on him based purely on his looks and the witty comments he’d make.  We never really talked much and I assumed he didn’t even know I existed. But when I saw him at the party he remembered me and we got a chance to talk and really hit it off.  The night of was great but the next morning I woke up embarrassed and ashamed.  I snuck away, assuming that he was just using me for sex. Now however it seems like he really does like me.  At least I think he does.  I’m super confused/torn and don’t know what I feel let alone how he is really feeling. I can’t tell if I really like him or am just relieved that he’s not a total asshole. Do I really like him or am I just convincing myself that I do because it makes this whole situation easier?  And as far as what he really feels, I have no clue.  I don’t know if he actually likes me or is just a good person and trying to do the right thing.  Or maybe feels guilted into being nice?  When I’m with him I don’t have these concerns.  Everything feels ok.  His presence calms me.  But as soon as he’s gone I start doubting everything.  I don’t know what to do.  I don’t want to force him into a relationship or make him do anything he doesn’t want to.  What can I do to make sure he doesn’t feel trapped? 

**Update #2 TL;DR:** 1) Confirmed age of consent laws and learned that maximum punishment is $10,000 and 9 months in jail.  2) Went to a bunch of appointments, found out I’m having twins.  3) Decided I want to keep the babies and put them up for adoption. 4) Things are going well with the baby daddy but I’m confused about my feelings for him, his feelings towards me, and what to do.

My husband [36] walked out on me [33] on Monday after 13 years and I don't know what to do.,distressedwife,331,76,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1htvx9/update_my_husband_36_walked_out_on_me_33_on/,"I posted about this, and updated a couple of months ago, I thought it was about time to update again. Here is the last update, which includes links to my earlier threads:


http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dq1x9/another_update_my_husband_36_walked_out_on_me_33/

My husband rented a flat in the village and lives a few minutes away from us. For a while things were ok, I've been taking my anti-depressants, my doctor actually had to double the dose. My anger issues have gone and I'm calmer and more content than I actually realised I could be. We get on great, still, but as I started obviously getting better, he started getting worse.

 He started being really mean, demanding a divorce, threatened not to look after the children while I was doing my university exams, took off his wedding ring, generally acting completely out of character.  It wasn't until I said, ok, let's just be friends, that we started getting on really well again. Things were going great for a while, just being friends, and looking after the children between us, and we planned on keeping things as normal as possible, planning days out to the cinema and zoo as a family. He even came over for fathers day for dinner and to play Settlers of Catan. We had an amazing day, and he played Bad Moon Rising and Cry Little Sister on his phone while we played, two of my favourite songs, which he doesn't like. It was really sweet, and when I said, aww, my song, he said ""I know."" Things were going really well and between things like the songs and just chatting and having a few beers, it seemed like we were getting somewhere.

Then two weeks ago I found out about his girlfriend. He met her online, oddly enough, through redditgifts. I enjoyed my experience so much I persuaded him to sign up for the fantasy exchange. This girl is the person who was matched with him as the person to send him a gift. He's known her since March, and they've never met in person. He swears that him leaving me and our children is unrelated to his relationship with this woman, and he's convinced it's a good idea. We live in Northern Ireland, she lives in Belgium. She's 2 years younger than me (I'm 34 now), she has a child of her own, and she sent him the money for him to go meet her. He's going to London to meet her tomorrow. I guess it's about halfway for both of them.

The whole situation is very bizarre. I had my suspicions about him seeing someone else, but he denied it till I got actual proof. Then he seemed relieved to get it out. Even then, we were getting on fine. Like I said, I'm so calm lately, I don't recognise myself. I wasn't angry with him, just disappointed. SO things kept going great with us till he decided he couldn't be around me anymore. He can't handle me being nice to him, or being friends with me. It's too hard for him. It's hard for me too, and since he's changing his mind so often about us, I've pretty much cut him off. I've seen him twice in the past two weeks, and that was twice this weekend. He still can't look me in the eye.

I apologise for how rambling this all seems, but if I put everything in I'd be here all week. My friends, my doctor and my solicitor all think the best thing for me is to have as little contact with him as possible, it's the only way for me to get better and move on with things. And it's true, I've felt great this past week or two without contact, much less pressure. I have my gorgeous children and our lovely home and fabulous friends. I also have my family and my husbands family. They're all shocked and disgusted at his behaviour, not least because he had all of them and me, convinced that this whole thing was my fault. I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but at least now he's going to finally meet this woman, he'll find out for himself if he's made a huge mistake or not.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your lovely comments and advice. As for the one or two ridiculous comments about me being a terrible wife, well, I can ignore that kind of stupidity. i have already admitted that I had a problem, and got help for it as soon as I found out. But the fact is my husband and I had a great relationship, lots of fun and laughs and we still get on great. As I've found out recently there are plenty of idiots in the world, but I have wonderful friends and family who make that kind of fool easier to tolerate.

If you were in my shoes, how would you confront her?",,384,132,394,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11xxxs/i_28m_just_keylogged_my_girlfriends_24f_computer/,"Hey r/relationships. I'm a reddit newbie who frequently hangs out in r/GameDeals. Teh Intarwebs isn't really a place I'd like to turn to for relationship advice, but I can't really talk to my friends about this just yet so here I am.

My girlfriend [24f] and I [28m] have been in a relationship for over 6 years, but it's not exactly what I'd call an emotionally satisfying relationship. I've caught her cheating with her ex-bf many times over in the first 3 years of our relationship, but I've let those slide because I thought she was a great girl didn't want to lose her (another issue worth its own r/Relationships thread in and of itself, but I digress).

At any rate, fast forward 3 years later. We've had hiccups, but at the very least I was happy to think that her ex-bf was complete a thing of the past and I had finally gotten over some of the trust issues I had in the first 3 years of our relationship.

My girlfriend was quite the anti-gamer back in the day, so you can imagine my surprise and delight when she finally asked me to teach her how to play a particular RTS title I played back in the early 2000s.

We'd play well into the night most days, but because of the game's age I eventually got sick of it and went on to other titles. My girlfriend on the other hand, still plays to this day and has made lots of friends, particularly in Europe.

Which would have been fine and dandy. I have no problem with her making friends on the Internet and finding a hobby to pour her spare time into. After all, she's been unemployed for over 4 years and has seemingly lost all interest in finding a job (another issue that deserves its own thread).

But then I come home early from work one day and discover one of her clan mates calling her ""babe"" and sending her kiss emoticons. I confront her about it, and she assured me that it's all a one-way street with this guy, and she has no intention of pursuing anything him because ""he's from a poor Eastern European country and is not as rich as you"" (her words. HUGE red flag, but I again digress).

Then came the increasingly odd and secretive behavior on her part. Whereas she used to share memes and content she'd find on the Internet with me on a regular basis, she now keeps half her window hidden from view, and has even gone to the extent of purchasing a chair with a high backrest that makes it impossible to take cursory glances at her screen.

So I wrote a keylogger, planted it on her PC two months ago, and promptly forgot all about it. That is, until a recent episode two days that once again flared my suspicions. 

I just finishing scouring the logs literally 5 minutes ago and discovered she's had cam sex with this guy once in the last few months. I also discovered several instances where they had chat sex but she refused to turn on her cam because her ""brother is at the computer behind her"".

Because of conflicting schedules and timezones issues (we're in Asia, clan is in Eastern Europe) however, they have not had the opportunity for a repeat performance and have slowly drifted apart in the last few weeks, but she now has 2 more potential replacements in the pipes. 

I've also discovered that she has edited me out of her life as far as her ""real"" online profiles are concerned. Her official profiles show the typical info - In a relationship with me, etc., etc.,. but her ""real"" online profiles show no trace of a boyfriend, and contain references to the ""brother"" she shares her apartment with. Note that we've been living together for about as long as we've been together. 

Needless to say, I'm shocked and angry. I don't want to lose her, but I'm rather sick of constantly having to compete with someone else for her affection.  Plus, I technically violated her privacy - which I'm sure is something she will likely bring up (in a fit of outrage, mind you) if and when I do decide to confront her.

How would you confront her if you were in my shoes? Can anyone give me any advice? Is a relationship like mine worth saving, or should I bolt out the exit? 

My brain sort of already knows the answer to that last question, but I guess I'm looking for a little push. I've spent 6 years on this relationship after all. I feel like we've been through a lot and wouldn't want it all to go to waste, but somehow I feel like I'm the only one pulling my weight in this relationship and am starting to wonder where this is all heading.




**TL;DR**
**I keylogged my girlfriend of 6 years and discovered she's lied to my face and had cam sex with her Russian clan mates. Do you think this relationship is worth saving? If not, how should I confront her considering that I violated her privacy?**

So he finally called me back and I asked him what he did today and, of course, he said he just slept and hung around his house. I said, really? that's interesting because I know you're lying about where you were and who you were with. He apologized profusely for lying and gave his explanation that he was just letting a friend crash on his couch and nothing happened. (And of course later on in the conversation he revealed that they did make out a little.)

I told him I felt it was best we not see each other anymore. He kept repeating that I was throwing everything away over a stupid mistake he made. He said how much he regretted it and it meant nothing and he wished he hadn't done it and that I was also in the wrong for testing him. (Apparently letting him do what he did was testing him because I wanted to see what he would do.) He said he loved me for the first time and how much I meant to him and that he wanted to fight for me, and I hung up and haven't looked back. 

It doesn't matter to me now if it was a one time thing and he regrets his mistake and it doesn't matter if he's been lying to me the whole time. Because he never wanted to be official all I had to hold onto and reconcile myself with was the fact that we agreed to always be open and honest with each other, and with that one lie he took that away. 

I don't regret the relationship, I learned from it and I know I will come out stronger from this lesson. 
Thank you all for your advice and support.

I think this is my out from our marriage. Is this a wrong way of thinking about this all?

- Ages: 33M &amp; 30F

- Married for 5 years

Two weeks ago my wife went to visit one of her old college friends. Apparently they went out together and she gets blasted and goes home with some guy. My wife says no penetrative sex happened and they just hooked up (i.e. making out/oral). I'm not sure I believe this but it really doesn't make too much of a difference. She cheated. I noticed something was off with her because she seemed so depressed and clingy from the second she got back. Friday she starts crying and tells me that she cheated on me and she is so sorry and it won't ever happen again. She is promising me everything and just crucifying herself. 

I'm basically the typical nice guy. I've never cheated on my wife and I think I've been a good husband. I don't really think I deserve to be cheated on. Our marriage wasn't that great to begin with so I'm not sure what we would be saving. We were arguing all the time before this. We weren't having regular sex. I'm not even sure I am in love with her. And now add in cheating. 

I know my wife and I can believe her getting drunk and something happening. I don't think she is lying about anything. This woman is a complete lightweight. Anything after 4 drinks and she is just out of it and not the same woman. I don't think she intentionally sought to cheat on me and I do believe she is truly guilty. 

Thing is right now I'm seeing this as my card out of this terrible marriage while still looking like the good guy. Am I being selfish. We don't have kids (I do want them though). 

I guess what I'm asking here is, 

""Am I wrong to see her cheating as an out and do I have to try to reconcile, if I don't want to?"" 

AND

I'm looking for advice on how to tell her I want a divorce. I'm not sure if I should play it nice and just say its both of us (probably smarter) or just crush her and say its because she cheated on me (which would be more satisfying). 

**EDIT 10PM**

Sorry for not responding to all of these comments. I stepped away for a bit to talk to my wife. I wanted to get a feel for how she was feeling and I told her that we probably were over. I know a lot of you guys told me to talk to an attorney but there really isn't much at stake. We don't have kids. We rent a place together and our lease is up Oct 31 so there isn't even a house. We both make the same money (roughly) and my wife is a pretty decent person, cheating aside. I don't see how or why she would want to even try to fuck me over in a divorce.

I explained how I haven't been happy for a long time and how her cheating just made it clear to me I couldn't deal any longer. We had enough problems without cheating. Its too much to handle. 

She starts to freak the fuck out at this point. Its pure theatrics. Basically she insists she never, ever had sex with him. According to her they both passed out while kissing and fooling around (handjob and him fingering her was the furthest they went). I told her I'm not an idiot. She starts offering to take a lie detector test and is swearing on everything that she never had any type of sex with him. I don't know if I believe that or not. She did seem convincing but it doesn't seem likely that she goes home with a guy and then *doesn't* fuck him. 

We keep up this argument for a bit and I just tell her it doesn't matter. You betrayed me. I don't care if you blew him or fucked him or *just* kissed him. You don't go home with other people when you are married. And she starts to weep. She literally was begging me to not divorce her that she would make it up to me anyway she could. At this point, I did take the low road. I said some nasty things back to her that just made our situation worse. It was basically tied to the pcos issues. I don't even know how to describe the situation. I feel like she lost her mind. She was just despondent. I tried to walk things back and I told her I still want to be friends but there is no way we can be married. Eventually she calmed down and we just sat, cuddled and talked about some better memories. I don't really want to be in the house alone, so I ended up taking her to her parent's place a half hour away. I think its for the best we keep some space between us. I'm just wiped out emotionally. I kept my cool through all of it but it was intense. I think I'm making the right call here. There was no way I would ever trust her again. We had a bad marriage before the cheating. We don't and probably wouldn't ever have kids. There really wasn't any reason to stay and there wasn't anything to save.

I'm a female and I've been with my guy for almost 3 years now and we've been living together for 2. I'm 24 and he's 23.
    
He's constantly groping me. And not just the casual butt smack. I'll be doing dishes and there he is grabbing a boob under the shirt. Folding some laundry, butt's being squeezed. Bent over changing the litter box? Better believe he's right behind me. 
    
I wouldn't mind so much if this didn't happen EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not just once a day but all the time. I can't sit next to him without a boob being exposed and squeezed. I can't do anything without feeling like a piece of meat and it just gets overwhelming and just too much. I don't like being touched SO often and it's getting to the point where I'm getting so much unwanted attention that it's turning me COMPLETELY off. I feel like I'm getting zero respect and my self esteem feels a little shot every time it happens because I just feel like a sexual object, nothing more. 
    
Now, I appreciate that he finds me so attractive that he can't keep his hands off of me but this is no way to be treated. There is absolutely zero romance. It's constant sex jokes and squeezes and it gets to the point where you feel like you've been molested all day that the last thing you want to do is be sexed up by that person. I don't even go to bed at the same time as him any more because I know the minute I lay down I won't be left alone and I just want to sleep. 
    
What do I do? I've told him to lay off being so overly sexual with me because it turns me off. I'm blunt, I like to approach my problems head-on but all I've gotten is ""quit being a prude"", ""FINE I won't touch you ever then"". I'm sorry but he's like a horny little school boy. I want some damn romance once in a while, to be taken out and treated nicely, not to be treated like a piece of meat all day and then be expected to provide sex. It's an awful, awful approach. What do i do?! Also, maybe I should mention that he's the only boyfriend I've ever had.
    
**TL:DR** Boyfriend can't keep his hands to himself + no romance = feeling like an object, therefore decreased sex drive.

Everything is generally great, good communication, we have a lot of fun together, and I'm very much in love.  We have the occasional fight and miss communication, but are generally able to talk through it.  She has an ex boyfriend (they broke up right before we met, turns out he was cheating on her) and she tells me she's over him.

It's been a little rough recently.  I feel awful for the next part, but when we were on vacation in upstate last week, her laptop was open on Facebook, and I checked her search history.  I'm not proud of it, but I was curious.  I did not check her messages  (although I know she talks to him) if that makes me any less awful. It turns out she's searched him, at LEAST once a day, if not multiple times, for the last few months.  She really doesn't look up anyone consistently besides him, and me. Is this normal behavior?  Or am I playing the fool?

I mean, we all look up an ex from time to time. It happens, even if we're totally over them.  But daily? After 8 months together?

You can skip the part of how shitty I am for being nosey. I already feel that.

1360767176.0,254,self.relationships,18g346,Boyfriend [M34] of 4 months says I [F31] am no longer allowed to see my guy friends 1 on 1,jealousy_issues,325,71,303,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18g346/boyfriend_m34_of_4_months_says_i_f31_am_no_longer/,"Yesterday my new boyfriend of four months brought up an issue he said was bothering him.  He told me that if I saw any of my male friends one-on-one in the future, he would go ""insane"" and our relationship would end.  If I saw them in a group scenario that would be fine. 

I think this is completely unacceptable.  I have several male friends and have even started a part-time commission-based business with one of them (who lives out of state).  (This business has three partners, the third being another of my female friends.)

To clarify, I have not dated ANY of my male friends; these are not exes.  Since I have been mostly single for the last four years (prior to that was in a long-term relationship), if any of my friends were interested in me, there was ample opportunity to ask me out--and I would have turned them down, because these are my friends, not people I am interested in dating.  At this time almost all of my male friends are married, some with kids.

He claims that I am not addressing his feelings in the matter.  

BACKGROUND: 

In the past, I have let people crash on my couch for a weekend or night if they needed to cut down on costs.  I live in NYC and hotels are not cheap here; my friends are artist-types (and that is the business I am building as well) and I have a big place, so me letting people stay on my couch has been the difference between them being able to attend one of our industry events or not being able to afford it.  Sometimes those are guy friends; sometimes they are female friends.  

I also am a social person, who arranges get-togethers, lunches, dinners, drink nights for a wide friend circle.  Usually this is a group event when I plan it; but for dinner or lunch it's often just one on one.  

My day job is one where I MUST entertain people for lunch/drinks in order to get the next project.  Think agent/editor/author relationship-buildings.  Some of my coworkers are male.  

I am not someone who has JUST guy friends.  I think the ratio is probably 75/25 female/male.  But I do have them and am unwilling to sever friendships that have lasted years because of a new relationship.

QUESTION:  How do I explain this to him in a way that he can understand, or is this a lost cause?  I have said everything to him that I've said here.    

tl;dr Boyfriend of four months told me yesterday that if I ever hung out with one of my guy friends, of which I have several and have had many for years and years, one on one (even for something like dinner or drinks) our relationship would be over.

EDIT/mini-update:

I spoke to him about this at length yesterday and we agreed to shelve the discussion until today.  We talked again today about it, and he's done some backpedaling on the ""or else"" statements and has apologized for them.  I told him that I will not be changing how I interact with my friends, male or female, period, and that I will be happy to help find a way to make him feel more comfortable with the interaction.  Basically, reiterated what I said yesterday with firmer language so there was no misunderstandings.  I did not bring up that I had major concerns about his jealousy at this time because I did not want to side-line/derail the conversation.

I don't think he's very happy with what I said but I also don't think he is calling it quits because of it.  We also talked about where this is coming from, which is his past experiences with women who cheated on him and lied to his face about it.  He also asked me to give him time to trust me enough; I said I wasn't going to put friendships on pause to make him feel comfortable with it.  I think we're probably going to continue to talk about this when we see each other in person tomorrow, so I'll give a longer update after the weekend.

I [24f] don't know what to do!",RexasaurusTy,314,68,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1954ng/my_father_57m_thinks_hes_dating_a_stripper_when/,"Back story: When I was a little girl my father was in a car accident, he was in a coma for about a year and had to learn how to live again, walking, talking etc. He's fine now and functions remarkable well for what he's been though, his speech is still hard to understand sometimes but you can usually figure out what he's trying to say. Point of the story is that there is a history of brain damage so I need to go about this delicately.

My dad is an OTR truck driver, he's gone for at least 5 days a week, nearly every week. His usual runs go through New Mexico/Arizona. 
Starting in September of last year he started talking about his new girlfriend ""Candi"" who lives in New Mexico (we live in the Midwest). When he told me she was only a few years older than me and was a stripper to boot I knew this was trouble and frankly I was a little grossed out. I brushed it off because I figured it would probably end quickly.

Since September he's wired at least $2000 to her, this month alone he's sent her another $800. Plus at least $300 in gifts. 
Meanwhile, he hasn't paid his electric bill, or water bill. He's borrowed money to fly cross country to see his sick father, which he hasn't paid back yet. He has committed to pay half of my phone bill, which he hasn't in the last few months. However he has gotten her a phone plan on HIS account. He said he's helping get her a new car, while I drive a death-box on wheels and he drives an ancient Toyota Tercel.

A friend of the family, ""Gary"" who is also a truck driver decided to stop in the strip club and see this woman and my father.
Gary said my dad spent all his time in the strip club waiting for her to show up to work. Which she never did. My dad also got a hotel room for the two of them and she wouldn't even spend the night with him. 
Which is just more proof that this relationship is all in his head.
I'm fairly certain she is NOT sleeping with him or exchanging sexual favors. I think he's just enamored or obsessed.

My dad recently updated his phone and so I took it upon myself to snoop around, I wrote down her number and read his text messages. The majority of the conversations is my dad texting her and her saying nothing back, except to ask for money. 

I love my father but I've had enough, this is EMBARRASSING and makes me really sad to see him treated like such a fool. He's neglecting his responsibilities and his family.

I don't know what to do. This is creating a big rift in our relationship and I don't want him to go bankrupt.
Help?

**Whoa okay, apparently I need to explain this phone thing better**
For my birthday he bought me a new phone and said he'd pay **half** of it for **six** months, as part of the **gift**. I have my own plan, with a different provider. I don't need him to pay that half. That was more of an example on how he's going back on his word with me and other members of the family. Financially for me it's a non issue. 

Edit: **Yeah, you guys aren't getting it lol My Father does NOT pay my bills, so feel free to move past that**
Also I plan on having a discussion with my dad when he returns from the road. 
I'm going to address his unpaid bills and family debt first and then move onto him being taken advantage of, I do think I'm going to suggest the ""Secret No-Money-Month"" 
If he doesn't listen, then fine. As much as it'll make me feel like a bad daughter, I'll butt out. But I love him to much to stand idly by and not say anything.

**TL:DR: My dad thinks he's dating a stripper, stripper barely acknowledges him unless it's to take his money. He's going broke and neglecting obligations. All the while hurting our relationship. Don't know what to do.**

Just a note, I've just woken up and haven't had my coffee yet so, if any of this doesn't make sense, be sure to ask me to clarify. Also, there's A LOT of text here, so kudos to you if you can read through all of this. This is my first /r/relationships update so I apologise if I've actually put in more detail than I should have.

So last night I went over to her place to pick her up and bring her over to mine for dinner. I planned on sitting her down as soon as I got there to discuss my problem with her. Many of the comments in my original post insisted that I break up with her, because we were clearly incompatible and would not work in the long run. I, however, felt it best if I could at least get a feel of where she's at in regard to what she's been taught about porn and sex before I try anything radical like that.

So, I get over to her place and her mother [49] answers the door. Not a good thing if I want to get my girlfriend down for a private conversation. She hangs around to ask me how I've been, how my mother's been (""Yes, yes, everything's been fine""). I figure that, if this is the case I'll just talk to my girlfriend when we get in the car.Then my girlfriend's brother [21] comes home and starts yelling at my girlfriend about some money he thinks she owes him. At this point she's on edge, so I figure the car drive home probably isn't the best time to bring it up. We get to my place, and after dinner, I bring her into my room, close the door, and sit her down on my bed. I can remember most of what I said. I tried my best to remain calm and clear-headed, although ultimately my speech was akin to Adam West's Batman - very slow and with more pauses than are necessary.

""So I was over at your place on Monday, right, and we were chatting away, and then the topic of porn came up. And in doing so, there was something in particular you said that bothered me quite a bit. You said that you would never allow any guy you date to watch porn, right? And then you kind of forced it upon me to say that I wouldn't watch porn. And that really did bother me in a couple of ways. Firstly, because you're kind of telling me what I can or can't do with my own body, in my own time when I'm not with you. And I think that so long as what I'm doing in my own time isn't hurting you or having a negative effect on our relationship, then it isn't your place to tell me what I can or can't do. Like, I know it was most likely unintentional, but I felt like you were asserting some sort of dominance over me, like you were trying to control me, you know?""

(Obligatory break in wall of text)

""And secondly, by trying to tell me whether I can or can't watch porn, it shows that you don't really know why a man in my position would need porn. Basically, every man on the planet has very strong sexual urges, and I'm no exception, especially at my age. Now, most guys in a relationship would be able to satisfy those urges through sex. Since we're not sexually active, I need to find a substitute for that, and I get that through watching porn. It's not that I find these girls more attractive than you, it's just that for that thirty minutes or so they are able to provide me something that you won't. Please don't get the wrong idea about this, okay? I still love you more than anything in the world, so don't think I prefer these girls over you. Now, I felt like it was important for me to say this, because the last thing I want is to go behind our back and lie to you, and that's not healthy in a relationship.""

My girlfriend was looking at me through most of this, clearly taking in everything I had to say, but when I finished she kept her head down and gave a simple ""Ok"". She changed the topic quite suddenly, and I couldn't help but feel that she was still uncomfortable by the idea of me watching porn, so I decided to change the topic again.

""Look, I really needed you to know this so that I could make sure you understand why I'm doing this. I hope you understand that. Are you feeling ok?""

She responded by telling me that she had a fairly sheltered upbringing, and was always told about the dangers of watching porn. She believed that it was easy to get addicted to, like a drug, and that it was important to stay away from it. I asked her if she understood now why I would need it, and she replied with ""Yes, it actually makes sense to me now."" After this she also told me that she never intended for it to seem like she was controlling me. She tried her best to hold it back, but she ended up crying in my arms, hugging me tight and telling me that she would never want it to be that way. I reassured her that I knew she wouldn't do anything like that intentionally, and that it's important for us to always be open and honest with each other with any problems we might have.

When she had settled down, I asked her about her views on sex. I had a bad feeling that she might say that she thought it was wrong, or dirty, or sinful, but I was rather surprised to find out that she actually does want me in that way. She doesn't see any harm in the physical side of sex, but she feels like it's something worth saving for someone special. She gave an analogy about a bride and a groom about to be wed, and when the bride says ""I do"", seven other brides each approach the alter and say ""I do"" as well. When the first bride questions the groom about this, he responds with something along the lines of (don't quote me on this) ""I gave my heart away to many women before I met you, so I should consider them each to be as much my bride as you are.""

Now obviously, it's kind of a stupid analogy if you take it for face value. While having sex with someone doesn't necessarily create an eternal emotional connection between the two of you like the analogy suggests, I can at least rest knowing that what I had previously thought of my girlfriend's views of sex were completely wrong. Telling me this caused me to really rethink a lot of things I had once believed about her. I had first thought that she was almost scared of sex, or something of the sort, however I now see that she values sex so highly that she believes a couple's first sexual encounter would be made even more special if it were at the climax of the relationship (pun kind of intended). I can respect that, but I asked her anyway, ""Are you sure this is something you've absolutely thought about? I wouldn't want us to be missing out on something like this if it's an issue you've only glanced over."" She told me that it was something she had been thinking of her entire life. She also told me not to get the wrong idea, that she does want me in that way and still reckons I'm the hottest guy on the planet, but thinks that something as special as sex should wait until marriage.

We had an awesome night watching funny video game reviews on Youtube.

TL;DR

* I explain to my girlfriend that her ""ban"" on porn made me feel like I was being controlled, and why a guy in my situation would need porn. She is very understanding of this and changes her stance

* I ask her about her views on sex, and surprisingly she isn't scared of it nor does she find it dirty, but has decided that it is something so important that it should be saved for marriage.

After some prodding he admitted he was feeling deprived and like he hadn't lived his life. That in his words "" You aren't how I pictured my wife""...wow, that hurt. So I of course was livid. He said I had two options: let him sleep with another women/have a gf on the side or be patient with him when he gets moody because I won't let him sleep with another woman. I couldn't believe he thinks he is being reasonable. He claims most men feel this way but don't have the courage to say it. I feel like any man or woman would never feel this way about someone they love. The last time I took him back he swore he had come to his senses. 

I cannot believe he is doing this to me again. I cannot believe I was so stupid. As I type this I know how pathetic I sound.

So now to the update. My boyfriend and I talked pretty extensively over the past five days and have been experimenting and compromising a lot more in the bedroom. It has been amazing.

1357093799.0,246,self.relationships,15swk2,[20F] My mom [45F] is dating a girl [19F] a year younger than me.  How the hell do I deal with that?,,323,77,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15swk2/20f_my_mom_45f_is_dating_a_girl_19f_a_year/,"Throwaway here.  I'm also an only child, if that makes any difference.

My parents got divorced about two years, right after I went off to university.  My dad's [48M] gone off to another state, and my mom still lives in the house I grew up in.  It's better for everyone that they divorced, honestly; they absolutely did *not* get along.  My mom also came out as bisexual five years ago, which also caused a lot of friction (dad seemed to think “bisexual” meant “cheating on him”).  It took me a while—and I definitely said some things I'm ashamed of before I did—but I fully support and accept my mom's sexuality and I'm trying to do the right thing and be a more tolerant person.  

But there has to be a “but,” right?

*Buuuuuuut* … a little before I came home for Winter Break, my mom told me she had a girlfriend who couldn't be with her family for Christmas, and asked if I would be okay with meeting her.  I said of course and had a brief nervous laugh to myself later.  I mean, it's all well and good to accept that your mom is bi, but when you're a socially-awkward penguin straight girl and meeting your mom's new *girlfriend* for the first time, that's sitcom territory.

Then I met my mom's girlfriend.  Mom and her girlfriend picked me up at the airport.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but I assumed she'd at least be somewhat close to my mom's age. 

Nope!  

She's 19!  A year younger than me!  My mom's banging a girl who graduated high school a year after I did!  I thought she was another girl coming home for Christmas, right up until she took my mom's hand and introduced herself.

I should mention that my mom's girlfriend (let's just call her Tina from now on) is a fine person (cheerful, funny, smart, obsessed with her BeDazzler, etc.) and it shouldn't be my business what my mom and Tina do with their lives.  But it still weirds me the *hell* out.  I have no problem with my mom being bi, but I do have a lot of problems with her specific choice of *Tina* as a girlfriend:

* The age thing.  She's a year younger than me.  There were definitely times, back before I had accepted my mom's sexuality, when I wondered if her being bi meant she had the hots for me or any of the girls in my school.  Until now I figured she hadn't.  Now I can't help but wonder if she * was * checking out me or my classmates, and … no, just no.

* The size difference.  I haven't mentioned it yet, but my mom is a big woman.  She's probably 300 pounds or more and is tall, too, about 5'10.  Tina, on the other hand, is 5'1 and maybe a buck even (100 lbs.).  Coupled with the age difference (guh!), it really does look like my mom is dating a child, not someone who's legally an adult.  And Tina dresses really “young,” too, like she was still in high school.

* Flirting and PDAs.  If it hadn't been for the first two issues, these wouldn't have bothered me, and honestly, they were clearly holding themselves back when I was around or they thought I couldn't hear, so I have to thank them for that.  But still, watching my mom kiss a girl younger than me was deeply disturbing.  And hearing them call each other “baby” was just plain weird. And I * definitely * heard them have sex … and more than once.  

* And when Tina sat on my mom's lap one night … there is not enough brain bleach in the world.

* Their friends.  I know my mom has talked about “letting myself go” and “experimenting” since the divorce, which is all fine and good.  And she's met new people, and that's also good.  And she and Tina have mutual friends, and * that's * good, too.  I even met a couple of them over the break.  And they are … interesting people, let's say.  There was a definite “alternative lifestyle” vibe going on, and I could definitely pick up a few … “shared experiences” between them and Tina and my mom.  Again, brain bleach. There is not enough.

So … there.  I'm glad I got that off my chest at least.  This is an incredibly awkward situation all around, and I'm so, so glad to be away from it and back at school.  Part of the … *everything* is thinking about my either of my parents having sex, and part of it is thinking about my mom having sex with a girl not just my age, but *younger*.  And possibly with other people.  

How do I get over how creeped out I am by all this?  Am I too creeped out by this?  Not enough?  Just right?  Should I tell my mom she's sharing way too much, way too fast?  Because I definitely feel like a server at TMI Fridays here.  For now I'm just glad there are so many miles between us, but that's not healthy long-term, I don't think.

He saw all the packages I had ordered for him over the past month. I told him that I thought it was special and sweet to give presents to your loved ones on Christmas, and he knew all of the packages were gifts for him (I say this because he asked and I told him).

He told me he wasn't ""big on holidays"", but I didn't think much of it, especially since I watched him buy tons of thoughtful, expensive presents for his friends and family (he has much more money than me).

I didn't buy him anything overly expensive, but I did buy him 7 or 8 thoughtful presents, that I started giving to him yesterday on Christmas Eve. A few presents in, I was in the other room and he hopped online and bought me a cheap online game. 

I'm not sure what to think. I've been watching him be showered in gifts all month from his friends and family, and spent Christmas Eve watching him exchange presents with his family, feeling like the odd one out. For me, there was just him this Christmas. I don't have any family, and I've had to move around the country a lot, so there's no one else that I'm close to. 

I feel really guilty for feeling upset about this. I guess I'm just wondering if I should talk to him about this, or more importantly what to say. Somehow I feel like it's my own fault, but I'm not sure what I did wrong.

He asked for my number and we started to text all the time, and eventually that led to a couple kind of dates... like to go see a movie, listen to a speaker, dinner, etc. We started to hook up lightly (no sex) and things were going, really really well. 

Like about a month in, he told me to tell him if I was dating anyone else or was like attached, because he didn't want to be the other guy. This was probably when we should have had the exclusive talk, but we didn't. I just told him I wasn't dating anyone else, and he said basically cool, if that changes just tell me, no hard feelings. A bit after that we had sex for the first time together (so not even first date, or second date, like maybe 10th or something). 

Since then things have been really, really good. We talk all the time and we get along really well. The sex is pretty awesome, and we are a great match. He has introduced me to some of his friends, and we spend probably 2 or 3 nights a week together. Text each other every night we aren't together. He took care of me when I was sick a couple weeks ago. I've fallen for him hard, and I thought he felt the sameway about me. 

I went home on Thursday for Summer Break and we are going to be about 4 hours apart. We were making plans to see each other over the summer, and he spent Sunday skyping with me telling me he missed me so much, wished i was with him. I've dated one boy before him, and the relationship was okay. No one cheated or anything, but I didn't care about him like Ryan. Ryan has only dated one other girl, but she cheated on him and broke his heart. He has hooked up with quite a few girls though, and he hasn't dated since his ex...which was like 3 years ago. 

So this afternoon, he texted me saying his Final was brutal and he wished I was there because he needed someone to be with. He was saying about how he was going to get drunk, and I told him to be safe and that it would be okay. 

Now, like an hour ago he texted me this rambling message basically saying, 

Babe I want to be honest wtih you, and i care about you a lot. I miss you, and I wish you were here. I know we aren't bf/gf and we don't like owe each other anythign, but id want you to tell me if it was the otherway around. I'm going to go over to ****'s [some girl he was FWB before] to drink and we'll probably hook up. Maybe I'm being narcisstic thinking you care, but I'd want to know if it was with you. My phone is going to be off so we'll talk tomorrow? 

I can't even describe how it felt reading it... like I was being stabbed. I feel so completely depressed and whacked and it fucking hurts. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel, and it just sucks. I don't want him to be with her or anyone else, and I don't know what I'm supposed to say or feel. Does he like me or is he playing me? I guess he was being honest... and that is good right? But he is having sex with someone else. And that isn't good.

1364175196.0,245,self.relationships,1ay46h,An apologyletter to my neighbour[~25m],iSoder,306,61,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ay46h/an_apologyletter_to_my_neighbour25m/,"Hi!

I have a problem with my neighbour with the twist that I'm the bad guy, somewhat uknowingly. I intend to apologize but I'm afraid he wants nothing to do with me so I plan to go the letter-route. 

Wall-of-text backstory: Last christmas I got a new sound system from my parents. As I listen to alot of music / tv-shows I used this frequently when I moved back to my place. I live in an middle floor in an apartment complex of three floors. 

Maybe a week after I moved back from the holidays I got a call from my landlord telling me he have received calls about noise from my apartment - which sounded like I was moving furniture all night. 

I was thoroughly confused as I certainly wasn't moving any furniture and I didn't connect the dots here (as I always make sure to have a low volume at night). 

After the call I made extra sure that I kept a low volume - even testing how much could be heard from the other room and outside the door (which was none as soon as I left the room with a medium-loud setting). 

I got a visit from the neighbourhood security a few days ago (their main function is to keep an eye on student parties) we had a chat about it and he suggested that it might be a sound system as he had alot of similar cases before. 

I'm now convinced it is the soundsystem and I have taken measures to reduce / nullify the noise.

Since we are a few months from christmas I can't imagine the frustration my neighbour must've felt - even though I tried to I wasn't successful until now (hopefully). 

I wrote this apologyletter and have yet to send it, I thought I wanted some views if it's too little (or even to much) and what is appropriate.

(English isn't my native language so it's translated)


&gt; ""Hello
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know I am the one who lives in the apartment directly  above you. I've aware that you have experienced loud noise from me for quite some time now. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried to keep the noise down by playing at low volumes in the evening and at night but since they haven't been enough I've been confused as to what was the cause of the noise. 

&gt; I've now identfied the source as the subwoofer I got last christmas.  It has been standing directly on the floor - obviously a stupid idea as  it caused the vibrations that you've heard until now. 

&gt; I've now moved the subwoofer into a bookshelf with a dampening cloth underneath - a temporary solution until I receive a soundcanceling platform designed for subwoofers. 

&gt; Now that I'm aware of the source of the problems I hope you can accept my sincerest apologies. As an added measure you'll find two giftcards for movies tickets attached to this letter. 

&gt; Feel free to contact me at my [cellphone number] should these preventive measures fail. If you experience any other noise please contact me immediately so I can easily identify what is causing the problem - and we both avoid further frustration. 
 
So what are your thoughts on this letter? Is there anything else I can / should do?

edit: To be clear I'm 99% sure the problem isn't bass *sound* but rather the *vibration* it makes - and as it was standing on the floor the vibration was sent directly down to my poor neighbour. 

**TL;DR** My (25y) subwoofer has caused my downstairs neighbour (~25y) to hear the vibrations comming off it even at low volumes since last christmas without me knowing about it. I've written an apologyletter which I want a few pointers at as well as other tips on handling my angry neighbour. 

**update** First of all thank you all for the positive feedback! I'm more confident in sending this letter now! I wrote this last night and went to bed right after so this was a good way to start the day. I was afraid it would be tacky to send a letter or that my gesture with the gift would be too much but you seems to like to so I'm going with it.

Some of you pointed out that there's no making up for months of noise but I firmly believe that one should at least try to make amends when one has wronged this much. It's up to him to accept the apology - I don't need to be best friends with him, I just want to open up a line of communication (that would also help me learn the limits) that does not involve the landlord and neighbourhood security. 

Since I got so much positive feedback I will ofcourse update again with his response, if any. ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1364210641.0,,,True,t3_1ay46h,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ay46h/an_apologyletter_to_my_neighbour25m/,

So this actually turned out really well!

Friday was pretty quiet and his dogs actually didn't bark in the evening. Saturday we (25f, 30m, 5 months) were out running errands an ended up at a pet shop. My bf was looking at some homeopathic anxiety stuff for dogs and I asked him why. He said he wanted to get something for his female so he could get some sleep. What a great opportunity! I said 'Yea, I have actually been meaning to ask you about that...' and we ended up having a great conversation. He is a very reasonable guy and wasn't offended at all, and he totally understood my little 'fit' last Thursday morning. We came up with lots of solutions! 

This weekend we exercised them and left the radio and a fan on at night to provide a constant source of 'noise'. His dogs didn't bark at ALL, even with a party next door. I also got them some long-lasting bones. We are going to use treat-training to stop them from jumping (which he has used in the past) and exercise them more often. We actually made a copy of his house key for me so I can come over during the day to let them out. 

TL;DR: Opportunity for discussion presented itself perfectly, had an awesome conversation, came up with lots of solutions, and further confirmed the splendid nature of this wonderful relationship. :)

ETA: We did not buy the homeopathic stuff. I just mentioned that since it was such a serendipitous way to start the conversation. We are using single pieces of kibble for the treat training, not treats. The long-lasting bones are only for the day we both need to be gone for an extended period of time. They are Nylabone or plain femurs, NOT some random animal bone that will splinter and choke them to death.

I guess an update is long overdue: after dealing with this, shitty boyfriend becoming shitty ex-boyfriend, reaching out to abusive deadbeat father and being horribly rejected, and being physically assaulted at work and threatened with physical assault multiple times at work, I tried to commit suicide.

Now I'm trying to get healthy and beat the major depression I'm battling. Since all of this the Dean has called and apologized to my mom and back tracked on everything she said to me and said that she ""always felt"" that I was truthful with her and felt powerless to stop the reign of terror these girls were running. Apparently I'm not the only one who has been harassed by them. I guess she's been running investigations involving them harassing about 4 other people.

Anyway, so I'm taking medical leave from school. During this time I want to focus on getting healthy, maybe work for one of the museums nearby, and transfer to another school.

I guess that's it.

TL;DR: Lots of things happened, horribly depressed, tried to commit suicide, things are getting better slowly.


edit: Because I really didn't comment on the other girls here it goes: supposedly investigations are going to continue when the new school year starts. Additionally, the Dean wants to investigate scumbag ex-boyfriend's role in this all, and also wants to look into why this group harassed me, his former freshman roommate, and a guy that he was really good friends with his freshman and sophomore years.

__________________________________________________________________
I posted to this subreddit a couple weeks ago after learning that my girlfriend was pregnant. Yesterday, I logged back on this site for the first time and read some of the messages, and I felt like I should update the situation. 

First, thank you to everyone for the thoughtful advice in my previous post. Not everyone was kind or understanding, but most of you were and you all helped me with sorting out my feelings. I am grateful for that. Specifically, I wanted to say thank you to /u/lsirius and /u/istara. Thank You. A lot of you wanted to remind me again and again I should have worn a condom. To you, message received. There was no need to tell me ~75 times, but I understand. It was a reckless mistake and going forward I will be much more careful. 

___________________________________________________

**Update**

When I had posted the original thread, I was shamefully almost wishing that my girlfriend would consider an abortion. I felt like it was too much, too fast. Caroline, wasn't considering an abortion and she had previously told me she was pro-Life so I knew I shouldn't bring it up, but I couldn't reconcile my feelings. 

This baby is part of me, and he/she is a child of mine just like my son and daughter are. I'm ashamed the thought even crossed my mind, and I was wrong to feel the way I did. I spoke to Caroline soon after I posted here, and I told her I was so sorry for not being more involved and I told her that I was scared, but I knew what we have to do. That I love her, and that I want to be there for her and our baby. 

She was relieved, and she confessed that she was scared and hurt by my reaction (which was to basically disappear for a couple days). Since we agreed to keep the baby, we've taken a lot of steps. We've talked about what we want for our future in clear terms. She loves me and I love her, and while marriage isn't in the immediate cards, it will happen sooner than later. She loves my children, and they care for her so much and I know she will be a good mother to them. She wants to too, and I think this is in a way the best possible thing that could happen for all of us. I am so beyond lucky to have her in my life, and so are my children. We are a family now, all of us. 

I struggled with feeling like I was moving on too fast after my wife passed and I still struggle with the rapid pace, but I think things happen for a reason. Several people told me to look at this as a positive, as my late wife would have wanted me to be happy and this is for the best for my children. Its still only been 7 months since she left us, and it is what it is. Its fast. But I do think when I'm with Caroline I'm putting my children first, and she helps me be a better man and a better father. This isn't perfect at all, but its happening and I'm committed to being positive and making the best of it. 

&gt; Relax Nervous Nelly. You have a woman who loves you, loves your kids, (all kids, she's a teacher) and wants to make a life with you. Half the world's men would kill or die to be in your shoes. Have a good life with your bigger family.

Someone said this in my first thread, and they are 100% correct. I've had some things not go my way, but what I have with Caroline is special. I'm taking a much more positive outlook and I am grateful for all that I do have... a beautiful family, a gorgeous loving girlfriend, and a stable life. 

Thanks for reading this far, if you have and thank you to everyone for all the helpful advice. 

ETA: 

**tl;dr** I apologized to my girlfriend and we are keeping the baby. We both are excited for our baby, and we have talked about our future together and we are on the same page.

My girlfriend stopped by after work today and so I had the opportunity to discuss the video that was sent to me.

I took all the advice the community provided me with and attempted to approach it in a very ""matter of fact"" manner.  Her initial reaction was one of shock and embarrassment.  She knew exactly what I was about to say as soon as I mentioned a video.  I did not interject any of my emotions as I had a couple days to process the whole situation and the fact that this had nothing to do with our relationship; rather, it was something that would have been an issue if she were dating me or anyone else.

She was immediately brought to tears and we simply laid down together so she could process it as well and calm down.  I didn't say much as I didn't believe there was anything I could say to make the situation any better and instead just tried to comfort her as best I could.

After the initial shock had worn off, she asked for my opinion on what I would do if it were my video on the Internet.  I told her that I would confront the individual and demand the video be removed or threaten to press charges. (I know that's not the most touchy-feely response, but I don't believe suggesting that we could 'work through it together' would be all that constructive as she knows that I'll side with her on anything.)  

We planned a day trip tomorrow for the two of us to get out for a while and help her take her mind off of everything. She wanted to take some time to let the emotions subside before confronting the individual who uploaded the video (no surprise, it was the ex) and so that's where the story ends for this evening.  For those interested, I will provide additional updates as the issue is finally resolved.

Finally, I would like to thank all of you who took the time to provide me with your insight and opinions.  Having just moved to a new state and not having any close friends who I'd trust with this issue, I sincerely appreciate all the thought that was put into your responses and I truly believe it helped me approach the situation in the best way possible.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_xp6st,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xp6st/updategfs_anonymous_friend_send_me_a_disturbing/,

In just a very short time, a lot of things happened in my life. I don't really want to post an update anymore because it hurts very much just thinking about what happened, but I think you guys deserve to know how everything turned out.

Last Saturday, we really didn't talk much. After I found out that she took an ultrasound without me, I was really mad, so I stopped talking to her that day to calm myself down. The last text I got from her that day said, ""My parents know now"". I replied to that message, but she never messaged me back after that.

Sunday, June 3, I was woken up by a call from her. When I answered, it turns out it was her parents on the phone. They called to tell me that they already know what happened. They also told me that their daughter ran away from home and they have no idea where she is. They have already contacted her friends, but none of them knew where she is. Eventually, I found out from one of her friends that she went to her aunt's friend's house, so I was at ease.

I met up with her friends that night because they were worried as well. They also wanted to talk to me about what has been happening since the incident started. We've found out a lot of inconsistencies on what my girlfriend has been telling us.

The first and most important fact of all, her aunt's ""friends"" turned out to be just one guy. All this time, my girlfriend has been telling me that her aunt's friends are a girl and a guy. Also, everyone knew about that guy except me. Even her friends thought that I know the existence of that guy.

After finding out about that, everything made sense to me:

* Last April, she met up with her aunt and her aunt's friends a lot of times. In all of those times, she spent the night at her aunt's friend's place.

* When she got the ultrasound, she went there with her aunt's ""friends"".

* When she ran away from home, she went to her aunt's friend's place and has been staying there since.

* She has been avoiding contact with me even until now because my sister told her that she's been suspecting that there really is another guy and that the baby isn't mine.

Anyway, it shouldn't take a sherlock to piece everything together and come to the conclusion that the father is her aunt's ""friends"", which is actually just one guy.

To be honest, I don't really have any proof of that, but she hasn't contacted me since last Saturday. Today, she also deleted me from Facebook. I asked her friends why she doesn't want to talk to me, and they told me that she said she isn't ready to talk to me. At this point, I just want to know what is wrong with me for her to cheat on me. I want to know what to change about myself, so this won't happen to me again.

So yeah, we actually broke up today, indirectly. I guess I'm relieved that I got my life back, but I'm seriously broken hearted right now. Anyway, if you've been reading my previous posts and are still reading it right now, I want to thank you for reading what I have to say and having a share of my experience as well. I feel better knowing that there are random strangers on the Internet who give a damn about my situation.

**Edit**: I never suspected her of cheating during our relationship. Her friends have been calling me out because I was allowing her to go out all the time and I never stopped her even once. I was doing this because I want a relationship where we can have peace of mind and not worry about what the other person is doing when the other isn't around.

It's been a rough week.  

1. Left her a note before going to work while she was sleeping (works nights @ hospital).  Moved into a friend's place.  Note explained that I found the texts she had with L, how things have felt so wrong lately, and that I was leaving her.  I set a date for a face to face.  Date was today (Sunday, 6/30/13) to talk about how to tell our parents and what to do with our living situation - reminder: we were half way through a 2 year lease.

2.  Rough week @ work, lots of text from her saying how sorry she is. I make no efforts to contact and stick to my guns to not communicate until Sunday.  A voice mail begging me to come home almost does me in.

3. Meet up with intention to talk about how we will tell our families and friends and it was **traumatic**.  Loud sobs, a lot of begging.  It was really painful to watch.  I wanted nothing more but to make her hurt stop but there was nothing I could do.  At one point, she pulls out a ring (some male engagement/wedding band she bought for me - I've never seen it before) and begs me again and again to stay.  I, almost stubbornly and mindlessly, repeat ""It's too late."" to every attempt/suggest that I at least think about it.  I'm not sure if I made a mistake, but I know I can never forget what happened. 

4. We end up calling our relative families.  Her dad sounds incredibly disappointed in her.  My mother sounds almost giddy (they didn't get along too well).  My father is overseas and sounds grim.  We are officially done. Set another face to face a week from now to work out logistics - just getting the phone calls out were enough emotional strain for the day.

I am haunted by her desperation.  There were a lot of tears from her and a little from myself.  Heavy, loud sobs from her; the kind I imagine a mother would give if she lost her child.  

I can't shake her frantic scramble to exhume the ring she bought for me and show me after I repeatedly refused her.  Or the time she snatched my phone from my hand and ran into the bathroom to try to get me not to leave (she is only in there for a minute, comes to her senses, and comes out to give me my phone back).  I replay these scenes over and over in my mind.  Each time is incredibly painful.  The emotional infidelity aside, I still care very deeply for her and it is destroying me to had seen her writhe.

Update 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c5383/update_i_34f_took_the_first_step_toward_ending_my/

I want to thank you for all the support and level-headed advice you have given to me, Reddit!  It had been invaluable in helping me come to the point I am today, which is making a definite decision to leave.

Last Saturday, I came to my husband excited about a new development in my home-based business.  I had been thinking and planning and decided to move my business out of my house, find an office, and expand.  I excitedly told him my preliminary plans, and his response was, ""Ah, yeah, great.""  I asked him what he thought about various things and he didn't really respond, and then when I asked him what he thought about the office space and what I should look for, he said, ""Why are you asking me?  I'm not a businessman.  You figure it out.""  My heart broke in two right then and there.  I was asking my husband to listen and support me with something that is not only really important to me but also to our family, which is something he should have been doing all along, and he can't even manage a shred of enthusiasm.  This isn't what I want.  When I told him how I felt, he dismissed me, and when I pursued the conversation, he punched my laptop keyboard in.

Yesterday solidified it all when my 13 year old daughter came inside and handed me a grocery bag with a box of chocolates.  She had walked two miles to the store and bought them for me for Mother's Day.  I thought about how much she must have struggled with wanting to get me something and not knowing how to do it, and not being able to ask her own father for help.  It didn't feel good at all, and I want to show her that marriages shouldn't be like this.  I want her to grow up and marry someone who will take her children to buy a Mother's Day card.  IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO EXPECT!!!

I have tried for 14 years.  I've made every excuse I can think of for his behavior.  I've blamed myself for everything.  But I'm not doing it anymore.  I deserve better!  Once I get out and settled and find myself again, I'm going to go out and find someone who thinks I'm worth something... someone who I can talk to and who treats me with kindness and respect.  It won't be hard.  I have a lot to offer.

My plan is to stay in the house until I can get my office and really get rolling.  My business is small group tutoring, so I won't really be starting until the new school year in September.  I crunched some numbers and I found that if I can get 40 slots in my classes filled, I can support myself.  I already have 22 filled, and I have quite a few more people who are interested.  I think I can do this.  

But, in the meantime, I'm avoiding him and sleeping on an air mattress in the living room.  If I thought it would help, I would talk to him, but it won't, and he clearly doesn't want to.  For the first time in 14 years, I'm ok with this.  I'm at peace...it's a quiet, sad kind of peace, but it's better than the alternative.

However, if anyone has any advice on how to get through the next few monthsof living here, how to handle the separation, or any other divorce advice, I'm all ears!

TL;DR:  I am leaving!  I'm in a flurry of emotions, but feeling good about the whole thing overall.  Thank you for all your help, Reddit!",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_1e8mgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e8mgg/update_2_i_34f_took_the_first_step_to_ending_my/,

**Original TL;DR:  GF [of now-3+ years] got pregnant even with an IUD in place. Risks to her make abortion the best option, but we're mentally and emotionally fucked up right now.**

---
This is a bit rambling and unfocused; I apologize in advance.  It's been a long, emotional five months.  Even though things could've gone much worse for us, I would not wish the decision we faced on anyone.

To start off with, we did abort.  After lots of talking and lots of what-ifs, she said that she would be 100% with whatever I wanted to do, and I still couldn't get beyond the pregnancy putting her at risk.  I'd love to tell you that we were sad for a couple days but got over it quickly, but that'd be a terrible lie.

The day after the abortion, she began to self harm again.  When we first met, she cut almost daily (She had a lot feelings of worthlessness thanks in large part to a verbally-abusive mother, as well as partially being blamed for a family member getting in trouble for molesting her.) Getting out of that environment helped her get to going months between harming incidents, but this triggered her.  She would cut almost daily, and at one point she cut ""I'm Sorry"" onto her abdomen.  She took 100% of the blame for the situation, even though I tried to tell her it was my/our decision and that I should at least get half of the blame.

I was a mess as well.  I knew that what she was going through was a possibility after the abortion and I still went with that decision.  I felt like a monster not only for the decision I made, but for putting my fears of losing her above her well-being. I blamed myself 100% for the entire situation because in the beginning it was my sperm and in the end it was my choice.

I didn't talk to anyone about it at first.  Her insurance didn't cover mental health services, and my insurance didn't exist. There are no-cost therapists in my city, but the wait would've been quite significant (6-8 weeks).  I dialed the Exhale support line so many times, but I could never bring myself to press 'send.'  I tried to talk to my mom about it a few days after the abortion, leaving a message for her that said I had something important to discuss.  When she called back that night, I chickened out.  I talked about other things that bothered me (and there was a lot), but not what I just went through.  She couldn't bring herself to talk to her friends about it either.

A few weeks later (about one month after the abortion), I decided to finally talk to someone at work about things.  I immediately felt *so* much better, like I was no longer keeping this dark secret.  Just the fact that someone else knew about what I was going through was a huge relief.  That's the one thing I hope people take from all of this: **talk to someone.**  My girlfriend told one of her friends a week after that, and she felt the same way.  At the very least, we had someone to suffer with.

The weird part about all of this is that our relationship didn't feel strained.  Sure we were both miserable as hell, but I never wanted out.  I was afraid as hell that one day she'd look at me and say ""this is YOUR fault"" and leave me.  I talked to her about it and she told me she felt the same way; that I'd wake up one day and decide that she was a monster and kick her to the curb.  We might have doubted that we'd *actually* make it through everything together, but we never doubted that we *wanted* to make it through everything together.  We did a lot of talking and we're of the same mind when it comes to this experience: While we think we made the right decision, we never want to go through it again, and if we were faced with the same decision tomorrow, we'd probably choose differently.

The self-harming has... well, I can't say stopped, but it's back to as often as it was before all of this happened, which is once every 4-6 months.

Fast forward to a few days ago.  She had a dream where she broke up with me and I responded nonchalantly.  It made her think about some things and wanted to make some changes in her life so that when we do get married (and it is now a question of when, not if), we'll start on the best foot possible.  One of the changes she mentioned is that she wanted us to see a counselor, together and/or separately.  I asked her if she was ready to talk about what we went through and she said yes.  I think I'm ready too.  We'll start seeking one out in earnest after Easter weekend.

**New TL;DR: Aborted. Things sucked for a long time. We both blamed ourselves, neither blamed each other. We eventually talked to friends and started to heal.

There will be a brief TL;DR at the end, but it'd help more if you read the whole thing.

Basically, I'm 15 and my mum has just gotten a new boyfriend, my mum is 37 and he is 50.
The age difference makes me uneasy to start with, but okay, not my place to judge.
The guy has a lot of history, he used to have schizophrenia, he's been in prison lots, has done a lot of drugs and was, well he still is, involved with a lot of gangs. Again, not my place to judge, but it just makes me feel wary that my mum is dating someone like this.

Anyway, since it's new year's my mum and I went to a gathering around our neighbours, our neighbour is the sister to my mums new boyfriend. 

We go round there, it's just me, my mum, her boyfriend, the neighbours grandchild (They neighbours have gone out.) and some guy my mums boyfriend brought round, lets call him Tom, who was clearly high as fuck on something.

It was going fine, although Tom kept making me feel uncomfortable by commenting on my appearance and staring at me. My mums boyfriend asks me if I want to play the PS3 game the grandchild is playing, then shouts at the grandchild for not letting me play it. I told him no, I didn't want to, it's fine, but he keeps insisting and shouting at the grandchild. This was kind of annoying me, he wasn't listening to what I was saying.


Anyway, he then decides he want's to order food, I say I'm no hungry, still not listening, then telling me to stop being stupid. So I just say something to get him to shut up. I'm the one who answering the door, he gives me £20 to give to the man when he comes.

 Foods taking ages, so I go home to check on my dog who's scared of fireworks, being new year's eve there's some going off. So, the food comes when I'm checking on my dog, he pays for It with separate money, when I come back I give him the £20 back since it wasn't used, he insists I keep it, finally I just say okay, then he says ""Kiss on it?"" then comes over and tries to kiss me. Not like full on, just a peck, but this makes me really uncomfortable.

I don't like my personal space invaded. My mother knows this and says nothing. He also said a couple of lewd things about my appearance. 

Well, I go into the kitchen where him and my mum are, just to get a drink. He then proceeds to get really close to me and tell me to just relax and be myself, although I am being myself. He then asks why I spend so much time by myself and asks why I don't come over here (My mum works a lot.). I just say how I don't mind spending time by myself, because I genuinely don't. I go to walk out the room then he grabs my wrist and pulls me back into the kitchen, telling my that's a load of rubbish. Invading my personal space again.

The neighbours come back and since it's now 12am, loads of fireworks are going off. The grandchild sees this as an opportunity to run off, okay this is usual behavior for him. My mothers boyfriend starts to get angry and smashes something on the floor, then starts yelling. My mum sees this as a sign to go home, so we do.

He knows he's upset us then knocks on our window, my mum lets him in, acts like everything's fine even after she see's I'm visibly upset by him. Okay, I do sound a bit selfish, but it's not nice when a parent doesn't stick up for you.


So, anyway, I'm being a bit short with him, my mum calls me selfish then goes round my neighbours, leaving me on my own for the rest of the night. I assumed she'd be coming back. It's now 7am, and my neighbours lights are off, she's obviously staying round there, or gone round his, which is quite far away.

TL;DR: My mums new boyfriend makes me feel really uncomfortable, has a short temper, she knows this but she's staying round there's this new years without even telling me, leaving me on my own.

Am I just being a spoiled, whinny brat? I feel like I am. Also, the only reason I got so upset over the aggression is because my father was physically and mentally abusive to my mother, just mentally to me, and I just can't stand being around people like that. It brings back memories. 


Do I have a right to be upset?

I just think my mother deserves better.


I'd also like to add that my mothers new boyfriend has made quite a few racist and homophobic comments, I don't really like being around people like that either.


EDIT: My mum finally came home at 15:30, I told her about it and well she just said he wasn't being serious when he said any of that and she told me to get a grip.

 She also said that I need to stop dictating her life, she's an adult and can do what she wants and that I just don't know him well enough to say I don't like him. 
I'm being too judgmental, according to her. 

Oh and apparently he can't be racist, because he's got black friends. 

Any advice on what to do now? 

What should I say to her? 

I can talk to my auntie, she lives in Germany so she can't physically stop anything, but she may be able to talk some sense into my mum.



EDIT 2: So talking to her is pretty much useless, she ends up just screaming go away at me over and over again. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I used to really close with my mum but I can tell we're just going to drift apart after this. 

I mentioned how I might want to go live somewhere else, like my aunties, for a little while and she didn't really care. I think I know where I stand now. 

My mums is acting like this because apparently she always does what I want, so instead of that she's doing what she wants from now on.

My husband's birthday is in two weeks and I've been scouring through all of our pictures to make something really special for him. He has a couple external hardrives which I thought just had pictures and movies. I ran across some weird things while looking for pics of us. I wasn't even snooping. I ended up finding several folders of screenshots with my Husband (then boyfriend) talking to girls either on Chatroullette/Omegle and Skype. Hundreds of pictures. Literally over years. And most of the girls looked to be between like 15 and 18. Fucked up. 

I'm shaking at this point and I now start snooping legitimately. I guessed his email and fb passwords and I've been looking through all of his emails and messages. Dumb ass didn't delete anything. The picture I've been able to put together is he started talking to girls off these type of sites in 2009 and has been doing it consistently since then. There are like 4 girls he talks to regularly. One started when the girl was 15.... in his defense it doesn't seem like anything sexual is going on but its weird that he is basically best friends with a HS Freshman. Two are 18 now.... 16 or 17 when it started up. And another one is HS aged. I can't figure out her exact age though. She looks young. 

Basically he has been having cyber sex, nude chats, personal chats with three of the four girls. The one thing that is sickening to me and makes me want to die is that he had actual sex with one of them. Last year before we got married he got cold feet and broke up with me and we were not together for a month. During that month he went to visit his teenage girlfriend and fucked her for a week straight. And then came back to me and told me he made the biggest mistake of his life and loves me and wants to marry me. 

I'm furious at him. I'm disgusted by him. This is so fucked up. We haven't even been married for that long and we've been trying to have a baby. And now this. He is basically a huge fraud. I don't know if I don't know him or if he changed or what. I haven't confronted him yet and don't know how to. Is there any way our marriage can survive this? I don't want to get divorced after less than a year Kardashian style but I really don't think I can look at him the same anymore. Any, any help is appreciated.

So, this party has been in the works for about three weeks. The boyfriend (turning 22) has no idea it's happening. I talked to my roommates about having it at the apartment and each of them said it would be fine. 

Now, I have this one roommate whom I'm going to call Brittney (Age 23). Brittney is pretty much everything I hate about people wrapped into one package. She lied to a close friend of mine about being on birth control and is now pregnant with him waiting on her hand and foot. She's a huge hypocrite and thinks that be openly admitting she is she's allowed to continue being that way. (""I know that's hypocritical of me, but that's just how I am. I'm sorry you don't like who I am."" -When it was pointed out that she was OCD about everyone's stuff but never would clean up her food from the living room). So, I was mildly surprised when she said she was cool with me having my boyfriend's party here. She said she was going to stay at her mother's place this weekend anyway. 

Anyway she left for her mother's on Thursday and came back this morning. I asked her boyfriend (close buddy of mine) if she was planning on going back. He said he wasn't sure, but he didn't think so. So, I asked her if she was planning on sticking around for the party. 

""Oh, yeah, you can't have that anymore. I talked to my mother and we think it's selfish of you to kick me out of MY apartment when I'm pregnant."" 

Now, for the record, she was really nice about this before. This is the first time she voiced any issues with it. We have friends coming from out of state for this, so I can't just shut it down now. I really don't know what to do. She says if I throw it, she'll go out of her way to make sure it flops. 

**TL;DR: Pregnant roomie said I can have boyfriend's party in apartment while she was at mother's place. Came home and states I'm selfish wanting to throw the party in the first place and is planning on making everyone at the party miserable if it is thrown.

I received a lot of great correspondenses. Some were encouraging while others were more protective over both my emotions and his, but I took all of them to heart and even though some of you warned that it may ruin whatever is left of our friendship, I still decided to take the chance. I couldn't go on into 2012 without knowing if he still felt for me what I felt for him, or not.  
At first, I was afraid I would chicken out. I was kinda tipsy and unsure of what to do. I was especially unsure of how to get him alone since there were at least 20 of our close friends around us. Eventually I found the opportune moment while we were outside. I waited for everyone else to leave before wrapping my arms around him and embracing him. I gave him a smooch, and told him I still loved him. At first he didn't say anything, but then I saw this huge smile come across his face. He kissed me back and told me that he did in fact still feel the same way! He was just too chicken to say something sooner. I felt like a giddy little schoolgirl.  
We chatted for a little about us and about everything. Those of you who read my first post will know that his mom recently passed and that was the biggest reason why we broke up. I made sure he knew that I am there for him and that I understand why he pushed me away. He kept apologizing over and over for pushing me away and being all emo. We still have a lot of work, but I'm confident that we can sort that all out and be a couple again.  
I have literally been smiling since this happened and I'd like to thank all of you guys for all of your input! Without your support I probably wouldn't have gone through with it or wouldn't have gotten the closure that I wanted and needed. Happy New Year to you all!

We were absolutely happy for many of those 15 years but the last 4 have been rough.  

Just as a background,  We're both college educated, she's 36, I've never been unemployed and earn enough that my wife has always had the option to stay home or work, I'm OK either way.  She's chosen to dabble in photography, write, help out at the kids school.. stuff like that.  I'm not the husband that's off at the bar after work or off playing golf every weekend.  I make sure her and I have a date night every 2 weeks and I try to make it special with dressing well and all that.  We have a great sex life, at least once a day she's interested and will make the first move if I don't.  I know this shouldn't matter but, she's amazingly pretty and I'm just your slightly below average looking guy.  I don't ditch all the house work on her although I admittedly do less than I probably should.  I work a lot but it's the nature of my career, it's not optional.   

So for 15 years we've been married and the first 12 I think were amazing.  After we had our first child she quit work and was a fantastic mom and with our second she was just the same.  Around year 12 though things changed.  She became depressed and withdrawn at times.   Her days consist of sleeping 12 hours, taking care of the kids after school and working out a lot.   So she started seeing a therapist, got on meds, things were better for a while and then would start to slip again.  I encouraged her to take up some hobbies or start a small company so she dabbled in photography for a bit, started to write a book, things like that.  Still the depression lingered.  

After 3 years of her seeing a therapist he asked me to come have a coffee with him.  Odd, I know.  He explained that although he should never do something like this he just couldn't live any longer and not tell me.  He calmly explained that my wife confided in him that she never loved me from day 1, instead I was just a convenient next step in her life post college.  She explained this to the therapist during her very first session with him 3 years ago and he worked with her to see if there was some underlying reason, there is not.  Her realization that she never loved me is what has her depressed.  The therapist further explained that she's never really loved anyone.  She loves her kids in a nurturing way but she doesn't feel love the way most people typically do.   This all came as such a shock to me I had made sure we were talking about the same woman and he didn't get his case notes mixed up or something.

Further more, he encouraged her to talk to me about this but after 3 years he realized she will not and has no intention on ever leaving me.   

I really love her and I have never doubted it for even a moment.  I'm so much not an emotional type but when I look at her I can't help but think gooey romantic crap.  I love coming home to her, I love kissing her, I feel like a god when I'm between her thighs.   She acts loving to me when she's not really down in the dumps depressed.  Now, unfortunately, I know the truth.  Her depression is due to me.  When I look at her that's all I think at this point and while the sting will likely lessen I doubt it will ever completely leave my mind.

Options?
If I get a divorce I'll be seeing my kids a lot less and I love spending time with them.  Also there's the chance she'll remarry and that guy could be an asshole to them or worse yet.  By staying with her I guarantee my kids are raised well and are safe.  I'll have the opportunity to find someone that really loves me.  Then again I could find myself alone for the rest of my life or settling.

Staying together means I either have to shove this knowledge out of my head and continue to love her even though I know the truth.   I am worried now that she's cheated or actively cheats even though the therapist said she has never suggested to him that she has.  I could possibly end up completely resenting her, hating her in fact.  

Finally, is her determination to stay with me her version of love?  Is that just an excuse to make this all feel better?  

This sucks.

TL;DR: Wife's therapist told me she has never loved me and now do I stay or do I leave her?

**Update:** I seems pretty unanimous that this therapist is up to no good.  I talked with my brother and he believes the same thing.  The thought has crossed my mind as well seeing as he's roughly our age and not married.  I just have to decide how I'm going to go about this.  

I think I'm just going to talk to my wife and ask her to see a different therapist in an entirely different office.  Go with the whole, ""It's been 3 years and little progress, lets try someone new"" approach.  Part of me wants to talk to her about what this therapist told me, see her reaction, see if she then agrees with what he said and see what she wants to do.  I think, though, that playing this with a cool mind and just encouraging her to see someone a bit more professional is the way to go.  See how things pan out.   

I haven't fully decided what to do yet... and with Halloween and our neighborhood throwing a huge party I probably won't make that decision today.

So, I told him. We were hanging out and trying to decide where we wanted to order food from and I said ""just quickly before we do that, can I talk to you about something?"" 

And then I told him, and I took all of your advice (for the most part...) - That I'm sorry, I didn't want for it to be a secret, I just wanted to get it over with and I didn't want to stress him out over something that was *way* outside of his realm of control, etc.

And he took it *really* well. I mean, I started crying halfway through telling him (apparently my hormones are gonna be ~*~*wEiRd*~*~ for the next little bit, not looking forward to that), so that probably helped with the pity angle. He just held me and we both cried for a bit and he said he's sorry I had to do it alone, he wishes he had been there. And then we got into a talk about his anxiety problems (they just started existing a couple of months ago) and he's decided he's going to try and get some therapy, because he doesn't want me having to hide this sort of stuff from him because he wants to be able to be there for me without his anxiety being a major factor - although I was *very* careful to say that I do not blame him, or his anxiety or anything at all - it's just a thing that happened the way it did, no one is really at fault.

Then we ordered some thai food and watched Netflix and cuddled. 

So yeah. Everything went amazing, much better than expected. Thank you all so much for your love and support, I wouldn't have been brave enough to tell him without you guys, etc. 

**tl;dr** Told boyfriend. He took it well, completely understood where I was coming from. Decided that he wants to get therapy to deal with his anxiety, which is a fun added bonus.

I've been on a few dates, but they usually end after one or two, or I develop a strong friendship with that girl, with romance off the table pretty quickly.  In fact a few of my close female friends started as dates.

I'm fairly normal.  In shape, work out a lot, run a ton.  Somewhat nerdy and awkward, science career.  Not a complete social pariah, but pretty introverted.  I have lots of hobbies I like.  I moved to a new area about a year ago, and have few nearby friends, but lots of long-time, close friends that I contact frequency through text, skype, gaming.

I just can't seem to get romance down, and it's really eating away at me.  I know I need to be more confident, get myself out there, just enjoy life by myself, and I will meet women naturally.  But I was doing that for the first 25 years of my life, with no girlfriends.  My entire life, I figured it was due to a lack of trying, of being happy alone.  But over a year and a half ago, I started trying to connect with women on a romantic level, and ended up doing horribly.  Tried talking women in public, and I choke.  Tried online dating, paid, on 3 different sites, and no more than a few failed dates, and *So Many* messages sent out...  Now I'm approaching my 27th birthday, and it's the biggest stresser in my life.  

I feel alone, desperate, and constantly stressed.  I'm tired of wishing I had a woman in my life, tired of falling asleep alone in bed, and wanting to start a family.  Having never had a woman have any kind of romantic interest in me, I just feel hopeless.  I can't even fake being confident anymore.

I don't really know what to do.

This is my first real relationship, but he's had other relationships before me. We go with the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on former lovers, but from context clues I've picked up that he's had his fair share.

Last night, I was trying to initiate sex which is always difficult to accomplish on my end.  On my third attempt, my boyfriend goes looking for something. After some searching, he comes back and says he found what he was looking for: a sex toy. A few days earlier, he had brought up introducing sex toys to the bedroom and I was on board and enthusiastic. Of course, I kind of assumed we would be buying one. We were even joking about how gross it would be if tried to save money by searching through the bargain bin for a used one. 

When he mentioned using the toy he was already in possession of, I was immediately turned off. I asked if it was used and he responded with a ""Well, yeah. of course. You just boil it to clean it."" I became super uncomfortable and sort of pissed. I told him that I was absolutely not interested in putting something in me that he had put in other girls. I didn't know how to interpret my reaction or deal with my emotions and kind of shut down for the night. I distracted myself with reddit, but since I was actively trying to not think about the situation it kept popping up in mind and was met with waves of revulsion and anger.

I really just want to get a handle on my feelings. I'm not sure why I have such a strong visceral reaction to this and I'm not sure why it pisses me off that he would offer to use such an intimate object that was used in a (or several, I'm not sure) past relationship. I'm not sure if he thought the fact that he knew the women it was used on made it less gross than if it were used on a stranger, but those women are strangers to me and their connection with my boyfriend makes it so much worse.

So...why am I feeling this way? I know he wasn't being malicious, but he was probably being an idiot. How do I get over feeling so angry and grossed out?

tl;dr: Boyfriend wanted to use sex toys he had used in previous relationships. Why am I so angry and repulsed by his suggestion? How do I get over those feelings?

Edit: I'm gathering that, for me, it's more about the history of the toy than anything. There's a, not necessarily rational but instinctual, repulsion of using a pre-used toy, as well. I'd have to agree with those that say this is mostly stemming from my own insecurities. I'll even reluctantly agree that I'm being childish to an extent. Lucky for me, I have an awesome boyfriend that loves and respects me. I think I can approach him about how I feel and why I reacted the way I did, and (thanks to everyone's input!) make sure he understands he's not in the wrong. I don't think it's something I'll be comfortable with, but he's not a  bad person or anything for approaching me with it. And we'll absolutely make a shopping trip in the near future.

Also, come on guys, I know that his penis has been in other girls! I was even trepidatious about using that line because I figured people would go there with it. I included it just because that's pretty much went down and what I said. He seemed to gather what I meant, so picking apart the semantics of it is a bit silly.

Don't know what to say/do.,firsttimethrowaway11,296,58,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16lu16/my_20s_m_girlfriends_20s_f_stepdad_confessed_his/,"This could get lengthy. I'm going to change names and a few details to try to protect identities. This is a throwaway but it's also my first post ever. 

I started dating my current girlfriend in September. She has always been very close to her parents. Her biological dad cut ties with her when she was a kid; her step-dad married her mom when she was around 4 and has basically been her dad; that is the person she considers her dad. I'll be referring to him as her dad for the rest of this post.

Again, she has always been close with her parents; through high school, college, and beyond she has generally chosen to stay home and spend time with them rather than go out and be with friends. She and her dad have been especially close. He has also been very protective of her. Only in the last year or so has she started to venture out on her own and experience things for herself. Around the time she started going out, drinking with other people, etc... her relationship with her dad started to deteriorate. When she started dating me, their relationship fell apart completely. 

Over the course of the next couple of months it came to a point where her dad was calling her a slut (even before we had sex or anything; she was a virgin), a bitch, and other terrible names. Her parents kicked her out of their house around November. The way she described the things he said and the way he was acting sounded exactly like a jealous ex-boyfriend; even though I had barely spoke to him, I was 90% sure he had feelings for her in some form even if he hadn't accepted it himself. This was reaffirmed when two different people that knew her and knew him said the same thing without me ever mentioning my suspicions. 

In the following weeks she and her parents had pretty much severed ties other than him occasionally texting her more terrible things, basically calling her a whore and so on. She has broken down in tears several times talking about it because she had always been so close to them and that relationship had been completely severed; they were also spreading lies to her family trying to turn them against her.

To save you all some reading we'll fast forward to tonight. After a little alcohol and a lot of tears, she finally opened up with the whole story. Sometime in the last year or two her dad confessed to her that he had feelings for her; trying to justify it because he ""wasn't her real dad"", among other things. She was absolutely disgusted, but tried to get things back to normal as best she could. But instead of trying to fix things or take anything back, her dad basically started treating her like crap because she didn't return his feelings. She was always far from being fat, but for a couple of years she was a little heavier than she is now (skinny now, about average or so the couple of years before that) and he would try to tell her that he loved her even when she was heavier, but I only liked her now that she's skinny; all kinds of things like that.

Apparently he finally told her mom about his feelings around August. She had always been jealous of their close relationship, and instead of leaving him or anything she basically blamed my girlfriend and started to turn on her. Before that, she had generally had my girlfriend's back despite her dad's controlling ways. 

There is one more thing she told me that she isn't sure if her mom knows or not. Earlier this year, before we were dating, there was one drunken night we kissed each other. When she got home she passed out. Her dad came into her room; thinking he was me (she doesn't remember any of this, this is all according to her dad; he even said she called him by my name) she told ""him"" (again calling him by my name) that it was ok to kiss her again. He did. She doesn't remember anything about it, but he said he didn't do anything beyond that, but he gave her a real kiss. Not a father-daughter type kiss. 

She feels humiliated and dirty and violated. I want to beat the crap out of this piece of shit more than I ever have anyone in my life. I know she still loves him as her father, but that relationship is nonexistent at this point. He isn't sorry; he doesn't care that he has completely fucked up her life; he only cares about himself and the fact that she doesn't want to be with him like that. He has turned her mom against her, he is lying to her whole family. She is completely heartbroken. 

What I told her tonight is that since he has made it clear that is the only kind of relationship that he wants with her that she has to cut ties with him completely, probably forever as hard as that is. I don't even hold it against him for having those feelings; feelings are a hard thing to control. But the fact that he acted on those feelings and was willing to completely fuck up her life because of them makes him a complete and utter piece of shit.

 I also told her to send her mom one last email. She may know everything, she may not. But she needs to explain to her mom exactly what happened, how violated she was, how much this fucked her up. If her mom still chooses to side with her dad, then she needs to cut her out of her life for good too.

Her extended family knows how good and awesome of a person she is and is completely siding with her in all this, but none of them know about the feelings her dad shared with her or the things he did. I really hope she will seek some counseling in all this because I don't even know where to begin other than to hold her and tell her I will always have her back.

Any advice? Anything I can tell her? I've told her a whole lot that none of this is her fault and it is all on him, and if her mom refuses to support her despite the fucked-up-ness of this situation then it's just as much on her. I just realized how much I really overuse semi-colons and didn't change any names like I promised in the beginning because I didn't use any names. But either way, any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

TLDR: Girlfriend is treated like crap by her parents. Finally comes out that her dad is in love with her and calls her a slut because she doesn't want to be with him.

I have been single for almost a month now, and my progress is evident- though my pain still cannot be overstated. However, I feel that I have gained enough footing to share what I have learned and hopefully help someone in the process!

Writing this will be therapeutic for me, but I truly hope that it reaches at least one person who is feeling as distraught as I was when my ex left me.

Backstory: I am a 21 year-old male who was in a 10 month long relationship with a 21 year-old female. We practically lived together and became one. There was much promise and talk of the future, and it was a very intense, loving relationship- quite healthy! However, my ex became despondent in our last few weeks of dating. She confessed that feelings for her ex had resurfaced, and so as not to hurt me further, she decided to be single. I should mention that she said she has no intention of returning to her ex (as it was an extremely damaging relationship), but she is clearly not giving her all right now to ours and needs to be single. Since this was not mutual, I was shattered. I didn’t understand what was going on, yet she remained adamant in her decision.
So, without further ado…

The breakup:
Regardless of who does this, it doesn’t feel good for either side- even if it doesn’t show immediately. If you are being dumped, it is very likely that your ex will protect themselves by showing anger or frustration with you. They will use unfair justifications for their breakup with you, but you need to take it for now. When my GF dumped me, she used examples that were hardly worthy of a breakup and all showed promise of being fixable. This was in addition to her own rationalization by saying that I deserve better because she hasn’t been treating me well in our relationship. The classic “it’s not you, it’s me.” (I see that she was right, now.) 

Your partner may become frustrated because you’re not understanding. They will say things that will damage you and look like they’re having fun in the process, and you will sit there and wonder how the hell a person who once loved you so much can hurt you so badly. I assure you, this is a mask they are wearing. And honestly, they might even wear it for a few weeks or even months. When my ex dumped me, she went out and partied a ton, as I stood by and watched her on facebook, twitter and instagram. She posted tweets about “true love” which were likely referring to her ex (who also wants nothing to do with her now). In an age of instant &amp; constant connectivity, nothing but heartache awaits you on social media (See no contact rule below).

I would be surprised to learn that anyone who hasn’t been broken up with yet is reading this, but I will dispense this advice anyways: retain your composure during the final moments. The moment of my ex leaving me is forever burned in my mind. My vision tunneled as I listened to her tell me the words I never thought I’d hear come out of her mouth. My heart sank into my stomach. I wanted to drop to the floor and cry, vomit, or punch her straight in the mouth. Thankfully, neither of these things happened.

Truly, the best response you can elicit during the breakup is professionalism. Do not show extreme emotion. Verbalize your disagreement (if you disagree), and tell them this is not mutual, and make sure they are aware of what they’re doing. No combination of words is going to bring you back at this point. Even if it seems sudden, I promise that they’ve been contemplating this until they’ve reached a breaking point. You have every right to defend yourself, but do not become hot-headed and clumsy. Let this moment transpire with as much grace as possible. Don’t make them pity you because you still want to be with them. Let them go through with their decision. After all, if they cave and decide not to end things, it’s only a matter of time before they build up the strength to do it again. I convinced my ex that we were right for each other because I broke down and told her how much I love her and all the things I love about her. She agreed that we were fated to be together, and that she couldn’t hurt someone who loved her so much- she changed her mind about the “break” she suggested. Two unsettling days later, she mercilessly broke my heart.

Post-breakup: The Unspeakable Pain

Your world has come crashing down. The emotional rug has been pulled out from underneath you and without closure. I drove home from being dumped and wanted to veer my car off the road. I entered my home, surrounded by photos and memories of us and hit the floor. I screamed and cried. I called my mom, who I don’t have a strong emotional connection with, and sobbed for an hour. I said maybe three words to her. You can’t even begin to process what’s happening. It’s a numbing experience, especially if it’s your first breakup with someone you honestly loved. 
I couldn’t be left alone. I needed to constantly talk about the breakup. I cried at work, and I would say that I cried forcefully at least once every 6 or 7 hours. I couldn’t listen to music or enjoy any of my hobbies. I just sat there, marinating in my own depression. Sometimes, you need to go to those bad places to get yourself back up.

 I ate nothing for three days and ran about 65 miles that week (I am a distance runner, but that kind of distance was unhealthy at this point in my season and especially with such little nutrition). I turned to alcohol and cigarettes for a few days. I would wake up in the middle of the night and sob because she wasn’t there, or because I just had a dream about her. The nights were the most difficult, because I had nothing but my thoughts in the darkness to keep me company, knowing that she was probably sound asleep and happy with her decision. Just power through it, it’s really all you can do during those dark moments.

I’d constantly think I would hear her car pulling in the driveway thinking that she’d be showing up to reconcile things. Other times, I’d feel stronger and I would find brief moments of comfort- only to be torn back down by a relapse or some kind of emotional trigger. I would defend her if people called her a bitch or disrespected her for hurting me. People telling me “you’ll move on, you’re a great guy” was far from the words I wanted to hear.

Sound familiar? Perhaps you didn’t handle it exactly as I did, but at least you understand the level of emotional anguish I suffered. And believe me, we feel the same pain. It might be hard to believe, given the magnitude of your heartache and specificity of your relationship, but the fact remains that a breakup is a breakup, and it hurts the same. Trust me.

If this is the point you’re at in the breakup, stop for a moment. Breathe deeply. You are worthy of love and you will one day be happy and fulfilled again. You were whole before, and can be whole again. I promise. Now, keep reading.

Ok, I know you think that you’ll never be happy again. You can’t even begin to envision a turning point where your happiness will return. You think to yourself that this isn’t fair, or that you just fucked up the best thing that ever happened to you. You might try to contact your ex (again, see no contact below), but I guarantee you won’t find solace in their words- at least, not for long. Even if you discover that they still care about you, it won’t feel good in the long run because it will only give you hopes that could be thrashed. Trust me- nothing they can say will give you any permanent recovery.
Start by ridding yourself of anything that reminds you of them. You don’t have to throw their things away, but get it out of sight. I boxed up every item that my ex gave me and left it with my mother- all the photos, stuffed animals, small gifts, even movies that we watched. Get it out of sight. Then, perhaps you should rearrange your room so you can live in a new, clean environment. Avoid places where you might run into them. What helped me was going back home to my mother’s house and seeing my friends. It was a good reminder that I had a life before my ex. 

You are going to neglect yourself for awhile. Your performance will slip, whether it be in school, work, or even keeping your house clean. You might stop eating, or you might take unhealthy comfort in food. You’ll franticly search the internet for advice, desperate to try anything (after all, that’s what we’re doing here). I urge you to not read guides on “how to get your ex back,” but instead on how to move on. However, don’t become addicted to reading about breakups. By all means, take comfort in and follow good advice, but when you begin looking for closure via the internet, you must realize that the only place you will find such a thing is within. If your friends are encouraging you to go out, do so! Even if you don’t feel like it. You’ll be glad you tried.

Recognize the emotional storm that you’ll be entering. For awhile, you will cry without warning because some sort of trigger reminds you of him/her, and you will want nothing more than to see them again. Some days, you will be empowered- being fully aware that what has happened is nothing unheard of. It was a breakup between two people, these things happen, etc. You will be confident that you’ll find love elsewhere. And other days, you’ll be livid. Filled with rage. How dare they break your heart? Fuck them. Stupid bitch. What an asshole. Why couldn’t they get their shit straight? Too bad you still love them.

Again, sound familiar? Alright, now perhaps you can understand why you can’t talk to them. Until you can find consistency in your emotions, you shouldn’t say anything to them- even if you’re so tempted to find closure.

No Contact:
The cardinal rule of a breakup. If you’ve been reading up on breakups lately, I can guarantee that at least one pattern will emerge: the no contact rule. No contact does not mean that simply aren’t texting or calling them. No contact means you do not see pictures of them (even ones you own). You do not check up on how they’re doing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, anything. Even their family and friends. There should be no flow of information between you two.
I personally blocked my ex on Facebook, but her life still bled into mine via her friends and family. I had to remove them from my news feed. This was especially difficult because her family became like my own during our relationship. I kept checking her twitter account, but only found heartache. I saw that she was going out and having fun without me, while I was moping like a pathetic, sniveling animal. She was posting shit about her ex and moving on and being who she needs to be. It’s painful to look at it. I wanted to see the direction that her emotions were going to head (because “what if?!”), but only found pain. Even when she started posting about making a mistake, being crazy, and being heartbroken- what does that do for me? Now she’s miserable without me- it doesn’t help me to see that, either. Take my advice (and the advice of everyone else who has overcome a breakup), cut the ties that bind. It won’t feel right, but give it at least two weeks with 100% no contact. See how you feel.

My ex still follows me on instagram, but that’s her choice. She keeps in touch with my roommates on facebook to a point where it’s awkward to hear that she’s commenting on their statuses and liking things on their page, when she never would’ve even said a word to them before. She’s probably doing it to keep me around, because she’s still confused but doesn’t want to lose me. Whether your ex is trying to jump around to new relationships to spite you or trying to keep in touch with you, please do yourself a favor and remain calm. If you have to ask that they leave you alone to protect yourself, do so in a civil manner- don’t snap at them. Keep the solitude you need. 

The no contact rule will probably drive them a bit crazy. It’s human nature to want what you can’t have, even though it defies logic. If your ex sees that you’re capable of living happily without them, it will bother them a bit. However, don’t use no contact as a means to get your ex back- the purpose is for self-discovery and healing. You may discover that after 30-60 days of no contact, you might not even want anything to do with your ex. If they weren’t able to keep themselves from stalking you while you were busy putting your life back together to where you can stand strongly (and happily single) on your own two feet, that’s their own fault.

For me, this was the turning point. Eventually there came a day where I became tired of it all. I was tired of having my eating and sleeping habits thrashed by one person. I was tired of mulling it over in my bed all day. I wanted to feel better, and no matter who she was during our relationship, the fact is that she is someone else now. If this is your first love (as it was mine), I’m sorry you’re having your innocence stolen. People change, but not always for the worst. Remain hopeful- and remind yourself that you are worthy of love!

Don’t you DARE let yourself be guilted into helping your ex battle their current demons. You don’t owe them a god damn thing. If your ex reaches out to you for help, they need to know that neither of you are emotionally stable enough to remain in contact. My ex reached out to me and told me she’s sorry, that she misses me, and that she’s wanted nothing more than to call me. It took everything in me not to tell her that everything is okay and that she can come back- that I’ll wait for her. All I told her was “good luck,” and even in the days that followed, I felt like should have bitched her out instead of being nice. You are not emotionally stable. Do not contact your ex. Silence is your friend.

Post-Breakup: The Recovery Process and Fixing Yourself

Hey, the “fun” part! This is when things get interesting. After you’ve been down for so long, you realize that no matter what, it’s time to start to come back up. It’s right to be down- it’s right to feel all this pain, but it’s not right to stay there. Time to work on yourself.

This is when you assume control again. Your ex is finally out of contact, and your tears are drying. Wipe the dirt off! This is when you finally pull your emotions out of the driver seat, grab the wheel with white knuckles, and take yourself where you wish to go. Here are some ways to do that:

-Realize that you’re not alone. You’re so far from being “alone.” You may feel trapped within your own emotions, but so do others. Let your friends and family be your armor. If for some reason you feel like  you can’t confide in them, come to me. I will take care of you, stranger. I don’t care if you believe the holocaust was a good thing or if you like hurling aborted babies at nuns- you are hurting and you need to heal, no matter what differences we share. No matter where you live, what year you were born, the pain is the same. And nobody should have to feel this bad for long.

-Stop being pathetic (ouch- nobody wants to hear that). Sure, it’s okay to do this for a little while- maybe even a few weeks, but there is a word for the lack of motivation. There’s a word for the crying. For not wanting to leave your bed, for neglecting your body, friends, and worklife. That word is depression, and the longer you stay in it, the longer it might take to get out of it. There is no quick fix for it. Work on projects, clean your house. Exercise helps a LOT (insert science and endorphin-talk here). Even if you don’t feel like it’s making you “better” in the moment- that is, even if you still find yourself wanting to cry over your ex while you’re lifting weights or running, the fact is that you’re still going through with the activity. That, despite your immeasurable pain, you’re still doing the right thing. Even through heartache, you’re still looking out for yourself, and that is a very encouraging thought. Because when all of this is over, you’ll come out on top. 

-Knock them off of their pedestal. I know, they’re on a pedestal. After a couple of weeks, I was able to sit down and specifically write out several things I did NOT like about her. However, you must understand that the purpose of this exercise is not to make you hate them (you probably have enough fuel for that already), but to help you acknowledge that they were certainly not perfect for you. After all, if they were perfect for you, they wouldn’t have left you. Something just didn’t click right. It wasn’t until a few weeks out that I realized how dumb and catty my ex was. She was very attractive (I dated a dancer), but looks aren’t everything (clearly). She was mean to me when she was drunk, she was irritable, our sex life was dull, and she often embarrassed me in public when I saw her handle situations poorly and with little articulacy. Oh, and you are absolutely welcome to chalk the breakup experience itself in the negative category, too. It hurt you- it’s a negative.

-Highlight your own attributes. Realize that you did things that made this relationship work. Realize that you were a catalyst for events in someone else’s life and happiness. At the end of the day, you MATTER. I see now that I gave my ex a great sex life, which gives me comfort that if she runs off with some other dude, I can still make a girl happy! I gave her comfort in her anxiety, and honestly- the shit I did for her, nobody will do again. I know there are girls out there who are waiting for a guy like me to come along. Hey, if you’re a girl who is sick of emotional bullshit and just wants a sweet, safe, dependable guy, give me a call :p.

-Actually, on that note- don’t. Don’t jump into a new relationship. What scares me the most is having to meet someone else’s family. I’m terrified of having to enter the dating game again, to feel awkward about whether a girl likes me or not. I feel as though I’ve undid all the work in my last relationship. A rebound might make you feel good for a day or two, but don’t kid yourself. That’s not the way to handle things. If you see your ex enter a new relationship, it will cut you deep… but do chuckle for a moment. They’re missing out on something paramount and crucial to a healthy relationship- comfort within yourself. They’re temporarily filling the void while you’re becoming a fortress. Relationships don’t work when they’re a codependency. You must love yourself before you can love another (see Eternal Wisdom below). Easy there, tiger- take it a day at a time. Clearly, you’re not ready for a relationship right now- even with your ex again. If you’re here reading this, you’re at a crossroads with your emotions, and you need to resolve that yourself before you continue in any direction. 

-I personally don’t identify with a religion or higher power, so I don’t believe that this happened for “a reason” or so that some force could teach me a lesson. However, I believe strongly in the power of self- that you are at least partially in charge of your own destiny. GOOD MORNING, MOTHER FUCKER- YOU JUST WOKE UP. You may not realize it, but you made SO many compromises during your relationship. Now is the time to not compromise ANYTHING. Now is the time to get what you want out of yourself. I have never LOVED my figure- I always feel scrawny and embarrassed to take my shirt off. I’m working very hard to correct that now with ab workouts and a new lifting plan. I am working on my house a lot to improve my living environment. I am planning trips and vacations with so many of my friends, and it’s great to see them and hear from them. When I go out to bars, I don’t search for girls to talk to, but I do notice them. I notice that there are so many other people in the world with complex intricacies and depth, just like my last partner had. Everyone has a story to tell, and I encourage you to find some new reading material. You don’t have to “chase tail,” but meet some people and see that society has been here the entire time!

-Come to terms with the healing power of time. I should mention, time is not the only contributing factor. If you hole yourself up in a room staring at a picture of them for days, time will NOT be your friend. Time only works in your favor if you spend it positively. It’s the currency of life, and you only get so much of it. While you may have to pay your dues to heartbreak, be sure to invest it in healthy activities!

-Keep a diary, or write letters to your ex that you’ll never send. It helps to streamline your thoughts into words that you can read back to yourself and give yourself a sense of understanding. You’re probably thinking so many combinations of thoughts (heartache, anger, grief and depression, acceptance) that if you try to write them out, it may shed some light on what you’re going through. It’s interesting to go back and read what you started with, just to see how much you’ve grown from this. Additionally, making a list of attributes that the “ideal partner” would have can help put into perspective if your ex really gave you all that you desire, in addition to the list of negatives I mentioned earlier. Don’t write this list fresh from the breakup. Give it a couple weeks, otherwise you’ll end up writing about your ex.

-Eventually, it’ll be time to stop talking about it. Don’t make heartache a routine. I became so enveloped in my situation that I would come home and search for breakup advice or begin writing my daily letter to myself or my ex, only to realize that I didn’t need to. I was just done feeling like crap, which represents a lot more progress than I’d find on here!

-You are a walking epiphany now. It’s so fucking awesome. I have learned more about the world and the people in it over the past month than the past year. You are so self-aware, it’s almost frightening. Every day, you will grow- even if it is a day where you hurt relentlessly after a relapse. Everything, no matter the form it assumes, is progress towards a new, wiser you. This is a chance for you to discover exactly who you are, or at least who you are meant to be so you can work towards it. I’ve been trying so many new things- playing new styles of music, listening to new genres, working out harder than ever before, and reading a LOT about the philosophy of self. It’s really been an eye-opening experience! You are not trying to become the person you were before your ex- you should be trying to become someone new.

-Finally, it gets better. You know that it does, and I’m sure you’re tired of reading those words, but it should give you a bit of comfort that you won’t feel awful forever. Imagine having an idle conversation with someone who had their heart broken some time ago, and interrupting them to ask if they are thinking about their ex in that moment or if they still feel heartbroken. I submit no, and that your question would take them by surprise. For me, it comes in the form of envisioning a life beyond my current one. I fantasize about finishing up my undergraduate degree in a year, moving far away from this place- out of this house, out of this bedroom that harbored most of the relationship for my ex and I, and beginning anew. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I realize that I don’t want to have to commit to a long-distance relationship with someone who I now don’t believe to be perfect.

Forgiveness, Acceptance, and Acknowledging your Assistance in the Demise of the Relationship:

-Forgiveness is very slow and hard to make sense of, but it is probably among the most important “steps” of the breakup. Some days, you will be at peace with yourself and the actions of your ex. Others…well, not so much. However, you know that you have to forgive to move on- whether it be yourself, your ex, or both. Perhaps your ex did some terrible, terrible things to you. Mine did. Even if you can’t find it in your heart to forgive them (now), you must accept that these things happened and that you are using them as ammunition to shape yourself for the better. You must forgive yourself if you hurt your ex. You are human, these things happen. What’s more important is that you learn from this. It’s all experience, even if it hurts. When you’re stable enough, invest some thought of how you could have made your relationship better or more reasonable. In my case, I have trouble seeing this since I believe it was my ex who really threw things away. However, I’ll know the warning signs next time, and I know that rushing myself into “love” might not always be the best choice. I have learned the importance of “moving on” before finding someone new (in my ex’s case), what a relationship with integrity looks like, etc.

-Channel your emotions healthily. If you’re here reading this, you’re probably hurting endlessly right now. If you were broken up with, your ex might have a bit more peace of mind than you (but maybe not, I don’t know every situation). However, you have a LOT of fuel right now. You have a lot of drive to feel better and not regress in the least- USE IT! My roommate went to taco bell last night, and I refused to eat anything from there. I refuse to eat unhealthy meals, and I exercise every day. Even if you don’t wish any ill upon your ex, success is the best revenge. Show them that you can function without them- even if it hurts to think about their absence being permanent. You are your own person! You do not NEED them, I promise.


Eternal Wisdom:

Here are some mantras and shreds of wisdom that have not only guided me through my breakup, but will continue to shape my life and will guide me into/through my next relationship.


-Repeat to yourself: “I gave myself to you for so long, I will NOT compete for your attention.” This one applies if you’re dumping someone who has become detached from your relationship, or if you’ve been dumped. The fact is, you gave your LIFE to this person- your happiness, your trust, everything that you are. If they took that, threw it on the ground and stomped on it in front of you, then they don’t deserve it. Sure, some couples can reconcile things and get back together, but you really need to sit down and ask yourself if they own up to what they did and are working to correct it. Once the dust settles, are you really able to be with someone and look past that tarnish?


-It’s ok to be single, especially after a relationship. You can feel lost without someone, but don’t get into a relationship if you’re not ready. Any relationship that has a codependency is built on sand. True love is about growing each other as people, through thick and thin. Not about one partner getting themselves emotionally stable enough so that they can leave the other (i.e. my relationship). You MUST love yourself before you can love another. 


-Despite your experiences, don’t become bitter and jaded about love. Though it may be hard to imagine now, you will be thankful you gathered what you did from your most recent relationship (assuming you take the right steps following its demise). I, personally, am very excited to fall in love again. It’s impossible for me to imagine it without anyone but my most recent ex, but I know it’s out there. I’m excited for my first kiss again! It’s out there. Just don’t look for it too hard, especially right now. It will be a weird experience, no doubt. A different kind of love than your most recent, but I promise that you are malleable and impressionable and that you will adjust your personality to fit someone you like- you certainly did it in your last relationship, whether you realize it or not.


You will be ok. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but you will find yourself cracking up over something idiotic and breathe a sigh of relief. You’ll realize you haven’t thought of your ex in all of 10 seconds, or maybe even 10 minutes, and realize that slowly but surely, you’re healing. Maybe you’ll successfully flirt with the opposite sex. Celebrate your small victories, and live your life through healthy, fulfilling activities. It gets better. It gets better. I promise, it gets better.

**TL;DR** The wisdom I have gained about breakups from reading and my own experience about a month after she left me.

**To clarify on that thread; no I did not want it to happen, this has never happened to me, so of course I will want to know the extreme possibilities first.**

So, I talked on Facebook to the close friend (we'll call him ""A"") shortly after a few comments started up on the other thread. He said he would be willing to stay by my side when I wasn't with my boyfriend for today. Since I did tell my boyfriend, once he saw D, he pulled me in a little tighter. 

After lunch, and to the dreaded networking class, he is surprisingly attempting nothing. We are both in separate groups doing the same lab. He managed to come to me and ask me questions, and then doesn't do anything. (It may have been that the professor was in there all day giving lectures.) In the middle of the labs I tell A, ""Okay, since he hasn't done anything, I'll just talk to him."" A agrees, but comes along.

Fast-forward 3 hours later once networking is over and A, D, and I all go into the elevator, getting ready to get this monster of a statement off my chest. A stands next to me, D the opposite. I cross my arms and tell him what I had planned since lunch; ""D, you need to stop touching me, the ass, the boobs, the kissing. All of it. This is your only warning. Touch me like that again and I **will** get *the professor* and *principal* and report you."" I have never heard myself say something as strong as I did then. After this he begins to deny, ""I didn't touch you today."" Implying I only meant for today. I think I genuinely scared him, considering I am naturally quiet.
._.

Anyways, I just want to say thank you /r/relationships. You brought my confidence up sky high and if anything happens I will once again update.

Been together for 9 months.

So here's the deal. My girlfriend and I have a very supportive relationship in almost every respect. However, we've never seen eye to eye in the bedroom. 

My girlfriend has always been very athletic, running track at college, and she has recently gotten in to power lifting at the gym, nothing major just yet, but she has gotten very strong. She is about 180lbs now, and i'm around 170/175, but a very slight build. 

Its gotten to the point now where (i think mainly due to her relative size) she wants to 'dominate me in the bedroom'. Which i was willing to try, but it has gone a bit too far and i don't really know how to initiate a discussion to bring it back to normal.

What started as some gentle spanking got harder and harder, until i was left with red marks for hours after we'd made love. Now she likes to slap me in the face, and recently squeezed my balls until i lost consciousness, though i begged her to stop. There are other things too but i won't bore you, apart from her recent request that she be able to slam my dick in a drawer. I haven't responded to that yet (she asked through text)

I don't know what to do because outside of the bedroom she is still the girl i love and we get along just as good as ever. PLEASE HELP

TL;DR Girlfriend likes to dominate in the bedroom, has become too much, please help.

EDIT: Yes i am still alive! I work during the day, and i feel i should have mentioned, she doesn't like it like that all the time, but we didn't do anything last night anyway. For those of you wondering, I was worried about steroids too but she has assured me she wouldn't put our ability to have children at risk with testosterone, steroids or any of that rubbish.

1375811270.0,229,self.relationships,1jtp3o,UPDATE: I found out my boyfriend sold his car (&amp; more) to buy me an engagement ring because he's insecure about my family's wealth. [28F + 30M],hatesocialclasses,385,156,362,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jtp3o/update_i_found_out_my_boyfriend_sold_his_car_more/,"[Click for Full Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jit5l/i_found_out_my_boyfriend_sold_his_car_more_to_buy/?sort=new)

A ton has happened since my last post.  My fiance proposed to me before I had a chance to talk to him about the ring.  In hindsight, I should have recognized that he was preparing to propose.  On Friday, I woke up to him cooking me breakfast and he insisted that I stay in bed so he could “spoil me”.  He told me that he used a vacation day so we could enjoy a longer weekend together.  I don’t know why I didn’t realize he was planning on proposing but I honestly didn’t expect him to already have the ring.  Also, sweet things like this aren’t very rare with him.  Still, I understand that I should have acted more quickly but at the same time I know it’s too late to cry over spilled milk
The ring really is beautiful.  When he proposed to me I completely forgot about talking to him about the price; I was far too excited.  Even though I was aware that he was planning on proposing, I still allowed myself to get swept up in the moment.  Anyways, most of this information is irrelevant.  There’s still the issue with the price of the ring.  I know I should hate it because it’s so expensive and unnecessary but now that I have it, I really don’t want to give it up.  It’s not the price or anything like that.  I love it because it’s my engagement ring.  I already had a conversation with him about the price and he told me it wasn’t about his insecurities.  He said he wanted to show me how important I am to him and that he’s willing to give up anything to make me happy.  I don’t know if I’m letting my emotions get the best of me but I really believe him.  I know the price discussion isn’t really on his mind because he’s been trying to get me to go along with this prenup (there’s no way I’m letting him sign one of those).  What does Reddit think?  Should I keep the ring?  My friends want me to keep it but I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do.  I know that when I look at it I should be thinking about what my fiance had to give up but in reality I just think about how much he loves me and how happy he makes me.  Yes, the money could be spent on a much more noble cause but I feel really happy when my fiance only wants to spend his money on me.  

I’m sure there are much more serious issues but I would really appreciate some advice on this.  

Please stop commenting about the ""1%"".  You can do that anywhere else.

**************************************************************************************************
First off, thank you for the kind (even harsh) words on the first and second post. I might not have liked it, but I greatly appreciate everything this community does to help people out. Even with differing opinions, most of you (minus trolls) are really great people. So seriously - thank you. Also - I don't expect anyone to read this fully (it's gonna be long), but I feel like I have to finish my trilogy. Even if it's a shitty trilogy.   
   
So, to be short. We broke up. Or, I broke up with him. 
 
Things got... weird. Very quickly. After that update, we were working on things. It honestly seemed to be getting better... then our vaction hit.     
   

**************************************************************************************************
**The Vacation:**

For Christmas, we were flying to my folks house and going to spend some time there. It was a **huge** deal to me, as he had never met my home town friends, seen where I grew up or anything else. I wanted him to understand my roots. To know who my best friends were. To see that I truly was a southern girl living in the big city. It just meant so much to me. We arrive in town and things between us are ok (not amazing, but good given the recent events). My mother picks us up and takes us back to the house. From there we begin chatting, and everything seems fine. They have a room off the side of the house (think mother-in-law suite) so that's where we'll be staying. Which is great, because my parents are very conservative, southern, christian people and the fact that they were okay with this was great. I did, at my mother's request, agree to sleep on the couch (because I love that couch and the bed sucks in comparison, not because of B) and I explained to him that I love my parents a lot, and it's only a few days and this isn't that big of a deal. And he agreed too. He said ""Yeah, they're letting us stay here, letting us borrow their car and feeding us. I think we can deal with separate places for a bit."" All seemed good.    
   
My parents had moved out of my home town about 2 years ago. So while it was their house now, I wanted him to see where I grew up. In a small town that has a population of 1,800 (last I checked) and was really, really, southern. So we went on a day trip out to that area. I grabbed some friends, we all met up at a local hole in the wall BBQ joint and I was trying to introduce him. He instantly shut down and was not sociable. Odd, but.. ok, I'll deal. Then I tell him that I'm going to take him on a drive through tour of my home town and then we'd go to a friends for a bit. So I'm driving him around and explaining where I grew up (""That's our one stop light in the whole town... we have 7 churches here... That's the house I grew up in... that's where I built forts..."") and just general BS about me. I look over and I see he's asleep in the passenger seat. I just yelled his name, he woke up and then we got into a fight about how the one thing I was looking forward to (touring my town, seeing where I came from, and frankly how hard it was to get out of) he fell asleep for. ""I'm sorry! I can't help it! Cars make me fall asleep!"" ok, fine, whatever, we still have a lot of our trip left, let's make this work. I put on my smile and we continued on. That was the only thing that really happened back home.    
   
**My trip to my brothers:**
After my boyfriend left (he was there for 5 days), I had a few extra days planned to spend with my brother. Now, my brother was distant for most of my childhood and high school years (horribly long story). I have never really gotten to see him much. At this point, we had been really working our relationship for a solid year, and things were great. But, I had only really seen him about 5x in my life. This trip was a big deal for me, as I would get to see the home he bought, the city he lives in, etc. Just like when he had visited, it was a big deal. This was just the other half. For information, but the time this trip was done, I've probably seen my brother for about 30 days in my life.   
   
B could NOT DEAL with this. At all. Where my brother lives, the cell phone reception is terrible for me. I'd constantly get voicemails without any sign someone had called. I explained this to B and that if he calls, leave a message. I also told him that I only had about 4 days with my brother so if I'm really busy, I'm sorry but I'll be home soon. What does he do instead? B decided to call me 3x a day. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Why? Just to say hi. If I didn't answer (which was often) he'd get upset and leave stupid passive aggressive voicemails on my phone about ""guess you're too busy for your boyfriend"" and then I'd have to call back and diffuse the situation. This got out of control quickly where on the day I was leaving, he texted me 40 messages (give or take a few, but I know it was over 30) about how I'm ignoring him, treating him like shit, don't care, etc. etc. etc. Also, at this time, my brother is absolutely furious. He spoiled our one damn trip together. B also decided to email my mom about this and say ""Don't tell her but I think..."" and my mom immediately called me up, worried about my safety.    
   
**Back to the city**   
After that... I think it just turned into trying to work it out, arguing, trying to work, etc. I don't remember exactly how it was handled when I got home, but I do remember the end days.    
   
**All aboard the crazy train**
My boyfriend has always said he was a republican, but I didn't know that Obama being re-elected would make him go over board with his crazy right wing beliefs (I consider myself to be kind of right-wing, more in the middle, but this takes the case).   
   
He has never owned a gun in his life and never shot one. But, because ""Obama is taking away our guns"" he went and got his permit and a $700 pistol (remember how I said he was always broke? yeah, a fight happened about this too). He also refused to take a gun safety course and would carry the gun in his jacket pocket. Gun safety 101, that's a horrible idea. I told him I would not be going out with him in public with the gun unless he bought a front holster, and he exploded. Something about how he's keeping us safe, and if someone bursts into the movie theater with a gun, he'd protect us... what? I don't want to say that I'm some marksman of sorts, but my father was a Navy SEAL. I've been around guns my entire life and learned Krav Maga early too. Boyfriend just bought a gun and is clueless. I do not feel safe. But, I lay down the law and he breaks it. Things start going south. They get even worse when he tries to bring the gun into my home and I absolutely refuse. No weapons but my own.   
   
Then starts the crazy talk. Because of Obama, we're going to have a people's militia and would I help fight? No joke. He knew a guy, who knew a guy, that could get any weapon we wanted. This turned into a LOT of fights and at one point I asked him if he'd go to counseling with me. Nope. Apparently just I need counseling because I didn't understand the war that was going on...   
   
No wait, crazy continues. My best friend in the whole world has melted away in front of me, and continues a transformation into someone I would never have dated, much lest befriended. We went out to a few bars to have some drinks where he would get horribly drunk (boy can't hold his booze) and then be aggressively all over me when we got back home (yup, warning. Especially as my last boyfriend was abusive and he knew this). Then, he'd post on facebook about how Christians who drink are scum and would turn into the most hypocritical person I've ever known. I was blown away by these changes in him, I knew that there was no turning back.    
   
**************************************************************************************************   
Edit: As for the sexual aggressive behavior - we've always had an open and fun time in the bedroom. But after drinking (after 1.5 years) he'd get oddly controlling. I don't want to say ""force"" me into bed, but.. that's probably the closest word. I could ward him off if needed, but it took a lot of effort. Again, this when I knew 100% (as opposed to 95%) that we were done.   
**************************************************************************************************    
    
**The End:**So, I sat him down and told him it wasn't working. We argued all the time, didn't believe in the same things and this had to end. He didn't get upset. He didn't cry. He just said ""I think that's for the best"" and left my house. **I was heartbroken.** I haven't talked much about how amazing the first year of our life together was, but... I seriously loved him. He was my best friend. We were truly lovers and friends - we'd go bowling and BS all night with friends, and the next night it was a romantic date planned. To this day, I have no clue where my best friend went to, or where he currently is.    
   
This is getting really long, so I'll cut to the chase - We tried to do the friends thing. It didn't work out. Instead of being friends, it turned into him telling me how awesome his life was, how amazing he was doing, and trying to make me jealous. The last conversation we had was a 3am text from him about something that actually started with ""You're going to be so jealous"" and then explaining something that had happened. I responded with ""Gratz?"" and the response was (word for word) ""Forget it. I don't even know why I bother. You won't hear from me until I text you again."" - That was 3 weeks ago.    
   
Some of you had suggested that he has a secret drug habit, or a secret child - to my knowledge, all of these are still not true. Family has suggested mental illness (due to the random increase in paranoia). Me? No clue. All I know is that my best friend is gone and I'm just doing my thing.    
   
**tl;dr**: Things were ok. Then foreign lands caused my boyfriend to fall ill with the crazy republican paranoia sickness which eventually led to aggressiveness and our mutual downfall.

[Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dtlxp/update_23fight_with_my_bf_22_brings_up_a_lot_of/)

TL;DR so far: BF of 3 and a half years was initially not okay with me having a friendship with my ex, G. After two years, he said if it means that much to me, let's all hang out. Next year and a half, BF claims to be okay with it, so I make plans for a music video with G. BF gets very upset during argument, and admits that he's not as okay with it as he let on. Next day, we discussed the argument. BF says I should make the video because he doesn't want to hold back my career. Admits that my friendship with G does bother him to a point, but is willing to suck it up for this video.

It's been over a week since my first post, and I've read all your comments, and thought them over. I had to ask myself why I'm willing to work so hard to maintain a friendship with G, after all the stress it causes me and my BF. I looked down deep, and realized that after all these years, I guess G still has a piece of my heart. Not saying I would ever leave my BF for him, because I wouldn't, but a younger part of myself comes to life when I speak to G. He reminds me of a time when I really thought anything was possible, before adulthood trampled me with bills, work, and stress.

G represents good times, but he's not half the man my BF is. When I stepped back, I realized that G only contacts me when he wants something. He contacted me to do this music video, he calls me when he's bored or feeling sad about himself. He's fun to hang out with, but he only wants to hang out when he feels like it. Prime example: since I set a date to film this video, he hasn't contacted me. I tried to organize a meeting, but he never responded. This is all starting to feel like a big waste of my time and energy.

We were supposed to film this weekend, but I told my BF we should go visit his sister and her husband instead. He doesn't keep track of dates very well, so he didn't realize what I meant. I explained the video was supposed to be this weekend, but I'm calling it off. I told him it had started to feel like I was putting other people before him, but I want him to know he's my first priority. I teared up and told him I'm sorry, and he held me and said, ""I know, but you don't have to be.""

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cjefp/update_22f_and_other_friends_who_are_trying_to/)

Can't believe I'm doing another update already...

We just received a text from James* and what we thought and tried so hard to avoid has happened.  

Here is his message:

""I cannot believe you have done something as disgusting as you just did. And on top of that to send Bob (a mutual friend who wasn't involved. we asked him to check on him.)  out of university to come to my house? She said she was suspicious of you, and she was playing along just to see exactly what was going on, she thought it might be one of my friends after the crap you all pulled over Facebook. You can chose to believe that or not because it doesn't really matter. I'm seeing her in July, everything is already booked. In the mean time I'm going to try to fix the problems that have been caused today. I want to be left alone for a while, please respect that wish.""

Basically, she's used an excuse we expected.  The worse thing is this.  
We are from Scotland. In the fake profile, we put that we were from London.  She told James that she caught us out because we used the wrong TIME ZONE.  Good fucking god.  For those of you who may not realise, the WHOLE UNITED KINGDOM IS THE ONE TIME ZONE. It's disgusting that James believed that. 

I personally am done.  She has him were she wants him.  I consider this the end of our friendship.  Thank you to everyone for your input.  Today was a shit day.

Right so, he came over last night, and depite my plan to act cool, have a normal evening and continue adding to the draft letter I had started writing about how I felt it all went to shit as soon as I opened the door to him. A day full of finally venting my feelings, being upset about the fact that he had been with her and reading all of the advice/opinions/comments that you guys so helpfully left had left me rather emotional! I had spent most of the day in tears, terrified that when I spoke to him, (cause I had realised by this point it was inevitable for my own sanity) he would freak out, not understand or I would hear something I didn't want to hear. Worst case, in the scenarios built up in my mind, we would have to break up.

 I opened the door and he took one look at my puffy eyes and drained face and he looked seriously worried. ""Whats happened?!"" He asked as he embraced me. I took him into the living room, there was no way I could put it off any longer. I explained to him everything. I started off telling him that I did trust him, and I knew how loyal he was to all of his friends, and that the fact he was loyal had never bothered me and it was lovely that he could be like that, but that I had a massive problem with one of his girls. I explained that it wasn't that I didn't trust him with her but that she made me feel uneasy and pushed out. I said that I had mentioned it at the begining of the relationship then been afraid to bring it up again for fear of seeming possesive. He said, ""Is this about Megan?"" And I told him it was. He told me, ""She doesn't like me in that way, she's just like that with her friends."" I explained to him a few of the reasons (from other post) that had made me see it in another light. 

He absorbed this and looked as though he may be realising. ""I can completely see how that would look, and I'm sorry."" He said that from now on he'll only see her in a group and try and change how their relationship is. He said after years of her being like this it would be hard, but seeing how it had been affecting me had shocked him. He couldn't believe I had been holding it in for so long. He assured me that I was the one for him.

 This isn't the end of this problem, its just the beginning of a route which will hopefully lead to the problem being resolved. I'm happy to see if he does what he said he will, I REALLY hope he does but only time will tell. I shall update when there is progression. Thank you all for your help, I don't think I would have spoken to him otherwise.

TL;DR: Finally spoke to my boyfriend after 14 months of feeling like his female ""best friend"" was in love with him and trying to undermine me. I think we're on the road to recovery. Thank you.

Well Reddit it’s been a helluva week.  I have 1 night on the computer for this, but I’ll try to address what I couldn’t last week and answer new questions, and to deliver the promised Update.

Your help was indispensable last week and really helped me to put a lot of the situation into perspective.

The OFP (Order for Protection) was granted last Thursday, through a free advocate from the women’s shelter I stayed at last fall when shit first hit the fan.  The OFP stipulated that it would be in effect until he chose to complete 1-month inpatient treatment for diagnosed alcoholism.  Essentially, it let me legally change the locks and granted me a no-contact order.  He was very much the mind-fucking stalker last fall when I left, and I felt I absolutely needed a no-contact order after kicking him out this time.  

This decision killed me, even though living with my alcoholic husband is beginning to threaten my sanity and has already threatened my safety.  It was heartwrenching all the same to jerk the rug out from underneath him by having him come home to an envelope on the door.  Then again, he doesn’t respond to subtlety and has made countless empty promises about his behavior already.

A few things to address from the first post:

There were concerns about abusing an OFP for personal gain.   In my original post I didn’t go into detail about everything he’s put me through (the original post was already a novel.) The OFP was, however, legitimately granted through my already documented history with him (including 2 calls to the police) and my own documentation of his drunk rages that always ended up with him passed out on the floor.  It would kill me if anyone thought I was abusing the system.

Also, several people suggested I leave instead.  I left last time.  It is his turn.  He has family to stay with.  I stayed at a women’s shelter with daily chores and a curfew, where you had to watch your shit to make sure it didn’t get stolen.

Also also, my comment about having told him while he was passed out on the floor that it was a mistake to have come back to him raised a few eyebrows.  Re-reading it, I can see why, it seems pretty passive.  This is the perfect example of everything fucked about our marriage, however.  He is too drunk for me to ever discuss anything with him ever, even simple stuff like a budget.  We could conceivably learn in therapy how to communicate and discuss important matters, but not unless he’s sober to learn them. 

For the record, we had 3 counseling sessions last fall after I left.  The therapist ended them herself, saying she couldn’t involve herself in what was an abuse issue (since I was at a shelter), and that the next step was for my husband to get treatment as recommended by the professional assessment.  Therapy was not advised until he was sober.  My husband himself couldn’t handle the sessions; when we finally starting talking about why we were there, he threatened to walk out and the therapist had to stop everything to make him pay the co-payment in the middle of the session because he had become threatening.  That was the last session we had in thereapy.

**So, the big question:  What the hell happened??**

Thursday evening after the locks were changed I called his mother to arrange dropping off his stuff (I left him a duffel bag of essentials in his pickup, but not everything he would need.)  His mother is a heavy alcoholic herself, but actually offered to me twice last month to help him with an intervention, so I was expecting at the worst a luke-warm response.

Nope.  She told me they wanted to go through the cops to get his stuff and wouldn’t let me come over.  She then told me to fuck off.  Okay, that was harsh but she’s unpredictable. PLOT TWIST:  I found out Tuesday that she never told my husband I tried to drop off his stuff.  She made the decision for him to go through the cops behind his back.  

She never responded when I asked her about her offer to help with an intervention.

Sunday morning I got the voicemail from my husband’s new’ lawyer requesting I call him back concerning divorce papers.  As of today, I have not called him back.  My husband dismissed treatment out of hand.

I cannot afford a lawyer and my parents are retired and can’t help.  My husband’s family has hired a spendy lawyer so I know I need one.  I’ve been through several low-income resources already so hopefully one will pan out for me, but they all take awhile.

Otherwise, that is that. We have exchanged civil emails and I let him know that I knew when I went back to him last winter that nothing would change. Why I went back still mystifies me.  I’ve learned a lot about abusive relationships, and I know that the emotional mind-fucking he’s put me through constitutes emotional abuse, and that that is just as crazy-making to live with as physical abuse.  I’m thankful for the law that recognizes that and lets me protect myself.

I will be putting in my resignation to the company tomorrow (I took a leave of absence this week) and have the joy of job-hunting to look forward to.

I have not given much thought yet about how to address the issue of all the drunk driving occuring where we work because of the boss’ Free Beer Club.  This was the biggest feedback I got from you Reddit, and I’m not sure when/how to address it.  I will mention in my resignation letter that I’m officially protesting the policy that encourages drinking and driving.

I am most thankful for the awesome network of amazing girlfriends who have stood by my side from the beginning. I could not have gotten through this week without them.

**TL;DR  -  I can honestly say that I would prefer to be single and unemployed than be married to my husband and employed by the company that is keeping him drunk.**


**EDIT #1** - Anonymity

**EDIT #2** - I haven't shared the details of all the abuse that occurred, so I am copying a comment to paranoidexboyfriend:  

Good question. Yes, I have not included a play-by-play of every argument. There were several instances of him not letting me sleep by screaming at me and ripping the covers off the bed while I was sleeping. He would physically block the door if I tried to leave, and wouldn't let drive away by physically blocking my car, etc. This is physical abuse.

He once was so pissed that he had to drive me to the hospital because I was sick and had to go to ER that he **ditched me in the parking lot** once we were there. I was bawling and begging him to come inside with me, and he just drove off like I was an ODing body. Instances like this put my safety in danger, which is abuse.
He has played a fine line with being as abusive as possible without throwing fists. That does not make our situation non-abusive, I've learned.

Original thread TL;DR: I am a grown-ass woman, and my mother bitches and moans when my 30-something boyfriend and I come to visit because we'd rather stay in a hotel than in separate rooms at her house.

You guys gave me a ton of good advice and a reality check that I wasn't the one being disagreeable. 

We went on the visit, got a rental car, stayed in a hotel, and had a great time. In fact, we did it once more since then and are about to do so again. On these visits, not much has been said about our arrangements, but my mother was visibly unhappy (facial expressions/body language) and made passive-aggressive comments about ""all that driving"" and whatnot.

We're about to go again for Christmas. I got a note from my mom asking about my plans in which she indicated that she is ""getting our rooms ready."" I thought it was manipulative to say that instead of just asking if we would like to stay with her, but I didn't want to get into that, so I just responded with our itinerary, which just included one line noting we are getting a hotel. 

Today she wrote an email saying almost exactly what I predicted she'd say last year: 

""Please reconsider and stay with us. We'd like that very much. We see you so seldom. Come on, make 2 old people happy this Christmas!"" (By the way, my dad doesn't care about this... dragging him into it is more manipulation on her part.)

I am responding with some text that is basically an amalgam of your advice from last year: 

""So-and-so and I prefer to sleep in the same bed and have some quiet time during our visits, so we will be staying in a hotel. We will sleep better that way and are more than happy to visit during the day. Given the available arrangements, I will not be reconsidering this decision now or in the future."" (Then moving on to a different topic.)

If she brings it up again this time or on the next visit, I intend to use UnclePaul50's suggestion of explaining that both sharing a bed with my boyfriend and visiting with my family are important and I'm intending to do both, but she is the one setting the limitation that's making me divide my time. I also plan to say that I am unwilling to discuss it and that I find her behavior around this issue insulting and unwelcoming. More updates to come if there are new developments.

Thanks!


**** Now with MORE updates ****

EDIT 15 hours after original post:

Should I start a new thread for this?

I sent the above email. She replied:

&gt;Since you are always frank with me, let me be as frank with you. Why it is so important for you to sleep with So-and-So every time you come to [her town]? After all, you both live in [my town] and you have 359 days a year to spend nights together whenever you want. You only visit with us about 6 days a year, if that many. Surely, you can be in separate beds a few days. Good grief, [my name], be more mature.

(Followed by a long quotation about how you have to spend time with people to show you love them, and a line about how I should ""elevate"" her above friends.)

I replied:

&gt;I'm sorry you feel so strongly about the issue of sleeping arrangements. I have already stated the reasons why I want to sleep in the same bed with [bf] during previous conversations about this. We're adults, we like to sleep in the same bed, and we have every right to do so. It's your prerogative to disallow sharing a bed in your home, and it's my prerogative to stay in a hotel if that doesn't work for me. I respect your preferences on the sleeping situation, and I have requested that you respect mine in turn. I'm not going to discuss it again.

Then she replied:

&gt;[My name], I am sorry you feel the way you do. But as your mother it is my responsibility to guide and advise you in life, which includes areas of proper and moral behavior. Obviously, I have continuously tried to change behaviors that I deem inappropriate, even though you are now an adult. You are correct in saying you are responsible for your own life, but remember that actions have a consequences. 


Ughhh. I have set a boundary that I am not going to discuss it, and she's not respecting that. I don't know whether to drop it now or what. My feeling is that if she thinks changing my behavior is more important that having an adult relationship with me, then I would simply prefer to not have a relationship with her at all. Our visits are nothing but stressful and unhappy because of the nature of my relationship with her, although I do want to see my dad and other family. I'm trying to figure out how to say ""that mindset is not going to work for me"" without further engaging her in an argument.

This wasn't a very popular thread so I'm not sure if anyone really cares about my update but here we go: 


I finally got up the nerve to confront my boyfriend again about the dating site 

After the first post I questioned him about it and he said it was just harmless flirting but that he would stop. 

Well, this morning (about two weeks after we initially spoke about it) I checked his profile to see if he'd kept his promise. And nope, he hadn't update were infrequent but last night he'd posted something about, ""any girls in (our city) want to pick my drunk ass up from the clubs and have sex haha"" . I was at his yesterday night, we went out with friends and I went home early and he stayed out. 


I asked him about it today, he said it didn't mean anything and that he just wrote it when he was walking home from the pub and it was all he could think about. (When he got home we didn't have sex btw)


I told him I didn't want any bullshit excuses and that this was his last chance and that if he wanted to break up then fine, but if we were going to be together he can't do this, it's disrespectful and just generally makes me feel shitty and worthless. 

He said he didn't want to break up because he loves me but feels like he's too young to settle down. I then said that was ridiculous because I'm younger than him and have so many things I want to do, and settling down isn't one of them, but if he would rather have sex with other girls than have a girlfriend who loves him and would do anything for him, then fine, but it's his loss. 

He didn't say anything else then, and we cuddled for a bit. I told him to stop worrying on silly things like settling down and just be happy and he nodded. 

I'm not sure what will happen now, but I really mean that it was his last chance and I'm preparing for the worst. 

TL;DR: confronted boyfriend about dating site activity and how I feel like he's taking me for granted, hoping things will go well, but getting ready for a possible breakup.

Ouch. It hurts a lot right now, but I feel like it shouldn't. I actually cried a bit, but hid it well and he didn't know.

So to get the bots off my back. 35f (me). 29m (him). Together 9 months.

I really do love him. So much. In fact, I knew 6 months ago, but because I've always been one to rush into the who ""I love you again"" thing, the next time I said it I wanted to be absolutely sure. I was married and am now divorced. I completely reevaluated what love meant to me after my divorce. I wanted the next time I said that to someone to be something I really meant. Something I've thought about and analyzed and I've done that with him. I do love him. He's turned my world upside down in all of the good ways. I've never met anyone like him. Never felt so happy. Never felt so sure. 

This is also the first time I've ever told a guy I've loved him first. Fuck. I feel so sorry for the guys out there that traditionally have to take on this burden. It was SO terrifying. And when I finally managed to squeak it out, I feel glad that I did. Because now he knows. The problem is, now I know that he doesn't love me back. More importantly, now I know that he probably never will. 

Well, that's not true. I feel like he loves me now. At least, I feel love from him in ways I've never felt it from previous partners. He makes me feel so loved. But he just can't (and probably never will) say it. I am struggling with should that matter. 

It's just a word right? It's a word that I've placed a lot of importance on, but that doesn't change the fact that this is still the best, most honest, most comforting, exciting, incredible relationship I've ever had. Unfortunately it's a word I seem to place a lot of importance on. So if he can never tell me he loves me, even though I feel that he does in every ounce of me, does it matter? 

The problem is I think it does. I want to hear it. I don't need to hear it now. I could even wait a year. But someday... I am going to need to hear those words. So where does that leave us. I am drunk and sad and lost and bewildered tonight. I guess I just need to know reddit, can you continue to be in a relationship with someone who you love with all of your heart, and who you FEEL loved by, but you know they can probably never tell you that. I am ok with this now, but know it's a matter of months before the crazy starts taking over my brain and turns me into someone unlovable. I don't even know what my question is. I just need someone to say something.

She attempted multiple affairs but got shot down, never committed herself back to the marriage, didn't follow through on my wishes for counseling and I've caught her in multiple lies since. Lies like ""I left the bar at 12:00 with Jenn"" but doesn't get home till 2:30.

So she had her birthday party last night... Girl's Night... I wasn't invited. She was being kind of mean (typical behavior for her when she's being dishonest). On a hunch, I looked through her Facebook friends. In her friends, the main guy she had the big affair with two years ago has reappeared and, understandably, it makes me extremely angry.

I plan on leaving when the boys get a little older. Our marriage isn't going to work since my priorities are kids, job and my health and her priorities (she said) are going out and being social. I will leave but in the mean time, how do I keep from LOOSING MY MIND?!??

A bit more than a month ago, my then-fiancee confessed to me that she'd been having a 3 month affair. We were going to be married in May. We're in our late 20's; we'd been together 4-1/2 years. No trouble until we moved in together, 6 months ago.

She made a sincere effort to fix everything that was wrong with our relationship - the distance that had grown between us. We both worked hard, and we brought it back to where it was before things went bad. The nights of laughing, drinking, and watching cartoons. The mutual support. The sex.

I realized today that no matter how hard we worked, it would never be the way it was. I would never be able to trust her completely like before. The doubt would always be there. I could never have children with her; they'd be nothing but a license to ruin my life.

I found a box of condoms in the bathroom; we haven't used condoms since she got her IUD put in 2 years ago. I didn't know if they were new or old, so I slashed them all up, then threw them away. I feel silly now, since they were most likely old, but they triggered an inordinate feeling of resentment. Too many things have. It was the tipping point.

The breakup wasn't poetic. It wasn't a scene from a movie. It wasn't closure. I stood in the living room, almost unable to talk, and I mumbled that I wanted to break up. Then I turned around and left.

I feel so broken and empty, but I know I did the right thing. I haven't stopped loving her yet, though. I know I will. I don't believe in remaining friends with exes, and I wouldn't want to put her through that emotional hell anyway. I finally stopped crying.

I asked for people's opinions a few days ago and got a lot of helpful responses. I took into consideration most of the advice, minus the ""moar blowjobz"" and I just wanted to update.

I want to thank everyone who offered helpful insight.

So I just set it out to my boyfriend the next night while we were cooking dinner. He didn't get defensive this time, but sat me down and explained that his friend is going through a lot. I feel sort of bad for not knowing. Basically the kid is severely depressed and my SO suspects he is suicidal. He's also having a lot of family issues and and his brother recently killed himself (I had no idea). 

Anyway, my BF agreed that he shouldn't have to ignore me to be his friend's counselor and he spoke to his friend until he agreed to visit the psych on his base. Hopefully he can get the help he needs. 

I also have taken to heart the advice I got, as no problem is one sided. Part of the issue is that I need to work harder at making friends and get some hobbies. 

I wanted to note that we've only been living in this new town since last August, which is why neither of us have made many friends. 

Like I said, I really appreciate everyone's help in the matter. My SO and I have agreed to set aside time each day to do things (the Zoo in the city near by is one of our favorite places to go) but I'm also going to be more understanding when his friend calls him, because he may need someone to talk to more than I had realized.

We've been together for more than 7 years, engaged for about 6 months. My parents threw a giant Christmas party this year that they were very, VERY specific about wanting us to attend. They made sure we'd be there in advance, checked the calendar twice, etc. 

I went up a few days early to help my parents with their party, and my fiance went to an annual Christmas party. He stayed out really late (that's cool, we usually do), but the next day didn't get up and get moving in time to make it to my parents' party (it's a very long drive). This is the first Christmas that we've been engaged, and my parents have been chatting to their friends about it non-stop. It was a Christmas party, but also a time for them to show off their daughter and to-be son-in-law. 

At my parents' party, I had dozens of old ladies and gents asking me where my fiance was, why he wasn't there, when the wedding was (we haven't set a date), why haven't we set a date, what's our problem, why can't we have the wedding at my parents' house (fiance doesn't want a backyard wedding), and generally embarrassing me, since I don't like answering questions for the both of us. When a friend of mine [m] arrived at the party, everyone assumed HE was my fiance, and I had to explain to everyone that he was not. It was embarrassing and humiliating.

My fiance finally arrived after people had gone home, and I (drunkenly) told him I was very upset. He meekly said he was sorry, and then moved on to other things. There was no talking about it that evening, as we had no private time together.

Christmas morning came, and he admitted to me that he had gotten me nothing for Christmas. I'm not materialistic, I tend to shy from expensive things, but it really hurt that zero effort was put forth on a gift when I already took a back seat to his priorities for Christmas parties.

How the hell do I tell him just how crushingly upset I am? He doesn't seem to understand that these were so hurtful. He said he was sorry about the party-- he wasn't feeling well that morning that he should have left (to which I said he should have planned ahead). And he mentioned that I was ""hard to shop for"" which is why he got me nothing. 

**TL;DR** Fiance (and bf of 7 years) stood me up at a large party that was important to me and my family, and then got me nothing for Christmas. He doesn't seem to think these are upsetting. How do I approach him about this?

**Update** I was able to pinpoint what really made me feel bad. I let him know we needed to talk, and when we were both able to yesterday, we did. I told him how I felt, not how he ""made me"" feel, and that really opened his eyes. He was very sorry he disappointed me, and knew why I was upset. We also have another ""Christmas"" coming up with his family, and he admitted that although he dropped the ball on a gift with my family, we have another chance at that with his.

My parents are now 72 and 63, and I'm about to turn 25. I'm starting to become very aware of their age, and my fears about their passing on is starting to haunt me, probably more than it should.

They're both in good health, given their age. My father, a professional musician, spends his days teaching himself new symphonies on his upright bass, reading...*everything*, writing novels, going to the gym (he can bench press 250 pounds! Super dad!), and cooking healthy food. Besides a slightly messed up elbow from carrying his bass for over fifty years now, he has no other real ailments. My mother is diabetic and overweight, but she (from my understanding) is controlling it well, and she loves going out several nights a week to attend eastern European folk dancing classes (and she's Filipino...my mom is weird). Even though she's retired, she still works part time at her old job as a lab technician.

My dad's dad lived to be over 90, and my grandparents on my mother's side lived to be about 70.

My parents are aware of their mortality. They've mentioned that they've written up their wills and my father gave me information about a trustworthy man who will buy my father's basses. My mom has told me what her plans are should she outlive my father, and my father, a Catholic-raised atheist, told me he has accepted the fact that when he dies, there is no afterlife.

To be blunt, I am terrified of what's going to happen when they die. I think what's compounding this problem is that I currently live on the other side of the country from them and I'm scared that, should something happen, I won't...get there in time, if that makes sense. I'm also scared of trying to deal with funeral arrangements, what I'm going to do with my older brother (he suffers from severe mental health issues that prevents him from getting a job, but that's another post), selling their house, and the list just goes on and on. 

My knee jerk reaction to anything scary is I want to go to my mom and dad and ask them to comfort me. But how exactly do I go about talking to them about this? Should I even ask them for comfort? I don't even know what I'll say to them besides, ""I really don't want to you to die, Mom and Dad. I love you both so much. Can you tell me that everything is going to be all right?"" I guess...I don't know. I don't know what I want to gain from this conversation, but the need to talk to them about this is getting stronger and stronger.

A few minor disagreements here and there but I feel a stronger connection to her now than ever before. She would say the same thing. This year we've been house hunting, talking about family, and enjoying life to the fullest. She has a job she loves and a good network of friends.

Earlier in the year she went through some tough emotional times as someone close to her passed away in old age. I also went through something similar as my uncle recently passed.

But we got through it together and to me our relationship has never been better. To the point that I've been shopping for an engagement ring and thinking about taking the next step!

Now here's where I need some help:

I just discovered that in the past year my girlfriend has spent close to  $10,000 on everything from charities, to gifts for workplace friends, to stockpiles of bathroom / beauty products, to fast food and god knows what else. Over the past two years she has quietly spent her ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS which she was planning on using as part of a downpayment on a townhouse.

She broke down to me in tears last night and told me everything:

- She told me she has a spending problem and has quietly spent her entire life savings (tens of thousands of dollars) in the past couple of years. 

- She told me she owes thousands in back taxes to the government and has no way of paying it. 

- She told me she regularly gives away money she doesn't have to friends, family and charities

- She told me she has an eating problem and virtually every night for the past few months has been eating a fast food dinner on her drive home from work before we sit down and have dinner together at home. 

- She told me she's booked vacations (Las Vegas etc.) with her girlfriends that she can't afford or pay for, only because they asked her to go.

- She told me she doesn't even have enough money left to pay for gas to get to work this week!!

- She showed me her personal Savings bank account statements for the past 60 days and there are hundreds of transactions for everything imaginable. She's over drafted with nothing left.

My dilemma is that we're no longer 20 somethings with nothing to lose. We're older now and I feel betrayed - like the 5 years we spent together have been awesome but now it would be impossible to take the next step.

I love her dearly and hope and pray that she can stop spending money. But I'm no longer sure it's a healthy relationship for me to be in.

We put together a weekly and monthly budget and she cut up all her cards last night. Basically it will take her 12-months of hard work (redirecting almost all of her salary) to pay off all of her bills and get her back taxes settled. During that time I will have to cover all of our living expenses. 

And that's assuming she doesn't start spending again. I love her dearly but feel like she just killed our relationship. I've asked her why, if there's anything I can do, if there's anything troubling her and she keeps telling me she doesn't know why she can't stop spending. The crazy thing is that she is a support worker / counsellor in her day job and deals with things like this all the time.

**edit** do you think it would be wise to show her this Reddit Post? The feedback and advice everyone has provided has been great and I thank-you all! But now I feel like we're talking behind her back. Should I keep this Reddit conversation to myself or share it with her?

We've always talked about getting married, and I have (had) no doubts that we would be getting engaged very soon.

Recently, John, myself, John's closest friend and his girlfriend, went on a trip to Vegas for several days. We had a great time, all four of us, and on our last night there, John told us he wanted to go to the Bellagio fountains to see them before we had to leave. Everyone was up for it, we went for a nice dinner beforehand, and then began watching the fountains and the music came on. It was really romantic, and I was really enjoying myself, and that's when John grabbed my wrist. He turned me toward him and I saw that he was sweating profusely. Like, his face was bright red, and he looked like he was about to pass out from trembling so hard. The whole time it looked like he was about to say something, but he never did. He just informed all of us that he wasn't feeling well and wanted to go back to the hotel. Our friends looked really puzzled and were whispering into each other's ears all the way back to the hotel. I kept asking John if he was okay, and he just said he probably had too much to drink.

We've been back for a couple of weeks, and he's been acting really distant and cold. I honestly knew something weird was up that night in Vegas, so I called up John's friend's girlfriend, who I'm fairly close to, and asked her if she knew what was going on with John, since he had been at their place a lot this past week instead of coming home. Eventually, she spilled the beans and told me he had plans of proposing to me that night at the fountains, but then didn't. That's why the two of them had been acting so confused. I kept grilling her and she also told me that John had told his friend that ""it didn't feel right"". She made me promise not to tell John that I knew because she didn't want anyone to be upset with her.

I'm feeling sick to my stomach. We live together and he has been spending all of his time at his friend's house or at his parents place since we got back. He barely calls me or responds to my texts anymore. I don't know what happened that night but I feel like he's about to end things. 

I want to talk to him, but I don't know how to approach the issue. Do I just say, ""hey, I heard you were gonna pop the question the other night, but changed your mind. What gives?""

Was he really nervous? Ah I'm freaking out.

tl;dr found out boyfriend was going to propose but changed his mind at the very last minute. Said it ""didn't feel right"", don't know what to do.

For the past several months we've had a heavy flirtation going on, but we're just friends (I think you can tell where this is going).

We got in today after a long train, and we started drinking with my mates. We all started watching a movie, and over the course of the movie my bff and I went from sitting to holding hands to cuddling. Then, when we got up to go to bed (we had to share a bed, but we've slept together platonically before, so it was nbd), it became obvious how drunk she was . She could barely walk down the hall, she was tripping and falling so much. I had to help her walk.

We got to the bedroom, and she starts hitting on me. She's nibbling my ear, fiddling with my belt, and trying to pull my shirt off. We're both laughing at this point, because it's still fully hitting me exactly what's happening. Then she asks, in this very giggly-slurred-drunk way, ""Do you want to fuck me?""

The answer to that is Yes, I do want to fuck her. Well and often. But she was far too drunk to give consent. I her that she was drunk, but she kept taking my shirt off, and having a hard time at it. I told her we were going to go to sleep and she should get ready for bed. I went to the bathroom and jerked off (I am human, after all), and when I got back, she was in her underwear, struggling to get a shirt on. I helped her, then got into bed. She started coming onto me again, kind of grasping and fumbling and trying to nibble my neck, so said ""Lets just lie here for a while."" So she cuddled up to me and pretty quickly fell asleep.

I've never been in a situation like this. I've never had a romantic situation (if you can call it that) with a friend, and I've never had to deal with a girl this drunk. I don't know if I should bring it up or not, but my natural inclination is to let sleeping dogs lie, and in the morning (after she gets sick) if she asks I'll tell the truth, but probably won't bring it up. I don't know if that's the right course of action, however.

So, reddit, what do you think I should do in the morning?

1352923803.0,227,self.relationships,1374zd,My adult son [22] moved back in with me [41] and is just generally making my life miserable. ,DepressedandHurting,269,42,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1374zd/my_adult_son_22_moved_back_in_with_me_41_and_is/,"My son has been arrested/had run ins with the police a few times for DUI, reckless driving, public intoxication and so on. 

I asked him to come stay with me to get some help.

Because I wanted to help him start over, I paid for him to move here, paid for medical care, food, living expenses, etc. This was with the understanding that he would do his part around the house, not get arrested again, and other everyday rules. 

He refuses psychiatric care, he won't go to therapy or admit he has a drinking problem. 

He was arrested last week for public intoxication. I spent a bunch of time looking up information online to see if he would go back to jail. I had a free consultation with an attorney.

All this time, he was sleeping. He does work nearly a full time job, but frequently misses the bus and I take him because I want him to have money for bills and such since I can't support him long term. 

He basically goes to work, comes home and drinks or smokes weed until he can't function, eats and sleeps. That's it. No friends, no life really. 

He blames me for everything. He blames me for everything from not having a girlfriend to his unhappiness. He saw me as a tyrant growing up because I expected him to go to school, clean up around the house, have a curfew and so on. 

I wake him up around noon on his days off usually and ask him to do things like check into his probation and sell his car, which has been sitting in my driveway (his license is suspended and he can't get a new one unless I give him $700, which I won't do). I ask him to do things like clean his dishes and his room, which has cigarette burns on the floor and old food laying around. 

I could go on, but you get the idea. 

Our conversations go like this: 

Me: Hey, look, I love you and I'm trying to help you, but you've got to show up for your life.

Him: There's nothing wrong with me! You were a bad mother, you yelled at me all the time and I have anxiety! 

Me: Well, if I was too hard, I'm sincerely sorry, but it doesn't change that you're not living healthy and I'm worried about you.

Him: I'm fine! You just don't like who I am! I don't want to work for someone else for little pay for the rest of my life! 

Me: That's fine. But, how are you going to make that happen?

Him: I'm selling my car and hitchhiking across the country! 

Me: That's not a lot of money and you owe other people money right now.

Him: FUCK IT! I don't care! I don't want to live how you want me to live! You're holding me back! You made me move here away from all of my friends!

I didn't make him move. I offered him a place to stay. He'd been evicted after running up a $7000 bill at the house he rented. Also, his roommate had moved out because my son got drunk and pulled a loaded gun on him. 

I don't know what to do. I try talking to him and he just says, ""I'm sick of hearing this from you. Leave me alone. I just need to get enough money to get out of here!""

I paid for him a gym membership because he thought that might help his depression. But, he won't go. He won't seek any other help. He says he's fine and that he's not doing anything any other person his age does.

I'm sick of it. He's all the family I have. My mother and I are estranged because she's a former abusive drug addict/alcoholic and current Jesus freak. I couldn't take it, we don't speak.

My boyfriend, who is a good guy is sick of my son. He's never said a negative word to him. My son says my bf hates him. The truth is my bf doesn't think much of him, but doesn't say so. It's hard to respect someone who causes so much pain and won't even be bothered to pick food up off the floor in a house we all share. I get it, but he's my son. I feel like I walk a tightrope. 

I don't know what to do. He won't listen to me, he hates me. 

TLDR: My son is, for lack of a better word, a loser. It's painful to watch and I don't know how to help.

So, basically, I let it eat at me for a while and I finally said something.  I sat her down and told her that it really concerns me that they talk, it makes me uncomfortable, and I didn't know how I should feel about it.  She told me that they only talk sparingly and it's usually just catching up, and that I had nothing to worry about.

Fast forward three weeks or so.  There's a way on SnapChat to see the top 3 people that your friends snap, and I noticed that his name overtook mine.  So, obviously, I was upset, because now it seemed like it was more than just catching up.  

Throughout the entire time we dated, a whopping 4 months, she always told me that she was very happy with me,  enjoyed being with me, and although didn't want something serious at the time she wanted to keep working toward something serious.  Again, the time we talked about her ex, she told me that I shouldn't worry and it was not a big deal.  So I message her while she's at work, letting her know what I saw and that it really made me upset and uncomfortable.  After all, she was dating me, very recent exes should just be out of the picture.  At least for courtesy.  

She comes over after work and basically straight up tells me she has unresolved feelings for him and is going to give him another chance.  This is the guy who left her at the airport when she flew into town to visit him and didn't even show up to the house, at all, that night.  The guy who never once bought her a gift, celebrated an anniversary, or celebrated a holiday with her.  A guy who never once came to visit her.  A guy who, when she got into the final round of a law school mock trial competition and unfortunately lost, told her ""Sorryz.  But hey I got a new phone!""  A guy who she constantly told me she was unhappy with and felt like there was too much shit to work out.  The guy who told her that ""you're immediately replaceable"" when she had her first real talk with him (not even to break up, just to talk).  The guy who told her that he refuses to be with anyone who has pets and basically told her she would have to get rid of her cats (she has not and will not do this).  Just to name a few issues.

And now she wants to give him another chance.  Not only that, but she told me she can see herself marrying him.  I'd like to note that two months before this, she not only said she can't see herself marrying him, but that she doesn't want to.  

So here's my thing.  I'm having a few issues right now.  First of all, I understand that, objectively, it must seem silly to react so badly.  But I have no idea how to explain it other than the cliche ""this one felt so much more different.""  Like, before she and I even started dating, something in my mind was like ""this is the girl you're going to marry.""  And during the relationship, everybody thought we were going to get married.  For the first two months (before her ex started talking to her again), the relationship was beyond perfect.  I mean it was storybook perfect.  And for once, I feel like I really did everything right.  I opened doors for her, spoke with her every day, bought her dinner, surprised her with random, small gifts, etc.  Indeed, she's constantly told her friends that I did nothing wrong, which is leaving me at a complete loss as to why this happened.

So here's a few things I would like your opinions and cold-hard truths about.  First, I have no idea what he said in the span of two months to make her go from ""I don't want to marry him"" to ""I can see myself marrying him.""  But I have this enormously burning need to know.  I know it won't do me any good at all, I just have to know.  I suspect that (because I've been hearing this from other people) he told her that he turned down a job in Florida and a job in DC for her (he's been unemployed for over a year and is not licensed to practice law in either of those states, so I think that's not only a lie, but really stupid).  But either way, how do I control this?  Do I just ignore it?  

Second, how do I cope with this outrageous anger I have toward her?  I feel extremely used and devalued.  My relationship before her was pretty much 3 years of the same story, so this girl doing this to me pretty much feels like salt in the wounds.  

Finally, I feel like I'm objectively logical about this, but subjectively stupid.  I realize what she did was absolutely shitty for any person to do (tell me everything is OK and not to worry about him when she was secretly talking to him for two months), but I have this part of me that absolutely does not want to give up on her.  When I say that we felt absolutely perfect, I'm not even kidding.  I want that back.  But I don't know (a) whether I should try, or (b) if it's even worth it.  And if it is, how do I do it?  Do I just leave her alone and let her make her own mistakes?  

She's changed over the past couple months.  She's turned very stone cold and has become extremely hardened and secretive, even toward her close friends, and it's starting to push some of them away, too.  That's something else that upsets me, because this dude was so abusive for the year and a half they were together that I have absolutely no doubt that he's feeding her lines about how she doesn't need them and they aren't worth it.

So anyways.  It ended badly, I really really really like her and fell for her very damn hard, and I'm having the hardest time in the world coping with it and just wanted some tips on how I can overcome this very selfish and (frankly none of my business) need to know what happened, and how I can cope with this burning anger I have toward her for doing this to me.

Thanks for reading this guys.

EDIT: I'm starting to believe, from reading all this, that it's not that she was the perfect girlfriend, but that for the first two months it was exactly what I want a relationship to be.  And that's what I'm holding onto.  The more that I can convince myself that there is more than one person out there who can offer the perfect relationships, the easier it'll be to move on

We have a generally good relationship, talk regularly, get along, have sex daily, etc.

Recently we had a conversation about strip clubs, I told him I have no care about him going to strip clubs, but getting lap dances goes beyond what I am comfortable with.

He said he has gotten lap dances while we've been dating and has no intention to stop getting them.  We got into an argument because as I stated, this goes beyond what I am comfortable with, but since we hadn't actually talked about it before, I cannot get too mad at him for getting them while we've been dating.  

However, I told him I'd really appreciate it if he doesn't get lap dances anymore and he said that he would not stop getting them because he sees nothing wrong with them.  I told him it feels like that isn't respecting my boundaries within the relationship.  

His response was that if I just want to control him and if I don't allow lap dances then there is no limit to the things I won't allow such as going out with his friends, bachelor parties, or weekend trips.  I pointed out to him that since we've been dating, he goes on regular weekend trips, been to bachelor parties, and out with friends - I had never had any fuss about these and wished him well.  He acknowledged that that is true, but said he will still never stop getting lap dances on the principle of the matter.

This really hurts me and makes me feel like he has no respect for my boundaries.  I feel like it won't matter if I ever bring up when something makes me uncomfortable because if he sees nothing wrong with it, what I'm uncomfortable with doesn't matter.  To me, it seems irrational of him to project a hypothetical situation into the future of me not allowing him to go out with friends because I told him I don't want him getting lap dances.  

Am I being controlling and/or irrational?


TL;DR - boyfriend gets lap dances at strip clubs, I don't care about strip clubs but don't want him to get lap dances.  He says I'm being irrational and controlling in that request and refuses to give up lap dances.


**UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the replies, was not expecting to hear so many responses.  There do seem to be some trends, and I recognize that the phrasing of the question and situation is certainly one-sided and makes my partner seem more disrespectful than probably necessary.  What I am seeing though is a relatively strong divide on people who feel strongly about this issue on either sympathizing with me or him.  There is some great advice on how to properly address the issue in light of the difficultly of both of our stubborn natures.** 

**At this point, based on what I'm seeing - there are plenty of other men and women who feel as strongly about lap dances as I do, I suppose even though the issue isn't settled, feeling validated is nice (but I won't be using that alone as justification for my cause).  There are also several men and women who feel as though he is right in seeing lap dances as harmless.**  

**I heard a lot of ""Dump him now, he doesn't respect you,"" but I wouldn't throwaway this relationship so quickly without a little calmer, more rational conversation - we're capable of that and I'm sure if this relationship doesn't work out, it will end on a calm, realistic note, not in anger over principles/jealousy.  So we talked a little more, in a calmer state and agreed upon a couple things:**

**1. I am allowed to feel any emotions I experience, just because he thinks they're silly things to get worked up over doesn't make my emotions any less valid.**

**2. He told me that he was irrational to assume I would start taking away weekend trips, bachelor parties, or bro time because it has been clear in the past that those were never threatened or even cared about on my end.**

**3. He told me that he really doesn't care about lap dances, cares about me, and because of the way I addressed this in a calmer, more rational manner (thanks reddit for helping me with the language!) that my concerns made sense.  He said he will still probably have one or two more lap dances in his life at bachelor parties likely, but I will be on his mind and the idea of hurting me over something unnecessary will be enough to skip them.**

**Part of this last conclusion was established when I pointed out how upset and hurt he was a long while back when I went streaking with some friends (men and women) even though I saw it as harmless and he thought I crossed the line - that allowed him to understand that while we may disagree on the specific issue at hand, respecting each other and giving up these silly non-necessities that don't really matter to either of us in the big picture is more important.  We both agreed that these are based on our different moral opinions and emotional responses, that doesn't make either of us irrational or controlling, just concerned or hurt by the situations.**

Excuse me if I'm doing it wrong.
I need advice, help or ideas. I'm currently living in Argentina as a NEET and was being supported by my dad since I left my job (4 months ago). I tried to get a job but I really had no luck until now. Before that I conserved my job for 5 years.
Yesterday, my dad beat the crap out of me, and I even had a partial seizure after the fight, biting very bad my tongue in the process. I cannot speak properly and it hurts more than anything when I try to eat something.
Tonight, he gave me $50 bucks, took my cellphone (which it was a birthday present from him) and told me to kill myself for tomorrow night. My mom is a drug addict so my family consist only of my dad and me. I'm 26 and he is 50.
What should I do? I never saw my dad so frustrated at my presence, it was like he really was begging to me to kill myself.. and obviously I have nowhere to go. No friends IRL, nothing.
Honestly I do not mind killing myself if I get the courage and prepare beforehand a proper method... it wouldn't be my first attempt and I'm depressed enough; but I don't want to kill myself because someone else is asking me too. Is that selfish?
It's not my fault getting a job has been extremely difficult lately. And I have a good resume overall. I used to be a programmer and a UNIX system administrator.
tl;dr: Suddenly my dad beat me up and I had a seizure which scares me a lot. Now he is begging me to kill myself for tomorrow night. I have no one close to ask for help, and I already tried commit suicide once. Don't know what to do.

Please help me.",isellputs,313,92,645,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pggli/my_wife_tested_me_i_failed_and_now_divorceis_this/,"**Background:**  I'm 30M and she is 30.We've been married for 1 year and 8 months but lived together for 5 years before getting married. No kids. We have been fighting since the day we got married because she got into an altercation with my family (my mom) and supposedly, I did the wrong thing and sided with my family.  Ok, I know that in laws and this sort of thing can definitely get sticky in a marriage but I tried to work through it.

I don't believe my character and intentions are bad. I've supported her and provided everything in the world for my wife.  I do not hit her or abuse her in anyway.  To be fair, there have been fights we had a year ago regarding my family where I did say some mean things to her but since then, I have corrected my self and refrain from using bad words and hurtful comments.  She, on the other hand still cusses me out, uses F-in this and f-in that, and demeaning comments towards me.

I made her apologize to my family for acting disrespectful towards them, which she did, reluctantly, but nevertheless, she did.  At the time, a year ago, I told her that if she could not get along with my family, we couldn't be married. So I guess it was an ultimatum.  I am very close to my parent and right now they are getting old and really need my help the most. I am not going to put them in a home, ever. They've done so much for me and raised me, went through ups and downs with me, bailed me out of several sticky situations, and I cannot thank them enough. So it is very important for my wife to get along with my family because I do spend the weekends with them.

In return for the ""apology"" my wife made to my parents, I promised my wife that I would ignore and disregard anything negative she says or does to me (these were her terms).  Basically act normal even when she is upset and bringing down the world on my shoulders.

Since last Oct, we've been fighting a great deal about this said ""promise.""  Every fight we had had since then she says that I broke the promise and I am a liar. It usually goes like this: She cusses me out, says really mean stuff, hurtful things, and not being able to take all the verbal abuse, I end up making a sarcastic or passive aggressive remark.  That remark or comment I made, makes her even more mad, and she gets louder and angrier. Basically, she wants to yell at me like a piece of trash and I sit there and ""take it"" and ""shut the fuck up.""

Well, since Jan 15th, we haven't been fighting much because she was basically yelling at me and I decided to ""shut the fuck up.""  So, things were going OK. By the way, she starts getting angry at me when I do little things wrong to make her mad. They are insignificant to me like coming home at 3:30 instead of 3, or forgetting to fill the dog bowl, or serving her cold fruit when she has told me repeatedly she likes it at room temperature, or putting too much cream cheese on her bagel and making it look sloppy,  i mean, just little things..nothing like cheating or lying.

She says, each and every consecutive time I break my promise to her, she will get worse and worse and it will take longer and longer for her to get over it.  She does not let things go easily. I can be mad today, and 20 mins later, I'm fine and happy again. She cannot do this.  She also says she will be testing me the more I break these promises and she NEEDS to test me to make sure that this final promise I made to her is FOR REAL.

**The Kicker:**

Well, she tested me 2 days ago, and I failed miserably. She was on her period, so I understand she was moody. Ok. She was nagging me all day long about little things and such and I just simply apologized, and admitted fault.  

At night, I hand squeezed her a glass of Orange juice (which I left at room temp before squeezing) and said ""Baby do you want some OJ?""  She got furious at my question and sharply responded. ""When do I ever refuse oj? You normally just give it to me. In this case, you can drink it yourself.""  The only reason why I asked her this time was because she refused to eat those specific oranges because they were sour, so obviously I asked her because what if she didn't want to drink sour juice?

Knowing she was in a pissy mood, I did not let that comment phase me. Instead, we proceeded to play with the dogs, and about 5 minutes later, I said ""baby, are you going to drink your juice?""  Well she responded by picking up the glass and dumping the contents into the sink down the drain. Six whole hand squeezed oranges. It may just be OJ and a small thing, but you know, it hurt me really bad when she did that. 

I was FURIOUS at that and it kinda pushed me over the cliff. I responded in a soft tone ""you did not have to do that and you are a terrible person.""  Well, that blew her up and she cussed me out and cursed me and said, she was right, she knew I couldn't keep my promise and that I failed her again. Divorce.

My wife intentionally tested me and kept driving me over the cliff and set me up to fail.  I feel that she is abusing me this way and making me look like I am just a compulsive liar and cannot honor a simple promise when she has already lived up to her end by apologizing and getting along with my family.

Well, we haven't spoken for 2 days and when we did, it was her screaming at me.  I feel like ever day is a walk on the eggshells or I am walking in a mine field not knowing when or where I step and its going to explode in my face.  When the times are good, they are really good. BUT, they never last for more than a few days.  My wife acknowledges her anger and says it will only get better over time and if and only if I stick to my promise.

**TL;DR**  My wife is leaving me because I continually break my promise to her but I feel that she intentionally sets me up to fail her little tests. Wife also refuses counseling and is extremely stubborn and views her way as the right away 100%. I cannot talk to my wife. When she yells at me, if I open my mouth to respond, she yells even louder and I can never get a word in edgewise with her. The only things I can say to her are ""yes baby, I was wrong"" ""It's all my fault"" ""I screwed up again, I'm sorry.""

A little more background - we have been dating for four years and I have changed *so* much in this time. Our relationship has changed a lot too, but I'm not convinced it was ever built to last and the cracks are too big to ignore now. We don't have a lot in common so although I love her a lot there just isn't much in our lives we can share with each other.

I'm not very romantic and I never really *did* much for her, and this only got worse as I/we lost faith in the relationship. I really wish it didn't have to end but I just don't think we were really making each other as happy as a relationship could.

We ended up having a disagreement to which she responded by punching me in the face.  I tried to hold her back, but she's a strong gal.  She ended up taking a few good swings to my face until my roommates came home.  When the two of them tried to restrain her, she hit each of them in the face.

I'm really not sure what to say or what to expect from her.  I don't know if this will end up being an isolated, drunken incident.  Is it something worth being patient about?  My girlfriend has also been the best friend I've ever had, and I care about her deeply.  At the very least, I plan to be there for her regardless.  But how significantly should this incident determine the future of our relationship?

Help.",cranberrybeer,277,57,342,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10ypyv/20f_i_love_my_boyfriend_of_two_years24m_but_i/,"Our relationship has been fine for two years... we have been in love and happy. We have always genuinely wanted to be together consistintly. About half way through our relationship we decided we wanted to move to another state together, so for the last year we planned our move. I might add that we lived together before the decision so we established that we were comfortable sharing the same roof. He treats me very well and goes out of his way to do things for me all the time. 

  Well, a little back story: at 18, I was the oldest girl he had ever been with. His first serious relationship in which he lived and commuted with a girl equally. He has always been a bit... childish about things. Kind of like the spoiled only child you knew. It wasn't too terrible, he got stuff done, but it was an issue with him that he was very defensive about. Like a child. Anyway. He was also very, very strange about his phone. Very secretive and almost violent. And everything on his computer is zipped or hidden and password protected. This was the first notable red flag. Another would be that he jerks off anywhere from 3-6 times a day. He has denied me sex for jerking off and that has made me upset before. I must for his sake add that he is a very ""good"" boyfriend. Very affectionate and thoughtful and has always treated me extremely well and given me lots of love. He always made me very happy. 

  Well I began using his things with no ill intent at all and he started to become more and more strange. I started to notice things. His internet history would always be clear. I used his phone camera and for a split second it showed pictures that he had deleted. I became very suspicious and I all though I am NOT proud of it at all, I snooped.

  I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at what I found. Literally hundreds of pictures  of jail bait. Perhaps thousands.  There were lots from even before we were dating.  I also found a shit load of pics of his exes all when they were underage. He had mostly accessed the folder of his exes, every single day. The pictures were all girls aged between 14-19 and most would be considered  illegal and child porn. All self shots, no men in any of them. It was the only porn I could find on his computer. 

  I felt like this wasn't everything so I said nothing until I could see on his phone. I would have confronted him about but he would first deny it and lie like I was stupid and second delete everything entirely so I could never know the truth. What I found on his phone was worse. I opened a locked app and clicked out almost immediately. It was a girl that looked between 10-12 in a sexualized outfit and pose. I became hysterical and immediately confronted him about everything. He did exactly like I thought... denied it, lied and tried to tell me I was wrong, then got angry and stormed out.

  I'm gonna wrap this up. He destroyed his hard drive and phone and threw them in a lake. He though I was gonna call the cops. He swore he was  gonna be honest  about everything  with a fresh start once we move,  putting all that behind him. Did I mention we had already signed a lease we can't get out of a week before moving? When I asked what else he was hiding, he said it was a lot. I asked what age, he said (I could still cry) ""Under high school age."" We moved and I now despise him. I hate him. I notice things now, he only checks out younger girls. The  things he says about women. I hate him now. I love him and still do but I don't want to touch him, or be around him, or look at him. I want his company sometimes but am constantly reminded of the betrayal and hurt. He says I am now overreacting. That I am obsessed with it and that all men do it. 

  I want to know what YOU would do in this situation. Am I wrong, Reddit? Am I obsessed and do all men really act upon this sort of thing? I want to run for the hills but I am in another state with no one I know and a lease with him I cannot break.  There is no one I can talk to about it because I am too embarassed. Would you call the cops? Would you look over something like this for someone you love? That is the biggest question. Would you look this over and forget about it? Does this end a relationship?

How can I (f30) work past this?,triggerthrow1,320,100,419,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zg11b/husband_m29_reveals_a_shocking_opinion_on_rape/,"m29, f30 married 2 yrs, going out 2 yrs before.

I've just had a very intense argument with my husband of 2 years. My heart is pounding as I write this. 

Basically there was an article in today's paper. The article was about a man who came home early to find his wife in bed with a neighbour. So the man goes back out, gets a couple of his friends/neighbours and they drag the couple out. They beat the man up. The husband takes his wife outside on the street where a crowd has gathered, and in the words of the article ""had public sex with her"" as all and sundry watched and she cried. In between the raping, he also took the time to slap her around.

Now, I was as horrified as I'm sure many of you are. I conveyed this to my hubby and was shocked at his reply. He basically was of the opinion that the husband did nothing wrong. He had a right to punish his wife for cheating on him. He said that because the wife publicly humiliated him he had a right to do the same. He did not even agree that it was rape, because they are married. The one thing he concedes is that he shouldn't have hit her.

Note, we live in a non-western culture that is institutionally sexist and concepts such as marital-rape have not sunk in here. My husband is a product of being raised in this culture while I have had the privilege of studying overseas. My husband has also been cheated on and it really affected him. But common sense and basic human empathy should make it clear that the husband in the story was wrong wrong wrong. I'm shocked and horrified by my husband's opinion and it's really starting to change how I look at him. We argued for a long while, and then he basically shut down because I was ""overreacting"" - I started crying and shaking because it really struck a nerve with me. 

I don't want to have another argument but I really can't be content to think that my husband really thinks this way. Do I bring it up again? What can I do to change his mind? If he doesn't change his mind, wtf does that mean for us?

1376531552.0,217,self.relationships,1ke3y6,I[18F] am concerned about my niece's[6F] racism. Help?,heartcafe,285,68,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ke3y6/i18f_am_concerned_about_my_nieces6f_racism_help/,"My sister has 3 kids (elementary kids) who I all love very much and every week or so, I help out and babysit the kids for a day while she gets some much needed me time. To give more context, my sister is  a full southeast asian with a slight tan skin and her husband is a really white caucasian american. Both are warm people and neither ever displayed any racist tendencies!

All of them are loving and sweet, however my 6 year old niece (Let's just give the name 'Suzie') sometimes say really inappropriate racist comments that I have no idea where she gets it from. I know kids can say inappropriate things and we just shrug them off as ""kids say the darndest things"" but she goes WAY above and beyond to the point where I'm super uncomfortable. 

Examples:

1. We were in the car and Macklemore's ""Thriftshop"" came on the radio and she yelled, ""Change it, Auntie heartcafe! I don't want to listen to a brown singer."" I changed it but commented that Macklemore was white and Suzie said, ""Why would a white man want to sing like a brown man? That's so weird."" I said that people can sing whatever they want and she shrugged.

2. Sometimes she makes comments such as, ""Only brown people play saxophones."" (ironically, I played saxophone in HS -_-) Which I shrug off, but then sometimes she goes wayyyy out there like and I do a double take, ""You won't see a brown person in -insert nearby university that we are passing by-, Auntie heartcafe. That's because they aren't smart."" I honestly did not know what to say.

3. Playing barbies, she gave me a black barbie that she owned and said, ""Here, you can have the ugly one."" I said to her, ""Aww, I don't think she's ugly. Why do you think she's ugly?"" She said, ""Because she's so brown!! Look at her!"" Not wanting to push the subject, we just started playing.

4. We were on the computer playing those dress up games and she wanted me to create a girl that looked at her. When I finished making her character, Suzie went into a tantrum, ""Why did you make her so ugly!? Do you think I'm ugly?"" I was so confused, I said, ""No baby, I don't think you're ugly! I was trying to make her as pretty as possible. What's wrong?"" She was yelling and screaming, ""She's so dark!! I'm not that dark! WHY DID YOU DO THAT? She's UGLY!!"" The thing is I didn't even put the darkest skin tone. I put the tan one. [This is what her skin color really is.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/US_Navy_050117-N-9951E-161_A_young_Indonesian_girl_poses_for_a_photo_near_the_town_of_Glebruk,_one_of_the_many_coastal_towns_on_the_island_of_Sumatra,_Indonesia_hit_by_the_Tsunami_that_struck_South_East_Asia_December_26,_2004.jpg) I don't even consider that pretty dark for a skin color.

5. Now the reason I made this post was because of an incident that happened today. We were relaxing at home and having fun with charades (a game where you try to guess what the other person is acting out) so Suzie goes up and she literally starts acting like a monkey. She pouted her lips, put her hands behind ears and started dancing around and rolling on the ground. So obviously, I said, ""Are you a monkey?"" She giggles and said, ""Close!"" THEN, she went towards my purse and then she began taking money from it! I angrily went and stopped her, but then she said, ""But that's what brown people do!!"" I literally went wide eyed so I asked her, ""Is that what you were acting?"" and she nods. I was so shocked that I yelled at her to never to do something like that again and she went off crying. She was still mad at me when I left the house when my sister got back.

And this is only her, none of the other two kids have ever said remotely anything similar. The thing is that she only says these kind of things in front of me, never her mother or father for what I know. I'm not quite sure what race she's targeting (brown is a huge spectrum) but I suspect that she puts blacks and latinos together. 

This is a huge concern for me because as an Asian, she is pretty tan herself as well as her mother (The picture of the girl in the link above is almost a copy of her.) I'm afraid that not only will these views will isolate the people she can be friends with in school but will cause her to hate herself and her skin color. I feel that because I'm like 2 to 3 shades lighter, (staying indoors for an unhealthy amount of time -_-) she feels like it's ok to tell me these things when really, it's totally not ok ever!

 I'm not sure if my sister knows about this or not and I'm not quite sure how to approach the subject with either my niece or my sister. Help reddit!!

Is it right to feel so betrayed and angry right now?",wanderingw,282,62,251,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10e78y/my_fiancee_recently_confessed_that_she_used_to_be/,"My fiancee (female, 26) and I (male, 31) have been engaged for six months but have been together for four years. We're starting to get serious about setting a date and have begun looking at venues for the ceremony/reception. On Saturday, while debating the pros and cons of several places, she abruptly became very serious and said to me: ""There's something I need to tell you.""

No good conversation ever starts out with that phrase.

I already knew a lot about her tumultuous past: she came from an abusive home, dropped out of high school when she was 16 and supported herself by stripping at a very shady club (yes, they knew she was underage and no, they did not care). She got heavily into drugs, heroin specifically, before getting arrested for possession. Instead of sentencing her to prison she was ordered to complete a treatment program, which she did. She got clean, easily received her GED, and then went to college. We met when she was starting her first year at a very respectable state college after receiving her Associate's Degree at a community college.

What she had never told me before this weekend is that in addition to stripping she was also a prostitute between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three. Yes, even when she was in treatment she was prostituting herself. And yes, for roughly the first year we were together she was still having sex for money without my knowledge.

She swears now that she hasn't been with anyone besides me since quitting that ""job"" three years ago. She claims that the reason she never told me before now is that back when she first told me about her days as a stripper I seemed sort of disgusted. Which might be true, I don't know. I was basically indifferent about it to tell the truth but it's completely possible that I reacted in a less-than-understanding way through visual/non-verbal actions.

Now that I know she was also a prostitute everything is different. For the first time since we started dating I actually made up an excuse rather than go to bed with her last night. I slept on the couch. This morning she was really upset about that but I just played it off like I fell asleep reading which was sort of true: I was reading and I did fall asleep on the couch. What I didn't tell her is that I did it on purpose.

She cheated on me! That's what part of me keeps thinking. Another part of me is just disgusted that she would do something so low and debasing as having sex for money. But the logical part of me keeps reminding me that she was in a very desperate situation back then. Who am I to judge her for doing what she had to do to get by?

I honestly don't know what to think. Suddenly the idea of marrying this woman isn't as appealing as it was just two days ago. I'm looking for any sort of advice: how should I proceed? Am I over-reacting? Should I tell her what I think or just appreciate she was honest with me (finally) and keep my mouth shut?

We have a heathy relationship, no fighting or violence or anything like that.

For roughly 1.5 years, I have known that she suffers from Bulimia(undiagnosed, but she most certainly would be if she were to ever talk with a doctor). I'm one of a very small group of people that she has ever told about her problem, and I'm fairly certain that I'm the only person she has told who doesn't also suffer from some form of ED. Apparently when she gets together (not very often, but occasionally) with these friends they talk with one another about their problems. But when they talk with each other, they just discuss their EDs as accomplishments; she has referred to having an ED as being ""part of a club"".

She has been dealing with this problem for close to 4 years now, and she tells me that most of the time it's not very severe, but that it has its flair ups, where it can be pretty damn scary in my opinion (purging multiple times a day, severe self-hatred, etc.). She told me that she purged so badly a few days ago that she thought she bruised something internally, as it hurt to breath for the rest of the day.

Apparently, her problem has been pretty intense recently. And just today, we ended up nonchalantly talking about strange things that give us senses of satisfaction, and she told me that she gets satisfaction over watching skinny people become fat. She works at a frozen yogurt place and she says that when she watches overweight people get very unhealthy yogurts, she ""smirks and gets such a sense of satisfaction"".

I am not overweight, but this irks me very badly, and I find it cruel and twisted.

I have talked to her multiple times about seeing a therapist, but she tells me that she won't because her parents would never allow her (they both think therapy is bogus/for lunatics). She has never told them about her condition, and she is very good at hiding it from pretty much everyone. I also know that she doesn't want to see a therapist for her own reasons; when I begged her to see a therapist a week ago for her ED, she said she couldn't because she ""needs it right now"".

I reeeeally want to inform someone, anyone, about what she's going through, but she begged me to promise her to never tell a soul about anything, and I foolishly made that promised. She trusts me completely, and I feel like if I were to tell someone and she found out, things would never be the same.

The learning of this new ""source of satisfaction"" has been the last straw. We love each other dearly, and I would never even consider leaving her for anything like this, but I feel like her ED can no longer be ignored. It really just kills me inside to know that she is hurting herself, and it also kills me inside that she doesn't see herself as the same beautiful person that I do. I feel helpless.

Please help me, I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Long-time girlfriend has ED, says that watching skinny people get fat gives her sense of satisfaction, this makes me very uncomfortable. She refuses to get help, but I don't think I can deal with her problem anymore.

My story can't really have a happy ending cause someone is still dead, but things are a lot better since my last post. There were still a lot of tears and hugs, but It was actually a pretty good summer. My GF and I spent a lot of time down the shore, and that really helped. I think it was good for her to get out of town because everyone here is walking on eggshells around her whole family and it was good for her to get out and be treated like a normal person, we had good times down there and it was good to see her laugh and smile.

Back at home my family has a lot of BBQs during the summer, and we made sure that we invited her whole family over, her parents are coping a lot better now and they seemed to have a good timing hanging out.

Things are still tough, and some days are better than others. I know that this isn't something that will ever be ""gotten over"" but my GF and her family are doing a lot better than they were a few months ago. School is going to start in about a week and I know that might be tough on her, but hopefully it won't be too bad.

**Partner:** Female, 25

**Backstory:** We met through mutual friends about two years ago, when I still lived back in my hometown. I got on with her, we had similar interests, a similar sense of humour and I asked her out on a date. Several dates later we made it official. As of now, we have been dating almost twenty months. 

We don't live together, I live alone in a house that I own (I have a mortgage) whilst she lives with her friend in a rented apartment. We don't live in the same town but I'm only a 35 minute drive from her, so we meet three or four times a week. Every was great for the first year and a bit. However, about five or six months ago, she began to change from the girl I love to someone with a massive issue. Her father had recently divorced her mother and my SO took it pretty bad. I tried to help her through it but she blamed it all on me, took it out on me, hit me (not hard enough to cause me any harm but it shocked me to say the least). I would stand up for myself and leave her be until she came crawling back apologizing. 

However, this didn't stop here. She purposely ignored my birthday, made it a living hell, she would come over in the middle of the night to my house and scream at me, she would throw my possessions around, breaking everything in a rage. And after the fight had finished, she would blame the argument and the broken items on me. 

One time, she even came to my workplace and accused me of cheating on her in front of everyone. Not only was I totally embarrassed, my boss was not pleased with me. My hopes of ever getting a bonus or a promotion took a heavy hit that day, as it was not professional to mix personal issues with work, according to him. 

So about a week ago, I decided I wanted to end it. She was making me more upset everyday, accusing me of things that she knows deep down I would never do. I went over to hers and told her calmly that I wanted to split up and that she should seek some kind of help as her behavior was not normal. 

However, she wouldn't let me. She would tell me that ""I wasn't thinking straight"" and that I couldn't break up with her ""because we were meant to be together"". Then she began to get angry and violent, throwing things. She told me she'd kill me before she let me break up with her and then she told me she would accuse me of rape and domestic violence if I did so. 

Now I know that if she went to the police and accused me of this, my life could potentially be over. I would have a criminal record, it would be there for every potential employer to see. Who would hire someone who beats and rapes his girlfriend? She knew she had me in a corner, so I told her to calm down and told her I wasn't thinking straight, I was just stressed with work and of course I wanted us to be together.

Reddit, I feel trapped. I can't run away because I have only recently bought my house, I have my mortgage to pay off and my family and friends are where I live. This girl is threatening to ruin my life and I have no idea how to get out of this train wreck of a relationship. There must be someway out of this.

TL;DR: My girlfriend will accuse me of rape and domestic violence if I break up with her. She is constantly angry and violent with me, so much so it's interfering with my work life. What do I do reddit? I feel trapped.

I asked him what's so interesting about her that he has to check her profile 3 or 4 times a week, and he didn't have an answer, he just resorted to calling me insecure, saying that he was over her and had no interest in her anymore. So I said if that's the case then why feel the need to type her name into the search bar and browse her profile, but again he had no answer, and kept avoiding the question. I felt at that point that it wasn't worth causing an argument, so I let the conversation go. 

I also recently found out that he has been storing a large number of explicit pictures of her on his computer. You could easily say that he simply forgot they were there, but that's unfortunately not the case. He's been accessing these pictures regularly, even though he told me he had deleted all such pictures earlier this year. He *pinky* promised me that he got rid of them, and now I find that he simply moved them (to folder on the hard drive that is being used to store my uni work, go figure...he must think I'm stupid). I dropped it into conversation and he said that if he had any pictures like that it must be because he forgot that they were there, which made me quite annoyed because I had checked the date the folder was last accessed in order to know if he was lying or not. 

I know this all seems rather sneaky on my part but my boyfriend is very good at avoiding questions, turning thing around and wriggling out of accusations, so the only way to ever get answers to anything is to find them myself. At least this way he won't be able to turn it around and try and convince me it's just me being paranoid. 

Additionally, when we were first going out he would talk about her all the time. We couldn't do anything, go anywhere or have any conversation that wouldn't be related back to her: ""Oh me and XXX went here once,"" ""I remember when I did this with XXX,"" etc. He even used to accidentally call me her name quite regularly, something which became very annoying after about a year. Early in the relationship she contacted him, asking for money. He kept this hidden from me for a while, but eventually came clean that he was giving her extra money in addition to the money he owed her from when they were together. I told him to stop giving her the additional money, and he agreed. It felt like he was still trying to please her and get on her good side, even though he was with me. Why would he agree to pay her money he didn't owe? And why did it take my intervention to stop it? 

It's been two years since we started going out, three since they broke up,  and I still can't seem to shake this feeling that my boyfriend isn't over his ex. His constant talking about her and comparing has left it's mark on me, which is why I need to know whether or not my fears are justified, or simply something my mind has conjured from the scraps of old issues. 

I don't like to snoop or check up on people, which is why I haven't looked further into this. I don't want to breach his privacy. The pictures I found were on our now shared computer, in a folder dedicated to backing up my final year uni work. I have confronted him about this before, and he denies having feelings for her. He even had the audacity to call me paranoid, when it's his behavior and white lies that have caused me to feel this way. 

Finally, I have confronted him about this a number of times, he's always reassured me that it's nothing, and I believe it until something else comes up to make me reconsider. It's at the point now that I'm starting to appear paranoid and insecure over this, as he seems to see it as some kind of obsession on my part, but it really isn't. All I want is the truth, and I don't feel as if I've got it yet. 

Thank you to anyone who has read this, I do appreciate you taking your time to read through this. It feels good to get this off my chest. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend keeps checking up ex on Facebook, and keeps looking at explicit pictures of ex he keeps on his computer. 

Am I overreacting, or is there a genuine cause for concern here? Should I confront him about this again, considering everything?

I have this uncle [M40ish] that makes me really uncomfortable. He has inappropriately touched me before, and made numerous sexual comments. Over the years he has made comments about how good I look, which usually leads to other inappropriate behavior. This post details the three major incidents of his inappropriate behavior.

This uncle is a very humorous guy, though some people don’t like this type of humor. In high school, he would have been that kid always making jokes. The class clown. Also, note that he is divorced, but got remarried around this time last year (2012).

***••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••***

**Incident #1**

About two or three years ago, he took my two younger brothers and I out to a fair, along with his toddler son. Him and my brothers (as well as my dad and other uncles) have this slightly perverted joke that they always use around each other. So while we were at the fair, my uncle and brothers were joking around about that. There was this small statue of a boy next to one of the rides, and he had his mouth open. Well you can guess what kind of jokes they started making. Later on, I got a corndog, and whenever I put it in my mouth, my uncle would make comments, and then he and my brothers would start cracking up. I sat down and he sat down next to me and kind of put his arm around me.

Later on we split up, because my brothers and little cousin wanted to go on some rides instead of going to check out the shops. While my uncle and I were walking to the buildings with the shops, he told me how good I looked. Then suddenly, he took out his camera and started walking behind me. Then he told me to stop so that he could take a picture with his hand on my ass. I continued walking, and after that he kept trying to take pictures. I stopped. He urged me to continue walking, but I refused. He was disappointed but said something like “Oh alright,” as if I was ruining his fun.

While we were at the buildings with the shops, he kept guiding me around with his hand on my lower back. He said that if I ever was uncomfortable, to say so and he would stop. I was like *Wtf, he knows that what he’s doing makes me feel uncomfortable, but he does it anyway?* We came across a jewelry section and he said I could pick out anything I wanted. I refused. Eventually we met back up with my brothers.

**Incident #2**

Some time after that (not sure how many months passed) he took me out to dinner. No physical contact, but there were some comments. Apparently, the server thought I was of-age (I was 15 or 16 at the time) because he asked me if I wanted wine. Basically, what my uncle said sums down to “Man, he thought I was banging this hot young chick!” Then proceeded to laugh like he always does.

**Incident #3**

Fast forward to about a month ago. My parents had the family over for a dinner. I was having a really bad day, and two of my uncles and older cousin upset me with the “humorous” things they were saying, so I went to my room to cool off. Well, my uncle comes in and feels bad because he thinks he’s the one that upset me. So he stays in for a while and tries to cheer me up with his sense of humor. After that, he started snooping around my room. He came upon two small bags from Victoria’s Secret. I had previously closed the bags with paper clips because of the obvious nature of their contents. My uncle gets all “Oooooooo” when he sees the bags, and asks if I have a boyfriend. He tries to open them, which I thought was way crossing the line. I swatted him away. He tried to convince me to “just let him see” but I wouldn’t budge.

Dinner is ready, and we go eat. Unfortunately, he is sitting next to me. Great. It felt like he was trying to flirt with me during dinner. At one point, he put his hand on my upper thigh and slowly moved it down for 2-3 seconds before laughing. Then he whispered to me to go in my room and try on the stuff in the bags, and then he would come in after me to see. I was like WHAT THE FUCKING HELL. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t joking, or if he was, he was only half-joking and half-serious. His wife was sitting right across from me at the dinner table. My jaw dropped and I said “NO!” He said “Why not? I would just look and I’d go in after you.” I was appalled. I tried to laugh it off after that and avoid all contact with him.

***••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••***

I know I should have been stern with him and tell him to back the fuck off. I don’t know why I didn’t. When these situations happen, it feels almost like an out-of-body experience. And then I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I don’t say anything, I just try to forget it happened. I try to avoid him.

I’m planning that the next time some crap like this happens, I will tell him to stop. Should I do anything else? I don’t want to tell my parents because that would be a really, really awkward situation, and could cause some serious family drama.

Is it hopeless?,,304,85,533,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/164bhg/my_husband_m25_and_i_f23_were_arranged_married_is/,"My husband and I are both of Afghan descent and we have been married for around three weeks now.  Our marriage was arranged, as is typical of Afghans for family reasons and such, with no real input from us.  We both have lived in Lahore, Pakistan for some years now and we come from a typical conservative background.

Our marriage isn't very good, to say the least.  We don't talk to each other much, we sometimes spend entire days doing things apart, to say we don't communicate well is an understatement.  We get into fights quite often, and then afterwards just spend more time apart.  

We haven't really made any serious effort to improve it either. It seems like anytime we approach each other, it's just a recipe for disaster.  None of the other aspects of marriage are doing so well for us either.  It is not the absolute most miserable situation ever, but it is not one that inspires much confidence and hope.

My husband is not a horrible person, not at all, he is a good man, but I don't know what the problem is, I guess it is just me?

Most people I talk to from around where I live tell me variants of ""stick together"" or ""it will work out eventually"".  Others from outside my country typically tell me the opposite.  I don't know who is right and who to believe, I'm honestly totally confused.

1355423207.0,217,self.relationships,14soly,"My wife (34) denies masturbating; I (34) know otherwise, and it's messing me up",secretschlicker,290,73,244,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14soly/my_wife_34_denies_masturbating_i_34_know/,"Sorry about the big ol' wall of text that follows.  I'm a wordy bastard and I absolutely suck at summarizing/condensing.  Thanks in advance to anyone who makes it to the bottom.

Maybe ten years ago, when we were just dating, I noticed on occasion that she seemed to be masturbating at night when she thought I was asleep.  At first it was hot, but our sex life wasn't great at the time, and I took it personally that she'd spurn my advances at night only to rub one out after I was asleep.  After a handful of instances over a few weeks, I confronted her about it (not angrily, but not gently, either) and she vehemently denied it.  I brought it up two or three more times shortly afterward to the same response.  I was never #totally# certain of what I'd witnessed and her denials were so strong, so I really wondered whether I had imagined the whole thing.  After a short stint of questioning my sanity, I decided that I'd probably never really know the answer and in all honestly it's just not that big of a deal, and so I put it out of my mind.

We got married three years later (seven years ago).  There have been a handful of times over the years where I've woken up and thought she might be having some solo fun.  I did not think much of it, though; I couldn't say for sure (in the years since that initial situation, I'd come to just assume that I'd imagined it all) and I didn't really care.  Pretty much everyone masturbates at least now and again and it shouldn't be a big deal.  Our sex life has its ups and downs like all married couples, but it's mostly been pretty good, so it's not like I felt left out or anything.

Fast forward to the present.  I've recently made a number of positive changes in my life (let go of some old anger, quit drinking, started running, etc.) and started going to bed with her at the same time every night versus staying up hours later as I had been doing for the past few years.  After a few nights, I woke up after twenty to thirty minutes and she was masturbating (there was no doubt).  Remembering how defensive she was in the past and not wanting to make her feel awkward, I just laid there quietly and enjoyed the show for a few minutes before falling back asleep.  The next morning I was really turned on and we had some crazy, wild sex before the kids woke up.

I started paying attention to it a little.  Our new routine is that we spoon (with her as big spoon) for a few minutes and then switch.  Nearly every night she lays against me with one hand between her legs and I can feel her “feeling around” a bit.  Sometimes I fall asleep before we switch and sometimes I'm almost asleep and stay put when she rolls over.  Several times in the past few weeks she's gone onto a full-on self-love session when she thinks I'm already asleep.  I haven't said anything at all (and have laid quietly so she can have her time, usually falling asleep before she's done)...I think it's hot, I don't have #any# issues with her doing it, and more than once I've used her “feeling around” as a cue to commence sexy times once we roll over.  I did think back to ten years ago one day and realize that I was probably not imagining things then and felt a little bit of resentment, but it was ten years ago and we were in a much different place and it really doesn't matter anymore.

We've been working through some trust and communication issues lately.  For the first time in our marriage, I've gotten her to begin opening up a bit and we've had a lot of very productive conversations and shared some secrets with each other that we've never shared before.  Our sex life is good, both in quality and quantity, but it's pretty vanilla and communication about it has always been awkward and uncomfortable, so we've included it a couple of times in the talks we've been having.

A week ago, she brought up masturbation unprompted.  She said that she's #never# done it.  I didn't believe her at first, but I sort of played along, and said that I think she ought to try it (it feels good, gets you more comfortable with your own body, helps you figure out what you like, I think it's hot, etc.).  She replied that she'd #never# be comfortable enough to even try it, that it just seems “weird”, and that she honestly can't understand how/why people would do it.  I just stayed quiet and let her keep talking.  She went on to say she's really uncomfortable with the idea that #I# do it and said that even knowing about it makes her feel really weird and awkward.  I gently talked about it a little in general terms that apply to pretty much anyone (why/when/etc.), and tried to explain a great insight I'd read here about how masturbation is different from sex.  She said she just can't understand why a person would want to do that to themselves.  She was so convincing in her words and so completely uncomfortable with even the idea of masturbation that I began to believe her statement that she's never even contemplated doing it.  The conversation wound down and we went to bed.

The next morning I started thinking about it.  I started thinking that maybe I #was# imagining it all again, that maybe she doesn't consider “feeling around” to be masturbation since it's through her clothes and she's not really getting off.  I started to worry, though, about how unquestionable what I witnessed on several nights was, though.  I started to wonder if maybe I'm going crazy and I hallucinated things.  I haven't noticed anything other than a little feeling around since that night, and by yesterday I was mostly convinced that it was all in my imagination.

Last night, she was laying against me, and I felt her hand moving more “vigorously” than usual.  I pretended to fall asleep, and shortly afterward she rolled over and proceeded to go to town.  There's absolutely no doubt as to what transpired; her breathing, soft moaning, the bed shaking, the occasional shlick sound, the final frenzy as she finished, etc.  There is no doubt in my mind what I witnessed.  I was unable to fall asleep afterward, and I've been thinking about it since.

The way I see it, there are really only two possibilities:  either she lied about masturbating, or I completely hallucinated the whole thing (I was wide awake).  I don't think I'm going crazy (there don't seem to be any other signs other than occasional mild paranoia) but I can't completely discard the possibility.

I know I need to talk to her, but I know she is just going to lie and make me question my sanity further.  My head is spinning, though, and I desperately need some outside perspectives.  Why would a person lie about something like this, especially when it hasn't even come up?  How can I get over my trust issues when she's lying to the extent that it's making me question my sanity?  Or does it even matter?  Am I blowing this whole thing out of proportion?  Or maybe I am losing my mind...in that case, what the fuck do I do next?

**TL;DR:  My wife seems to masturbate on a regular basis (I've witnessed it), while vigorously denying it. I'm beginning to wonder if she's in denial or if I'm going crazy. Don't know what to do.**

I fell for him long before we became more, but he had told me shortly after we met that he wasn't interested in having a relationship.  Long story short, I finally couldn't keep my feelings to myself any longer and I kissed him while we were watching a movie at his place.  Turns out he felt the same way.  Yay!

I knew all along that he wasn't very experienced, and that it had to have been a long time since he'd last been with anyone.  However, the other day while we were fooling around he told me he is still a virgin, and that I am his first everything.

I've been thinking about it since, and I know that I am in no way willing to leave him because of this, but I am worried.  How do I go about this?  How do I help show him how to be a boyfriend without changing who he is?  How do I make him comfortable with the idea of sex?  I've no issues with waiting as long as he needs to wait, but he said that over time when it didn't happen that it became this huge thing in his head until he just gave up hoping. He is incredibly nervous, and whenever we get close he goes soft.  It's upsetting him, and I hate to know that he feels that way because of me.

He is such a wonderful, caring, and sincere man.  I have never been so comfortable with letting my guard down and being vulnerable with anyone I've ever been with.

My ex and I have joint custody of our two children. We also have an 18 year old daughter from his previous relationship that I have raised since she was 5 (P). P brought it to my attention this year that there are things that ex has done that could get him into big trouble, but she was to afraid to tell me at the time. Ex is a building contractor and has always had a ton of shady deals going on, so I just assumed that was what she was referring to.

P moved out on her own for a few months at the end of last year and was working full time and attending her senior year of school. It was then that she confessed to my that her father had been pretending to be a 15 year old boy online named Trevor. He told her that he was doing it to ""catch"" her 15 year old stepsister (J) ""being nasty."" He would ask for dirty pictures, and she would send them. It didn't end there. Ex began having telephone conversations with J. He would put his tee shirt over the receiver to try to muffle his voice.

P does not know if it went beyond talking and pictures.

Early this year J was expelled from school because she had written a note stating she wanted to bring a gun to class and kill herself in front of everyone. It also said that she was afraid of Ex. P sent me a copy of the letter and I notified Children's services.

This is when P told me about ""Trevor."" She said it was why she moved out of his home and had been struggling to work and stay in school. She asked to move in with me and I got her here as quickly as possible.

I have tried to talk to two different police departments, as well as left a message o the FBI website, but I haven't received any help in this matter. I talked to my lawyer about suspending his custodial right to my children, but she says we can't do anything with out proof. We can't get proof without an investigation.

P is afraid of him. Some days she says she wants to make sure he goes to prison, and some days she just wants to put it all behind her now that she is 18 and free of him.

I'm lost.

**UPDATE**

I didn't have class today so I decided to stay home for another day before heading back to college. I used some of the constructive criticism I received here as well as my understanding of my mom's thinking to have a chat with her this afternoon. I realized it was unrealistic for me to expect her to change anything as long as the issue stood between my friends and I so I just wanted to have an open dialogue and see what she thought. And the talk went great.

I opened the conversation jokingly with how my friends think my mom is attractive. She laughed and said she noticed with the occasional glances she got. I immediately asked her if that bothered her and if she wanted me to set those guys straight. She said no it's fine. It's flattering but weird at the same time. She reminded me her appearance wasn't for them or anyone else, but herself. I felt bad and asked her why she didn't tell me about them looking or at least tell them to stop. She said she didn't want to embarrass me. When she said that, I suddenly became really irritated and told her forget the friends, she's what matters to me. It was at that very moment where I came to a realization that I wasn't embarrassed of my mom's assets in front of my friends. I was just being really *overprotective.* 

I told her I'm going to talk to the guys and tell them to stop or at least minimize that stuff in front of her like she wanted. She told me I didn't have to and that it was no big deal. She said she'd playfully and jokingly bring it up one day and try that. I told her not to worry about my friendships with them, that I would still tell them. I met up with one of my friends for a gym session and brought the issue up. He said he completely understood and he and another friend would spread the word to be more respectful around my mom with their eyes. He said he felt bad that I had to go through that and I told him not to be because up until today, I thought I was embarrassed of her chest when in fact I was just being overprotective. Which makes sense considering I never disliked her guy friend when he started coming around her a while ago. It was just me being the overly protective son around my friends which I know has to stop. She's a grown woman and can handle herself just fine.

Thanks to all the guys who PM'd me to walk me through my thoughts and plan. You guys were awesome. Thanks to the people who disagreed and respectfully provided your opinion on the matter; it was nice to see another point of view on how I was looking at the issue. And I apologize to the number of people who felt the need to tell me to go kill myself or wished that my mother aborted me so that she didn't have to deal with me and things of that nature. While your messages were a little disheartening and I can't say why my issue would merit those actions, I empathize with you for whatever led you to feel that way towards my situation and I can only say good luck in the future. Thanks guys!

TL;DR - Had a great talk with my mom about her chest being ogled by the guys. Didn't ask her to change a thing but to let me know what to do. Talk went great and I think I'll handle from here on out.

I moved in with her about 8 months ago.

When she moved into her own apartment two years ago she started gaining weight - she wasn't making healthy meals, lots of takeout, etc. She also started smoking weed a lot, which makes you crave unhealthy food.

As of 4 months ago she'd probably gained 70-80lbs. I tried dropping subtle hints for her to eat healthier, go to the gym, etc. but they weren't really sinking in. I finally said point-blank that I wanted her to live a healthier lifestyle, and that I was concerned for her health. I found her very unattractive physically at this point, but didn't say that for obvious reasons. 

I started making her healthier lunches to take to work, bought her a bike for her birthday, even bought her this expensive 'meal plan' that some people at her work were trying. I make sure we do an activity every other day - going for a walk, biking, gym, etc. She hasn't lost any weight with all this stuff, but she hasn't really gained anymore either. 

Today she was cleaning out her car and I saw her stuffing a bunch of fast food bags/wrappers into a garbage bag. I decided to do some sleuthing and looked at her last bank statement, which confirmed she'd been going to fast food places for lunch, as well as on her way home from work. It works out to an average of 1 fast food meal per day for the last 4 months that she's been hiding from me.

I haven't told her that I know about her secret fast-food binging. I can't decide whether I should confront her about it, or just break it off with her and not giving any specific reason. I feel shallow as hell about the whole situation, but physical attraction was one of the reasons we got together in the first place and now it's completely gone. 

TL;DR - My girlfriend of 4 years has gained a lot of weight, and now I found out she's been eating a bunch of fast-food in secret after I'd asked her to eat healthier. I am considering breaking up with her because there is simply no physical attraction for me anymore.

**EDIT: Thanks to everyone for their responses, I can't believe how many comments this thread got - 30x more than I was expecting. I read them all. Lots of helpful responses, lots of ""axe grinding"" as well which I guess is to be expected with a touchy subject like weight gain.

I'll be speaking with her when she gets home from work tonight. Many of you have requested an update which I'll provide once we decide what we're doing relationship-wise. Thanks again.**

So, instead of going to brunch at his parents this morning I decided to stay home and spend the time packing up all of his shit and putting it on the front porch, complete with a note that said ""Maybe you and Cara(friend he cheated w/) should be looking for an apartment together"". My wonderful father came over and changed the locks as well; the look on his face was priceless when he saw all his stuff on the porch and realized he couldn't get in.

He delivered the message that my ex wants me to keep the dog because he knows she is better off with me and would be much happier living here. Also says he knows he has no stake in the home and will remove his name from the deed as soon as I tell him how to do so.

1372799639.0,213,self.relationships,1hiui9,[Infidelity] My [28M] life has been shit since I found out my wife [26F] of 6 years cheated on me,throwaway29901,271,58,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hiui9/infidelity_my_28m_life_has_been_shit_since_i/,"Some background:

Met my wife when she was 18 in college. We immediately fell in love with each other and we shared lots of things and goals in common. We dated for 4 years until she was out of college and I had a decent paying job. She was 22, I was 25 the day we got married. Couldn't be happier.

During 3 of these 4 years we lived together. I transferred jobs closer to where she wanted to go for grad school (it was fairly easy for me and the company helped with everything so I didn't think it twice) and we moved into a much nicer apartment. I kept working and moving up in my job while she went to school exclusively. Our first and only daughter is turning two this week. 

Our sex life had up to now been amazing. Slowed down because of our daughter and how taxing a kid is, but still no less than 4-5 times a week. We still find new things to try and we are big into role playing so we kept the fire pretty much alive. 

The problem:

3 months ago I found out she cheated on me. It happened during October 2012. She went out for a conference with another two classmates, one of them a girl I had already known and the other a guy she had already told me about. During this week she did stuff twice with the guy (who knew she was married). First time: they ""fooled around"" meaning making out, she masturbated him and he ate her out. Second time: unprotected sex all with creampie included. Fucking great.

She confessed to me after reading the letter I wrote her for her birthday. She called me on the phone from work crying asking me to go home. I thought something was wrong with our daughter but she was just freaking out and I couldn't understand anything so I immediately drove to our place. 

She broke down and told me she had cheated on me and how much of a piece of shit she was. I drove off for about two hours. I came back and asked for every single detail. We spent 3 hours going over it. She told her version and then I asked every single question I could think of (which just broke my heart more).

I left the house and took the vacation time I had earned so far from work (3 weeks) and pretty much drowned myself in alcohol for 2 of those weeks until my older brother, who lives fairly close and had heard from my wife that I was missing, found me in a cheap hotel room and slapped the shit out of me. I hadn't touched alcohol in 9 years after having a rough time with it during my teen years. I felt like I just wanted to die. 

I pulled my shit together and called my wife. I told her I wanted to work it out for our daughter.

It's been 2 months since I came back home after saying I had forgiven her and wanted to work it out so that everything would go back to the way it was... I am doing worse every week at job. Have trouble keeping up with what I have to do. 

I do not trust my wife at all, I can only think of her and this guy fucking. 

Our sex life is shit. We haven't had sex since I found that out. We've tried several times... I lose my erection every time. I just look at her and can see nothing but her being fucked by someone else. My mind goes through every single detail I squeezed off of her during those 3 hours we talked about it. I feel like I can't have sex with her again. 

I reached my worst today. I went into the shower this morning and masturbated. I started thinking of my wife and this guy and I couldn't stop. I was angry and I jerked my dick until it hurt and I came. I immediately started crying and felt disgusted at her, at myself, at what she did to me. 

I just can't forgive her.

I wake up every morning and kiss her like I used to. I make breakfast for her and our daughter. I put up this fucking smile and act all like I used to before this. Then I get on my car, drop my daughter with my sister-in-law, and just fucking break down. I cry everyday all the way from her house to work. I clean my face in the parking lot. 

I come back home at 6, I feed our daughter who is picked up by my wife at 2. I take her to bed by 7:30 and then I have dinner with my wife. We might watch some tv or a movie. I act like everything is fine. Then we go to sleep. If we try to have sex I'll lose my erection and she'll say something like ""We can try again tomorrow, don't worry"". If we don't then I just read something until I fall asleep. 

We go out on weekends on our own or with her sister and her children and I put up my ""everything's fine"" face when I really just want to drink until I die. I don't want to be separated from my daughter, seeing her everyday is what keeps me from doing something stupid.

Every minute of every day my only thought is her being fucked by someone else. I am going crazy.

If anyone can offer any advice on how to forgive infidelity and move on, I would love to hear you.

**tl;dr**: Had an apparently perfect life. Wife cheated on me. Alcoholic urges resurged, starting to deal with erectile dysfunction, underachieving at work and just generally having a shitty existence. Divorce is not an option, I wouldn't stand being separated from my daughter.

**Update as of June 3rd:** Thank you everyone for your advice. Will try to address each comment individually, the ones I consider were serious. For those claiming divorce is not that big of a deal, I'm sorry but it is for me. It is a very personal opinion I guess and I don't see how I can just give up on 8 years of my life, specially when we're talking about a family here. I love my wife very much, regardless of what she did. I can't forgive her right now but I want to. I have a daughter with her and I don't want to become a weekend dad. I've taken care of her everyday since she was born and I don't want that to change. She is the most important person in my life, besides my wife, and I don't want to see her only 2 days a week, if not less. If you can't respect that, I beg you not to comment. I understand some people think differently but the way some of you talk about it is just plain disrespectful. I don't mind hearing the opposing side as long as it's expressed in a respectful way. To those of you who shared their experience as children from divorced parents, thank you very much. Those ones definitely help and give me something to think about.

He is disabled with seizures, blindness, and physical disabilities. My wife and I have had a tough time coping with everything. It's been a shock adjusting to our new life.

My wife stays at home to work with our son full time with physical and occupational therapy. I recently started a business and work at night full time as well to provide for everybody. Until recently (3 months ago) I was working to the point where I could barely help out (60-70 hours a week) but the business is going well and I have a little more free time.

The problem is I avoid my own son. It bothers me, and I want to love him like his mother does but the feeling just isnt there. I am still extremely depressed from everything that has happened and I over medicate with smoking too much weed. I kept thinking it would get better as He got older but it's not and I don't know what to do.

It's so hard to spend time with him, half the time you look at him and his eyes are rolling around in his head from the seizures. He doesn't move, make noise, reach for you or grab you. I know it's not fair to him but I can't deal with this. I'm literally crying as I type this. I feel myself pulling away and I can't let that happen. Please, what can I do to help him and not ruin everything?

1371450825.0,212,self.relationships,1gi23e,Is it reasonable for me (M-26) to break up with someone (F-24) if they won't let you touch them sexually?,tyler0351,297,85,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gi23e/is_it_reasonable_for_me_m26_to_break_up_with/,"I'm Tyler and my now recently ex-girlfriend is Emily. We first got together in early January. She is also pregnant with my child and unwilling to consider an abortion.

Emily says she was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I only have a B.S. in Psychology, so I'm not qualified to assess her in any way, but based on the books on BPD that I've read and the DSM criteria, she certainly fits the bill.

She has extreme body issues. She was burned in a house fire at age 15 and has some scaring on her arms. She even wears sweaters or hoodies during the Summer.

During sex, she will never get completely naked. The furthest she will go is taking her pants and underwear off, but I have to keep my eyes shut while she does it. She leaves her shirt and bra on. She doesn't allow me to touch her boobs, butt, or her vagina. No fingering and no oral sex. Just vaginal sex with no touching. She has even told me that I won't be allowed in the delivery room when the baby is born because I might see something. 

Early in the relationship, before we knew she was pregnant, we had sex when she was drunk and she got completely naked. I saw everything, went down on her, fingered her, even had anal sex. She looked great. Everything was fine. I've seen it all and it only made me love her more. 

I've always been a big believer in The Five Love Languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages). Out of the different ways of expressing love, mine is primarily physical touch. I am very touchy feely. I don't know if I was held too much or not enough as a child, but that's just how I've always been. It's not something I choose or can turn off.

I crave her physically. I want to touch her. I wouldn't even care if I couldn't see anything --- as long as I could touch, even in the pitch black. I asked her to speak to a therapist because her body image issues are quite serious. As long as she thinks my love for her is based on her weight or physical appearance, then our relationship would never work. 

It even gets so bad that she won't let me watch a movie if it has any nudity or sexuality in it. She thinks that if I see nudity on TV, that I'm going to get turned on by it and it will make her feel bad. She literally puts her hand over my eyes if there is something on that is sexual.

It gets so bad that she never wants to have sex. She has never initiated sex with me. I almost have to beg her or have to sell her on it. I feel like I'm attractive and physically fit. I'm a former U.S. Marine and I cage fight professionally, so I believe myself to be the type of guy that a lot of women desire. Sometimes I wonder ""am I just not attractive? If I was more attractive, then wouldn't she want sex all of the time?"" But many other girls still find me attractive so I have to believe that it's her. Or at least I hope so.

I have personally spoken to a therapist while in this relationship. I went through therapy a while back. I have a high opinion of it and I think she could get past this if she would make an effort. I have even offered to pay for the therapy sessions, but she won't do it.

Our relationship isn't that great to begin with. She constantly accuses me of cheating on her. Her BPD has also hurt her in other ways, such as injecting drugs (over a year ago), and not being able to hold a job.

All of the other bullshit I think I can handle. The cheating accusations, the pain pills, the bad work ethic, etc. I don't like any of it, but I like her so much that I think it's worth it. But I just can't NOT touch her. When I kiss her legs and get a scent of her vagina, it makes me get crazy horny. It is very frustrating for her to constantly reject me when the desire is so strong for me.

Is this wrong of me? If it bothers her so much, should I try to ignore it? Is a relationship even possible if she NEVER desires sex and won't let me touch her?

TL;DR -- Borderline girlfriend has severe body images that cause her to never want to have sex. No touching her boobs, butt, or any part of her body that she dislikes. No oral sex. Only vaginal sex with no touching. I have to ""sell"" her on sex. Physical touch is very important to me and I crave it. It is the most important expression of love for me.

1360376565.0,208,self.relationships,1865yo,(UPDATE) My fiancé bought his ex a ring that is significantly more expensive than mine?

So the ring he got me gave me a rash around my finger, and he ordered a new one in the same price range (under 30). He asked if I was going to bring up the price again and be upset over it and I said no. And I meant it. I'm over the argument, it isn't worth it.

Next issue: today he drops a bombshell on me. Him and his ex wife own a home (paid off) a few states away, that I knew nothing about! We've been together for two years. I thought I knew everything about his finances. This isn't the first time he has surprised me with some crazy financial detail. He wants me to be a homemaker after our wedding in June. He then insisted that he had told me this info before, when he absolutely has not. I've seen his paychecks and have access to his bank account, so I at least know the truth about that. I'm hurt, confused, and questioning our upcoming marriage. On top of this, what people think about our age difference and how we look as a couple is really bothering me. 

TL;DR My fiancé forgot to mention a house he owns. What do I do? 


Edit: Not even ONE person thinks I should stay with him? I love this guy, madly.

Second edit: In response to people saying maybe he is sill married or he loved his ex wife more than he does me, he left his ex for me within days of meeting me. Moved out. And I've seen the court paper saying he is divorced.

Again, edit: Yes, I realize I am a shitty person for falling in love with a married man. To be fair, I didn't touch him before he moved out/filed for divorce and I discouraged him from leaving his wife. I'm not bragging about anything and I do feel genuine remorse for what I did. 

FOURTH EDIT: I JUST BROKE IT OFF WITH HIM. Sorry to those who thought we were a match made in heaven.

Fifth edit: So as I'm drowning my feelings in alcohol, what should I do with this awesome ring? Anybody out there want a $25 cubic zirconia from EBay? Maybe I could trade it for a box of wine. 

Sixth edit: http://imgur.com/FQozAY7.jpg  I'm not sure what this will prove to you, Recording Artist, but it took approximately a minute and a half to break up with him. I tried to talk to him on the phone but he started yelling so I hung up. You're so intent on proving that I am either a. A troll account or b. the devil, you'd think I had fucked your husband and kicked your dog. And I will have a pity party now, thanks.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12sryj/update_to_my_m23_parents_m58f63_have_taken_me_out/

I know its a fast update but I couldn't sit on this any longer.

Recently I was helping my parents with doing a bit of late spring cleaning and throwing a lot of old rubbish out when I cam across what I assume is the most recent copy of their will (date June 2012). I didn't mean to look at it but am I moved it I noticed in the 'beneficiaries' section on the front only my sister was listed. Then (I know it was horrible of me to do) I decided to have a read through it.

I'm not in it, at all. My sister is listed as the sole beneficiary, she will get their house, life insurance policies, savings, car, absolutely everything. They aren't rich people by any means but due to the way property prices have risen since they bought their house in the 80s this probably comes in total to about £500k.

They have always had a thing with favouring my sister a bit more than me giving her extra attention and stuff but I've never really minded. She is a bit of a screw up and if I'm honest she has needed the extra attention. I'm not going to lie either my financial situation is a lot better than my parents, I'm engaged and together me and my partner (no kids) make about £45k a year, she is a single parent of two children (deadbeat dad no child support) earning about £16k a year. I know that is a lot of a gap and I would understand if they left her a greater share to help her out more but leaving me with nothing just seems so harsh. Whilst me and my fiancee do earn more we aren't exactly rolling in money and even if they had only left me 20% it would still be more than enough to help me start to buy a house.

Obviously this is all hypothtical as they are both perfectly healthy and have a long time in them yet. it just seems harsh that if they were to die tommorow my sister would be set whilst I would be left with nothing.

Am I right to be angry about this? Should I confront them about it or not? I know its not my money at all but she is a terrible daughter to them. Over the years she has lied to them, stole money from them (and me) had to be bailed out and fines paid for drugs charges etc, she barley even finished school as well so whilst she is financially worse off its only because she has made herself so. On the other hand I visit them all the time, help them out whenever they asked, went to University which they had always wanted me to do (I paid for it 100% myself with no help) and it just seems like they are punishing me and rewarding her for being such a failure.

Additional info: With me they have always had a parenting style of letting me make my own way, if I wanted something I was expected to do chores/get a job and pay for it (I don't mind at all its made me more responsible). My sister on the other hand they always bought what she wanted and never really expected as much from her as me.

Tl;dr. Saw parents will, I have been taken out in favour of my deadbeat of a sister. Should i confront them/be mad?

She wants to wait until we're married to have sex, 
because she's waiting, and she's also told me 
that she's never going to let me go down on her, ever 
(she's never tried it, but it's honestly something I love to do). 

She is set on waiting until marriage and she also does not 
want me to propose until she's at least done school, 
which is another two/three years. So at this point I'm really stuck.

I love her I really do, but I feel like I'm just going to explode. 
I am just obsessed with sex all the time now, I watch way 
too much porn, I masturbate all the time, and nothing is making 
up for the lack of sex. I'm at the point where I'm smoking pot sometimes just to intensify my orgasms because it's just not doing it for me sober. We do mess around maybe ever two weeks, 
and that stops at me wearing a condom while she grinds on me. 

I feel like I dick if I were to walk away now at this age, and 
because of no sex, but I don't know what to do. 
I tried talking to her about it, but she believes I can just hold it, 
and if I do love her I'd wait. It's really affecting my day to day life 
at this point. I felt healthier when I had a sex life, I could think about 
what I needed to do, I didn't want it so much, it wouldn't be watching so much porn. 

I feel like a pervert everytime I bring up the subject. 
She has a low sex drive, and she doesn't masturbate, 
and she doesn't start to think about orgasms unless we're together. 
She actually didn't have her first orgasm until last month when 
we were messing around, but that hasn't really changed her drive or anything at all. 

I really don't know what to do. This is stupid because I feel like 
I'm just putting sex on a pedestal and looking at the idea of 
marriage simply as ""finally, sex"" instead of ""finally, marriage"". 
I hope that makes sense.

TL;DR: Looks like there will be no sex for another three years, not sure if I should walk away or what to really do.

This is a throwaway as my gf is also a redditor.  

Backstory: I am 22 years old and have been dating my 20 year old gf for about 2.5 years.  We met randomly at a concert and had a long distance relationship for about a year until she transferred to my school.  We fell in love very quickly and have fought very little, and we have a lot of similar interests and haven't had many fights or major disagreements.

About a year ago, I caught her having an ""emotional affair"". Long story short, she left open an email on her computer (i was not snooping, just using her computer, and it was right there) from an old high school ""friend"" that among other things, said that she loved him and couldnt wait to see him and that they were soul mates. She claims she never physically cheated and that she was just being nice to this guy who is depressed or something, but she never even mentioned this person, and they were probably spending a lot of time together when she went back to her hometown where he lived.  I was crushed that she lied to me and i nearly broke up with her, but i love her and im a sucker and forgave her after she insisted nothing happened besides saying that stuff. I still think something happened and she is lying to me about it because I dont have any further proof. Our relationship bounced back a bit after that, and i was probably too easy on this break of trust and infidelity.

Now (about a year after this event) I caught her snooping in my email addresses. She went through 3 different addresses, my sent mail, my personal folders, and apparently was looking for something. For the record, I have not been cheating or acting suspicious or anything and i have nothing to hide. I confronted her about it and she lied and denied it repeatedly, saying that she just signed me out of my email to check her own. I told her that i have my internet history saved and proof that she did it, and she finally admitted to it. after some more prodding, she admitted to going through my emails and my phone/texts many times over the past year.  She said she has no reason to be suspicious and that its nothing I did, but said that she did this because she's insecure and and depressed and anxious that I am going to break up with her or something. Basically, she didnt have a good excuse for it.

She invaded my privacy, she lied to me about it, and she doesn't trust me (for no reason).  So now I don't trust her about a lot of the things she's done in the past and I feel like i will be second guessing and thinking that shes lying about everything should our relationship continue.  If this was an isolated incident, I could be more forgiving. But she had that ""emotional affair"", has lied to me before, and lost my trust.  

So Reddit, can you tell me why she did this? What should I do? Can this break of trust be repaired?  I really love the girl and have for a long time, but trust and honesty is probably the most important thing to me about a relationship.  I dont want to just throw away 2.5 years of my life away with a rash decision, but I also can't be treated like this and I can't be lied to.  Who knows what else she has led to me about, especially the ""affair"" with her high school ""friend"". I think shes projecting her own infidelity and suspicious behavior on me.  Ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, can you help?

Summary: GF of 2.5 years caught searching through all my emails looking for signs of infidelity. Invaded my privacy, lied to me, and now I cant trust her about anything she's told me during our relationship.

**Mystery Solved. Shes been cheating on me for over a year. im talking to her ""other"" boyfriend right now**

Update: I have talked with her ""other"" boyfriend and have talked with her. we are completely over with, and the other guy is too. she had been lying to both of us. i just wasted 2.5 years of the best years in my life (college). i am completely crushed, and completely destroyed. and yes, there are sex tapes

To recap, my boyfriend refused to put any effort into our relationship and I ended it with him because I couldn't take it anymore, then decided to go out with a guy who'd recently asked me out. Link to original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fh0d7/boyfriend_24m_refuses_to_try_in_our_relationship/). 

My ex began speaking to me throughout the day yesterday, and he thanked me for the Aleve and the water that I brought him, but we both kept it very impersonal and platonic. He was playing video games in his office with a friend of his when I got ready to leave for my date. He said, ""Are you going out?"" I told him I was, he just nodded and calmly went back to his game. When I got back home around 3am, I popped my head into his office to see what was up, and they were still playing games and laughing/drinking. He said, ""How'd it go?"" I smiled and told him it went really well. He nodded again and went back to what he was doing. 

He knows that I was out with someone else, he's given no indication that he minds at all, and we're still getting along. 

The date went amazingly well and I had a blast. This guy had no problem at all vocalizing his appreciation for my appearance, which brightened my overall mood immensely. He'd apparently been keeping an eye on me at work for a while, and when he got a new job opportunity, he made sure to somehow contact me before he left the company. I'm seeing him again later today, and I think that everything is going to be okay. 

Thank you to those of you who told me that what I was doing was okay. It meant so much more to me than you guys know. 

**tl;dr:** I think everything is going to work out and I appreciate everyone's support so much. 



**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for the support, including those of you who decided that I was needy. I'd never really considered that wanting to be thought of as attractive by your SO and to connect with and reciprocally communicate with them on some level could be construed as needy, but I appreciate that you took the time to say anything at all. 

Additionally, I'm not ring-shopping with this guy. I'm not a big ""pole-runner"", nor am I a serial monogamist. I wanted to have fun, I am having fun, and in no way am I rubbing this in my ex's face. If he wants to know details then he'll ask. If he has an issue with any aspect of this situation, I've given him numerous chances to voice it. He's said nothing, his behavior has not changed, and he seems totally unfazed by it. If we had had some sort of heavily emotional break-up then dating this soon would not have been considered an option. As it stands, he didn't care before, didn't care during, and hasn't cared afterward. There's nothing vindictive or ""bitchy"" about the decision that I made. My heart has been twisted for a very long time, and I needed fresh air. I got it. Also, I do have hobbies. I'm not Stella and I'm not trying to get my groove back; I'm trying to have fun again.",Updates,False,,t5_2qjvn,1370282456.0,m-it updates,,True,t3_1fj651,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fj651/update_boyfriend_24m_refuses_to_try_in_our/,
1368628808.0,209,self.relationships,1edui3,My dying father [62] wants me to accept his apology after he stole me from my mother and ostracised me [26M] from my family.,throwaway_6709,279,70,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1edui3/my_dying_father_62_wants_me_to_accept_his_apology/,"**TL;DR:** My Dad stole me from my mom and I grew up being told by my very large (80+) family that I was abandoned.  Dad just had open heart surgery last night.  He is the type of person who gives an all-encompassing ""I'm sorry"" and expect you to instantly forgive him no matter what he's done.  I have nothing in common with him except a past I'd rather forget.  He doesn't fail to disappoint me.  I expect him to die relatively soon and I don't know what to say to him.  

My dad was in his mid 30s when I was born and my mom was 19.  My dad met my future mother when he was visiting my grandmother in Colombia.  My dad had moved to the United States to go to college and was at this point a successful engineer.  My dad is deeply religious and was friends with the pastor of the biggest church in his hometown. My mom was at this church the Sunday he was in town.  My dad found her attractive and told her that ""the Lord spoke to me and said that you would be the mother of my children.""  My mother was a simple woman from a small town in the mountains.  Even her mother believed my dad's story and told her that ""if he said it's the Lord's will, then you should marry him.""  My mom wasn't attracted to him but obliged.

She moved in with my dad in the United States.  He beat my mother on their wedding day because she asked her sister's husband to unclasp the top of her gown.  He took her paychecks and made her ask permission for anything she wanted to buy.  My mother said she needed time away to think if she wanted to stay married.  My dad bought her the plane ticket to Colombia to stay with her mom.  Concurrently, he also filed for divorce claiming that she abandoned the household.  

He knew she would be gone long enough to wait out the minimum amount of time to legally consider it abandoning the household.  He left his job and we spent my childhood living in one bedroom apartments all across the country.  

My dad was not a legal resident at the time and had difficulty finding another engineering job.  I remember him coming home in fast food uniforms.  He always worked two jobs.  I was home alone a lot after school.  He would leave me dinner already prepared in the microwave with instructions on a piece of paper next to the stove.  I remember coming home to an apology from him on the answering machine of why he couldn't be there on my birthday.  I didn't have a stable set of friends growing up because we were constantly on the move to avoid being found by my mom and to continue my dad's job search.

When my dad and I weren't doing too well, his brother (let's say uncle Frank) invited us to live with him and his family.  I had to share a bed with my cousin (let's say Roger) who was the biggest bully I've ever had.  He thought of me as a tagalong and was embarrassed of me.  He forced me into the empty cavity of his hide-a-bed once when his friends from school came over.  He tricked me into pressing my thumb against a car lighter like a buzzer.  He thought I was a crybaby and would punch me to get me to stop crying.  

I couldn't tell on him because I didn't want to cause a fight between my dad and uncle Frank since we had no other place to live.  That continued for a year and then my dad finally found a stable job. 

I grew up being heavily indoctrinated.  My dad is an ordained minister at a Pentecostal church.  As a teenager, I felt like there was something wrong with me since I couldn't speak in tongues or feel the holy spirit.  For as long as I can remember, I was told that my mother abandoned me.  My family gave me the impression that I should be grateful to have the father I did.  He used to call me his ""work of art"" and always told me how proud he was of my academic achievements.  I worked hard to prove my worth to him.  

I graduated early from both high school and college and am now making more money than anyone in my family has ever made.  I wasn't religious so much as I was scared straight.  I didn't lose my virginity until I was 19 because I was so terrified of God's wrath.  

The God I grew up with was a scary, old testament God.  The sermons I constantly heard on the kitchen radio were voiced by preachers shouting in Spanish about a God that is hurting from seeing his people living hedonistic lifestyles.  They sought to promote shame and did a good job of it.

My paternal grandmother had 9 kids and they all live in the town I spent the majority of my life in.  I would see my uncles, aunts, and cousins more than I would my own friends.  I was thought of highly by my family and also pitied because I grew up without my mother.

I moved across the country with my girlfriend for a job when I was 21.  It worked out well because I could still keep in contact with my dad without having to deal with his cynical disapproval of my friends, interests, and lack of religion.  After 5 years together, she said she didn't love me anymore and left that same day.  I was saving up for an engagement ring.

I didn't sleep for three days straight.  I was useless at work.  On that third day, I called my dad to break the news to him.  It was the hardest phone call I've ever had to make.  I felt like a failure.  He told me ""You're better off.  I was happy whenever your mother left us.  [Your ex] was never good enough for you.  Please, don't tell me why she left you.  It would only hurt me to know what she's done to you.""  

I shut myself off from society.  I drank every night for months.  I gained about 30 pounds and had tried to vindicate my own existence by progressing at what I was good at: playing music.  As ridiculous as it may sound to some of you, being able to play something on an instrument proved that my past was real and not a figment of my imagination.  It made me feel less like every day was exactly the same in my beige, windowless office in a government building.  I learned how to play several different instruments over the course of the next 9 months.  Math was what I was good at but music was what I loved to do.  My dad only supported the former.  He broke my cds growing up because I listened to ""devil music"" like Blink 182 and Weezer.

At a certain point, I decided to stop feeling sorry for my fat, sad self and lose the bodyweight.  I ran every day.  I ran so much that I broke my treadmill a few months after I ran my first 5k.  I took the songs I had written while drunk and depressed and played some shows.  I met another future ex-girlfriend when she played right after me at an open mic.  I was finally feeling good about myself.  After everything that had happened, I decided I needed to get a fresh start somewhere.  

I moved to a major city because it was a well-known music town.  The only family I had in this city was my cousin Roger that I lived with growing up.  He was now married and had a daughter.  He also played in bands and said he wanted to start a project with me.  He seemed well-adjusted and friendly so I put our past behind us.  

He initially struck me as a stoner archetype who liked a lot of the same music as I did.  For some reason, him and I never got along well.  His wife, however, was awesome.  She (let's say Amy) sung in our band and we always seemed to be on the same page.  Early on, our drummer asked me in confidence if I noticed that Amy acts differently whenever Roger isn't around.  After it was pointed out, I could only see her as two different people: the person she was around him and her normal self.  She acted timid and fairly quiet when he was around and was optimistic, confident and outgoing whenever he wasn't.  

She told the drummer and I less than a month after I moved here that she'd be leaving my cousin.  I stopped hanging out with him after he began to suspect me of having an affair with his wife.  After she left him, the remaining members of the band decided to replace him and continue.  Roger took the fact that I stayed in a band with Amy as betrayal and told the family that I was the reason behind his divorce.  She left him because he was an ambitionless, lazy and didn't make any effort to keep her happy.  She described living with him ""like living with a second child.""  

Amy was exactly the friend I needed at the time and vice versa.  I had learn how to cope with what was done to me by logically and objectively examining my life and figuring out ways of improving my situation.  The problem was that I was too far gone to where I shut myself off emotionally.  I noticed myself forgetting my past.  I wasn't attracted to women anymore.  My existence seemed inconsequential to me because I had lost my footing in life.  I felt like an active observer gazing into real life and acted like what I determined a rational (normal) person would.

Amy had an optimism about her that was contagious.  She was the kind of person that would stop what she's doing to point out the birds chirping, take the time to cook savory meals, and read books on a blanket outdoors when the weather was nice.  I was the kind of person who thought of chirping as simply birds communicating to each other irrespective of my existence, ate prepackaged microwaveable food and slept through most of the daylight hours.  She was exactly what I needed to make me learn how to enjoy life again.  I was the logical perspective she needed to make necessary changes to her life.  

We grew closer and closer together until it happened.  You don't get to choose who you fall in love with but when it happens, I mean REALLY happens, you've never been more sure of anything in your life.  It's like breaking a bone for the first time: although you've never experienced it before, you know it's broken the moment it snaps.  We decided we couldn't see each other not being a part of each other's life.  She felt guilty since Roger was still grieving the end of his marriage and I was his cousin. I felt bad since I knew this would mean losing a lot of family members.  It would, to them, confirm my cousin Roger's story that I had an affair with his wife which caused their marriage to end.

My dad heard about Roger's accusations from my uncle Frank.  He called me up to scold me, tell me that what I'm doing is wrong and tell me that I need to ask for forgiveness.  I told him that we were not together (we weren't at the time) and that Roger is blaming me for his mistakes.  My dad didn't defend me to the family.

I haven't seen my family or visited since the accusations started almost a year ago.  I finally came out to a different cousin  (let’s say Jane) about Amy and I being together and explained the circumstances.  She said that she loves me no matter what and knows me well enough to know I wouldn't ruin a marriage.  

I would like to be honest about why I'm with Amy.  It's not out of revenge or opportunity.  It's not about sending a message.  Before my ex left me, I had considered leaving her.  I regretted not doing so whenever she left me.  I had told myself that I wouldn't let other people prevent me from being happy.  We weren't happy for at least a few years before breaking up.  

Now, for the first time in my life, I had truly found a person that makes me happy.  I couldn't justify not being with her out of family obligation to someone who made my life hell growing up.  I wasn't the cause of their divorce.  I couldn't let what people think stop me from being with the person I love.  

My uncle Frank has badmouthed me to the point where his story isn’t even based off of true events.  He said that Amy is scared to be alone and I took advantage of the situation.  Amy and I plan on moving in together this year.  She is my best friend and we see each other every day.  She is my favorite person I’ve ever met.

I haven’t talked to my dad since last year.  I got two calls from him yesterday which I didn’t answer.  I had talked to Jane the day before and guessed that she must have said something to him.  After texting her back and forth, I found out that my dad was in the hospital with a clogged artery.  Almost a year ago, my dad had a “prophetic dream” telling him how he is going to die and has refused to seek medical help for his cancer because of his faith in God.  He refused treatment and told me to keep it a secret from the family because they wouldn’t understand.  He only told me make me feel guilty and “win” a conversation.

I stopped talking to him since he didn’t even want to hear my side of the story involving Amy and has refused to get treatment.  He’ll be in the ICU for another 24 hours.  Should I make the long drive to go see him?  If I do visit, I know I can expect nothing but hateful and hurtful remarks from my extended family.  He is already out of surgery and is doing fine.  If I don’t go, they will blame the stress I’ve caused him for his condition.  I wasn’t even called by my dad since he was in surgery when the calls were made.  

I was robbed of the opportunity of saying a few last words to my father, the same person I shared a bunk bed with in one bedroom apartments across the country.  He has done nothing but disappoint me and I expect him to ask me to forgive him without admitting fault of any kind, like he always has in the past.  He will never approve of me and Amy.  He will never approve of my lack of religion.  As he put it before, “I don’t know where I went wrong in raising you.”  

Does this man deserve to be a part of my life?  Should I accept his forgiveness although I know he’s only doing it so that I won’t be upset with him anymore?

**EDIT:** I've gotten a few comments questioning how exactly my father has disappointed me.

-My dad denied me the opportunity to have my mother in my life and told me she abandoned me.  My mother was only a legal resident because of my dad.  When they divorced, she was illegally in this country and lived in a women's shelter.

-He told me he was letting himself die of cancer because of a vivid dream he thinks is prophetic. My younger half sister is still in high school and my stepmother doesn't work. He is being selfish by letting himself die because he has an obligation to his family.

-If your son murdered someone, would your first reaction be to scold and distance yourself from him or ask him what happened? I was blamed for ruining a marriage, which by comparison seems much less severe. When family members asked him if the rumors were true, he said that I confessed to him that we were together. He completely sold me out and sided with his brother.  I'm not suggesting he had to agree with my actions but he could have said ""I don't know.""  

-He's owed me $10k for over a year now (I helped him with the down payment on his new house).  He's spent more than that decorating his house over the last year. Hasn't paid me back, not even a dime. 

-When I used to visit, he didn't accommodate me into his busy church schedule and tried to get me to help out around church as a way of spending time together (I'm an atheist and he knows this).

Bottom line: He wants me to be in his life but only on his terms.  Refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing.  Believes himself to be a saint since he's the pastor of a church.  I don't want him to be a part of my life but I don't want to feel guilty when he passes.  Our worldviews are completely different (believes women should be submissive, for example).  I've tried to talk to him about everything last Christmas and he said I was being sensitive and holding grudges.  I haven't talked to him since.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1368644624.0,,,True,t3_1edui3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1edui3/my_dying_father_62_wants_me_to_accept_his_apology/,

We have been working on it, but no matter how many times I tell him that I need more help around the house and with our son, he doesn't seem to get it.

He works four-ten hour shifts during the week, from 2pm-midnight, and I work 5 days a week from about 11am-3:30pm most of the time, except Fridays I work 3am-7am.  He works 40 hours, I work 22-25 hours per week.  My mother-in-law watches our son from about 1-4 on the days our schedule overlaps.  

Sounds fine and dandy, right?  The schedule works out pretty nicely, and we can avoid daycare costs for right now.  But this is how my days go.....

Get up at about 7 (whenever my 2-year old decides to get up), take care of dog's needs, child's needs, my own needs, do laundry, clean up kitchen, watch son until I need to go to work, work my 11-3:30 shift on my feet (running around nonstop, no breaks), come home (usually my son has taken a nap while I'm at work), start taking care of my son again, make dinner (whatever I can muster up the energy to make...) and I am exhausted by this point so I can't usually get much done, then I give my son a bath, get him ready for bed, and he usually won't go to sleep without a fight until 10...and by then I am falling asleep with him.  

My point is, it gets to be a long day.  I let my husband sleep until I leave for work most days (until 10:45) so he should be getting enough sleep, and I do too, most nights.  

The weekends are much the same, even when my husband isn't working.  I get up with the kid, let my husband sleep in for at least a couple hours longer than me, and I take care of him most of the time.  

I also am ""expected"" to take care all of the finances (which is tricky because we were in a mess of a debt and I have been working my ass off trying to figure out things we can cut, etc), take care of almost all of the housework, take care of my son 90% of the time (change diapers, make sure he has eaten, baths, clothed, etc), take care of the dog (which is kind of just annoying), do things for my husband, clean up after everyone, make sure we have groceries, etc.  Basically what a full-time housewife does. 

What I expect of my husband at the very least:  Take out the garbage.  

So, on Saturday (the day we usually have sexy time...just because our schedules are difficult to work with), he expects something.  Last night, he wanted a blowjob, and I had every intention of doing it (and he actually helped out with cleaning up the house a bit yesterday), but I was exhausted at 10 pm...right when my son goes to bed...and he was pissed. 

I know he is frustrated because it's been this way for almost 3 years now (ever since I got pregnant), but he has to understand that I am completely wiped out at the end of the day.  I don't get a day to rest, and I am under a lot of stress.  I am also trying to beat depression/anxiety, an eating disorder, and dealing with the death of my dad, and being the personal rep for his estate...  I am completely emotionally drained right now.

Where do I begin with him????  I need help, and I tell him almost every weekend how frustrated I am that he hasn't helped me with much even though I repeatedly ask for it...and now that he actually tried to help yesterday, he didn't get his blowjob (I am on my period, so...otherwise we probably would have had sex, maybe.)

TL;DR:  My husband expects me to do everything around the house, I work part time, he works full time, and we have a son that I take care of 90% of the time.  Hubby gets mad when he doesn't get a blowjob because I am so exhausted at the end of the day.  What can I do??

In that time I have become a stepmother, and a mother myself. I have been a stay at home mom for most of the 3 years we've been married, with a one year stint of working part time. 

Often he talks about how I have changed, I am not as relaxed as I was, not as nice, smart, motivated, outgoing, clean or organized as I was when we got married. I have no doubt that I have become depressed in my situation, I love him and my kids, but I have developed a very short fuse. I don't blame him, I love him to pieces and he tells me he still loves me, but he's stressed and just doesn't want to do it anymore, that we can both do better on our own, that we don't work well together anymore. He thinks I'm too young for him.

We fight frequently (I would say an average of 2 times a week unless where in a pit, like now) but not in an unhealthy way. He does not hit, and he rarely yells, but there are many stressors in our relationship; my relationship with my stepdaughter (8) is weak and our fallouts usually result in him reffing, and instead of taking a side or sorting it out, we're both told to drop it and move on, our issues do not get resolved. While we're not hard for money, I believe it bothers him that he works full time at a job he dislikes while I stay home (we agreed that I will stay home until our daughter ,4, is in school full time). Sex has become routine and not as enjoyable as it was, it feels mechanical and simply for the sake of getting it out of the way.

I mentioned age, he feels he is too old for me now, that when we were younger it was okay because he had a younger mindset. He feels he has ""outgrown that mindset"" and is ""ready to be an adult"" while I am still ""acting like a young adult."" often times while arguing or trying to talk, he will insist he is correct because he is older, wiser, or more experienced, that I need to see things from his POV because I am thinking too young. 

He is ready to call it quits, he claims he doesn't want to but doesn't see another way around it. He says I cannot seem become the person he wants me to be, that I am longer the person he married. I have attempted to take strides to be the person he wants me to be, I know where my downfalls are but I feel like he expects change overnight. He has stopped wearing his ring, he has been talking about divorce for months as our only place to go from here, he has no interest in seeing a counselor and I have no idea where to go from here. When do you say enough is enough, and that he is right? How do you fix yourself?

TL;DR... Husband of 3 years feels I am too young for him and no longer the person he married. He insists divorce is the only way to go unless I can ""fix myself.""

Now she says she may never want it.,ThrowMeInTheTrash8,256,50,354,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11726u/i_23m_have_been_with_my_girlfriend_25f_for_over_3/,"We have been together for 3 years and we have had a wonderful relationship. We now live together in an in-law style apartment in her parent's house (fairly private, just shared kitchen). We have fun, we laugh, we really love each other. When we first met, she said that she wanted to wait to have sex until marriage so that it would be more special. I was/am okay with this.

We have had some sexual contact (oral, manual, etc, maybe once or twice a month), but I was always the one to initiate. I truly love this girl but she is terrified/ashamed of sexuality, or she just hates it. She has never had an orgasm despite my VERY enthusiastic attempts, and I think it is because she doesn't have her mind 'in the game'. She recently told me that she may never want to have sex, even when we are married. She has never masturbated and any discussions of our sexual relationship end in her getting upset, changing the subject, or me becoming depressed and just forgetting about it to avoid a fight. Of course this upsets me greatly.

I'm a very affectionate, touchy person, and I always feel 'closer' to her after physical interaction. I love the feeling of closeness and intimacy with her, but it just doesn't happen often. We cuddle, hold each other, and kiss, but that doesn't fulfill my needs. I was perfectly fine with waiting when I thought our relationship would eventually have a sexual element. Now that that may not happen, it has totally changed my outlook on waiting. I guess it isn't waiting if the thing you're waiting for never happens.

Now I'm starting to get depressed because I feel unattractive and undesired. On top of all that, she is absolutely gorgeous and turns me on A LOT, which makes this that much harder. I don't know what to do. Is she asexual? Is there something I can do to get her interested? Also: She is terrified of getting pregnant and thinks that condoms + birth control is going to result in pregnancy because they're both 'only 99% effective'. This may or may not be a big part of the issue.

TL:DR; Been with a girl for 3 years. I love her more than anything. Waiting until marriage for sex. She says she may never want sex. Suddenly, waiting until marriage doesn't seem okay. She needs to decide before we are married because honestly I don't know if I could spend my life in a sexless marriage. I love her. Also, thanks, reddit. Just typing this out has helped me feel better.

This is a throwaway because paranoia.

Edit1: Her parents often make snarky remarks about her appearance/weight, despite her being a 'pretty universally recognized as pretty' woman.  I assume they also did this while she was growing up.

Edit2 ***UPDATE***:  I wrote her a letter and told her, very gently, that she is always safe talking to me and we need to discuss the issue.  I told her we didn't have to do it right away, but soon, when she is comfortable.  She didn't bring it up but hopefully she will soon.  If i have to press the issue again, I will. In the meantime, i'm going to try to help her realize that it is okay to be sexual and there is no shame in it.  

I believe there are three potential issues: Self Confidence, Fear, and Shame.  I need to tackle each of these things to see if one of them (or all) is the problem, or if she is truly asexual/not interested.   I am not totally sure how to tackle each of these issues, but I have some plans.

In order to get her over any 'shame' she may feel, I'm going to try to expose her to sexuality (very gradually) and try to help her realize that it is OKAY to enjoy your body.

To help her get over her fear of pregnancy, I am going to try to direct her towards some information on birth control. I actually asked her if she would talk to her doctor about birth control and she flat out said NO and didn't give a reason.  That is unacceptable to me, so I need to figure out something wrt that. Also, many people have mentioned that her low sex drive could be a result of hormone levels.  Any advice on how to bring this up without her saying ""I am who I am.""?

Lastly, I think her self confidence will improve as she continues to lose weight.  i support her, constantly reinforce her, and tell her I love her. Moving away from her parents will be a big help.

Hello again everyone.

I just thought I would post a quick update.

On Friday the court reporters came back with a report after speaking to Tom and I. Their police checks show that I have a complete clean bill and his has 4 occasions of being in trouble with the police for alcohol related offenses. Other than the DUI, I didn't know this.

My SO went to court today for the initial hearing. Tom didn't turn up. His solicitors had written to court asking for an adjournment because he was in hospital but I happened to know that 1) This was down to a liver problems (ahem) and 2) That he was already out and had been working hard at the gym so had no reason not to be there. I explained this to the court.

Judge was not impressed with him.

I gave the judge some brief details and I could see her mind cogs turning. She ordered no contact for Tom until this is heard in a months time. In the mean time he has to provide medical evidence of  the reasons for his hospitalization. She also said that if he didn't turn up for the relisting she would make a final order stating no contact.

So even without be giving statements and providing evidence, I have a judge pulling faces and saying things like ""no contact"" to me. Makes me realise that reddit was spot on.

I am going to go 100% for no contact without compromise. This is what we hope for but I don't have a feel for the final outcome as it is early days. If we get it, it going to be horribly difficult explaining all this to Lilly and we are probably all going to cry when we do it, but I think it is for the best. I think we are going to have to go to Hamley's in London and buy the biggest, softest bear we can find :)

I have changed names to protect anonymity as this is obviously a delicate legal matter. Therefore, I am not going to give an update again until I have a final order. 

Thank you for everyone's kind support. Keep your paws crossed for us!

**tl;dr We had the preliminary hearing and the forecast is looking good**

Thank you for all your comments/criticism/your experiences, I really appreciate it all. It was definitely interesting listening to arguments from both sides of the spectrum. I don't take the hate to heart, because after all, it is the internet... and each person has their individual opinion. I will definitely try the game AND talk to him about it. I understand that relationships are not perfect, and they all have their flaws. I apologize if the title was overdramatic or misleading (LOL), and the lack of detail... I wrote the post at 2 in the morning all angry. I will keep you updated :) Again, thank you so much :)


EDIT:
People are suggesting I learn/try to play the game with him, I've already considered that, but I'm currently studying for my finals, and they're not going to end for another 10 days. I played games for years, so I don't really mind trying something new.

YES I WILL TRY THE GAME WHEN MY FINALS ARE OVER. 

Boyfriend is addicted to League of Legends, and he has been neglecting me. He has been breaking promises/cancelling plans, saying ""he forgot"". I try to bring up how I am upset about this, he responds with ""I'm not dealing with you"", I asked if it's because he's playing the game, and he says ""yes"". I don't believe I'm being too unreasonable.

For me this has never been a problem and we've been going out for a little over a year. The first month of our relationship I thought we got over her insecurity about her height.

Of course when we've gone out I've heard comments from men and women but it's never really bothered me. I've just attributed it to them being jealous or being assholes.

But last week I over heard her talking to her friend on the phone about how she didn't like our photos together and was embarrassed because of the height difference.

I never really cared till now. It really hurt to hear that somebody that you love is ashamed to be seen with you. She knows that I know what she said and i've been kind of a dick to her since then. For example she's a ""pro"" volleyball player and I go to all her games but skipped the last one and when she came home and asked why I didn't go I told her I didn't want to embarrass her and then we started arguing again.

How do I get over what she said? Or should I even get over it? Should I just move on?

Here's a little history, I've been dating him for 2 years now. I moved from the west coast to the east coast with him so he could be closer to his son and family and in the process losing the closeness of my family and friends. I am not saying he didn't give up anything when we moved, but I had a great job and tons of friends that I gave up to be with him.

Anyways, a few months ago I was using his phone because I couldn't find mine when a text from and number that wasn't saved in his phone came through. I was about to tell him about it when I read the last text he had sent her he was asking if she had a boyfriend still and if she wanted one. I went back further he's asked her for naked pictures, videos, etc. I was naturally upset even if he didn't physically do anything this is a line that we both do not cross. I confronted him about it and instead of telling me why he got mad at me and said that I shouldn't be snooping. In that aspect he's right, but he goes through my phone all the time and I don't care I have nothing to hide from him, I was cheated on before and I can't stand people who do.

Fast forward to today, his phone was going off this morning and would not stop, he just kept sleeping through it, so I picked it up he's got multiple girls who have sent him naked pictures and videos. He's been using my photos to get them to send them! I'm stuck here I make less than I did and I have an older car that I don't think would make it all the way back to the other side of the country. I'm at a loss I don't know what to do, if I confront him about it he just tries to turn everything on me. I want to end it but I have no where else to go.

Basically it started because I started dating a guy in their friend group that one of them liked. I had no way of knowing that, and didn't know until after I started dating my boyfriend.
  
  
Last semester my boyfriend was abroad and the harassment got worse (I'm talking people banging on the door to my room and calling me a slut and whore through the door, among other things). So I met with one of the Deans of our college (she is also in charge of the Honor Code at our school) and asked for a no contact order (basically a restraining order) to be placed between one of the girls and myself. I struggled with that decision as I did not want to make the harassment worse. 
  
  
The harassment never stopped, but I had been really sick this semester and had some family crises at home (I was on medical leave for over a month and there was a situation where my mother- a school principal- had been targeting in a serious school shooting threat) so I just met with the Dean to report a violation of the no contact order.
  
  
The Dean [F50ish] proceded to tell me that she didn't know if she could do anything about the further harassment because she ""can't force people to be nice to others"" and because the biggest incident was in February. Additionally she said that I had been harassing the other girls involved- and one such way was that I had filed for the no-contact order (wut?). 
  
  
Anyway, Reddit, I'm looking for advice on how to handle this- I am being harassed and now being told that I am the harasser (and oh my goodness, I have no fucking clue how that is being spun). 
  
  
TL;DR: [F19] being harassed in college for 18 months. Finally gain courage to file for no contact order. No contact order is broken, being told I am the harasser for filing for a no contact order. What do?

It seems like a little thing, but when it happens over and over again, it gets annoying, especially when the girls ram into my girlfriend when she refuses to move.

I'm in Texas, near Ft. Worth, and since the sun came up things don't seem quite as bleak.  Duct tape is keeping the window up for now.
I'm about 1200 miles from home, but I'm more than halfway there. 
I do have more good news--a very kind person at the airline ticketing office transferred my non refundable ticket that I was going to use to fly home for the holidays to my mother. She arranged to have her fly in and meet me early this morning in Albuquerque and she's with me right now.  She can't help with money but she is going to help with the drive and moral support, which I definitely need. 

Speaking of money, I've received some very kind messages requesting my Paypal address--I can't tell you how much I appreciate it, but I really can't accept.  Just reading your comments is helping to keep me going, and I had no intention of trying to get anything more. Simply put, I'm some random person on the Internet, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm a scammer or such. 
I know that's happened on Reddit before, and I would rather sleep in my car and pawn things than draw a witch hunt down on me. This whole thing has already had plenty of real life drama, I don't want to add Reddit drama to the mix. 

Finally, multiple people have called my ex's real relationship with this girl into question. I promise that I was not exaggerating or using hyperbole--she really is a girl who he fucked once, about two years ago. I know that (as well as the fact that they aren't friends and haven't spoken beyond her attempting to fuck him again) because we were best friends for ten years and told each other everything. We both have friends of both genders, and I have never done anything but encourage him to hang out with his actual friends. But she is not a friend, she is not even an ex. She is just, literally, some girl he fucked. 
I was trying to lay claim to my boyfriend, that much is true. But all I was asking was for him to gently remind this girl that he had a girlfriend. I don't think that's unreasonable. He obviously disagreed, and so do others. That's fine. If that was the extent of what happened, that would be different. I never even got to have that argument. 

I can feel myself getting defensive and rambling again, so I'm going to end this here for the moment.  In some ways I wish he would see this and tell his side so that I didn't keep wondering what he would say and wondering if I really am crazy. 

Anyway, thank you to everyone again.  
I'm halfway there, my credit cards are maxed out, and my cat hates me, but I still have a little cash and I have someone to keep me from turning around and running back to him.    I'll update again later if I can. 


**Update 2** Still driving east. Home feels so far away, but I barely have money for gas let alone a room for the night. About 5 minutes ago, my passenger side window fell down and I can't get it back up no matter what I try. I'm in the middle of the desert and its freezing. I can't help but think about how I was safe and warm and loved and happy two days ago. 
I've never felt this alone. It's even harder to not want to turn around now. I don't know if I can make it. 


 **UPDATE** I'm getting the last of my stuff together and trying to cram my cat back into his carrier, and then I'm starting to make the drive from Los Angeles to Florida (fuck identifying information, and fuck you Max if you read this--take a look at the comments and then we can talk).  Thank you, everyone, who set me straight.  I needed it.  Let me just say that so far, the kindness of strangers has given me more than a renewed faith in humanity.  

I'll update when I stop for the night, hopefully the drama is over (though that's probably wishful thinking).

----------------------------------------------------

My apologies if this turns rambling, I'll try to give the short version.  

I moved across the country a month ago to be with my long distance boyfriend--we've been together a year, but best friends for 10 years.  Before the move, we've had a couple terrible fights.  He can't have an argument without losing his shit entirely, screaming, throwing things, even self-harming.  He says that this only ever happens with me, and no one else in his life affects him that way--he also says that he once had a very severe temper and has worked very hard to fix that, and he can't let me destroy that.  Every time we've had a fight that ended like this, he's convinced me that I have an anger problem and need to get help--when I point out that it's him freaking out, he simply says that I'm the aggressor.  

Last night he got a text from a girl he once fucked, and to whom he hasn't really spoken in years (though she's sent some thinly veiled booty calls)--she was inviting him to a concert late last night.  He announced this text and read it to me, by the way, I didn't go searching through his phone or anything out of line.  I jokingly said I'd text her back that he was too busy having sex with his girlfriend, and playfully grabbed his phone.  He thought I was serious and took the phone back.  He said that he was going to tell her that he couldn't go because it was late on a school night...I know I shouldn't have even asked, but I did anyway.  I asked him if he was going to even mention me to this girl, and he reacted like I was insane.  Long story short, I said that I thought it wasn't asking much to just give her a gentle reminder, just in case she had any ideas--he said that I was crazy and jealous and possessive and crossing a very clear line to him.  

I went outside and tried to clear my head for a bit, because I knew if I argued, it would end up in the same old dramatic situation, and I would have to take the blame for it.  I came back after a few minutes, and told him I was going to go out, maybe wander around the grocery store for a bit.  He told me not to go, he wanted to talk.  He then proceeded to dissect my feelings, basically telling me that my feelings are my own and he isn't going to treat people ""badly"" because I want him to.  He went on and on about the boundaries that he has set in order to have a healthy relationship with me; he'll be happy to discuss my feelings in a calm rational way, but he won't open a door that will surely lead to me telling him who he can or can't see and when and where and why (nevermind the fact that I've never tried to do anything like it, it's more important to send a message to me).  Meanwhile, the thought of just re-establishing a boundary with this random girl is heinous to him, because she hasn't done anything wrong and why should he punish her?  You know, by saying my name to her.  How awful.  But no, he's more concerned with keeping me ""in line"" than with how I feel.  

He then proceeded to dissect everything I was saying about why it hurt that this seemed to be such a huge problem for him, when I or anyone else I know would have (and have in the past) automatically done it without a second thought.  I was trying to tell him that he was making me feel like I wasn't any more important than a stranger, I was just trying to tell him why I was upset.  And he starts in with pointing out all the logical fallacies in what I was saying, drawing comparisons to atheist vs. Christian arguments, and basically giving me a debate critique.  It would have been funny if it wasn't so painful--I was telling him that I felt like he was ridiculing my feelings, and he retorts by ridiculing my feelings.  He had this smile on his face the whole time that was killing me.  

I finally had enough and told him, ""I know you think that you're being the smarter, better, more mature person by throwing around your knowledge of ad hominem attacks and straw man arguments and telling me why what I feel is wrong, but you're not.  You're just hurting me.""

He then looked at me, told me to pack my shit and get out, and started screaming.  He called me a fucking bitch, amongst other horrible things, he threw his computer onto the bed, punched his bookshelf repeatedly, and started packing his stuff to stay with his mother for a few nights.  I didn't even know what to say, I was scared shitless.  Every so often, he would seem to calm down and start to argue again--when I would answer him, he freaked out all over again.  

In the course of calling me every horrible name he could think of, screaming at me, and throwing shit, he took an armful of textbooks and threw them at me.  They hit the wall six inches to the left of me, nearly hitting my cat in the process as well.  I couldn't even move.  Several times he got near me, with this look in his eyes...I still don't think he would hit me, but I can tell he wanted to.  And through the whole thing, he kept screaming about how I was doing this to him, how I was making him this angry.  

Finally, he called his mother right in front of me, asked her to stay for a few nights.  He told her that things had gotten bad with me, that I had started a shouting match.  I hadn't so much as raised my voice once, and I said so.  He laughed and said, ""See, she won't stop, she's so aggressive.  You know how hard I've worked to keep my anger under control and she doesn't care, she is just fighting and fighting and fighting with me and won't stop it.""  When I looked at him and asked him if he was really doing this, he laughed again and said yes, of course he was.  

I ended up leaving the room, and went out onto our balcony, and promptly started sobbing.  His roommate had heard the commotion, obviously, and grabbed me by the shoulders--she was almost sure he had hit me.  She also asked why I had let him talk to me that way.  I still don't have an answer.

He came out about ten minutes later, and tried to cuddle up to me.  I wish I could describe how horrified I was at the whole thing.  I told him to please not come near me, and he literally asked me what was wrong.  I reminded him of how he had, about 15 minutes prior, called me a fucking bitch, kicked me out, and thrown a stack of books at my fucking head.  ""I didn't throw them AT you, I just lost it.""  

I told him to go and I haven't seen him since.  

Now I'm sitting in his room, surrounded by boxes of my things--my family, his roommate, his best friend, everyone who has heard even the beginning of this story has told me I need to get out and never come back.  But even after 24 hours apart, I already miss him.  He still believes that this is all my fault, of course.  

I keep thinking about what happened, what he said, what I said, and going over and over to see if it really was as bad as I thought at the time.  I know he has anger problems (though he swears I'm the one with the problem) but I knew that going in--I feel like a failure, and I'm so ashamed of myself.  

I don't know if I should leave, or stay, or try to talk to him, or if it would even do any good.  I've never felt this way in my whole life, and if there's anything anyone can tell me, or any hope anyone can give me, I need it now more than ever.

We're both college students. He's a senior, and I'm a junior. Up until a few months ago, our sex life was great. It ranged between every day to every three days or so if we were busy, with both of us initiating about the same amount. About two months ago, everything changed. It was only me initiating, sex dropped to about once a week (barely), and I've just been feeling kind of neglected. I brought it up to him a few times, and he sort of brushed the issue off. I've been starting to feel like it's me, and I've been feeling really bad about myself because my boyfriend doesn't want to have sex with me anymore. Last night, the issue (not having sex) got brought up again. 

Well, I finally got my answer. He told me that he thought I was overweight and that I needed to lose weight. Just as a note, I have not changed weight, not even a pound, since we started dating. I'm 5'8"" and about 135 pounds, and I've never considered myself to have a weight problem in my life.

I feel absolutely devastated. I have never felt so low and down about myself. I never want to eat again...I just don't know what I should do. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend told me that he thinks I'm overweight even though I am still the exact same size as I was when we started dating a year ago.

Edit: I took down the picture...sorry, I just didn't want one that I had on facebook/that someone would recognize, and I was just trying to give a reference, sorry it was so unnecessary.

Also, I honestly am not leaving anything out. This conversation is just so out of left field and so out of nowhere that I don't know what to do about it.

Not sure if anyone remembers any of this but I feel obligated to update for the last time about this. 

Me (M27), Wife (F26), we've been married just over a year.

Things are working. My god we've put in a lot of work, and a lot of talking, and a lot of everything else it takes to make it over these humps, but we've done it. We've both grown a lot from this. It's been a lot of hard work on my end to change some aspects about myself, and she's been doing the same. 

In the past, I was pretty afraid to call her out on her shit when it was happening, because it upset her and caused fighting, and I didn't like that. Well what I've learned is that when I bottled it up, she was bottling up her frustration from me doing that, and in the end making things worse regardless of me saying something or not. Now I'm up front and honest when I think something is stupid, or irrational, or a good idea, or anything else. This has been a huge help. I've learned to pay attention more instead of just drifting away in to the couch every night because I was tired from work. 

Now I can let her know, ""hey, I'm tired, I worked hard and I don't want to do anything. Lets just spend some time together."" and this works out well most of the time. Sometimes she gets a fire under her ass to get shit done when she gets home, and I've had to let her know, that just because she wants to do chores or something, doesn't mean I want to. We dedicate those ""get shit done"" times for the weekend when we have a free day, then I gladly help out with projects around the house. I also learned to put my foot down when I really don't want to do something and just tell her no, she needs to learn to do that herself because I don't want to spend my free time working on her projects for her all the time.

She has improved a lot on the whole family time thing. During Christmas, she was still working that out for herself, and an argument was sparked when she tried to pull the same thing she had the year before, and tried to dedicate spending 85% of Christmas day with her family, AFTER we had already come up with a time schedule that we agreed on. I called her out on her attempt to change it all, and she really put up a fight about it. I stood my ground, and we both got our way. We divided our time evenly among the three families and had a great Christmas. She said she liked how it all worked out too. 

I think what sparked her attempt the most was that her mom took on 2 part time jobs to help pay for the second house they bought (that's it's own disaster story), and was forced to work on Christmas Eve. Well this meant that her mom couldn't be at grandmas to cook dinner for 25 people like she always is, and tried to pass the duties on to my wife (my wife usually shows up and finishes cooking every year). There was a lot of friction back and forth about it, her mom really laid on the guilt about ""but who else will make the food?! What will we all be eating?! I need you to be at Nana's to cook this year or there won't be anything!"". My wife indulged in it for a bit, and when I caught wind of it, I put an end to it right away. If 25 people can't team together to make a fucking meal, then guess what, we're all going to ave cheese and crackers for Christmas, everyone needs to pitch in or not bitch about it. The end. It all went fine in the end. My wife didn't realize how relieved she was to not have to cook the dinner until she didn't do it. 

So back on topic, things are going really well. Once in a while there's a little slip, and I realize I need to fix what I'm doing and not get us back in the same rut. I'm happy to report that love prevailed, and that we're going to be ok this time around, and hopefully the rest of the time too. Big thanks to all of you that responded with really genuinely helpful responses. I don't really know what else to say about it so if I left anything out, just let me know!

TL;DR: Wife and I had a rough patch, we came out on top and still in love. Life is good again.

Thanks for all the advice. After thinking it all over, I realized that whether or not she was okay with me sleeping with other people didn't matter because I didn't *want* to sleep with other people. I felt like I would feel like I was cheating no matter what we'd decided beforehand.

C. and I had a long talk last night and I explained that despite my past and my initial plans for this vacation I was definitely not going to sleep with anyone else on this trip whether we had made things official or not.

She said that it's hard for her, because she feels like she's going to be worrying what I'm doing the whole time. I don't think she's super jealous or anything, but she explained that we haven't been seeing each other long and it would be naive of her to assume she knows me oh-so-well. I offered to send her pictures of my penis every night so she can see that it's not in anyone else but she apparently didn't think that was a great idea.

Eventually, I felt like the conversation was going in circles so I just said ""I'm not going to cheat on you and I'm just going to start calling you my girlfriend. If you don't like it, you'll have to dump me.""

Then we made out on the couch for like an hour. Things were getting pretty heavy when my sister came home. (Sidenote: I know C. because she is my sister's friend and roommate.) It was pretty late at this point so she said I could sleep over in her bed -but just sleep. The whole ""just sleeping"" thing lasted about half an hour.

I guess that's what you'd call a happy ending. I got a girlfriend, I got laid, I get to go on a European vacation, and then I can come home and continue to get laid.

The only bad thing was this morning my sister told me that C. and I needed to stay at my place when we sleep together because she's traumatized for life after hearing her brother have sex with her best friend. I asked her why she didn't bang on the wall  or something and she said she didn't want to ruin our first time together so she just put on headphones. She's a good sister.

1373106689.0,198,self.relationships,1hqrt4,UPDATE: My(25/m) gf(25/f) has become obsessed with interracial sex. I'm not sure what to do. Together for 3 years.,throwawayissue1,270,72,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hqrt4/update_my25m_gf25f_has_become_obsessed_with/,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hmzt0/my25m_gf25f_has_become_obsessed_with_interracial/).

I want to thank everyone for their advice. You all helped me to think through this issue.

I took time last night to sit down with my gf and talk with her about our sex life. I started off pretty general in terms of how she’s liked being more open in the bedroom. We both agreed that it’s been on the whole a good experience.

I steered the conversation towards her interracial fetish, saying I wanted to talk about it outside the bedroom. I tried to do it in a way that wouldn’t make her defensive, but kind of seemed to get that way at the start. I didn’t offer any judgment or commentary, I just let her talk about it. I learned there were two big reasons she’s become so interested in this fetish.

The first was something I didn’t know about her college days. She said her close group of friends went through a phase early on in college when they all (except my gf) dated black men pretty frequently. They mostly all left for college with bfs and when the relationship ended, these girls (who were white) would seek out black men. By the time my gf broke up with her bf later in college, the group had moved out of this phase and my gf didn’t get to experience it.

They had a mini renunion a while back and I guess her friends got talking about how the sex they had during this phase was the best in their life. She said they talked about how it felt very transgressive and that many of them “didn’t feel like they were women” until they had that experience. The way she described it, the thrill was linked to a lot of stereotypes (rough sex, penis size etc etc). But according to my gf, she girls all treat this phase in their life a dirty secret, but nevertheless a transformational part of their sexual histories. (Many of them, including my gf come from small towns originally).

The second reason was one I was expecting- her kind of nutty friend. Like I mentioned earlier, this friend recently started dating a black man, and she frequently overshares. I guess this friend and her bf are into very explicit sex (this is where the breeding, and other very racial terms seems to come from). She talks about it a lot when they hang out together and I guess my gf has become interested.

I said I was glad we’ve been so open with eachother, and I was glad she could talk with me about this. I said some of what we were doing was making me uncomfortable. I explained the history behind the stereotypes she’s brought into the bedroom and how they tie into historical racism. She didn’t like this. She got very defensive and said this wasn’t racist because it’s based on her friend’s real life experience. That according to her friends, black men generally have certain physical characteristics, and that sex with black men changed them. She also said while she can understand how some of the terms look racist from the outside, she’s doing something her other friend does with her bf, and he’s the one who’s driving their sex life.

Every time I tried to point out that while this might be her friends experience, historical racism still plays out in the background, she kept pointing out that it’s not based on stereotypes, but her friend’s actual experiences.

Ok. Fuck. So we’re not getting anywhere. I explained why I wasn’t comfortable with this. I tried to ask her what our other black friends would think about this. She didn’t have much to say to that.

While we were being open, she also told me about some things I liked that she was uncomfortable with, which is totally fine. But she said it’s going to be very hard for her to dial back this fantasy. She apparently wanted to take it further by introducing certain slurs into dirty talk. I told her I was in not ok with this at all.

So reddit, I’m pretty lost and confused right now. What should I do?

My mother tried to drive a wedge between Me[28M] and my fiancee [30F] - Warning this is a long one,rivfader02,255,58,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h3cia/i_hope_i_did_the_right_thing_here_my_mother_tried/,"Some quick history without getting into personal details, my mother and I were separated for 15 years, drama, custody battle etc. Anyway I reunited with her a few years ago when my fiancee and I were just dating and not engaged yet. It was a very happy moment. My mom hit it off just fine with my now fiancee. I thought they were two best buds.


I wanted my relationship to go slow and step by step with my mother after all 15 years is a long time. My mother is completely obsessed with me and understandable she lost me for a very long time. Our relationship worked fine due to distance. We had a bit of a misunderstanding about phone calls. I would call her once every other week for a nice chat, I am not much of a phone talker and like I said baby steps. She wanted me to call everyday.


Anyway my mother ran into issues where she was living and had to go move in with some family on her side as a roommate, she had some drama issues with that living situation. So I invited her to come out to our state/town to live nearby where we could get some bonding as mother/son and learn to be a part of each others lives.


She came two days later totally unexpected, she stayed at a local extended stay hotel to look for an apartment. Well this is where things went downhill. She didn't respect my space or personal life, I have lived out here for over 20 years and have a life of my own and she would get mad if I didn't cancel already made plans to come hang out in her hotel room. I work late nights so I sleep during the morning/afternoon and she couldn't respect that. She expected my fiancee who also works weird hours and myself to apartment find for her. I mean fully do it, make all the calls, setup the appointments, get the paperwork, etc. 


We did it at first just to show we care, and we figured after we got her started and some directions and driving her by a lot of different complexes, she would have a nice set of options to choose from. Oh no that wasn't enough she expected we spend our entire weekends with her and if we tried to let her know we need space or we had plans booked with our social circle or other family she would flip shit and accuse us of being rude, unaccommodating, and complainers. We have basically been feeding her since she came out here, and even bought her a phone card for her cell phone. We did everything we could within our free time to help her.


Well three days ago I took her to lunch before work, and this is when the jealousy of my fiancee began. She started out saying wow she is such a nag, are you sure you want marry a nag for the rest of your life? She is two faced and puts you down. This is all complete bogus my fiancee is very sweet and she doesn't have the mean bone in her to be like that, yes she can nag but all people do and it's not constant or anything and some of it is well deserved. I like to keep a line of peace, and I just told her you know that's my future wife and I love her flaws and all, just like she loves me flaws and all. I said I respect your opinion but please keep it to yourself, now lets enjoy our lunch. I think most people would have turned the car around and said GTFO at this point and believe me I wanted to but I didn't want to think she was petty like that with some bs matriarchal jealousy. Especially since my fiancee adores my mother and wants to be her best friend. Also did I mention my fiancee is the main reason we reunited she pushed me to do it and held my hand the entire way.


Well yesterday morning on our day off which the past two weeks have been go go go, and my fiancee and I wanted a nice day to spend quality time together we were gonna have lunch see a movie, then take our dog to the dog park, and then meetup with friends for a double date and board game night. My mother calls at 9am while we were still sleeping in and my fiancee picks up and she just goes on a rampage against my fiancee, accusing her of being a two faced bitch, blocking her son from her, not helping her find an apartment, shes gone hungry, and we are not giving her the time of day. As I said my fiancee is very sweet so this shocked her as she didn't see it coming and she was reduced to a sobbing mess. I grabbed the phone and told my mother that was completely uncalled for and you owe her an apology do you not respect our space? My mother hung up on me.


I went to the room and left my fiancee out in the car as she is not very confrontational and it's my mom so I will take it from here. I was stern and civil, I raised my voice but more in a parental tone. I let my mother have it, I also did not cuss her. I told her I am here to ask you to respectfully leave. We had next to zero drama in our lives until you showed up, we have asked you respectfully a handful of times to respect our space, we have fed you, and given you things you needed, we have helped you apartment hunt, and you spat in our faces and tried to drive a wedge between us. You also made up lies about my fiancees family and put words in their mouths and tried to turn us against them. Today you have lost your son again, and I want you take your forked tongue with you and out of our lives. I now understand why nobody wants you around or living with them. 


She got super upset of course and she agreed to leave, but she told me I am making a grave mistake siding with my fiancee and that I hurt her deeply.


My heart is broken, I feel betrayed, taken advantage of, disrespected, and cheated. Please tell me I did the right thing here. Also I just want to say before anybody brings it up she has not lost her son permanently but for right now I am not going to have any contact with her right now I need some time. However when the time is right I will allow a slow paced long distance relationship with her again, after all you only have one mother.

My boyfriend [22M] and I [23F] have been dating for almost two years. Today, we were having a discussion about our relationship when I asked him if there was anything else he would like to talk about. He (hesitantly) said that he wished my boobs were bigger and asked if I would consider getting a breast augmentation. As a little background, I am a small Asian girl (5'3"", 105 lbs) with at least a proportionally-sized chest (B-C cup border) that I am not ashamed of. I am, of course, not planning on getting a breast augmentation. 

What I want to know is -- is this a normal issue that comes up in relationships? Is it normal for a boyfriend to want his gf to get bigger breasts? How do I move on and go back to normal in this relationship...?

My boyfriend is very philosophical. He believes that he gains so much knowledge and ideas just from being alone. Right now he is going through a phase where he feels that being in a relationship is stopping him from growing into a better person, and it is wearing on our relationship. He wants to be with me and sees himself marrying me/having kids with me but not right now or anytime soon.

He says that he wants time to be single before he settles down. Not to be with anyone else but to just be alone before he starts that chapter in his life. He wants to travel and learn a lot more about the world, single. 

He thought of this ""great idea"" to break up then set a date to get back together then get married 6 months later. I automatically said that that was ridiculous and I can't guarantee that I won't move on. I feel that he won't ever be ready to settle down unless he has his space but I'm not comfortable with his idea. I figured I would ask Reddit their opinion and see if anyone has gone through this before.

What would you do if you were in this situation?

Tl;Dr Boyfriend wants time to be single before we marry. I'm not okay with it.

EDIT: Hey guys, I can't believe the response I got from this. I appreciate everyone's insight and can see where you all are coming from. He has tried to make it very very clear to me that he doesn't want to be with anyone else. That he knows he can't do better but he just wanted space before he started the rest of his life. Soul searching as some call it. 

EDIT: I have read each and everyone of your advice and it has helped. I did some thinking of my own and brought to his attention a couple things. For one, I'm not the most motivated person. I sometimes set goals for myself and never meet them. Or really try. I know if affects him because he really finds that attractive in someone. I also don't have any hobbies. And if I do I usually am too tired so I watch TV. 

I brought these things up and told him that I think there is a deeper reason. That he wants to take time apart to see if I am the one he wants to be with. Not just to be by himself but to make sure I am what he wants. He broke down and said that he does feel like he is less attracted to me because he really wants me to achieve my goals. He wants me to go after things I want and really show that initiative. He finds it so attractive.

I want to be this type of person so it didn't hurt my feelings. It was nice to hear the truth. It made him really excited when I told him that I am going to start trying to achieve everything I set out to do. I hope that talking with him has helped our relationship and that he will start being more honest!

I am 20F, and I am running into problems telling my boyfriends what I do for a living. During the day I have a job where I do basic tech support for a small company, but I only have 30 hours a week and get paid barely over minimum wage. This is not enough to pay my bills.

At night, I am a webcam model. I have been doing this since I turned 19, and it is how I make almost all of my money. I am very successful at this, but I've never made top 100 or anything like that. Yes, I am nude on camera, and yes, I do everything just like almost all the other webcam girls you see out there. This does not bother me, as I look nothing like I do in real life when I go on camera. (I wear a wig, different makeup, cover my tattoos, etc)

My problem is that every guy who I ever date ends up wondering where I get all my money. They know I am in college studying electrical engineering (I have a 3.8 GPA at a 4 year state school), and that I am in general a very shy person. They also know that I do not make a lot of money at my day job. It just does not fit in with how I present myself in public, as most people see me as the shy nerdy girl who has her nose buried in textbooks and a kindle.

Every time I try to tell a partner what I do for a living, he freaks out. I've dated three men since I started webcamming, and I dropped hints about my profession to all three. None of them seemed okay with the idea. The one that I told dumped me after we had dated for 4 months. It is hard to hide what I do because I work about 4-5 nights a week. I make on average $4000 a month from both jobs, which is way more than a lot of people my age. I don't know if they are jealous, or what and I need some help before I ruin all of my relationships!

**TL;DR: I'm a webcam model and a college student and I don't know how to reveal it to a potential boyfriend without ruining everything.**

**EDIT: Everyone keeps asking me this question, so I will put the answer here. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH BEING RECORDED AND RECOGNIZED. I have had a very close friend approach me and tell me that he had found pictures that looked like me, but it was easy to play it off because of the hair difference. It did happen. I have been recorded many times, and DCMA takedowns are never fun.**

**To find a site, research, research, research. Look at the sites, watch the other models. Is it something you want to do? Look at the top 20 and then the middle range models, then the really badly ranked ones. Are you comfortable with the differences? Are you comfortable getting naked for strangers? Are you okay with going to bed without having made any money? It happens.**

**And the last is key: Do you offer something different? Don't say a stellar personality, as all models in top 1000 all have good personalities. They wouldn't be there if they did not. Top 1000 at my site make $2000+ a month, pre-tax. That is about $1400 AFTER taxes, which you DO HAVE TO PAY. The IRS does know and later on that information might be revealed under your social security number.**

I hope that helps, any more and I would be giving out too many tricks.

Weird?,Isthisok123,264,66,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hzfu3/update_my_gf_24f_has_a_male_best_friend_shes/,"Original text:  http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1htvpn/my_gf_24f_has_a_male_best_friend_shes_hooked_up/

So, I received a ton of advice, half saying it's weird, the other half telling me she's shady and she's most likely cheating on me.

To address the latter, no, she really isn't cheating on me.  I'm not constantly surveilling her, but we live together and like I said, she knows for a fact that if she crosses that line, we're done.  She's brutally honest and up front with me and thus, let's just accept that she's not cheating on me and move on.

As far as the main issue at hand.  I talked to her about it, and said that I think it's pretty messed up she's helping him ring shop for this girl who has no idea how he cheated on her.  She didn't understand.  I mean, blank look.  I then said, ""Ok, let's say that I cheated on you.  Let's then say that I asked the girl on the side if she can help me pick out a jewelry for you.  How would you feel?""  Then a lightbulb went off in her head.  

According to her, since it was so long ago (2 yrs ago), that she didn't even think about it at all.  She didn't think how it would look, the consequences, etc.  We then had a LONG (3 - 4 hrs) conversation about this issue, and how horrible this action was.  She understood.  

We THEN talked about her best friend.  I told her up front that I think he's a huge asshole, how shady I think he is because he's NEVER introduced his soon-to-be fiance to my gf, though they're ""best friends,"" and she didn't understand how that was shady.  I again, put it into context.  ""Let's say that I have a best female friend.  Let's say that she has never met you, my gf, and you have never met her, my best friend.  How would that make you feel?""  Then another light bulb.  ""That does sound really weird...do you think he wants to hook up with me again?""

At this point, I seriously -__- at her.  We had a long discussion, about how she can keep whoever friends she wants, but I flat out told her that I think that her best friend is a scumbag, and I have no respect for him.  I left it there.

All in all, it's resolved, but now I'm beginning to think that either A) my girlfriend is so oblivious to things (yes, she is very naive, brought up very conservatively, etc. but...jeez) or B) ...I don't know.  Do people like this exist?

TL;DR - had a long talk.  Gf didn't understand why it was wrong, then light bulb.  More talks, more misunderstandings, more light bulbs.

After a talk, she admitted she isn't sure if she loves me anymore.",iamhurtandupset,253,59,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cisqu/caught_my_wife_30f_effectively_setting_up_to/,"**Sorry for the wall of text.** TL;DR at the end.

My Wife and I have been together for 10.5 years, married since July last year. Up until yesterday, I genuinely thought we had what could only be described as a picture-perfect relationship: Barely argued, good sex life, pretty much the same goals, no money problems, and we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.

As of November/December last year, she developed depression that *really* took hold of her. The big swing came after she was told officially that she cannot have kids (she's sort of known this for a while as she had cancer when she was a child, but this made it official) and her grandfather died. She went to the doctors who diagnosed the depression, booked her with a therapist and gave her some anti-depressants. Well, she only saw the therapist for 4 sessions (that was all that was initially booked) but the anti-depressants seemed to do the trick. In fact, not only did they make her feel normal again, but it knocked her sex drive into overtime!

So yesterday I was at home, on the Laptop. I went into iPhoto to find a picture from a while back, when I came across some pictures she took of herself in underwear. This didn't lead to any initial concerns, as I know she wanted to take some anyway, but they were initially stored in Photobooth. However, one of them (of her in her bra, with some nipple showing) had been marked that it had been emailed. My curiosity was piqued. She can't have accidentally clicked ""email"" and then deleted the draft, as it said successfully emailed. She wouldn't try and save the draft for future, as it's saved on the Laptop.

Now, we both know each other's email and Facebook passwords. Not because of any trust issues, but we just ended up knowing them. There were never any problems with this, but with this anomaly, I had to check.

So, I went into her email..... and found the picture. It had been emailed, as it had said. To a male friend of hers from Uni. And the conversation that preceded it effectively said (without using such words) that she was coming on to him. She called herself a ""self-confessed spankophile"", talked about a blowjob that she owed him (in joking terms, but made suspicious by the context). She said she was going on holiday with a female friend to Turkey, and when he asked for ""pictures"", he said that her friend wouldn't be happy with that.... but she'll send him pictures of her, but that he needs to send some of him to recipriocate.

This was not just a chat with a good friend that just went a little over the line, this was well over that point. I confronted her, just saying that it was marked email and implying that she could have just saved it to drafts (gave her the opportunity to confess or lie) and she lied. We had a long chat, and she admitted that she isn't sure if she loves me any more, and she's felt like this since November/December. She did say, however, that when she feels like this, she doesn't have any love for anything (this is a symptom of depression) but I just..... I need to know how to get over this. I need to know how I can trust her again. I need to know how to stop torturing myself with the thought that if she wasn't so sloppy with covering her tracks, that she would have slept with another man.

What do I do?

**TL;DR** Wife went nearly naked email to another guy while giving him the come-on. She admitted she isn't sure if she loves me any more, but this may be a symptom of depression. Don't know what to do.

Whilst I had always known she wasn't the most maternal person ever, it was only last month when we sat down and discussed the matter seriously that we realised we are completely opposed when it comes to starting a family.

I am from a big family (6 siblings), and so the idea of only having one other person in my immediate family for the rest of my life is one I just cannot conceive. Not starting a family is not an option for me.

Unfortunately, she feels as strongly the other way. She doesn't even concede it as unlikely, it's just not an option for her either. She is as distraught as I am about this.

We are very much in love and it is heartbreaking to think that a relationship as good as this could be about to end. She has made the argument that it would be madness to throw such a good relationship away when it's possible I may only be looking to start a family in 10-15 years' time.

Having read every other similar thread in /r/relationships I know that a couple is incompatible if they cannot agree on what is probably the most important issue a couple will ever to make - whether to start a family together or not. Therefore I know the relationship must end at some point.

I suppose what I am looking for is advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation and has the benefit of hindsight, especially regarding the practicalities.

Is the best solution simply finishing it immediately? Is there something to be said for spending another month, another year, together - even if we know it has to end eventually? Relationships normally end because either one or both people are unhappy, but this is not the case here, we are both very happy together and have had an amazing time together. It is a horrible situation and has made us both very upset.

However, I cannot stress enough how firmly we both disagree on the issue of starting a family.

Any advice or stories of similar experiences would be most appreciated. Thank you for reading.

**tl;dr - We are both 25, completely differ on wanting to start a family.  We don't know what to do and we're very upset.**

Edit: Thanks for the comments, I appreciate every single one. It has confirmed to me what I know needs to happen.

*She has accepted my apology.
*Wants to make our relationship better.
*We're going to work on our relationship, as we have done in the past. This incident, however, was unlike anything we had ever been through. (pregnancy scares, almost break ups, long distance, illness)
*She attributes her low sex drive to her lack of self image. (used to be fat, got skinny, still thinks shes fat) I say nothing about positive things about her appearance.
*In the past, I have tried back massages, candles, drawing her a bath, chocolates, flowers, cooking a 5 course meal, reading [/r/relationships](/r/relationships), dates out to nice restaurants, bike rides, camping trips, out of town getaways. These have about a 45% success rate
*She has been diagnosed with depression. She takes 300mg Wellbutrin (is that a lot?)*
Whenever we have had sex, I ALWAYS make sure that she has at least 1 orgasm before I finish(oral/foreplay, intercourse)
*When she does want to have sex, I usually can pick up on it. Last night however, was not one of those times. I made a terrible mistake
*She is starting grad school in June. One of the many stresses in her life. Sometimes I feel like she is so focused on the other things going on in her life that she doesn't have time for me
*She does seem to fit the personality of a girl who does not find sex as necessary.  I am doing some serious soul searching.
*We have talked since I posted this. Keep in mind I wrote this almost immediately after she went to run her errands
*She later clarified that she meant ""selfish"" in terms of my apology. Apparently I used the words ""I"" and ""me"" too much in my apology for her liking

Where to start? My fiance (**F**24) and I (**M**25) have been together since 2005. We took each other's virginity after about a month in to our relationship.  The first couple years were amazing, and would not trade the memories for anything else. We both ended up going to the same college and stayed together throughout (no breaks, no infidelity). The prevailing issue that kept coming up is our seemingly incompatible sex drives. The first couple years, the sex was almost every time we spent time together, which was practically every day.  

Then college started and our schedules got busier to where it got down to us seeing each other on the weekends.  I just blamed the lack of intimacy we were sharing to the lack of time we would spend together.


When she got a place of her own, I ended up staying with her (and her 2 other roommates) most nights because she lived closer to school than I did.  Any time I wanted to have sex, I would have to initiate. She has initiated sex about a dozen times during our relationship. 
I wouldn't have a problem if the initiation was the only issue; whenever I try to initiate sex, I get every excuse in the book. *Tired, stressed, busy, headache, or the plain old not in the mood.*


Now I must say this about her before anybody makes any ditch the bitch comments: she is my best friend and the love of my life.  She is smart, funny, sexy, has the most beautiful hair, and is possibly the most determined person I know.  We have been through a lot of ups and downs together (lots of crazy family issues for both of us)  We got engaged this past November, and we moved in together in a place by ourselves for the first time in February.  **I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman.**

So here is my dilemma: At this point in our relationship, we have sex about once every 2-4 weeks.  Last night I hinted that I wanted some loving.  I began by kissing her, but the only response I got was laughter.  It bothered me that I was trying to be sweet and wanted to have and intimate evening with her.  But yet again, she just was not in the mood.

I then proceeded to let her know that I have needs, and that I just can't live with sex once a month.  I explained to her in a very calm manner that I crave intimacy with her on a daily basis, and her ""not being in the mood"" or ""being tired"" does a real number on my self confidence.

Her response was to pull her panties down (we're laying in bed) faced away from me and said, ""You have needs? Go ahead and fill *your needs*!""

This is where ~~I think~~ I messed up.

I took her up on her now obvious sarcastic offer.  We proceeded to have sex.  The worst sex we have ever had.  It honestly made me feel like I was using her body to masturbate with; it felt like she wasn't even in the room.  At one point I slowed down to try and kiss her, she wouldn't kiss me back.  I felt something was wrong then, but for some stupid fucking reason, I just flipped her over and proceeded to finish from behind.

As soon as it was over, she hurriedly put her clothes back on, grabbed the blanket and curled up in the corner of the bed.  In my post climactic state, it was dawning on me that I had dome something terribly wrong.  She would not talk to me.  I did not understand. I still don't.

I went to work today, and when I got home I received the silent treatment.  When I got up the nerve to begin to apologize to her, she just stared back blankly.  She said she was testing me last night and that I failed both tests.  I know what these were now.  I feel like I have completely destroyed her trust in me.  This event had me rethinking our engagement all day.  I'm so confused right now with so many thoughts and emotions, I felt that writing this all out may help in some way.  Our conversation ended with her going to the grocery store after calling me selfish.  I don't know what to do, and I don't have anybody I can talk to about this.  I need some perspective as well as some encouragement.",,True,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_sf1j2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sf1j2/i_may_have_ruined_my_7_year_relationship_nsfw/,

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who commented for their kind words and advice.  I did manage a little sleep in the end.  My husband was meant to come round at noon to talk, but instead we ended up talking this morning when our car started acting up and smelling like burnt rubber. His dad drove him in and we got the car home. 

We ended up talking on the drive and it went really well.  He feels so bad for not saying anything sooner and he's willing to work on things.  He's not ready to come home yet, but we're taking our daughter to ballet this afternoon and we're going to take our son to the cinema on Friday.  It all feels very strange but he's very willing to talk now and he even said maybe this is a good thing, like a fresh start.  

I know a couple of you have suggested I have anxiety/depression, and I believe you are right, but I'll leave it to the doctor tomorrow to tell me instead of speculating.  It turns out he's been feeling depressed too (unsurprisingly), so he's going to go see the doctor too.  It's all a bit weird, it's his 36th birthday tomorrow and taking our boy to the cinema to see Iron Man 3 has been our plan all along, only now it sort of feels like a date night.  I'm feeling so much better now for talking to him, and I just managed to actually eat some scrambled eggs, which is an improvement! Again, thanks to everyone for the advice, I'll update again when as things progress.

It began almost a year ago. I was 20, and struggling to support myself in a big city. I decided to use my body and sexuality to help pay bills, and turned to prostitution/ ""escorting"" by meeting men online. I was working full-time at a low-paying job, so would only do this when I knew I wouldn't be making ends meet at the end of the month. 

One of the guys I met this way seemed really sweet. I started seeing him repeatedly while he was in town on business. I knew he was getting attached but I didn't do anything to stop it. Fast forward 1 month (yes only a month) and he confides that he is in a miserable marriage and wants to divorce his wife and be with me. I decided to try dating him. He seemed like he had good intentions and truly wanted to help me. 

We had a few months of whirlwind romance and I started to realize this had no future. We were just to different and I started to resent him and his lifestyle. I have confrontation issues, and struggled to find a way to end it.  Every time I tried to break up or slow things down, he somehow spun it around so that we were right back where we were. 

Eventually, I got the message across, or so I thought. Now we are in the present. Apparently I am dealing with a much more serious situation that an awkward breakup. He is demanding that I keep seeing him or he is planning on mailing my family nude pictures of me and telling them how I earn my money to pay for tuition. I have a strained relationship with my parents and if they found this out, I would be devastated.  

How can I convince him to stop this and leave me alone?

My husband and I have been married for nearly 8 years. We have two children together. Before we met I dated a man for about a year 12-ish years ago and we accidentally gotpregnant. I was going through a tough time. I was young and wanted to finish school. My mother had just died a month before. 

He asked me to marry him when I found out I was pregnant. I said no and got an abortion. He vowed to never speak to me again. I honestly hold no ill will towards him, but I wasn't ready for a baby then. 

I met a man about a year after the abortion/break up. We married and eventually had children of our own. I was ready the second time. 

Well, my husband got a new very coveted job that he enjoys. He has this job for about a year when we attended a company gathering. We go and BAM! I see the man there. He is a lot older, but I would recognize that face anywhere. He sees me and instantly gets annoyed and angry, but doesn't say anything to me. From what I remember about this man he is very vocal about me being a horrible person for doing what I did. I fear he will tell my husband or attempt to ruin my husband's chances at a career with this company. The day after the abortion he told me that he would make sure I suffered for this, but nothing ever came from it.   

The problem is that the guy is kind of my husband's superior at work. I haven't told my husband, and I know I need to. I just don't know how. He and I are part of religion that frowns on this sort of thing, and although I have no regrets about the decision I made, I feel like he would be upset, even though I was so young when I made that choice. 

I appreciate any input, but please, please don't insult me for making a choice from over a decade ago. I made the choice, and whether you believe it is right or not, it is done. I can not go back. I can not redo it. How do I go on from here?   

Should I talk to the ex? Maybe he has changed and is more understanding now. Should I tell my husband? 

Why didn't I tell my husband? For a long time I didn't speak to anyone about it, and then I felt like it was done and going back to it wouldn't do anyone any good. Maybe I should have told him, but why does he have to know? It was my past. I don't know all of his past.   

tl;dr: Got an abortion more than 10 years ago. Married with children now, and my husband works for the ex that I got pregnant with. Think this is a problem that should be addressed immediately?     

Edit: Because it has been addressed- I am an American. I was born in England, but have been here since I was 10. English is my first language.I am Catholic, grew up in a largely catholic community.

1343996103.0,193,self.relationships,xm72t,UPDATE: I discovered through her e-mail that my wife is cheating on me. I am heartbroken.,lesecretestthrowaway,241,48,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xm72t/update_i_discovered_through_her_email_that_my/,"**Original thread:** www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xeux7/i_discovered_through_her_email_that_my_wife_is/

Well, there's a lot to say, even if the situation isn't 100% resolved. 

Firstly I went to see a lawyer and he told me to get all evidence of these e-mails in case it came to divorce - evidence of her adultery will help me in court. He didn't advise me to use my children as pawns but he did say whatever happens I have to stay calm and he says he can get me joint custody of our children, which is fantastic news, as long as I can prove that with my income and I can provide for them, which I can. 

I returned home and managed to get copies of e-mails from my wife's laptop. They've been printed off and are now in a file just in case. 

Next came confronting my wife. She arrived home on Wednesday, late as I expected, and I had already put the children to bed. I asked her why she was late, she told me she had extra work to take care of and I said, ""It hasn't got anything to do with (her colleague) then?"" She seemed slightly taken aback, asked me what I meant and I told her that I'd seen the e-mails, I know what's going on, I wanted to know why she did it. She began to cry, she didn't deny it, and there were a lot of tears from this point on from the both of us. 

Apparently he made her feel safe, as he had a good job with a high income, and that he gave her what I couldn't and that was expensive romantic meals in restaurants, getaways in four star hotels (here was when I found out that when she had to go on weekend 'work trips' it was actually her going to a hotel with him). She felt free when she was with him, whereas with me she felt that she was trapped. She told me that marriage was such a permanent thing and that she wasn't keen on marrying me in the first place, that because her parents and friends liked me she felt pressured into doing it and that her affair was her way of escaping it. 

She told me she still loves me and that she still wants to be with me. She said the affair wasn't my fault in the slightest, it was a result of her marrying too early and not experiencing relationships with others before she committed herself to me. She said that she would end the affair and would try to make amends with me. 

I wasn't totally sure whether she was telling the truth and that she would end the affair so I told her I would forgive her and we would try to go back to where we were if I was there when she ended it with her colleague in person so I knew she'd definitely done it. 

She agreed and we are now set to try and get our marriage back on track. It will take time, it may never be the same after she betrayed my trust but we love eachother (at least I do) and we want to fix this.

She has set up a 'date' for Sunday evening at our house, telling her colleague that the kids are at my parents house (this is true, they will be) and that I am out of town for the night. In reality, I will be there and my wife will end it with him. 

I'd just like to say thank you so much Reddit for helping me, the answers I received were extremely helpful and I don't know how I would have lasted this without your advice. 

***TL;DR:*** My wife has apologised, she will end the affair and we will attempt to get our marriage back on track.

**EDIT:** After browsing these comments, I can see the risks associated with the plans me and my wife had made. After all, what is to stop her cheating again? She could potentially side with him and make secret plans with him and backstab me when he comes around. Thank you for the advice, alarm bells are beginning to ring. Even though I still love my wife deeply, there's nothing to suggest she will be trustworthy with me. I have decided to do the following:

* Insist she quits her job. If she truly wants to end the affair, surely she will have no qualms about doing this. She is intelligent, she has a great resume and has good qualifications - I'm positive she'll be able to get a new job of equal pay. 

* Invite my friend over at the same time as when we meet her colleague, just to ensure nothing will go wrong. I've informed him of my situation and he has agreed to come around. We're not violent people, and despite the hate I feel for this guy, I wouldn't resort to violence upon meeting him knowing the consequences.

If she uneasy about either of these, this may suggest she plans on continuing the affair. If so, I may have to admit my marriage is over. I'm not looking out for me, I'm looking out for my kids. They are the ones who will suffer the most from this, not me, and I have decided that I'd rather end this marriage sooner rather than later.

1360189671.0,192,self.relationships,180yhb,UPDATE: Should I Sleep With Someone Else? M[24] F[24],sigularSex,243,51,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/180yhb/update_should_i_sleep_with_someone_else_m24_f24/,"[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rka36/should_i_sleep_with_someone_else/)


So I probably should have updated everyone a lot sooner than this.

So here it goes:

No I did not sleep with someone else, also I am no longer seeing her. Lets call her M to make things simple.

When I had made that post M was away on a volunteering trip, where she got to teach English to children in India. She was gone for 3 months and came back in early May. Once she was back things were really good, and I was planning on proposing to her in December, because our dating anniversary was on the 30th of December. 

Well the shit hit the fan quickly. By mid-July we were fighting all the time over every little thing. We were spending less time with each other every week. Things were looking very bad.

We finally sat down and, I pretty much asked her what her problem was, and why she became all crazy. She then told me she cheated on me in India. I was devastated and never thought that she should do something like that to Us.

So, after that, I told her I needed some time, and after a week or so I asked her if she wanted to make this work. She said that she did. So we sat down again and talked out some other issues that we had. So now we were talking our issues out and, when we got into fights we would resolve them. 

Unfortunately, things still weren't getting better. I couldn't trust her and we were still growing further apart. So finally, we both said to each other that this isn't working. I said that I just didn't know what to do anymore. She suggested that we try therapy.

So we went to therapy, and it really helped. I was starting to trust her more, and our therapist used a method that was really effective, and it allowed us to start to solve our issues on our own outside therapy.

We started therapy the first week of August. Now in my story we are in mid-September. So while things were better, we still had issues. I was preparing to leave for therapy and M calls me and said we need to talk. So we meet up at a park in between us, and she tells me that she doesn't want to do this anymore. She doesn't want to keep going to therapy and she doesn't want to have to work this hard to keep us together.

So we broke up. It sucked a lot, it felt like we threw away the past 4 years.  But we tried and it didn't work out. 

After a few weeks M contacts me, and from then on we would chat a little here and there, but it was clear that our relationship was over and she didn't want to completely loose contact with me. 

Here is the fucked up part:

Then in the second week of October M tells me she is going to visit a ""friend"" in Australia. Guess what. It's the guy she cheated on me with. (Indian guy, lives in Australia). So I called her some nasty names, and she went to Australia.

She comes back to the States mid November, and shes engaged. 

She left on Monday to go to India to get married to this guy.

I saw her for the first time since we broke up, and probably the last time ever, last week. Mostly to see her mom, and pick up a bunch of my stuff she had. I told her that I wasn't ok with what she did to me, and that I'm not ok with what she is doing, and this will probably be the last time that we see each other. 

And that brings us to today. It's a crazy story. Sorry this wasn't the post you were expecting.

Also I have had sex with someone since then, it was meh. You were all right.

1367439416.0,191,self.relationships,1di4t6,"My fiancé [23M] absolutely refuses to let me [23F] work out, and it's threatening to end our relationship.",Diplococci,244,53,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1di4t6/my_fiancé_23m_absolutely_refuses_to_let_me_23f/,"Hey wonderful people of /r/relationships, throwaway account here.  I've been long-time subscriber, and I really need your insight.  I apologize in advance for the extremely long post.

My fiancé [23M] and I [23F] have been together for four years, and we've been engaged for a little over two months.  We attended the same university, and we're now currently living about 3 hours apart while I'm in my clinical rotations.  For the most part, we’re perfect for each other.  I’m extremely extroverted, and he’s a pretty quiet guy.  He balances my crazy outgoing side out, and I help him be a little more social.  He really is the sweetest guy, and the thought of losing him is truly unbearable.

Anyway, here’s the story:

I'm a 5'3"" Asian American girl who weighs 140 pounds.  I definitely don't have a typical Asian body.  I've got big bones, I'm really curvy, and I wear a D cup.  I'm not skinny, but I'm not big.  However, I've always grown up being extremely aware of my size.  My mother grew up in Asia where EVERYBODY is tiny.  My entire life, I've had to deal with her saying very blunt things to me like, ""You're so much bigger than me"" and ""Wow, I can't believe you weigh 140 pounds because I'm only 105.""  Whenever I visit relatives, they've always pointed out that I'm the biggest girl in the entire family, and they even call me ""chubby one.""  It's brought me to the verge of tears so many times, and I have awfully low self-esteem because of all this.  Before I move on, though, I do want to say that my mom and relatives don't realize what they're saying is mean.  They grew up in a country where it's okay to be that blunt, and they don't understand that saying things like that can be detrimental to one's mental health.

During the summer of 2011, I decided to take action.  I started working out everyday.  I started off doing Jillian Michaels's 30 Day Shred, and eventually got into Zumba, step aerobics, and biking.  And I LOVED it.  It became something I looked forward to doing everyday.  After three months, I had lost 15 pounds and toned up quite a bit.  I felt amazing about myself, and for the first time ever, my self-esteem was so high that it felt like I was floating on clouds.  My life seemed to improve drastically, as well.  I slept better, ate better, and studied better.  It felt great being so healthy!

But my boyfriend (who was working in a different city), who I thought would be my biggest supporter, was 100% against me working out from the start.  He could never tell me why, other than, ""I can't explain it, but I just don't like you doing it.""  At first, I thought he was just being a little dramatic, but over time, I realized he was serious.  That whole summer was miserable for us.  We had never really been long-distance, and he hated the fact that he couldn't control whether I worked out or not.  We fought and fought and fought.  He kept saying that I needed to ignore what my mom and relatives were saying because I was beautiful the way that I was.  Sounds romantic, right?  But when I explained to him that I was so happy with my new body, he'd say, ""But you're too skinny now.  You looked way better with some meat on you.""  It completely crushed me.  I had worked so hard and was so proud of my new body.  Why would someone who loved me so much not support that?

Once fall semester started again and he moved back to the same city, I stopped working out.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I was so tired of fighting with him over something so silly.  Once in awhile, I'd bring up that I'd like to work out, and the whole big fight would happen again.  I even tried compromising by saying I would only work out a few times a week instead of everyday, but he'd say that even working out one day was over his maximum allowance.  I started getting so frustrated that I began arguing that it was my body and that I should be allowed to do what I want with it.  He would just respond, “If you loved me, then you’d stop.  But if not, then fine.  We’re done.”  But I just couldn’t let our relationship end.  Not because of something like this.

When 2012 started, I acquired a crazy infection in my arm that took months to fight off.  I was on many different antibiotics and corticosteroids, and I was always so tired and sick.  Over that semester, I eventually gained all of the weight back.  Down my self-esteem went.  Once I was healthy again, I wanted to get back in shape so badly.  Not just because I wanted to get that awesome body back, but because it felt so good to be healthy!  But I didn’t mention it for fear of losing my boyfriend.

Now it’s May of 2013.  And we’ve had a great year.  I was ecstatic when he proposed, because I really do think he’s the perfect guy for me.  My parents love him, and his parents love me.  Because we’ve been together for so long, it almost feels like we’re already married.  Our lives are so intertwined that I can’t picture being without him.  My clinicals are done in a month, and I hope to have a job in the same city that he’s in.  We’ve been talking about moving in together, and we’ve already started planning the wedding.  Everything about my life has been so perfect lately.  But I still can’t help but want to get back into shape.

Last night when we were video-chatting, I mentioned that I’ve been so happy with everything lately, except for my self-esteem.  I told him I really missed working out, and he immediately went cold and turned into the stranger I don’t know.  He said, “I’m sorry for making you so completely miserable.  You should start looking into getting your own apartment.”  And he hung up on me.  I haven’t been able to get in touch with him since.

/r/relationships, what do I do?!  Why is he so against me working out?  Is there anything I can do, or are we done for?  Feel free to ask me any questions because it’s such a long messed up story that I’m sure I forgot some details.

 Also, here are a few parts that are important, but I didn’t know where to put them.

* He’s not in great shape, either.  His family is larger, and there’s a history of diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, and heart problems.  Being in the medical field, I’ve expressed my concern about this to him.  Recently, he began exercising everyday and has a goal to lose 40 pounds.  He says he’s not doing it for him, but he’s doing it for me.
* He’s my second relationship, but I’m his first everything.  Kiss, girlfriend, sex, everything.  He’s never dated anyone before.
* He also has low self-esteem.  I’m the first girl who ever showed interest in him, and he thinks it’s because he’s ugly and weird.  I tell him everyday that I think he’s handsome and amazing, but he just doesn’t believe it.
* I haven’t always been a perfect girlfriend.  We got off to a bad start because I couldn’t let go of my first boyfriend.  Then I made a huge mistake and cheated on him.  I know I know, you don't have to tell me.  It was a really scummy thing to do.  It’s been one of the biggest regrets of my life.
* Because I’ve been so crappy in the past, I’ve tried my hardest to be the best girlfriend, including doing things for him that I absolutely didn’t want to do.  Like getting my nipples and hood pierced for him and doing things in the bedroom way outside of my comfort zone.

**TL;DR: I’m an average-sized Asian girl whose mother and relatives made extremely conscious about her body growing up.  Started working out in 2011, lost weight, felt amazing.  Boyfriend (now fiancé) says he doesn’t know why he's so against it, but he doesn't want me working out at all.  I just don’t understand it, and it’s threatened to end our relationship multiple times.  Please, help me.**

**Edit:** I knew you guys would have good insight.  I've read every single comment, and I will take everything that you've said to heart.  Someone asked me what I would say if another girl posted this, and I said:

&gt; That being said, if another girl posted this, I'd tell her that she should stand up for herself and do what she wants to make her happy. It's her body, not his. If he really loved her, he would think she was beautiful no matter what.

About two months back was a chat between her and her ex that was rather sexually explicit, and I'm absolutely devastated.

 When confronted, she initially tried to shift blame, but eventually apologized. She said that it was stupid and childish and she was just seeking attention. I have a feeling this wasn't an isolated incident, but she denies that it goes any further or that it was also a physical thing.

 What really kills me is that I'd brought up pretty much this exact thing as a source of insecurity for me, and she'd repeatedly assured me that while she did talk to her ex she no longer had feelings for him, and I feel as though she's been lying to me this whole time. I really want to forgive her and move on, but I'm not sure I can. I still love her to death but I can't have this thought be in my mind and continue my relationship.

How do I handle this knowledge?",wishbee,234,41,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tgzsn/my_mother_is_having_an_affair_she_is_planning_on/,"First, some backstory. I'm 22, female, and in college. My mom is 52, and my dad just turned 60. I have one younger sister who is 17. My parents are still married, but they have never loved each other. That is no exaggeration. I don't have a single memory of them being happy together, but I have endless memories of them screaming at each other and fighting constantly. In fact, one of my earliest memories is of my mother throwing my father's things out onto the lawn as she screamed at him about kicking him out of the house.

For the longest time, I didn't understand why they were even still together, why they hadn't just gotten divorced at any point. It was clear to me that Mom wasn't happy with Dad, but she was always a lot happier away from him. We'd often hang out with her best friend, Jim. I sometimes suspected her of cheating on my father with Jim. My mother would always make me lie to my father about what we did and who she was with. Since I grew up this way, it became ""normal"" for me, and I didn't really start to question it until I was close to leaving for college. Once I moved away, it became clear to me how fucked up all of it was. I went through therapy, and that helped a lot, but the whole situation still bothers me and I know I still have issues. 

My father never made me do anything like that. I think that he's always loved my mother, but she has never loved him. He has always gotten her really lovely presents on her birthday, Christmas, Mother's Day, etc. He puts a lot of thought into it. For example, since my mom loves horses, he's getting her a nice painting of a horse for Mother's Day. He works two jobs to provide for us. My mom quit her job when I was little so that she could stay at home with me. Now, she has a side job, but it's still my dad's money that pays for the house and all of the nice things we've gotten to do, like vacations and all that. I'm not saying he's a perfect husband. I don't even know what sort of husband he'd be like with a woman who actually loves him.

Needless to say, family vacations and things like that have never been fun for us. We all just fight and argue and it's miserable. My sister and mother get along the best out of all of us. I'm not that close to my dad, but I know he loves me a lot and does so much for me. My sister doesn't get along well with my dad. I used to fight a lot with my mom; now, we just don't talk much. I could never imagine moving back home. Every time I'm home, even if it's only for a weekend, I feel terribly sad. My sister and I are really close, and we get along great, but that's all I've got when I'm there. 

As I was growing up, I never wanted to get married. My mother would often say things like, ""You should wear black to your wedding, because it's basically your funeral!"" As a growing young girl, this really affected me. I was close to my mom until I turned 14 or 15, and that's when things got rough between us and we started fighting a lot. As I mentioned, now, we don't talk much. It's the easiest way to avoid fighting with her.

About a year ago, during an emotional phone conversation, my mom admitted to me that she's having an affair with a man she dated in highschool, whom she reconnected with via facebook (of course). I tried to be supportive and tell her that she could talk to me about it, because, well, she's my mom, and she was crying. I didn't know what to do. I asked her why she hadn't just left dad, and why she ever even married him in the first place.

She never left my dad because she couldn't support herself financially. She didn't go to college. She only married my dad because my grandfather threatened to disown her if she didn't. While she didn't say this next part directly, I have a very strong feeling that the only reason they got married was because she was pregnant with me. I did the math and I know that she was already pregnant when they wed.

She told me that she plans on leaving my father after my sister graduates high school. At the time, that was two years away. Now, it's just one year away.

Living with this knowledge -- the affair, the fact that she's leaving him, the fact that she has NEVER loved him and only married him because she was afraid of losing her family if she didn't -- has been harder than I could've imagined. I wish more than anything that I didn't know. We haven't spoken of the affair since then, although she does mention his name occasionally.

I once logged onto her email account and read some emails, because I was hurt and furious and wanted to know the full truth. I found out that she has had MULTIPLE affairs throughout the course of their marriage.

For a while, I was incredibly angry with my mother for all of this. We went a few months without speaking much, if at all. I've avoided going home even more than I'd avoided it in the past.

I'm not worried about my mom. She's obviously happy with this new guy. I'm not worried about my sister. She's strong and smart and she can handle it. The person I'm worried about is my father.

He doesn't have any friends. He might have a few co-workers that he gets along with, but he never does much of anything outside of working. Never goes and plays golf, never goes and has drinks with his buddies, never does anything like that. He works and comes home, sleeps, and works again. He doesn't even really have a hobby. He plays the bass guitar sometimes, and when he was much younger, he was in a band, but that's it. He's sort of introverted and doesn't seem very friendly when you first meet him, but he's a wonderful man underneath that. 

What is he going to do when my mom leaves him and he's completely alone? He's not even close with his side of the family. He really only keeps in contact with his mother, who lives 8 hours away and is beginning to show early signs of dementia, I think, or maybe she's just getting old. Last Christmas, she was staying at our house, and she woke up one morning and didn't know who my dad was. She recovered and was totally normal later. That's one of the few times I've seen my dad cry.

I can't even talk to him without thinking about all of this stuff. I've started avoiding his phone calls, which I know isn't good, but the knowledge that I'm carrying is torture. Sometimes, I hate my mom for all of this. I wish she'd never told me, because knowing what's coming is like watching a clock ticking down to a bomb going off, and there's absolutely nothing I can do to stop it.

It makes me feel so sad. I know I'll be able to handle their divorce, but will he? I feel so shitty and powerless and I just don't know what to do, honestly.

I don't feel like I can tell him. I don't even think that would be the right thing to do. My sister still lives at home, and I don't want her to have to be in the middle of that situation. Also, to be honest, I'm terrified of my dad finding out, because of the reasons listed above.

Please, no mean comments about my mom. It goes without saying that what she's doing is wrong, and I've spent a lot of time hating her for it, but I'm trying to get over that. There's no defense for her actions. But she was in a shitty situation and she's been unhappy for over twenty years. We are all human and flawed.

**tl;dr** My mom is leaving my dad in a year. I'm worried about my dad, who has no friends and no one to turn to when it happens. This knowledge is making me completely miserable, and I feel like it will only get worse as the time approaches. Reddit, is there anything I can do?

I'm just going to start typing and I'm sorry if it gets too long winded but I'll tell it as it went down.

**Wednesday Night**
After posting my original story here, my wife comes home that night and she hands me all the divorce documents, signed, dated, everything. Neither of us has moved out of the house yet so basically I am sleeping downstairs on the couch. I was a bit shell shocked when she actually signed the papers, but ok, whatever. She said was going to file them first thing in the morning so I said fine.  

While I was resting on the couch, she started texting me from upstairs. She was telling me how it was my fault for us getting to where we are, and basically everything that I did wrong, and did not keep my word and such. I tried not to say too much for fear of setting her off, but then she started comparing my love of her to my love for my family. I told her I that I loved her and my family equally, as you are both my family, but love for wife is different than love for parents. Just a different type of love, IMO. She didn't accept that answer, texted me another couple paragraphs and she stormed out of the house and did not return till after midnight. 

**Thursday Afternoon/Night**
In the morning, I asked her if she was going to file, because if not, I would. She responded ,""unlike you, I actually do what I say.""  OK, Enough said. I came home from work and saw her 
car in the garage earlier than usual.  I was scared to go upstairs into my home office because of what I knew would be waiting there for me on my desk. I couldn't face it, seeing, the actual stamped and filed copy. So I stayed downstairs on my couch and just stared at the ceiling. 

My wife started to text me again from upstairs. It started out with ""Just know that I still love you.""  I responded, ""I don't believe it."" Simply because I feel that if she truly loved me, I would not have been put through all this verbal abuse and such.  I did express that to her in another reply text and OF COURSE, her response was , ""If you loved me, you wouldn't have made me apologize to your family against my will."" So, Basically circles...each party thinks they have the right and valid argument. 

Not wanting to piss her off even more, because she warned me and said ""you don't want me to get hostile to you, do you?""  I said, ok, No more replies. I'll STFU.  Then she started to text me, ""let's just be happy for our last days together.""  In addition to that, she was texting me about how it's fine, she's ok with it, its better for the both of us, we will get over it soon..blah blah blah.  

A few moments later, she comes downstairs to find me on the couch. Brings me a snack and drink and we went outside to have a chat. She was SUPER NICE and SUUUUUPER SWEET. Saying stuff like lets just be happy. She was smiling and grinning (Not sure if front). She says ""I know you have a bad back and it must hurt sleeping on the couch. You can come upstairs and sleep on the bed and we can watch our favorite shows together."" Basically inviting me to sleep in our room.  I declined and told her, as much as I would like to, it would only make things harder for me because at the end of the day, it is not going to mean anything.  She told me should would be out by the end of the week (house is owned by my family trust so there will be no division of property here and I cannot be the one to move out). I told her, just take your time to get your situation straightened out. I will buy another bed and sleep on it temporarily. 

She goes back upstairs and So I go back on my couch. She texts me again. Telling me how I did not deliver on my part but she did. (after the apology it took her about 12 months to regain trust back in my family again, but she did not have to do anything. She just had to ""show up"" with me and just chat, say hi, or simple social stuff). So she used this against me to say that she did her part and I didn't. So the ""divorce"" was basically a result of my actions. And her anger was a result of my lack of communication skills over and over.

She did finally admit some fault tho. She said it was her fault for NOT walking out at the time I said he had to apologize to my family. She said she should have left me back then but because she loved me so much, she did it anyway. (I feel that she did it, but resented the fact that she did, and has been making me pay for it ever since.)  She said it was typical of me to think negative like that of her.

She then came back downstairs sat with me on the couch.  I started to tell her again that I don't believe she loved me, EVER. I told her she was just in love with ""being in love."" I told her how her anger issues got me to where I am. I told her I felt abused and that I read about abuse and what it is. She said of course I am looking for it I will see it that way and see her in that negative light.  I told her she needed to take responsibility for her anger and stop blaming it on me and holding that resentment inside and letting it turn bitter.  She said her anger came from me. So, it was circles again.

Btw, this was the first time we ever sat down and just ""talked"" without her screaming at me, calling me names, and getting worked up. I asked if I could say something. I told her I couldn't live in fear anymore and worry about her moods on a daily basis.  I told her It WAS MY FAULT for not bridging the gap correct between my family and spouse.  I told her I assumed she saw my folks the way I did through my eyes BUT made the wrong assumption and did not work the communication correctly between the two parties.  I did say, Even though I made a mistake, I am human and I wish to take the steps to correct it and do better.  I said I wanted to learn HOW TO bridge the gap properly but you never gave me a chance to do it.  It was like this for me, every time I wanted to speak to her about my family or teach her something, She was in a good mood, I was scared that by me bringing up my family, that good mood would turn into a bad mood, so I would only bring up issues DURING our fights, which NOW, I know is never a good thing because she wasn't listening anymore.  In addition, her screaming scares me and makes me nervous and I end up spurting out bits and pieces of what I REALLY want to say and it comes out all wrong and not really what I meant to say.

She told me, *WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ALL THESE THINGS BEFORE?""  I said because I couldn't because I was scared your mood would change. When she is in a good mood, I try to enjoy it as long as I can because they never last long so for me to bring an issue is like asking for it.  She said, had she known that this was what i was trying to do (leaning how to bridge gap), then she would have taken a different approach with me this whole time.  BUT I told her this all too late, I was late in telling her, and because of that, its too late.  So she said it was my fault, this divorce for miscommunication. I told her I want to learn but I need time and patience from you, which I felt I didn't get at the time.

Again, this was the FIRST TIME in almost 4 years that we sat down and just talked and tried to understand each other. IT HAD TO BE AFTER DIVORCE WAS FILED.  I balled as I was talking because I just couldn't hold it in. I felt that I was cheated, and viewed as someone that I am not.  What hurts me and disappoints me the most is that my wife was not able to look past these communication issues and see the TRUE person that I am. She could not see how much I REALLY love her.  I have done everything in my power above and beyond to try to give her happiness. And I feel if she loved me, she would step up and do something positive to keep us together.

She finally admitted it and said ""we both made mistakes."" BUT, what I wanted her to say was that she was wrong and sorry for treating me badly and to admit that her anger came from within. I wanted to hear her say she wanted to work on her anger and such. I owned up to my mistakes from the outset but she still feels her actions were a result of my lack of communication.

It hurts really bad right now because I do really love her and I have given her everything. It would have been easier if she screamed at me and stormed out. Now that she is being very nice and sweet, it is just reminding me of the good days that we have. 

**TL;DR**  Wife actually filed for divorce. We are still living under the same roof maybe for the next week or two and she is being very nice and sweet to me. Is she trying to make me feel guilty? or regret? After divorce, we actually had a civil conversation. The fact that she is not being mean to me right now only makes it HARDER for me with sticking to divorce.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_pjht3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pjht3/update_1_my_wife_tested_me_i_failed_and_now/,

So i called her up and told her that i was through with her and i wasn't going to let her use me anymore. It was a hard phone call and the next couple of days questioning everything was also pretty rough but i'm ok with it all now. About a day after the phone call i sent her a big long heartfelt message in which i just wrote down all of my feelings about how she could go from telling me she loved me one day to fucking another guy the next. Venting really helped to relax me and give me some sort of closure.

I found out the day after this (from the same friend as original post) that she had been sharing this message around her friends (guys and girls) laughing about how much of a ""faggot"" i was. This made me so angry! I have never been a violent person in any way at all, but after hearing what one guy was saying to her about me i fantasied about beating the shit out of him. I am glad i don't have to ever see him because i'm not sure i could restrain myself if i did see him.

I'm now glad that i am no longer in a relationship with her because this new side of her i have now seen is not a nice one.

Thanks for everyone's thoughts on the original post :)

TL;DR: Told her we were finished, she continued to fuck me over, i'm glad to have her out of my life.

1368290452.0,191,self.relationships,1e4v4a,My girlfriend (32F) of five years is considering breaking up w/me because I (29M) suddenly want to use a condom to avoid pregnancy.,OuchWTFLife,295,104,321,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e4v4a/my_girlfriend_32f_of_five_years_is_considering/,"My girlfriend and I have been using birth control exclusively as a means of contraception for the past five years, but now I want to additionally use a condom because:

1) I don't want a child. I've communicated this to her over the course of the relationship but conceded that I'd possibly be open to the idea in a decade (i.e., when I'm nearly in my 40s)--if it felt right.

2) This is what really sparked the change: Her girlfriends, most of whom are around her age, are engaged and/or have a child on the way via misuse of the pill, and my girlfriend has indicated that, if by some freak accident, she managed to get pregnant, at her age she'd certainly keep the baby.

3) I don't trust her, and she knows it. The relationship is in repair mode due to past misbehaviors on both our parts, but, while I have changed radically--undergoing intensive therapy--she has not.

My girlfriend has a history of dishonesty and shady behavior, so I fear that, if we keep on our current path--i.e., sleeping together without a condom--she will at some point slip up and get pregnant ""by accident."" Then, once she's good and pregnant and I'm pissed off, everyone will be like, ""Well, what did you think would happen? Should've wrapped it up, bruh!""

So, my girlfriend is now pissed at me because she claims sex with a condom isn't nearly as good as without one. That's pretty much it. The conversation we had last night went as follows:

Me: ""I'm sorry, honey, but I don't want a kid. Period. You using the pill while I use a condom is the safest way to avoid that. Outside that, I'd gladly do whatever it takes to satisfy you."" 

Her: ""But the pill is full-proof. It works. I've been taking it for over 15 years without a scare.""

Me: ""Well, you're long due for a scare by my account. I don't want to risk it.""

Her: ""I'm not going to get pregnant.""

Me: ""I don't want to risk it.""

So on and so forth.

She says that, if I begin using condoms, she MAY discontinue use of the pill. From the sound of it, she'd at the very least not take it as regularly, thus obviously fucking with its efficacy. I tell her that a condom used by itself is even less effective than the pill. She doesn't care--says that maybe getting off the pill would make sex with a condom more enjoyable, to which I respond ""See, now you're missing the point--that is, to not have a kid.""

So, for all that, I have to ask--am I being unreasonable? (I don't think so.) Is her anger justified? If she loves me, wouldn't she try to work out the relationship, even if it means we use condoms henceforth? Could my decision to use condoms henceforth really be deemed a relationship-terminating ""offense"" to a sane person?


TL;DR
After five years of condom-less sex with my girlfriend, I now want to use a condom for fear that she'll ""accidentally"" get pregnant. My girlfriend is pissed.



Edit: I'm somewhat surprised that I have been largely demonized within this post. It's amazing how many redditors turned the matter onto its head, assigning to me intentions that I have not possessed, saying that I have been stringing my girlfriend along, and otherwise attempting to shame me for supposedly robbing some poor thirty-something girl of her fertile years, when nothing of the sort is happening and she stays of her own volition. (Apparently, and this isn't something to which I typically pay attention, I've been downvoted through the floor, too.) My communication about my desire to not have children anytime soon has been only too clear. Every discussion of separation due to the child issue has been met by her with anger and the reassurance that she doesn't even know that she wants children; it's just that she doesn't like the idea of me closing the books on the possibility altogether.

For all that, I'm amazed by how rapidly most redditors have placed the blame squarely upon me and made me out to be some kind of monster. That's fucking nuts.

**TL;DR: Caught fiancee cheating on me with a married man for the last 3 years.
she left and took the dog and her essentials.
Shes acts angry at me and i got dumped because i caught her.
I gave the husband an option to come clean with his wife first, he didnt, i tried but got no response, shouldnt of told him.
For some reason i really want her back, she dont want me, i miss my dog. I dont know whats wrong with me or why i want her so bad when i know its wrong. Anyone have a job and a place to live far away from the east coast?..**

   I ended up finding the wife's name with help from a friendly redditor.
 calling the husband first to give him a chance and come clean to her first.(not sure why i did this.)

  I told him shes going to know either way but she could hear it from her first before i told her. 
 I told him id call him the next day around the same time.
 
When i did he said he doesn't need to tell her anything and if i talk to her he would kill me. ( i have no intentions of taking that as a real threat)
I face booked his wife after but didnt get a response.
I figured he deleted it so i face booked her again while i knew he would be at work a few days later but still no reply


As far as me and my ex go. Its fucked up and really weird.
Forsome reason i cant stop thinking about her, and i want her back so bad, I feel like i could somehow forgive her for this.
Everything was so perfect before i found this out, and i just want my life  and dog back. 

I contacted her a few days after because i really just wanted to see my dog, I coudnt even say goodbye to her before she took her.

So she was going to let me take her for the weekend but when she was on her way over she said shes just coming alone. It was weird, we cried together alot and she got angry alot, she trys to justify why she did this.

Shes taking this alot better than i am. I know it will never work again but it kills me that im the one chasing her. If she was chasing me or even wanted me back i think id feel better. im so embarrsed about this whole situation, I dont want to leave my house, i told a few close family members and i regret doing it

I barley have left my house since, i havent slept or eaten in days
I know im not handling this the right way and i shouldnt want her back but i cant help it. It feels like that now she is honest i can finally trust her

I dont want my life to change and i dont want to lose what i had.
Id rather be stepped on then left all alone

 Being with her made me a extreme introvert over the last few years, and i dont even know how to act around my friends if i ever did start hanging with them again.

Its weird not seeing her car here when i pull up and its weird going to sleep alone and waking up alone. I haven't done this for over 7 years.

the electricity is in her name and is getting shut off the 18th.
Im not sure what im going to do.i cant afford to live here but i can not live on someones couch again.( i couch surfed from when i was 15-18)
i posted an ad for a roommate, which would be the ideal situation other than the face im stuck in her hometown around her family which dominate all of the bars around here

Sorry for the formatting ill try and fix everything later.
I guess its time to go to /r/breakups. I use to read that sub alot feeling bad for everyone, and use to make me feel so grateful for what i had with her.

Also if anyone lives on a farm and wants someone to work there for room and board let me know! I would love to get out of this state for a while.

May 7, 2012. That's the day all of this begin, the day my life completely changed. For those of you who may not remember:

**TL;DR of previous original post and subsequent updates**: Our relationship (9 years) and marriage (almost 4 years) crumbled overnight as soon as he returned from a combat zone deployment. An initial PTSD meltdown began a journey of discovery into what my life *really* was; the lies, the infidelities, the mental illness, the alcohol abuse, etc. My last post was five months ago, so I figured it was about time for an update. This is going to end up longer than I intend it to, so I offer preemptive apologies.

I'll also update about our daughter [7]. 

OK, here we go...


Over the course of the last eight months, ""Jr."", as I'll now be referring to him, has just about completely cut off contact with my daughter and I. I couldn't care less that this man doesn't want to talk to me. Most conversations we've had in the last year have ended up with him yelling at me for one reason or another, more often than not, how I'm some kind of gold digger for not dropping a request for a ***small*** amount of allimony. Remember, this man left my daughter and me in another state, refused to let us move back home, and told me to, ""Figure it out.""

Jr. recently got orders to go overseas again, this time to a less hostile zone, but still on the other side of the world. He told me he got his orders in November. I finally told my daughter three days ago after realizing he was never going to have a conversation with her about it. He's leaving in April. He's really been pushing to finalize this divorce before he leaves (my assumption is because, once the decree is filed, it wouldn't be able to be amended until he returns 2 years from now. Oh, and as soon as he gets there, his paycheck will double, so he can keep the child support as low as possible).

I'm not money hungry. I'm **definitely** not looking for a reason to prolong this divorce. I agreed to sign as long as the terms we've been living with over the last 8 months stay the same. I'm pretty sure he's trying to marry the neighbor he initially left me for, as the BAH he receives for my daughter and I will only go down a little if he still has a legal dependent. She doesn't work. She's 37.

Jr.'s contact with our daughter has been inconsistent at best, and fucking infuriating for me. Jr. decided to drive to town with his girlfriend to his mother's house a few days before Christmas. My daughter just happened to be there because I had to work. He never told me he was coming, and didn't give his parents' more than a few hours notice either. He showed up, the crack whore wouldn't come in the house, he talked with my beautiful daughter for ten minutes, handed her a twenty dollar bill, and left.

I never heard a thing from him.

In fact, the only time I've heard from him over the last four months was when he thought he could take advantage of my happiness and manipulate me into agreeing to sign a divorce decree that had ZERO custody arrangements/support arrangements. What a guy.

Jr. has cut contact with just about all his family, save for his stepdad, the only one who will still let him scream about me. He cut contact because his family won't shun me. He refuses to directly talk to his mother now. Its really sad. He tells everyone I cheated on him while he was deployed. I stopped being severely damaged by this about three months ago. I've been slowly healing from all this shit, but its only been relatively recently that I can finally say I've moved on from it all.

I'm pretty confident his gf, that I will from now on refer to as, ""Tuna,"" has had A LOT to do with him isolating and alienating himself from everyone he knows. Or knew. I have no respect for the slag, and she adds to my contempt for him if I think about it for more than five minutes. 

How can I say this, be *this* sure that my negative feelings toward Tuna aren't misplaced? I met her. Again.

Let me rewind. In October, Jr. and Tuna drove through here on their way to the next duty station, and stopped at his mom's for a few days. He wanted to take our daughter and spend time with her. At this point, he hadn't seen her since February. I thought it was more important for her to have one-on-one time with him. He didn't. So, I did what any sensible mother would do; I firmly shook the hand of the woman that helped destroy my family. With a smile and I'm-currently-skull-fucking-you-in-my-mind-with-my-power-eye contact. She was EXTREMELY passive, i.e., a coward. I told her how wonderful my daughter was and how much she missed her father. I told her that despite how awkward this situation was, everyone involve *would* be adult about it around my daughter. I told Tuna and Jr. to enjoy themselves and nearly skipped out the door. I almost threw up afterward, but sometimes faking strength makes you stronger. I felt good about it.

Unfortunately for my daughter, her father's interest in maintaining a relationship with her is just non-existent. She's been having very serious health issues lately, and the docs have been tossing around the C word. Right before the winter break, she was hospitalized for a week. It was serious. She had a plethora of illnesses, including strep throat, pneumonia, ear infections, impetigo, etc. Her immune system is really struggling to protect her. One doc said her body is acting like she's severely allergic to something, so referred her to an allergist. Because Jr. refused to make a change to her medical insurance (which would come at NO cost to him), her referral was denied. 

He never called while she was in the hospital. He never called after she got out. The first time he called since she was released (Dec 19, 2012) was yesterday. 


My daughter is really starting to exhibit anger towards her father. I don't **ever** begin or encourage daddy bashing sessions. I listen, and validate her feelings, while trying to remain a neutral confident where her dad is concerned. She doesn't talk about him much anymore. I'm just hoping my neutral position regarding her father will prevent her from idolizing him. That fucker doesn't deserve a second thought from my precious, innocent angel.

As for me? Things are pretty wonderful. That man I started seeing as a rebound? Yeah, turns out he was made for me, and I him. ***This*** is how a relationship is supposed to *feel*. I'm happy, finally. It isn't all rainbow cum and hi-dad soup, but its better than any other romantic relationship I've ever had, and the feelings I get in my gut when the three of us (him, me and my daughter) spend time together... its a kind of paradise without ever having to leave home.

All in all, I'm moving in a productive direction. I know I've probably left *something* out, so feel free to AMA! 

***TL;DR:*** He's still with the haggard street-sweeping vaginal hood. I'm still a little bitter, but only because I had to relive everything in order to remember, so I could update for YOU fine people :) He has virtually no relationship with my daughter, shuns his family for talking to me, and seems like he is getting worse. I love my daughter, I love myself, I love this man I've found in a sea of boys. Slow and steady, I think I **can**.

We met at college and are actually still in college.  While dating we have always had a great relationship but recently have had sexual problems.

Well, she is a bit of a ""squirter"" and the other day I was performing oral and she actually squirted pretty much all over me.  Instead of being embarrassed or anything she just laughed at me.  I shrugged it off and laughed at myself a little too.  But this was a sign of things to come.

About a week ago we were in bed and she told me she wanted to try and mix things up and that she wanted her butt licked.  I was kind of turned off by the idea but did it anyway.

Well last night I see a few of her friends and they start laughing at me about how my girlfriend can even get me to lick and kiss her b-hole and how whipped I am.

I am completely mortified about this blatant lack privacy.  To tell all her friends about what we do in the bedroom really weirds me out.  When I tried to talk to her about she just laughs it off and says ""well it's true isn't it.""

What really gets me upset is that apparently she has been ""bragging"" to her friends about how I constantly perform oral and other things now for her and that she doesn't have to reciprocate because she thinks it's gross.  So a serious issue I am having, she is laughing about and bragging to her friends.

So now this disrespect in the bedroom is carrying over into other areas of our relationship and I feel like I am losing my footing and as a result, losing my relationship.  I am pretty hurt to be honest about us right now but need to know if there is anyway to get back to the way things were and not increasingly lose my footing in the relationship.

Thanks to everyone who offered advice. I would especially like to thank those who reassured me that I had done nothing wrong. It's funny, I immediately felt guilty when my friend told me how he felt. I don't really know why I felt that way. I've never felt that way towards him and I didn't know that he thought so little of my marriage.

I told my husband soon after and he seemed sympathetic towards me rather than angry at our friend. I was glad because I had considered not telling him for fear that he would be upset. He was very understanding when I told him that I felt very naive about the whole thing. It's been a few days and he hasn't mentioned it again.

I haven't even heard from the friend since the evening of a million text messages. The last text came hours after the others and was very blunt, closing with ""let's get it on before you leave"". The death knell for any hope that we could stay friends.

tl;dr :: Told husband about friend being a creeper. We shan't see him again anytime soon.

Also, in case anyone finds themselves in the position of my friend I would like to offer advice from my perspective. I understand the want to be open and honest but assess your friendship. If you let your feelings known to someone in a committed relationship, you seriously risk ruining your friendship. I enjoy being loyal to my husband and that's why I married him. As an outsider, this friend of mine never stood a chance.

I'm not sure how to do this so please correct me if I am doing this wrong!

**EDIT 2** - I do want to mention that my ages and relationship length are correct. His are different due to him trying to keep me from recognizing it. 

Browsing around the subreddit on another sleepless night I came across a post that mirrored my own relationship. Save some differences, it was just too eerie. While I respect my SO’s privacy, I just had to know if it was him. Sure enough. Now, while a couple of things bother me about his post (I plan to link it later after reading the advice here and talking with him about it) what hurt the most was reading his take on the relationship and just how much it differs from my own. It’s funny how two people can be in the same relationship and experience the same things and have such a different take on events.

My SO and I have been together for about 3 ½ years and living together pretty much the entire time. I was recently divorced and had a nice home. He was in between renting and buying his own place so staying with me made sense. Even after his home was purchased he still stayed with me. We had a wonderful and passionate relationship for the first year or so. While his post touched on different things such as finances and household chores, delving into that would make for a monster wall of text so I’m just going to stick to the biggest problem in his mind.

First, a little back story. Neither of us have kids in the plans for quite some time if ever. Having as much sex as we did we had to find a better option for birth control. He (as many men do) was very pouty about condoms and I was very wishy washy about the pill. I had been on Depo Provera before in my teens and loved it so I went back on the shot. But, as strong hormonal birth control can do, this kills the sex drive. Very quickly. This was coupled with a few health issues such as kidney stones and a heart issue that required surgery. Needless to say I was just not up for sex. While my SO understood in the beginning, I know that it quickly grew to be a huge problem for him. After many fights he suggested seeing a sex therapist. I loved the idea. I missed my sex drive and was eager to regain it. I had stopped taking the Depo shot (who needs it if you’re not having sex right?) a few months earlier and at the advice the therapist I changed to the non hormonal IUD option. He also suggested that I have my hormones checked. Those results showed a huge imbalance of progesterone. It was no wonder I can't get a lady boner. He referred me to a compound pharmacist who now has me on a cocktail of hormones and supplements to jump start my libido. 

Sounds like progress right? Not to my SO. He’s been very impatient with this. I don’t fully blame him. It’s been a long time. But to me it seemed like he expected me to take my first dose of the hormone and I would be right as rain. I’m only about 2 weeks in and he seems so upset that things haven’t changed. I’m frustrated because I know he’s upset. I’m upset because it doesn’t seem like he’s acknowledged the fact that I’m TRYING. I’m doing everything I can to make this better. I’ve read the self help books, I changed the birth control, I’ve been seeing the therapist, I’ve been taking the hormones. I just can’t seem to get it across to him that as a woman, libido isn’t a light switch. I can’t just get in the mood often. He’s taken this as a hit to his ego and that I must not love him as much. I am beating my brains out to try to convince him that I love him more than ever and I’m just as frustrated. I know it’s hurting the relationship. I know its pushing him away. I’m so damn scared that my inability to keep him sexually happy is going to push him into someone else’s bed.  

So here is where I ask for advice. What else can I do to convince this man that I’m head over heels in love with him? I find him so attractive in many different ways. But despite me telling him this, he only wants to believe it if we are fucking like teenagers. I am doing everything I can think to do, mentally and physically. BUT I JUST CAN’T GET IT UP.  Help.

TL;DR - no lady boners for me despite trying. SO just doesn’t seem to understand.

Need advice. ,ZoeyRene,241,53,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uzcwx/12_year_old_sister_is_having_lesbian_kissy_time/,"Sister 12 years old. Me 16.

My sister is going though the typical 6th grade 'scene kid' phase. She is a little chubby and is trying to fit in with anyone she can. She is overly hormonal for her age, I have never seen anyone get as crazy as she does during her 'time of month.'

Some things that have raised concern: her getting caught smoking our parents cigarette butts, her anger towards my family, her immediate change in style once she entered middle school, how she treats and talks to her friends/family. 

I realize most of this is normal teenage behavior but in this case it is to the extreme. It's gotten to the point where having a normal conversation is almost impossible. She is always giving a terrible attitude and being extremely rude to everyone she comes in contact with. My mom and I have tried to talk to her on several occasions but no one can get threw to her. 

Out of curiosity, my friend and I looked though some of her Facebook messages. She left her account logged in, so it wasn't like we were entirely snooping. But anyway, her 'best friend' who she calls Mommy has always given me a weird vibe and I can tell she is a bad influence on my sister. I looked at those messages and I think I am scared for life. Here are A FEW of the disturbing things they said to each other, mind you their both 12 and in 6th grade. 

-talking about having a 3 sum in my basement 
-having kissy time
-'I'm wet wet pussy ready'
-are you bi? We should hook up?
-asking if she's on her period, so they can 'do it'
-talking about their other friend (who is also in 6th grade) who is supposedly pregnant but had a miscarriage. Yet talks in detail about her sex life. 
-calling each other 'babe' and 'sexy'
-complimenting each other endlessly on how good they were
-talking about smoking weed together, then having 'kissy time'

Honestly, I am just concerned these girls are making decisions they are going to regret in the future. If they are going though a little phase, so be it. If they are actually lesbian, so be it and I will support her 100%. I have nothing against same gender relationships and I don't want anyone to be offended by this post. I simply do not know what to think of it. Is it normal for kids to be acting like this now-a-days? How should I go about approaching her on this topic, if at all? 

Tl;dr. Sister is talking to bad influence friends inappropriately and having 'kissy time' in the basement of our house. Don't know what to think. 

By the way this is my first post. 

Edit: I am a 16 year old female, sorry for not specifying earlier.

Thank you guys so much for the advice. You've cleared up my thoughts entirely. I've decided I am going to show my mom the messages and the comments on this post and see what she has to say about it. I am hoping it will open up her mind to counseling or a doctors visit to talk about hormonal imbalance.

We got married 10 months ago, been together a total of 8 years.

Yesterday he left his emails open and I found many, many emails to and from 18-20yr old girls, asking to meetup and chatting about sex. He gave a few of them our cross-streets and instructions what to wear. These messages go back years, and are sent back and forth many times a day. 

I looked in his bag, found a throwaway phone. Texts from girls, asking about our address, about our home renovation (!) and of course sex and how much they love him. 

I confronted him. He says most of it was ""fantasy"" but he did meet one girl since we have been married. He said her texts about how she loved having sex with him was ""fantasy"". Says she never was in our home... He just met her on the corner to give her rent money and talk because she ""needed help"".

I feel like that is bullshit. Why did she use past tense about the sex (2 times) then? Why is he paying her?

I go to a top 3 engineering program so the distance didn't make my studies any easier. We have been through a lot of things in our time together that have made us very strong in our relationship. I am now finishing up a year I took off from school for co-ops for Intel for 6 months and now 7 months for another big tech company close to where my gf lives. 
Long story short, we took a trip  to visit her parents abroad and got engaged. We went back to our home state and decided to tell my parents who I already knew wouldn't take the news too well since they want me to finish school. Since her parents can't travel to the US, we can't get married in the US but with my impending move back to finish my last semester in college and my subsequent job offers in California and Boston starting January, we decided to get married in another country  this summer; more long distance in the face of uncertainty was not an option any more. 
We talked to 2 different lawyers and 2 different priests who advised us on how to proceed with our decision. Having talked about it extensively, we decided we were ready and told my parents yesterday during dinner. When we broke the news to them my dad just kept eating while looking down at his food and my mom looked expressionlessly at my dad. There were no hugs, no smiles, no congratulations, just me and my fiance holding hands and holding back the tears. My dad, after questioning me harshly about the intentions and timing, stormed off the restaurant without saying good-bye (My response was that we did not want more long distance, specially since we are ready and eager to form a family).

Today I received many texts of my father furiously emphasizing that we needed to talk and how I was not to be addressed as an adult because I did not deserve it. He blames me for putting her above his demands, saying that doing so makes me less of a man.

Some background details: 

* We are Catholic so we'd prefer to be married by the church before moving in together. 

* Also, my parents are very strict and traditional.

* My mom has always been overprotective and hyper critical of others.

* My SO is a wonderful woman who works with special needs kids, is cheery and very intelligent. All my siblings adore her and her previous relationship with my parents was solid. 

* We are both financially independent with ample savings, great credit,  and belongings.

* Everyone in her family is very happy and supportive.

I realize the details are sparse but my SO is really suffering because of this and doesn't feel accepted by my family. This, in turn, burdens my heart beyond what my command of language can express. If you have any advice please help. 

Thanks in advanced.

Store time before the question... Maybe I can make a tl;dr


My girlfriend and I recently moved in together as of July 2012. We have been together on and off for about 3.5 years with a 4 month break that started because she wasn't sure about us anymore and she wanted to find out what she wanted, not to mention I wasn't taking very good care of myself at the time. I took this as a wakeup call and used my time to work out, eat healthier, and saving up to move out.


I won her back after the break, and she was happy to be with me, and I was ecstatic to have her back. I love her more than anything and can't imagine being without her. 


Right after we got back together, her best guy friend, lets call him Ed, who won't stop giving her shit for getting back together with me. He constantly tells her to break up with me and to fuck his best friend. Shes fine talking to him all the time about things like this and how she thinks other guys are hot, even after moving in with me. She hasn't cheated on me as far as I know, but I am getting fed up with it. I snapped and told Ed to stop telling her to fuck his best friend, and to leave our relationship alone, what happens doesn't need any outside help and that she would figure out if shes happy and wants to be with me on her own. He responded with a ""I know whats best for her brah"" type of bullshit assuming he knows everything about her.


I only found out about this because I went to check facebook last night and realized she was logged in, with a message asking her if she would fuck his friend.  She still considers this guy her best guy friend and is always super happy to see him and talk to him even though he constantly berates me and tells her she should break up with me for my own good. She is also telling all her friends that she wants to move out, and is looking for new places to live. 


This pisses me off since I have been almost fully paying for the rent while she goes to school, not to mention telling her she doesn't need to get another job (she only works maybe 20 hours a week at 10$/hr).


Other things she has been doing recently: Went out with a ""hot"" guy to the bar just because he wouldn't stop bothering her. She doesn't have an answer to this when I told her she should have told him to **** off. She also constantly goes to see her other guy friend with all kinds of issues at the drop of a hat, and refuses to answer my texts or calls in a timely manner when I am sitting at the house wondering where she is... She constantly dodges questions about what she was doing, and its like pulling teeth trying to find out fully what happened. She also does not want me going to the bar she always goes too because ""it would be weird.""

We had a talk about it last night, and she has no idea if she wants to be with me anymore or if she wants to live with me.... She apparently loves me, but it doesn't seem to me like she wants to work on the relationship. I love this girl and want to be with her, but not if she is going to be unhappy...


All because I accidentally saw a facebook message. I know it was wrong to read it, but the eye wanders and whats read has been read. 


Anyways, I wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar situation? How did it end? Also, am I to blame for any of this? I just can't believe whats happening and all my thoughts in my head...


tl;dr
My girlfriend moved in together and she hangs out with guy friends all the time and doesn't really seem into our relationship. I love her and want to be with her, but I am at a loss as to what to do... Is she in the wrong?

EDIT

UPDATE*******

So we had a long talk about everything and I said I was unhappy. She has to move back in with her mom (who is getting evicted in the spring) and has to find somewhere to live and get a better job while being a full time student while I get a pretty shnazzy apartment all to myself! I doubt she'll change her ways anytime soon, but I don't care! Glad I posted this, I think I would have let it run me into the ground had I not posted this. I feel like shit but know it will get better once I find my own balance again. 

Thanks Reddit!

We met at the office when we were our early twenties, dated for 1 1/2 years and then got married. Like any couple we have had a few ups and downs, but generally things have been very good. She is loving, supportive, and completely dedicated to me, and I feel the same way towards her. 

Here's the issue: About a year ago I went back to school for an executive degree. I met a lot of friendly people from a wide range of ages (from 19 to 40) since some of our classes are with younger, first-time-in-college students. In one case I was assigned to a long-term group project with two guys and a girl. This girl (23F) is incredible. Basically, if you had asked me before I met my wife to describe my perfect girl I would have described this one exactly. We clicked immediately and perfectly. She is funny, smart, gorgeous, and we have an amazing chemistry when we talk and work. I can't stop thinking about her and am incredibly happy every time we're together. It would be the dream situation for when you're single, but it's a horrible one when you're already married.

Now, even though we are both clearly ""into"" each other, nothing has or will happen here - that's not the issue. I have been clear about the fact I'm married right from the get-go and she has always been respectful of that and never crossed any boundaries. I have no intention of leaving my wife or cheating on her or anything like that, and as such am doing my best to limit my interactions with this girl. I've been telling myself that these strong emotions I constantly feel for her are just infatuation, or that I'm feeling this way in part simply because it's something ""new"" (basically I'm just repeating the advice I have read online for other people in similar circumstances). I've also re-doubled my efforts in my marriage (another common piece of advice), making a point to take time to really talk with my wife every day, spend quality time with her, take trips together and go on ""romantic"" dates. We enjoy our time together and she constantly tells me how happy she is and how much she loves me, and I (honestly) tell her the same. 

Despite the time and efforts, however, the other girl continues to dominate much of my thoughts. It's been nearly a year, and instead of the infatuation subsiding, it's gotten deeper and more intense, to the point where I'm honestly starting to feel like it is something more serious than infatuation. Next to my wife, this girl is the most wonderful and amazing person I have ever met, and when I'm not around her I keep thinking about her. Limiting my interactions with this girl hasn't helped, nor have my recent efforts to keep our conversations solely on school-related topics. Our group work is almost over, but there are still another two years in the program where we will have at least two classes together every semester, and will therefore be around each other, so this issue isn't necessarily going away anytime soon. While I don't think I've done anything out-and-out wrong, because I've never encouraged the situation, I still feel guilty for having these continuing thoughts no matter how much I try not to.

So I suppose the advice/input I am looking for is: have other married people been in this situation, where you were in a healthy, happy marriage but had strong ongoing feelings for someone else? If so, how did you deal with it, and when/how did those feelings finally go away (or do they)?

I'm 22 years of age, she's 21.

We became Facebook official shortly after New Years. The relationship itself has been over a month. I've known her longer than that, since I met her last semester in one of my required humanities classes. We talked, clicked despite all odds, and I kissed a girl (her) for the first time on New Years. 

What I don't understand is why she's with me. I'm a loser, my life consists of classes, lab reports, and playing League of Legends with other STEM majors. I go to the odd party, but that's not very often. I took up lifting because the school gym is free, but believe me when I say that I'm not fit, just not fat.

She's a sorority girl. Popular, ridiculously hot, blonde, etc. If she posts one thing on Facebook, you can bet she'll get 17+ likes. Has a handful of suitors that would date her if she gave them a shot. Most of these guys are copies of Ryan Gosling/Chris Pine/Ryan Reynolds. In other words, they are better than I am.

It was revealed on V-day night that I was insecure as hell. She dropped the ""I love you"" bomb on me, and I didn't know how to respond. Long story short, she was NOT happy, accusing me of using her for sex. I haven't talked to her since. My best friend told me to let her call first, and I'm taking his advice because, unlike me, he's quite successful with women. And so, I spent yesterday playing LoL in an attempt to ignore this situation.

I've gotten no love for 22 years, so it's new to me. The very fact that a girl, let alone an attractive one is interested in me is a foreign concept. Plus, when you have a girl that's bombarded with better options, it just makes me extremely paranoid that she'll cheat and I wind up bitter, angry, and sad.

My husband (27) and I have been married for a year, and we have a baby together. 


The dog he has had for 2 or 3 years now. It is not house trained. Not at all. It pees and shits almost exclusively indoors. We just bought a house which I put a lot of money into. He promised he would train him or otherwise come up with a solution for the dog. This never happened. 

The floor is wood and now permanently reeks of piss. I have tried to train him myself a number of times (I have had two other dogs myself) But I don't know this dog is just untrainable. 


My husband never walks him. In the past year, it literally hasn't happened. I started walking him for a while but I just don't have the time. I'm sure it would help his pissing problem at least a little. 


My big problem is I try to talk to him about this, and he gets super offended. As if I'm talking about him or insulting him. Where the fuck does he get this from? It always turns into him ignoring me and having a horrible attitude and then finally OMG HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HIM THAT WAY ITS SO RUDE. He literally doesn't understand that I am just bringing up a problem in our marriage. 


At best he goes, ok I'll start walking him. And never does it. He gets again offended or something when I suggest him being an outdoor dog. It's like he likes living in a house covered in piss and shit and massive amounts of dog hair. 


At worst, I've been on the verge of just opening the door and letting that thing fucking go. God. I hate this dog. 


My question is not really about what to do with the dog, but rather how the fuck do I talk to my hard headed overly defensive husband about this without him taking it so personally? it literally has nothing to do with him. I don't even think he likes the dog that much. He says he does, but he never plays with him or walks him or takes him to the dog park. I do those things with him, and I wish we didn't even have him! 


Help!? what is going on here? 


**tldr;** husband's dog is not potty trained. He takes any comment about the dog personally and gets mad. Nothing ever changes. How do I get through to him?



EDIT: Edit to add that the dog has a doggy door, and knows how to use it. He will go outside all day to look around and hang out but come back in to piss on the floor. Wtf!! So it's not like he is trapped inside all day and thats the only place he can go.

So, after the incredibly insightful and helpful number of comments I received, I called my SO over to discuss it.

I admitted immediately to breaching his trust, and apologized. I admitted I was very concerned with what I read, and what he seemed to think was the quality of my character. I told him which specific entries I had read, and what they said.

I am not a very emotional person, nor prone to ""freak outs"" or crying, but I started crying and asked him why I didn't know any of these thoughts. I apologized again for  the serious breach of his privacy. He said that was the least of his concerns right now, and asked me to elaborate on my thoughts on the entries.

I told him I was hurt mostly because I had no idea these ideas were in his head. I told him he did absolutely nothing wrong with writing these things: this is what a journal is for, and it was my mistake alone to have read them. That being said, in the future it is important that he takes a secondary step to releasing these negative thoughts: sharing them with me.

Communication on his end seems to be a serious issue, apparently stemming from extreme insecurities. He says he is scared that I will leave him if he confronts me on issues involving my behavior or personality. He ""doesn't want to lose me"".

I did my best to assure him that we're we ever to break up, it would never be for him speaking his mind. Conclusion: he doesn't feel safe yet sharing negative aspects of our relationship, fearing losing me. We agreed on more consistent communication and discovering new ways for him to approach me about issues.


Tl;dr approached boyfriend and confessed. Agreed to open communication and discuss issues more frequently. 

Thank you so much for all the help from everyone. I really appreciate the insight and lack of hasty judgement, as I always do on this subreddit. Thank you again.

I am male, 33 years old, my fiancee is two months older than me.  We have been together about 5 years.  I went away to attend an out of state funeral and when I came back saw some lingerie on the floor that she had not worn for me for quite some time, investigated, eventually found proof positive and sparked a confession from her.  She says that she felt disassociated during the actual physical act.  She swears up and down that he kissed her once in October and then they had the one night in late January and that is the totality of their physicality.  Phone records show hundreds of texts and daily calls from about May of last year, all stopped dead once it came out.  She is terrified of losing her job which she loves.  I am trying to strip out all identifying information, but I will say we do not live in Texas and the student is 18 so while the secret coming out would explode her career, there are no legal ramifications.  


My fiancee is brilliant, sweet, caring: a joy to all who know her.  She is held in extremely high regard at her school as, barring this mistake, she ought to be.  


We have agreed to fight for our relationship.  I was strong at first, but as the months have gone on I have weakened.  She cannot cut off contact, she still teaches this kid!  And that has started to eat me up inside.  I am consumed by suspicion.  Those months of phone calls certainly constitute an emotional affair and I was utterly oblivious, how can I know now that she is not still deceiving me?  She admits to still having feelings for him, but says she will never act on them again.  There was a school trip she chaperoned recently, in the pictures they are always standing together.  

So my stance vacillates depending on how I am feeling.  When I think she is being true to me I feel like an utter prick due to my paranoia and accusations of continuing malfeasance, when said paranoia has the upper hand I want to throw her out of the house.  How the hell can I trust again?  If she is telling the truth (and in my saner moments I do believe that) then my outbursts are the height of injustice...now that she is NOT cheating she is being punished for it whereas when she WAS cheating all she got from me was kisses and flowers.  This woman is worth heartache.  

We are going to a therapist tomorrow afternoon.  Beyond the ""run of the mill"" emotional devastation of an affair I am living with the burden of bearing a terrible secret.  She says the affair was all about her issues and not about me or us, she says there is nothing in our relationship that led her to stray.  I can't believe that, I feel that if she could give me something to address I would feel better with a tangible goal.  And even if she is telling the plain truth and nothing was dissatisfying her before, well now I am an insecure mess, which can't be close to attractive.  I am scared she is only staying to keep me from telling.  I am scared I am going to get drunk and burn her life down with an email to the school listserv.  I feel that even this anonymous posting is a betrayal.  r/Relationships please tell me happy stories of partnerships surviving infidelity.  Give me some coping mechanisms.  Help me find peace.

She is an avid tumblr user and I had known about this in the past, but what I did not know was that she kept a secret tumblr and a secret ""shop"" tumblr too. She is using this ""shop"" tumblr as an avenue to sell photos of herself in her underwear, videos of her dancing in a bikini, spanking herself, etc. On top of all that she has a section where she is selling her worn and used underwear, with additional options for length of her wearing them, whether she masturbates with them on, etc.

She has never mentioned any of this to me. She doesn't work and I had always wondered how she would get the money for new shoes, clothes, and lingerie and when I would question her about it, she either brush it off as her ""having leftover money"" or her parents giving her cash.

Honestly, I'm pretty heartbroken, because in one of her ""demonstration"" videos of her dancing, she's wearing the outfit that I had bought for her as a birthday gift.

I didn't break into her email or anything to find this secret tumblr either, just a simple googling of her current URL brought up the entire operation she has been running.

I feel crushed, humiliated, disgusted, and angry right now. Long story short, I started to get suspicious of various things that happened in our relationship, and did the rather ungraceful act of installing a keylogger on my computer. I didn't have the evidence I needed to confront her with my suspicions, and felt like accusing her without proof would lead to massive drama.

As of 2 hours ago, I know everything. I have her passwords for her email and facebook, and between the two I have a complete picture of what a deceitful, manipulative, disgusting person she is. Suffice to say that literally almost every other word out of her mouth is a lie to both me and her husband who is away for work for extended periods of time. She has also done and said some things that would make Jesus himself divorce her. I don't want to get into it because I'd rather this not be personally identifiable by anyone who might read it, but suffice to say she has stooped lower than most people would think is humanly possible...way beyond simply cheating.

The sad thing is that I felt like she was ""the one"" and was amazing in almost every aspect of a relationship you could be amazing at...besides being a decent human being apparently. I gave her my all and was always 100% honest, caring, and decent with her. I paid for at least 80% of every activity we did, took her awesome places, and generally just had a blast with her. We never fought.

So my question to reddit is: How should I end this? I guess I'm looking for people to talk me down from the ledge of insane thoughts I'm having about how best to carry out some kind of revenge (no physical harm of course). I mean I could literally burn her world down with what I know, and I'm half tempted to do it. There isn't a person alive that could tell me she doesn't deserve it if I did.

**My options:**
1) Nuclear. I send out a mass facebook message to every one of her friends letting them know she's a lying, manipulative piece of shit, and not to believe a single word that comes out of her mouth. I call her husband and tell him everything, including some of the disgusting details I've left out of this.

2) Cruise Missile. Less messy, but effective. I tell her husband everything so that at least he is not wasting his time and money on this piece of shit. He's also at risk for disease based on her behavior.

3) White Flag. Meet her in person, tell her I know everything and that she's a piece of shit, walk away.

Right now I'm leaning towards 1 or 2, with 2 the more likely based on the fact that I think he has a right to know, and I'd want to know if I was in his position.

As for me, I'm basically going to be pretty fucked up for a long time because of this, and making an appointment to get checked for STDs asap. 

**TL;DR** GF lied about being single, has been having an affair with me against my will. Her husband knows nothing. I have her email and facebook passwords. How should I end this?

**Update**
Thank you for the ongoing advice guys. I've ruled out option 1 and will almost surely be doing option 2 and leaving the rest in her husband's hands. Since I'm not a reddit newb, I will update if I can once I've decided how best to handle going about option 2.

A few additional points: My state doesn't take into account fault in divorce or alimony, so no need to think about court. I also will withhold the keylogger part since it's not really important for anyone to know. As far as providing evidence to the spouse--I have the most definitive proof imaginable, so he won't be confused even a little.

I also want to thank those talking about the psychology of this. She is clearly a very very troubled girl and based on her background it does not really surprise me. I thought she was the exception, but she's just another sad statistic.

**Re-Update**
Not posting a new thread because the resolution was anti-climactic and I also don't want her to see this since she does occasionally check reddit and I was obviously really angry when I wrote it. Basically I went with option 3 because I wanted to give her a chance to explain herself. After she did, I understood her motivations. Life isn't always simple, and people don't always make the best decisions. She was planning on leaving her husband before she met me, and it was just a matter of finding a job in another town before she could do that and support herself. Unfortunately, she decided she wanted to wait for just the right job, instead of simply doing what it took to move out and start a new life the right way.

Just an update for you guys, and an encouragement to ANYONE who is going through something similar.

Basically after that post, things dragged on for another 2-3  months or so, of me basically being a spineless bitch who believed I could never love another. At that point of time, I was a disgrace to men everywhere.

Well after 2-3 months, I finally decided, enough is enough, I've got to stop this. So I told her this was going to end. I tried all I could, and I was going to move on with life. I thought that was the end.

To my surprise (at that time), she started clinging on to me once I told her that. Now I had a very possessive female friend with whom I did not have clear boundaries. Of course, the best part was, she still didn't want to relinquish contact with her ex-boyfriend, but everytime I tried to cut off ties with her, she kept crying and begging me not to leave her.

Oh well.

I made my second mistake, giving in to her, and still being her ""good"" friend, meeting her up very often, doing favours for her, etc.

Around this point of time, she started turning VERY passive-aggressive. It would be okay for her to cancel on me last minute to meet her other friends or her ex-boyfriend, but if I cancelled on her for any reason, she would say ""It's ok."" in that tone in which you knew it was NOT okay, followed by one-word answers for the rest of the day. You know the drill, guys.

She would do a lot of other passive-aggressive things.

Now by this point, around January of this year, I had just about had enough.

In early Feb, I was overseas for 4 days on business. (Started a new job in January that I LOVED, couldn't be happier.) I even went to the extent of text messaging her when I touched down overseas to let her know I had arrived safely. International SMS.

When I got to the hotel after a long day of work, the wireless there would only let me log in on ONE device, so obvious I logged in on my laptop. My phone had no internet access, so I couldn't Whatsapp her.

After surfing reddit, sharing some videos on Facebook, she suddenly SMS'd me out of the blue, saying: ""So you have time to surf Facebook but no time to message me?""

I totally lost it. I found that she was online on Facebook, messaged her there, and let her have it. She ""yelled"" back at me virtually, you know, ALLCAPS STYLE, and after 10minutes or so of virtual arguing I gave up and logged off, and went to bed.

I got a very long Facebook message from her about 2 hours later. She apologized for what she did, and she hoped that we could stay friends.

I replied her with a message, that while short, wasn't cold, but neither was it warm. I would say it was ""business-like"".

I basically told her that I could remain friends with her, but she had to STOP with this passive-aggressive behaviour, or it wouldn't work.

She replied with multiple messages, yelling at me, saying that because she doesn't love me as a girlfriend, I'm no longer giving her time, no longer putting in effort into the relationship, etc, etc, etc.

I didn't reply to that.

I didn't contact her ever since.

Ever since that night, I finally took my life into my own hands. I've started lifting weights, started running regular, started watching my diet. I've spent more time practicing the guitar, re-establishing old friends, going out for drinks and to listen to good live music.

About a month after I started ignoring her, I returned all her stuff she had left at my place, via her sister (whom I'm still friends with).

There was a little bit of perverse joy in how happy and relieved I was to finally rid myself of all the last remaining signs of her presence in my life.

I had a revelation last month, when I met up with her sister, and her DOG, whom I missed so much. (Quick background, I used to walk her dog and play with her dog more than any member of her family, except her father.)

When her dog saw me from far away, he started sprinting towards me at high speed, and nearly bowled me over. I swear, I was so glad to see him after nearly 2 months of not playing with him.

I told my friend after that night: You know how I know I'm over &lt;Ex-gf's name&gt;? It sounds mean, but it's the truth... I miss her dog more than I miss her. Which is zero.

Thank you to everyone on Reddit for your great advice; you were all tremendously helpful. Most of you told me to continue sticking it out and continue supporting my boyfriend emotionally and financially, which is exactly what I did. I also did so with a more positive attitude after reading what a lot of you had to say.

Turns out all of you were right - since November his business has begun to pick up so quickly we barely know what to do with ourselves. On top of that, January is typically the slowest month in his industry - but this January has been his best month yet. He is now effectively earning as much as or maybe more than me. 

The shift has been so wonderful for our relationship and his self esteem. We have a really refreshed and exciting view on the future and what we can do and accomplish together. He is currently going above and beyond to contribute - I'm still covering rent and bills (which will change in Feb) but he is paying for everything in between and refusing to let me pay for anything when we go out, which is totally ok with me at this point. I've expressed to him that down the road I want it all to be totally equal and he 100% agrees, but he still feels indebted and claims that he wants to support us entirely for a while so I get to enjoy actually using my own income on myself and on buying myself some things I haven't been able to. The whole idea sounds like a welcome change. 

He even says he'd be more than happy to support both of us indefinitely and so I wouldn't even have to work if I didn't want to but... that's not going to happen. :-P

The best part is that I have had a big hand in the current success of the business and have been by his side since day one - he acknowledges this daily and is tremendously grateful. The fact that the business is ""our baby"" has added something really special to our relationship and makes us so grateful for each other and proud of what we have accomplished.

It's a really exciting time for both of us - thanks again to all of you for all your great advice!

1335645981.0,180,self.relationships,sx8df,My boyfriend is beginning to scare me,kaizersorchestra,227,47,161,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sx8df/my_boyfriend_is_beginning_to_scare_me/,"First of all, I apologize if my grammar and spelling is a bit off, English isn't my first language.

So, my boyfriend (22) and I (20) have been together for 2 years. For the first year it was an extremely long distance relationship (he's English, I'm Norwegian), but I moved to England to go to uni, only 30 minutes away from him. He has always been absolutely lovely and great, but lately things have started to get worse. I guess it all started at the beginning of our relationship, when I went to a party without him, and some guy randomly kissed me. I want to make it clear that I didn't kiss him back and only pushed him away and told him I have a boyfriend. I told my boyfriend about it and he said it wasn't my fault and it was okay, but it seems like he's changed his mind about it.

The problems started around 5 months ago. He would get suspicious of everything I did, and wanted to know everywhere I went and who I was with at all times. If I talked to guys he would have a huge go at me, bringing up how I 'was making out with some guy at a party' and he couldn't trust me being with guys. At that time I didn't think too much of it, only that he was being paranoid because he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, but I'm not so sure anymore.

Ever since it first started it's only gotten worse. He started getting mad for everything I did. He can get mad at me for not texting him back within a certain amount of time, for looking at other guys, every time he wants to have sex it seems like I have no choice, and if I ever say no to him he'll go on about how I would 'fool around with lots of guys at parties but not even have sex with my own boyfriend' until I just go with it. We've both always liked pretty rough sex, but lately even that is getting a bit out of hand, especially if I don't say yes when he first wants it. He also makes me buy him pretty much everything, because I come from a very well off family and he doesn't have a job. For example he now wants me to get him a new computer for £400, so he can play games on it with his friends.

Now, a week ago, he told me he didn't want me to go out other than for school and to see him, he doesn't want me to have any people over, and he also made me quit my dance classes because he thought there were too many guys there (there are two, one of them is the instructor). He also keeps going out all the time with his friends, which leaves me at home with nothing to do and pretty much no one to talk to, and he says I have to deal with it if I love him and want to be with him, because of 'what i've done'.

Every time I go see him now I'm scared that he is either going to break up with me over something he thinks I've done, or that he'll just take everything a step further and beat me. He is naturally very aggressive, but the only time he's hit me was when we were having and argument and I hit him first, probably a lot harder than he did. I personally don't see that as bad, because I believe that if I hit someone they have the right to hit me back. A few times he's held me up against a wall or something and told me to shut up before I piss him off more, but it's never been anything serious. He also told me that when I go back to Norway after I finish uni he wants me to delete all my friends from here from facebook and not talk to them. 

The thing is, I do love him, and I want to be with him more than anything. I just want things to go back to how they used to be. I'm not sure if it's my fault that this is happening, but all I really want is to fix things, because it's making me feel extremely depressed and unappreciated. The last thing I want is to leave him, and I'm willing to try anything to fix things between us.

1376068905.0,183,self.relationships,1k1ca5,UPDATE: My [26F] girlfriend thinks that I [29M] don't care about what she wants?,InPursuitOf,225,42,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k1ca5/update_my_26f_girlfriend_thinks_that_i_29m_dont/,"Thank you all for the replies to my [original post!](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jy3ym/my_26f_girlfriend_thinks_that_i_29m_dont_care/)... you all were very helpful and I took a lot of your advice!

Anyway last night, we had a talk. I said that it wasn't like her to have a total breakdown like that over something like furniture. She started trying to yell at me again about what I need to buy. Thanks to all of your advice, I saw through it this time and redirected her, instead of taking the bait and fighting with her about money.

I told her that I wasn't interested in talking about anything money-related, because I knew that wasn't the issue. At that point she got quiet, and then when she talked again she started crying. Not like a tear or two, but that really deep crying when someone is in serious emotional pain. It was terrible.

She started naming all the nice things that I've bought for her, all the times I've bailed her out of a jam she couldn't afford, and said that she felt terrible because she's never going to be able to reciprocate, she's never going to be able to give me the things she thinks I deserve, and we're never going to be equals, and she is never going to have any power in the relationship, because I own everything. I've never seen her as upset and hurt as she was these past two nights. It seems like this has been on her mind for a while.

When she calmed down, I explained to her that even as a teenager, I had always planned on taking care of people when I grew up. My life was carefully engineered to be this way, because I want to be in a position to help people. She's not the only person I help financially; I also give a lot to my parents and I have bailed out my brother before, too. I also pointed out that I have a strong track-record, both with her and with others - I don't play power games, I don't expect stuff in return for the gifts I give, and I make sure I'm fair to people. I'm pretty sure her fear of me holding material things over her head comes from the way her sister treats her, but that's another story entirely.

She then asked, ""Well how come you're not asking me to move in with you anymore? Is it because I can't afford to split the bills?"" I pointed out that I've asked her to move in in the past and she said no, so I was kind of just waiting for her to decide when she wants to. Then I asked her again, ""Do you want to move in?"".

So anyway, she will be moving in a couple of weeks from now, and we're both pretty excited about it! I thought a lot about what /u/HeatherEleanora and /u/Tunzie had to say on this subject, and we decided a couple of things last night:

- She will be paying rent, starting at $100 a month and possibly going up once she gets used to the increased cost of commuting from my house, etc. 

- That money will go into a bank account that I own, but won't be spent. It will be kept aside to cover her half of the cost whenever we decide we want to do something big to the house. That way it's kind a checks-and-balances system. She needs to keep the balance of that account in mind when she decides she wants something, and she also has to get me to buy in, since I own the account for her rent and I pay for the other half from my own account.

- Money for little stuff she wants to do (picture frames or whatever) will come out of her normal checking, she's not going to have a shopping list full of knick-knacks for me to go buy, she's going to pay for those herself.

- She's going to do some research to bring her up to speed on houses in general, so that we are both on the same page, and she has meaningful input when it's time to design a deck, re-do a bathroom, something like that. That way hopefully we can be partners and not roommates.

Then she asked if we can get a puppy soon. I'm going to be working 8-hour days for a while instead of my usual 12-hour days, and she's going to be living here, so now would be a good time. She's always said how she wants a chihuahua, but I want a bigger dog that doesn't run around yapping and shivering and being ugly all the time. I showed her a picture of a corgi, she loved it, I can deal with it, problem solved =)

It just so happens that there are 6 guys and 6 girls, kinda matching up the parties together.

I trust my girlfriend, I know she wouldn't betray me or do anything that would break my trust, but I can't help feel that little ""uh oh"" in the back of my head when she said, ""Yeah, we met up with a bachelor party down here, they seem chill, so we're going to hang out with them all weekend.""

Just wanted to get that off my chest.  Thanks.

Update:

I just got a call. Apparently, some guy made a move on her twice, first time, he leaned in and kissed her on the cheek, and afterwards, she moved away.  The second time, he held her hand pulled her towards him, and he kissed her on the cheek.  She then moved away again.

She then called me to tell me what happened.

We met what seems like forever ago. She and I have been living together for 4 or 5 years now, we have a home together, we have dogs, and dreams and ambitions that we share together. 2 years ago on a night I will never forget, we both had way too much to drink. That night I caught her giving a friend of mine a handjob... being drunk and naturally aggressive I freaked out. He ran like a coward and I was left alone in the home with her. We talked and she denied that it had been happening since I didn't have a good view of it but I knew something was up none the less. I am sad to admit this but I lost it. I hit her. I swore up and down I would kill them both. Needless to say the police came. I was arrested, I lost any possibility of a future. I sought alcohol treatment and took courses to better deal with stress and my anger. I honestly think it has done wonders for me. I know what I did was horrible but deep down I don't regret it. We worked through things and I felt like we made such great strides. Recently though I found out that she has had oral sex with a mutual friend's husband, and slept with 5 people over the course of our relationship.

The obvious answer is to leave, I know this. I don't want to though. I am a firm believer that a marriage is forever, and personally I believe it should start the second you ask that person to spend their life with you. We might not have the piece of paper saying we are married, but I rehearse my vows every month (we are writing our own, we are saving for the wedding in case anyone is wondering why we arent married yet)

This woman has seen me through some of the darkest moments of my life, she is the only reason I am alive, literally. She has saved me from making foolish choices countless times. I have depression issues, and anger issues, no money, nothing in my life but the hours after work when I get to come home and spend time with her. She knows this. Yet she cheats.

As bad as it sounds, I understand to a degree why she does. She said she doesn't want to leave. She wants us to work. Or at least she did before. Today I confronted her about everything I found out recently. She was with one guy as recently as yesterday. She said he is too good of a friend to cut off. I said it was him or me.

I don't even know what all to write here. I am devastated. My life revolves around the good times we have. They are literally the only good times I have had as far back as I can remember.

I can't continue to live like this though. What can I do? What should I do?

I'm a 23m dating a 21f, we've been together for going on 3 years now.

So, last night I got an email, totally out of the blue, that essentially said ""hey I felt bad and wanted you to know your GF cheated on you this last year. Once with a rando at a party and prior to that with a guy last halloween who she kept seeing.""

So my initial reaction is that this is complete BS. My GF is in a sorority, and I've heard plenty of stories about similar girly backstabbing. However, I can't help but get a little suspicious. I've always let my girlfriend do what she felt, and was never bothered by her going to frat parties with her sisters and whatnot. If she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore I assumed she wouldn't be.

In particular the mention of last Halloween was a bit off putting because that was a time when she was behaving slightly strangely.

Anywho, do you guys have any tips on how I can broach the subject with her without being accusatory while still getting the truth? To make it clear: I side against this letter and my initial thought is: BS!! but....

I've responded with a mildly suspicious tone to the sender asking for more detail, but don't expect to hear back. (edit: have heard back)I'm in the process of tracking him/**her** down with help from my buddies in the university's IT lab.

I married ""J"" a year and a half later.

The girls knew about B as their ""birth mother"" (as well as the factors that led to my divorcing her), but considered J to be their ""real mom"". J passed away suddenly two years ago, making me a single parent again.

B has had no contact with us and has played no role in our lives whatsoever for the past 12 years until last night, when my youngest daughter (now 14) handed me her cell phone and said ""someone wants to talk to you"", and it was B - asking me ""what she did that was so bad"" that it made me ""run away"".

The conversation was brief, awkward, and only served to confirm that I made the right decision to divorce B all those years ago. We had married young after she got pregnant, and I was pressured by family and friends to ""do the right thing"". I never loved her, and the marriage was miserable. It was like running a day care with someone I used to date.

On top of that, B had developed some serious psychological issues which were a key factor in my getting full custody of the girls. Having no contact with her was best for all of us.

My problem now is how to deal with my daughter. She may have put our family at risk by opening up a communication channel with this woman, and she needs to understand that. At the same time, I need to figure out how to help her deal with the issues that compelled her to contact B in the first place. 

Advice?  

**UPDATE: I sat down with her one-on-one today, and we had a very good discussion about things. She really opened up to me about what's been troubling her and what her motivations were for contacting B. Turns out that she is quite the little critical thinker. She was merely doing what J and I had always encouraged her to do: getting her own information and thinking for herself. She has no further desire to communicate with B, as she got the information she was looking for. Thank you, everyone, for helping me keep an open mind and healthy perspective. I think we're going to be all right.**

Please take time to read them. I'll do a quick, blunt recap to the present. I'm 24f. I babysit/nanny for a family for two years. The father has been dead for three years. His family lives in China and have never met the kids. (10f, 8m, 6m) The mother started drinking after he died. Her family live on the other side of the country and are not sober people either. She hides it well but three months ago gets a DUI and Child Endangerment charge. 

I take the kids while she goes to rehab. I am a high school art teacher and doing pretty damn well for myself at 24, but suddenly I have three kids. My family live 7 hours away and due to my mom's health do not travel. My boyfriend is long distance at 9 hours. Half my friends disappeared when I got the kids, a few have gotten over the situation and don't want to help anymore, and the worst have sent me messages saying I'm a MILF they would like to bend over. 

Whatever, I get through the 90 days. I'm overwhelmed but happy with the kids. Then their mom comes back and relapses twice in two and a half weeks. Last night I went and picked her up from the parenting class she got drunk before, again. I told her I was keeping the kids and not giving them back on Friday like I was supposed to. She didn't fight me. Today we had a long talk. The kids and I are staying in the house. She is moving into her sponsors house. 

I also told her I'd call the police anytime I have to, but honestly I want us to be a team and get her better. She will be seeing the kids with me every weekend. This weekend the 6 year old turns 7 so he and I made a cake today. I don't know what else to say.

The ten year old saw her mom drunk so we had a long talk about that today as well. The other two do not know at the moment.

So, any advice about addicts is appreciated. I'm in shock but I don't want this to turn into a poor me post so any stories, advice, or similar experiences is welcome. I also don't want to give the impression I'm not happy. I really love these kids and I'm very grateful I get to take care of them and keep them safe. I'm trying to give them as much love as I can.

No idea what to do.,AnotherThrowaway213,213,37,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18aydk/my_20m_girlfriend_lied_about_her_age_said_she_was/,"Hi Reddit. I honestly don't know what to do here. 

9 months ago I met a girl who told me (and everyone she knew) that she was 25. I wasn't at all put off by that but she was for a bit concerned about it because she didn't like the concept of dating a younger guy but I told her it was a bit of a double standard really because she didn't find a 20f dating a 25m unusual at all.

So we started dating after a couple of months and then into a really solid and enjoyable relationship. There was some unusual parts of it like she wanted to keep us secret for a few weeks (still hasn't let me meet her sister who she lives with although everyone else knows) and she doesn't want anyone to know we've had sex. 

Other than that it's been a very **very** happy relationship but recently I managed to get a hold of her driving licence and I saw her birthday as being in **1976**! I kept quiet about it until last Sunday where I called her and confronted her about it and she admitted to all of it.

I asked her why she lied and she kept insisting that she didn't 'technically' lie and the reason she *lied* is that when she came to this country her uncle introduced her as being 25 and nobody would believe her when she said she was 37 so she just rolled with it and it just got out of hand.

Part of me thinks ""Well age is just a number"" and nothing about her as actually changed and it was a really really happy relationship
... but another part of me is pretty pissed off that she would lie to me about something so major for so long and that I had to find out the way I did. I also wonder how the hell this will work with 17 years age difference?! 

While I'm pretty sure this wont work out but I don't know how I'd go about ending it and remain friends later on (give each other space for a while obviously) because we pretty much share the same friend circle. This is seriously the weirdest reason I've had to end a relationship.

Has anyone got any advice for me or any stories? Anything to help me process this is appreciated because its a lot to process right now...

Thanks for your time

TL;DR: Girlfriend lied. Said 25, actually 37. Don't know whether to leave or stay. Pretty sure it isn't going to work but I have no idea how to end it.


If youre wondering how the hell I didn't see she was 37. She's extremely young looking and [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/BkBwv.jpg) should explain a lot too.

**Update**
I have decided to end it. I will call her tonight and explain to her that this relationship simply cant go on with such a massive age difference. I would call her a liar but that hostility just isn't necessary. I'll end it as simply as I can. Thank you reddit!

Girlfriend here. Found my boyfriend's thread about us. He left a lot out, and everyone is only getting one side of the story (his).

He got me into reddit, and as I was thinking of our relationship, I checked out this forum... I was going to post asking for help, too, hah.

TL;DR: I'm worried my boyfriend will leave me over my debt.

It's becoming less about engagement for me, or more of what I fear about what he thinks of my debt.

Things he left out: 

He told me when we had been dating for 1 year that he'd be ready to get engaged in 2 more years.  Then slowly, it turned to 3 more years.  He told me he wanted to move in together in x amount of years, and then that also increased.  I'm now seeing that we just had poor communication.  I thought he had doubts about ME.  I thought it was something I did.  I didn't see until very recently that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.  I guess I was ready a lot sooner than him to say that.

Anyway, after feeling incredibly hurt and confused by why he changed the deadlines, I talked to him a lot about how I viewed engagement; how I saw it as an emotional thing, where I was ready for that next level of commitment.  I understood that we wouldn't get married for many years.  I figured it would be a long engagement.  I just love telling people that we're in love, that I have an awesome boyfriend who loves me, and that we're soul mates.   It's all very romantic to me to be able to say ""hey, look, I found my soul mate and he makes me so happy.""  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with wanting a ring.  I was staying under $1000 in rings that I looked at.  The ring I told him I wanted was $650.  I couldn't care less about the ring.  It's the commitment and what it symbolizes.

After all this talk, he told me two months ago that he was ready to get engaged.  He went so far as to start showing me rings he'd been looking at.  We went to stores and looked at rings together.  I thought it was something he wanted, too.  He gave me the budget of what he'd be willing to spend on a ring.

About 2 weeks ago, he took all this back and said that he was afraid of getting engaged because he'd been hurt in the past.  He said he was going to see a therapist because he had all these issues from his past relationships, and that he thought something was wrong with him for him to not be ready to commit to me.  He told me he didn't know when he'd be ready to get engaged.  I was hurt.  I thought I did something wrong.

Fast forward to now... I found his post.  Well, I now know how he feels.  He says he's committed to me and wants to spend forever with me.  That's what I needed to hear.
However, he's making money into such a big issue, and has in the past when being concerned about my debt, so I'm so scared that this will be something we don't see eye to eye on.
To me, he's perfect and I love him more than anything.  He's my dream man.  He's intelligent, hard working, funny, supports me emotionally... he does EVERYTHING he can to be a wonderful boyfriend.  I feel so incredibly lucky to have him and feel that he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

I want more than anything to work this out.

This post is exactly how I feel:
""Nooo... but then again, it kinda sounds like you are saying that you being willing to commit to her is purely based on her financial status. You say that's its not true, but if that's the only reason you can give her as to why you are not willing to be engaged, then I kinda see her issue.
I think you have a lot of good reasons for waiting to get engaged (including unstable situation, haven't lived together, too young, etc), but by making it only about the money, you are sending the message that she's not good enough until she meets your financial standards. Whether or not she wants to believe you, your actions don't meet your words, and its hard to ignore that.""

The last paragraph is EXACTLY how I feel.  It seems like to him, I'm not good enough until I meet his financial standards.

I now feel like I'm holding him back or I don't deserve him because he's making good money, and I won't for years.  I feel hurt, because now I feel like money is a huge thing for him... like, he wants to be rich, live without debt, etc.  I feel guilty that I'm not in the situation where I can contribute to our relationship in that way.  I feel bad thinking that maybe I don't deserve him because he deserves a woman who can contribute money equally to the relationship.  It's soooo out of proportion right now.

 It's not my fault I can't contribute yet.  I wish I could.  If I had things my way, we'd get married NOW (I'm ready emotionally, just not in any other PRACTICAL way, and I see that now) and be able to start our lives together.  However, I'm seeing more and more what engagement means to him and that we just disagree on that.  The fact that we're young, we haven't lived together, and we aren't in a stable situation makes complete and total sense.  We CAN'T get married right now.  There's no financial way.  I understand that. 

He's just making it seem like he will leave me if I don't get into nursing school.  I'm so frightened that he'll leave me, even while I'm trying my very best to ensure a good paying job and future for myself.
I'm also scared to death that he'll hold this debt over my head until I get it paid off.  Now I wonder how he'd handle if something unexpected happened in the future, like... what if I got cancer, and had huge medical bills?? Would he leave me then because he wants to be rich, and I would have more debt?  What if unexpected money issues come up? 

He said a year ago he wanted a pre-nup.  I thought it was unromantic at first, but now I see it as practical and something I'd TOTALLY be willing to do to prove to him that I won't make him responsible for my debt.

How can we figure out, together, how we would handle money issues together? Is it something you just figure out as you go along?  It's really hard for me to wrap my head around right now because I'm not in a career job making a large income like he is.  However, I would want to stand by him and support him no matter what.

I regret the debt I'm in.  It has been very depressing for me.  If I could do it over, I would've gone to community college for 2 years and then gone to the school I'm going to now (a state school).  I would do everything differently.  I didn't have anyone to guide me about finances when I'm young.  My parents aren't good with money, so I didn't have very good role models.  I didn't comprehend how long it'd take to pay it off, and how it'd affect having a family of my own.  I figured I'd graduate and get a good job, and that everyone lives with some sort of debt.  I see it differently now.

I didn't plan for my aunt to stop cosigning my loans for me, leaving me with no foreseeable way to finish college or pay off the debt by myself.  I would've had I been able to graduate, but she backed out at the absolute worst time.  I was going to RISD, too.  It's pretty much the best art school.  I'm incredibly passionate and hard working.  I was trying to do everything I could to ensure that I'd have a good job after I graduated.

There's nothing I can do about that now, but I feel like he's punishing me for it now.

My boyfriend went so far as to say that he thought ""what if"" I dropped out of school all together, only was able to get a minimum wage job or simply didn't get a job.  He's treating me like I'm some sort of deadbeat who won't be responsible for my debt.  I now comprehend it's weight and am absolutely working my butt off to ensure that I'll be able to pay it off.  I want to be a nurse after I graduate.  It's something I'm INCREDIBLY passionate about, and plus is a career that makes a good salary.  He says he supports me, but then he goes and thinks I'll do something completely irresponsible.  It's like he suddenly doesn't remember the driven, passionate, hard working person that I am. 

I'm hurt and insulted.  It's MY debt, and I (all caps) will pay it off.  I not for a second asked him to be so generous as to offer me to live with him rent free.  I'm feeling so guitly about that, thinking he'll resent me over it, that I've taken back everything I said, and told him that maybe we should even wait to move in together until after I have a stable nursing job.

I don't want to put my life on hold with him.  I want to be with him so badly.  So, his offer to live rent free while I pay off my debt means everything to me and I'd be so grateful.  I just don't know what that sort of thing would do to our relationship.  It'd be a lot of stress.  However, I've made a conscious decision that I'm in this relationship forever, through thick and thin, so I want to stand by him.

I want to do everything I can to pay off my debt in a reasonable way.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

I regret that I have to postpone our life together because my aunt stopped cosigning for me and I had no way to return to school until now.

I'm 25. My current girlfriend of two months [22] did not end things well with her ex-boyfriend [30] -we'll call him Jason. When we got together, she'd told me that she'd ""ended it"" with her ex, but the truth was that she just cut contact and blocked his number.

At first, Jason emailed her saying he had no hard feelings, but he needed about 10 minutes to talk and get some closure. I understood and allowed it, but when they talked on the phone, he basically insulted her for an hour. When I found out, I forbade him from contacting her, and he obliged for a little while. 

After about two weeks, he started emailing her again - because she's afraid of him, she had me read them and paraphrase for her. In each email (including the ones he sends to me), even between sentences, he alternates between 

1. praising her and unleashing torrents of insults
1. pining for her, then saying he's so happy she's out of his life
1. saying that he's done with her and moved on, then saying that he never got closure or apologies (though she tried to give him both)
4. At first, he threatened to send nude pictures of her to our friends. Now he tells her that he's sorry and that he would never do such a thing. With an ocean between us he can't touch her, but this thought chills me to the bone - he wants to shame her and ruin both our careers.

To be honest, I'm at an impasse. The last time she tried to give him what he wanted (apology and closure), it wasn't good enough for him and he only insulted and threatened her. But I'm afraid that if we keep ignoring his emails, he might deliver on those threats, or I don't know what. They were only together for 3 months, the majority of which was long distance, and I'm bothered by how manic he's acting about this. She's great and all, but wow. 

If he didn't live on another continent, I'd probably go with the tried-and-true ""smash his teeth in and delete the pictures off his computer"", but that isn't possible this time, so I'm stuck.

Me, my girlfriend, and my best friend all live pretty close by in the same neighborhood. Every once in a while when me and my girlfriend were hanging out my best friend would come over and hang out too, which isn't a problem but lately things have changed.

Throughout the past month my girlfriend has become increasingly distant. She also just got a job and we're now hanging out much less often then normal because of it (I don't have one yet myself too). Though, the past several times we have hung out my best friend is always there as well. It's usually by coincidence though, but I told my girlfriend it would be nice if we could have time together without him but she refused to hear it. She prefers it when we hang out with him.

Well this lead to a pretty big argument one night. By the next day we stopped arguing and things seemed to be ok but I started getting bad vibes. Apparently my best friend and girlfriend were texting all day, and as soon as she got off work I asked her what's up and she said she was talking to him. Well I was kinda paranoid but I sort of shrugged it off as if I was being too clingy. 

My girlfriend told me her work schedule and based on her hours literally the only day we can hang out this week is today because it's her day off. Last night though, she said she didn't want to see me today, and instead wanted to hang out with my best friend one on one without me there. She says she needs time away from me but she's going to not see me for the rest of the week anyway. I don't want her to do this and when I told her that she got very angry. Am I being to clingy or paranoid? It just doesn't make sense why being with me is starting to become such a problem. I don't know what to do, and I've gotten no sleep because it's bothered me so much

edit: We broke up

We live together in an apartment, and have discussed the possibility of marriage, buying a house, etc. in our near future. Up until today he's been a model boyfriend and honestly the man of my dreams :(

My SO has been living in another city for the last 2 months doing a training program for his work. He's expressed that he's very lonely there, he's not the most social person - he probably doesn't leave his apartment at all except for his training and to get groceries. In the last 2 weeks he's also been complaining of being sexually frustrated. He has a very high sex drive - when we're together we have sex daily, and from what I can tell he usually masturbates once or twice a day too.

We have a home computer, and most of his stuff is signed in automatically - Facebook, Gmail, Skype, etc. Well today curiosity got the better of me and I looked through a chat log with one of his best friends, and what I found has caused my world to come crashing down :(

My SO told him that he ""made a huge fucking mistake last weekend"" - he ""drank a ton of beer"" while watching baseball, then when it was over he started watching porn. In his ""horny state"", surfing different porn sites he ended up on an escort site and texted one to come over. He continued jacking off until she arrived, she gave him a blowjob for 10 minutes, he came, and she left immediately afterward. 

My SO said that he's overwhelmed with guilt and ""wants to crawl into a hole and die"". He asked the friend if he should confess his actions to me, and his friend replied ""no, not unless you want your relationship to end"". My SO said he absolutely did not want that. His friend replied ""then learn from your mistake and use your guilty feelings as motivation to be a better boyfriend when you get back"".

There were a couple other troubling things in this chat as well - apparently his work training has been going horribly and he hates it, whereas he's always told me it's been going great. He also said he's gone to sleep drunk almost every day for the last month - at home he maybe drinks once or twice a year! It's all just so not like him :( 

He doesn't know that I know yet. I don't know what to do - whether to confront him next time we talk, to wait until he's home in a few weeks and talk face to face, or just not bring it up at all and see what he does. I am so mad and hurt at what he did :( and but the thought of losing our 4 year relationship makes me feel even worse. 

Please help me :(

I really do have no one else to turn to.

I am in my early thirties and my girlfriend of two years is in her mid twenties. Things have been great, despite me having a small penis (about 4.7 inches/12cm), she never once complained about the size and was able to orgasm off of it. 

It wasn't until we let her parents stay in our very tiny studio apartment for a few months. During this period, we could not have sex with each other without it being incredibly awkward. So to get our sexual frustration out, we would masturbate in the bathroom. I using my hand, while she would use a dildo, which was significantly larger than my penis (about 6 inches/15 cm).

After her parents left, we started having sex again, but it wasn't the same. She just wouldn't orgasm. After several failed attempts, we began talking and she said that my dick, ""just wasn't enough anymore."" 

I began using my fingers and my tongue to get her off, but she said it just ""isn't the same as a real penis."" I also began using techniques I learned from pegym.com to increase my length and endurance as well as shedding weight (I'm over 250 pounds), but it just isn't happening fast enough. 

I've tried experimenting with different positions, but her favorite is taking it in doggy style positions. But my penis just isn't long enough to penetrate properly due to her having an incredibly large butt. It makes things incredibly awkward for me and I would become flaccid. 

We tried adding toys into the mix, but no go. She said that the toys just didn't have the same feeling as a real penis. 

She is incredibly frustrated with this whole situation and it really makes me feel less of a man. Sex is becoming more akin to work than anything else. All I think about during intercourse is trying to please her, but when I see the look of disappointment on her face, it just really kills the mood for me and for her.

I'm not sure if this helps or not, but she would tell me that, ""it is like having an itch deep inside her that my penis just can't reach."" She stopped using the dildo, in hopes that she would just get used to my penis again, but I catch her masturbating more and more in the bathroom ... to porn videos of men masturbating.

I am in serious need of help. I really don't think this relationship will last if things don't change. We're happy being together, but sex is such an important part of our relationship ... I'm just at a loss now. 

I really am afraid she might consider having sex with other men just to get her frustrations all out.

I married my girlfriend of one year April 2012. We moved to a new city, started going to school together, and were happy. Fast forward to March 2013 and she tells me that she wants a divorce. This completely blindsided me, I thought everything was going great. Her reason is that she doesn't like my religion and can't see a future together.

So, she packs up her things and leaves. I'm in a strange city, with almost no friends and no idea what to do with my life. I slowly start getting my life back together, going out with friends, working out, focusing on school and work. During this time, I find out that the real reason my wife left me is because she was seeing another man. At this point, I didn't care anymore. I always had my suspicions and they had been confirmed. I want to get divorced, but she hadn't started the process and neither had I, so I didn't do anything. I am still technically married.

A short while after, I meet a foreign exchange student from Turkey. We hit it off immediately and start dating. Even though she was just here for one month, I was extremely happy. We had made plans to stay together and give the long distance relationship a try. Three weeks into the relationship, my wife calls me and tells me how she broke up with her other boyfriend, how she wanted me back, etc. I flat out told her that no, I did not want to be with her. If she could please leave me alone. 

The following week, my girlfriend from Turkey is very serious. She looked angry, and when I asked her about it she says, ""Who is (wife's name)?"" I told her the truth and she got up and left. She ignored my calls, messages, even when I would see her in person she would ignore me.

Eventually I convinced her to sit down and talk. She says that the reason she is angry is not the fact that I am technically married, but the fact that I didn't tell her. She forgives me, but doesn't know if she can ever trust me again. That is the last thing she said before closing the door on me.

Later that evening, I receive a text from my wife saying, ""So what did (Turkish girlfriend) have to say?"" 

I know I should have told her I was married, I just didn't know when. What could I have done/what can I do now to save this relationship?

We met online and things got serious very fast. In the beginning everything was fine and we were in love. I moved in with him and suddenly I found myself in a huge mess. Suddenly he was nothing like the guy I fell in love with. 

This is going to be very long, but I have a lot on my chest right now.  

**Insults**

Since this is a throwaway I'll be honest and tell you  that I've had a rough childhood with violence and incest. I have been fixing my personal issues the most of my life with the help from professionals.  It has been very hard, but after the hard work I began to enjoy life and myself. It was great and I was truly happy for the first time in my life.  

 Me and my bf have been together since I was  17, and I was still seeing a therapist until I was 18 when I finally felt good about life. When we got into fights (about little things) he would get angry and say stuff like I'm sick a crazy and I should take a lot of pills. 
I got pregnant and as most women do, I gained a little weight. When he got mad he would say I am a fat cow, and stuff like that. I felt disgusting and didn't enjoy the pregnancy as much as I should. He also had something going on with a couple of girls. I know this because I got his old laptop and he forgot to delete the conversations on msn. He turned it around somehow to make me feel bad about it, and I felt that it was my fault and irrational. Frankly, I don't want to get pregnant again, because I associate pregnancy with me being unattractive, fat and unwanted. 

Before I started to study (I wasn't able to do that because of my personal issues), he would say stuff like I was stupid. 

So I worked harder with the therapist, I lost almost 30 kg, I started studying and I'm now studying physics at the university. He couldn't say hurtful things anymore.. Or so I thought.. He got mad and said ""At least MY dad didn't fuck ME!"". I was shocked. To hear that from a person that you love is beyond horrible. I couldn't say anything. It hurt. My daughter sat next to me. Luckily, she didn't understand what he was saying, but she saw how much it hurt. I ran to the bathroom and sat there for few hours.  

These are just some of the insults. It is like he is trying to find the most hurtful thing to say. I feel like every time I feel good about something, he'll just make me feel bad about something else. Every time I told him that these insults hurt me and makes me really sad, and he will say that he will never do it again. And that is what he will say every time. He will even suggest to see a professional and fix it. Next day it's like it never happened. When I tell him that it still hurts, he can't understand why. He believes that a ""sorry"" would fix it. But it won't.  

He says that everyone says hurtful things when they are angry. It's natural and nothing to be sad about. I'm just being weird. For him I'm being irrational when I tell him that they still hurt. I asked him if he really thought those things about me, and he said that he could always find something hurtful to say about me when he's angry.  

I don't like to fight or argue like that. If there is a problem I want to talk about it like adults and solve it. I don't start fights, because I don't believe that a fight will solve anything. 


**Sex**

There is a distance between us that has been growing with every insult. And now I feel like he is a stranger to me. He's not the guy I fell in love with. And when he touches me, it's uncomfortable. Sometimes he is holding me and says I have to kiss him. I don't want to. But he's holding me until I do it. It's disgusting and I feel like a piece of crap, but somehow I feel like a HAVE to do it. I don't know if it has something to do with my past. 

He doesn't do this with sex, but he will make me feel bad. ""You hate me. "" ""You think I'm disgusting."". It worked for a while, but now I just say goodnight, ignore it and go to sleep. Sometimes he will continue with making me feel bad, and at that point I just want to disappear from this world, because it is like he won't take no for an answer. 

When we do have sex, he finishes and goes to sleep. If I want to climax I have to do it by myself, and I think it's weird and I don't want to do it right there when he's ""done"". I use porn to satisfy myself. Actually, I don't want him to be a part of my sex life, because it's more enjoyable when I masturbate.  


**Me**

I would say that I'm attractive. Not because I think so, but because others have told me this. And when I'm out, I get a lot of attention from other guys. But in my opinion, I'm disgusting, fat, crazy and ugly. I can't go outside without wearing makeup. When I'm at the university and I fail at solving a problem at first try, I feel really stupid and just want to cry. 

I used to get good grades and be one of the best, but now I lack motivation. His behavior sucks the life out of me and I feel that the little things, like doing the dishes or doing my homework is like climbing a mountain. Recently I've felt that every day is a struggle, and I'm afraid that this will ruin all the hard work with the therapists. 

I almost never smile when I'm with him. It's only when he isn't around. The days when he isn't home are actually nice. I love spending time with my daughter and we always have a good time. 
I have told him that I'm not happy, and I'm afraid of what is going to happen. He tells me that it is sad for him to hear that, but the next day he can't understand that I'm still not happy. I've cried out for help so many times, but it's like my cries go right through him and I feel like he doesn't really care. All he is concerned about is our home and money. 

**Him** 

My boyfriend works a lot. And when he comes home, he's often irritated. There is a woman in the same office as him. When he talks about her, he's smiling a lot. I also know that they text outside the work. I don't know if she is the reason he works so much. Actually, I don't care. He seems happy. Good for him.  There is not much intimacy in our relationship and I think it's natural to seek for others. I don't blame him. 

Generally he's a angry person. He yells at people when they make mistakes. I think it's embarrassing and I feel bad for the people he yells at. I have tried to help him with it, but nothing works, because he doesn't think there anything wrong. 

It doesn't get physical, and he doesn't hit or anything. He has pushed me a couple of times, but it stopped once I pushed him back. It's really childish and I don't believe that violence will solve anything at all, but I'm not going to let anyone hit me again.  
He makes me feel that it's all my fault. And I'm beginning to think that it really is. I feel like I'm making a little problem huge. 


**Our daughter**

I love her more than anything else, and I just want her to be happy. I treat her like the most precious thing in the world, which she is. I know that she loves her father and if broke up with him, I know that she will be devastated. This has been going on so long, because I just want her to be happy. She's growing older and I think she is beginning to realize that something is wrong. I do not want her to grow up, learning that a boyfriend/husband is not a person you are in love with. Maybe she will end up in the same situation as I am in right now. I don't want that to happen.  I want her to be happy now, and when she's older. 
 
If me and my bf break up, I will do everything to help her through this. She knows that she can talk to me about anything, and I'm always understanding and I try to help her as much as I can, even if it's little things, because in her world, those little things are huge. I can't bear the thought of her reaction to the fact that the two people she loves the most in the world are going to break up.  


**Present** 

A few days ago I told him (again) that I don't want him to force me to kissing him. He couldn't understand what was wrong, and then he turned it to be my fault that our relationship was bad. He was quiet and irritated for a few days and then one night told me that he didn't want to be in this anymore. I was sad, but also relieved. Next day, I found that I had more energy and more motivation. I had a fantastic day with my daughter. She was also very happy. Maybe because she saw how happy I was. He came home, and acted like he didn't say that. I asked about it and he said that I misunderstood him. And he said that if I hate him so much, I could just leave. He just wants to stay and wait for me to fall in love with him. 

It's pure chaos. My exams are right around the corner and I'm stressed. I want to ignore this until it's over. After my exams I will have to do something. I can't continue like this. 

I'm afraid of what is going to happen if I leave him. I know that he will try to get our daughter on his side by talking bad about me, which he has done a couple of times. It is unfair for our daughter. She is a little child and does not deserve to be involved in this mess.   

I really hope to hear your opinion on this and maybe give me some advice. And if you think that I'm handling this the wrong way, please tell me, so I can fix this. I really don't know what to do.. 


**TL;DR** My boyfriend insults me when he's angry and makes me feel bad about it. I don't feel good about myself anymore and I don't know how to solve this problem.

1361155549.0,180,self.relationships,18q6rz,I (27/m) want to end romantic relationship with my pregnant partner (39/f) after I found out I'm not the father of the baby.,ichigoismyhomie,221,41,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18q6rz/i_27m_want_to_end_romantic_relationship_with_my/,"First of all, english is my second language so be easy on me for any grammatical/spelling errors that might be in this post.

I know the title sounds like I'm an asshole for wanting to end it with her, but let me explain a bit of background before you pass judgement on me.

I've known this girl (or should I say woman, since she's old enough to be my mom) for few years now. We used to work in a same department together and we were pretty close together. We talk about life and such, but I never consider myself to be romantically involve with her (she was just like a big sister to me). I moved to another department last year but we were still keep in touch with each other by texting.

She was always in a relationship and so was I, up until last year. I broke my engagement with a girl that I was together for almost 6 years the day before my 27th birthday (long story). I told her about it over casual text message and she told me that she also broke up with her abusive boyfriend couple weeks before. She suggested that we should hang out and talk things about our failed relationships. At this point, I still consider her as good friend, and never intended for the visit to be more than just a hang out. We hang out together in the past (snowboarding, barhopping, etc), but that was the first time I ever been to her place. Long story short, we hooked up and had sex that night (and I wore rubber).

From then on, we been regularly hooking up every other week or so throughout the summer. I was loving the arrangement because it was just purely FWB. Later on, I heard from another coworker of mine that he also was sleeping with her. So it was all good ol' adult fun time for both of us for the rest of last summer.

We were getting quite close that it's becoming weekly thing for us and I becoming more risky during sex (rubberless and pulling out, etc.) but never finish inside of her. It wasn't until around last september, she finally told me that she's pregnant. I was shocked. I felt like I just got kicked in my gut. She told me she wasn't sure who the possible father because she was still fucking her ex-boyfriend while doing me also (I never brought up the fact that I know she also slept with the other dude from work, since I also sleep around with few girls around the same time period), but she told me that she hoped the child is mine. She told me that she been wanting to have a child but her previous husband (prior to this ex-boyfriend) was sterile and she was planning to adopt a child anyway so she is planning to keep the baby. She told me that she didn't expect me to be there for the child if I din't want to.

We both have decent paying job and financially capable to raise a child so I'm not worry about the welfare of this unborn child, but I was raised to be responsible for my action, MY ACTION. I told her that if the child is mine, then I also want to be there for the baby and help support her. The only condition is that I want a legitimate paternity test to find out who's the father and I even paid for the testing.

She also agreed to keep our relationship a secret from many of our coworkers and common friends until the result is in. Due to circumstances, we have to wait until she's due for her amniocentesis (around 20 weeks gestation) then we can proceed with the paternity test. 

I've been spending time more often with her while waiting for the amnio and I actually like it. She told me that I've become her only sexual partner since she found out about the pregnancy. At one point, she even told me the ""I love you"", although I did not say it back because she was saying it in a casual way and I also don't feel that way about her.

She told me that I was so much better person than her ex because I treated her with respect, etc. and she wished that I can stick around. I told her that let's take things one day at a time. The more time I spend with her, the more I see that she's getting more attached towards me and her insecurities starting to show. 

Fast forward to couple weeks ago. I received the paternity test result in the mail and I'm NOT the father. I was relieved and perplexed at the same time.

As much as I enjoy being with her, I know I have to end the romantic relationship with her. I don't want a relationship where I can't be open about it to my friends and family. It is a major taboo in my culture (I'm from south-east asia) to have premarital child and none of my family member knows about this issue. Even for western culture standard, being in a relationship with someone who is pregnant with someone else's child seems to be quite unacceptable.

She is a great person and good friend of mine, and I don't want to end this relationship abruptly. I don't want the break up to causing emotional harm to her especially when her hormones are out of whack from pregnancy thus making her more susceptible to depression (which I know she was on antidepressant med in the past). I care about her wellbeing and the fetus, but I can't keep stringing her along any longer and making her grow more attached to me day by day.

I was going to break it off with her on Valentine's day but I couldn't bring myself to tell her since she made wonderful dinner and other stuff that show me that she loves me.

**TL;DR: I don't want to be in a secretive romantic relationship with her any more, but I don't want the break up to have long-term consequence to her or the child.**

Well...my brain tired thinking of this issue. I'm gonna go do some laundry and get hit the gym for some cardio and hopefully clear my head about this issue. I would appreciate insights from those who been in similar situation and how you dealt with it.

Edit #1: Thanks for for constructive criticisms. I know it was immature and foolish on my part for going bareback, but spare me your judgement. I asked for insights on this issue, not your judgement. I'm just a human, I made mistakes. This issue is bad enough for myself to deal and I don't your condescending judgement about not using condom. Don't comment if you just gonna judge me for my past.

1365475887.0,176,self.relationships,1byqtq,UPDATE: My mother is draining my finances and I don't know what to do. [19f],momissuesthrowaway,220,44,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1byqtq/update_my_mother_is_draining_my_finances_and_i/,"Since posting to r/relationships on Saturday, I've gone to my bank and transferred my money to a different account that my mother has no access to. 

I've also decided to move out with my boyfriend. When I confronted my mom about all of this, she initially was angry. She blamed my boyfriend, who was sitting beside me for support. He had promised to stay out of any arguments, but he spoke up and told her that he didn't want my money, didn't use me for money, but no longer cared if that's what she believed. She told me that if I truly go through with this, she will never accept my boyfriend as a part of our family. It hurt to hear, but it wouldn't be much different from how she treats him now. As I said, she's jealous of the significance I place on him. 

After that, mom told my boyfriend to leave, so he went outside. That's when she started crying, shakings her head in disbelief, and asking over and over if I was serious. She said things like ""I only pay the bills!"" and ""You waste money yourself."" and ""This money is going to ruin your life"". I was heartbroken, felt terrible, and wanted nothing more than to take it all back. But I told her that she had ruined her own life, but I wasn't going to let her or money ruin mine, and that I needed to start my own life. I told her I loved her, and to not forget how much I cared about her. She seems like she won't want to talk to me for a while. I contacted her brother's wife and told them we would need to sit down and discuss this soon, she said it was no problem, and that she's here for me. My oldest cousin is also being very supportive. This is the very abridged version.

I told her she could ask for help if she needed it. I don't mind paying for her necessities if she's actually taking significant steps to better herself. 

Her Medicaid was recently renewed, as well. So was mine, but I'm unsure if I can use it legally with my inheritance money in the bank. Does anyone know anything about situations like this? 
She's unqualified for SNAP, though. I haven't looked too deeply, but after a quick online evaluation I doubt she has too high of a chance. 

I'm currently staying with my boyfriend at his family's place, but we're looking for a place to rent. We may have found a good place, already. But we are trying to wait until we're secure in our jobs. We checked on our applications today and both our chances look great. My boyfriend has also been invited back to work for his old company.

TL;DR: I moved my money, decided to move out, and initially felt bad. But I'm hopeful things will get better from here on out. 

**I'd like to thank everyone who gave me their advice, I appreciate it more than you know. You've given me the confidence to finally make the changes I needed to make, and hopefully life will get better for me, and my mother, in the near future. Thank you for this.**

1359943621.0,174,self.relationships,17uaaj,[30M/F] My wife of 5 years had an affair while pregnant with our first child.  Am I a monster for wanting to leave?,slightlydeadinside,219,45,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17uaaj/30mf_my_wife_of_5_years_had_an_affair_while/,"My wife and I have been together since we were 17.  High school sweethearts that stayed together through a LDR in college and got married 5 years ago.  Prior to ""the incident,"" we were both completely monogamous, had never cheated on each other, and had only ever been intimate with one another.


Around the time of our wedding, there was a management change at her place of employment.  She and the new boss (about 5 years her senior) had some initial friction, but then became very close.  Some years later, promotions occurred, changes happened, and he left the company, while she got her own shot at the big chair.


The two of them stayed close, and became even better friends outside of work.  Being the supportive husband I am, I encouraged this, as she didn't have many friends at the time, and I didn't want to be *that guy* who frowned upon her friendships with other men.


Fast-forward to the last few months.


I became somewhat suspicious of her behavior, noticing that she would do things like:

* Come to bed with me, but stay up super-late using her phone
* Add lockscreen passwords to her phone
* Leave the room to take phone calls
* Find reasons to leave the house, like holiday cookie runs

Again, not wanting to be the stereotypical jealous husband, I shrugged off a lot of these things, never once doubting her faithfulness and commitment.


Then, about three weeks ago, I was looking for a return label in her email (a common occurrence), and I stumbled upon an email chain with *him*.  In the email, she expressed her love for him, and he for her, multiple times, and it was obvious that they had been having a physical, if not intimate, relationship for some time.


My heart felt like it was going to pound out of my chest.


When I could breathe again, I went to work.  My job is one in a technical field, and it requires me to travel about twice a month, for 2-4 days each time.  Prior to my next trip, I dumped all of her text messages from her phone and set up a hidden camera in the house.  You may think this was extreme, but at this point, I was just hoping that I was overreacting.


I wasn't.  From the comfort of my hotel room several hundred miles away, I had to watch their hours-long make-out sessions.  I witnessed her do things to him that she's never been willing to do for me.  There was sex, romance, and snuggling, all at the expense of my living room couch.  The texts only made it worse, and I continued to torture myself my watching and reading both until I couldn't stand it anymore.


Adding insult to injury:  At the time, she was 20 weeks pregnant with our first child.  


Since this is already too long, I'll just cut to the chase:  Three weeks ago, I confronted her, and told I knew everything.  She had a breakdown, and literally begged me on her hands and knees, sobbing, to not leave her.  We had a very emotional weekend, and talked for hours about our marriage, her relationship with him, and our future together.  I felt incredibly guilty about leaving her, even though she was in the wrong, so I decided we would do a ""trial reconciliation,"" get counseling, and try to work this out.  


Since the confrontation, we've pretty much had a dead marriage.  I can't look at her without seeing *them*, which means I can't bring myself to touch her or tell her that I love her.  She has openly admitted that she is more attracted to *him*, and that, if given the choice, she would choose to be with *him* now, because I'm essentially treating her like crap.


I believe that time heals all wounds, so I may eventually be able to forgive her, and learn to love her again.  Right now, I don't think that's possible.  I also don't know if I'll ever be able to trust her again.  I'm basically staying for our unborn son.


My question (finally, I know...) is this:  **The more I think about this, the more I want to GTFO.  Am I abandoning my son?  Should I be working harder at this?**  I feel nothing but guilt and anger over this situation, and that's left me very conflicted.


**TL;DR:**  My wife [30F] of 5 years cheated on me [30M] with her best friend [35M], while pregnant with our first child [-0.5M].

Thank you every one for your kind words and advise!
Also any one interested in buying the trip can message me. Its eight days in Punta Cana D.R. at the Secrets resort. with ALL THE UPGRADES.**



So I'm pretty confused and numb right now. I want to get the hive minds perspective on the situation. 

So me (29m) and my SO (38f) have been together for almost 4 and a half years. In December 2011 we broke up and have been circling getting back together ever since then but we never did. Mostly because I knew i was going to take a job that would have me over seas for a year or two (I'm now currently over seas). During the last year we have acted like we were together without ever making firm commitments. 

We have had some issues with our relationship in the past. I was unhappy with our sex life and she was unhappy with my pot smoking. That is pretty much it. Other than those issues we had a great relationship, with the usual ups and downs. But over all good. I still love her and pretty she she still loves me. But we are effectively very close FWB with options. We had no illusions of exclusivity. Though I never saw any one during this period I did not expect her to be the same way since we were not technically together. 

I only had one rule....
For there to be a possibility of us getting back together any sex she had with other guys needed to be safe sex.... No ifs ands or buts. 

If she had unsafe sex with another guy and was clean afterwards and did not tell me it was unsafe it would not have been an issue. Since I would not know either way I would just assume she followed the rule.

Well I got a phone call last night and she told me she was pregnant. I was the first person she called.  I have been over seas since September. And she is two months along. Soooooo she did not use protection. I have not asked her if she did as I got off the phone pretty quickly as I was pretty stunned. But I know she does not enjoy using condoms. 

She says she still wants to be with me and that she is sorry and feels horrible. She wants us to together. 

I don't know if she's saying that to keep me around for security. Or legitimately feels bad and just made a mistake. Or just scared. 

I don't know how I feel. I am angry that she had unsafe sex. But know its unreasonable to hold her to that since we were not together. I don't know if I could be a father or even want to be. 

I don't want to be used because she needs my money and security for her baby. 

On a side note I just spent seven grand on a vacation we planned to take together early march. Should I cancel or go through with it. 

I'm confused and horribly numb right now. I don't know how to feel, or how to act. 

I will be over seas until October 2014. So I don't even know if we would do a real LDR if I decided to get back with her. Or even if I could trust her while I'm away. 

I only had one rule and it was shattered. Wtf do I do. 

tl;dr
Ex got knocked up. Wants to get back together. 

Edit:
Ugggggggg......FUCK!!!! Well I have my answer. I knew it before posting this but could not really bring myself to admit it. I'm going to cut off contact with her tonight when I talk to her. 
The vacation is off, it's non refundable. Too late to find someone else to go with me and I'm not sure I want to go by myself. I'd probably just try to drink myself into a hole. :/",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1358955417.0,,,True,t3_171o58,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/171o58/my_ex_38f_just_got_pregnantnot_mine_wants_to_get/,

Genders: Me, male. Her, female. 

Length of relationship: Two years, 5 months. 

So here is the gist: I have no idea how to handle my girlfriend's family. They are kind, good hearted people that take an active interest in their daughter's life and mine. They have been extremely supportive of us both. They are fantastic people. And I have no idea how to handle this. 

Growing up, my family didn't ""do"" things. I remember a handful of times that we ate dinner together outside of Christmas and Thanksgiving, but now we don't even do that. We didn't sit around and watch TV or play board games. It was all yelling all the time. Everyone. Always. There was no understanding between my parents and my sister and I. It was just screaming. Screaming for not helping. Screaming for helping. Lots of alcohol abuse on my parents' part. My mother laughed at me when I got out of the hospital for suicidal thoughts. Just to give you an idea of my family. 

So now I have this girlfriend and we stay at her house and I see this family that asks me how my day was, and asks about what my plans are, and we eat dinner together, and I have no bloody clue as to what to do. It honestly creeps me out. 

I have no idea how to interact in this environment. I shut down. I get so uncomfortable because I'm waiting for a plate to go flying or the shouting to begin. 

I know it seems vague, but what do you do when your girlfriend's family treats you better than your own? It makes me *so* uncomfortable. Here they are being great, and all I can think of is what their ulterior motive is. It makes me feel guilty. 

I've tried to talk to my girlfriend about it. She just doesn't get it. She thinks I'm exaggerating because her family is so great. 

So what do I do? How do I get over this? 

*TL;DR:* Growing up my family wasn't the best and now I have a girlfriend with a great family and I don't know how to handle it.

We have agreed that we both need to go to therapy - though I don't know how that's going to happen because we're both poor and without health insurance. I also want to share that while this event was complete bullshit, I would like to say that this is not characteristic of our relationship. He's usually very understanding, sweet, supportive and a fun person, and I think he just got in over his head in this situation. We are a very kinky couple and experiment with new things all the time which usually go great, and this just absolutely blew up in our faces. We both agreed we're going to keep our relationship to just the two of us from now on. I'm considering showing him this thread. Should I even though we've made up and he admitted to being wrong?*

Sorry, this is kind of long.

So, my boyfriend of 8 months thinks he’s a cuckold. He’s not. However, he was very insistent on watching me have sex with another man over Skype (we’re long distance). Not my thing, I really didn’t want to do it, but he persisted it’d be the hottest thing ever, yada yada, whatever. So two or three weeks ago, I did it. Needless to say, it didn’t go well; I was overwhelmed with regret, he was overwhelmed with jealousy (he maintains he “loved the sex” but got upset over us kissing or getting into it when he wasn’t ready) – but we got over it and agreed it wouldn’t happen again, though he does bring it up a lot when he’s horny and talks about how it was the hottest thing a girl’s ever done for him. The guy I slept with is out of my life for good – he never meant anything to me. In fact, I actually always thought he was kind of a douche and unattractive, which is why I chose him.

Fast forward to last night - he invites me to drink with him over Skype, which is weird, because he barely ever drinks, and is trying to get me to stop. We pound about four or five shots in less than 15 minutes, or at least, I do… he was supposedly taking his shots off camera. Anyway, I’m feeling pretty tipsy, and he starts bringing up that night and telling me it was so hot and he wishes I’d enjoyed it because he’d love for me to do it again. I was protesting for about a half hour before he convinced me to try again. So, I text the guy, and he ends up coming over. Of course, as shit is going down, my boyfriend freaks out again, and orders the guy to leave. So he did. Then my boyfriend starts getting livid at me for all of these little things I didn’t know weren’t okay, because he never said they weren’t okay (spanking, doggy style, necking, not checking the Skype chat log frequently [he refuses to talk out loud in front of the guy]) – he said “I just want to observe while you guys do whatever you want.” I got really upset, told him he convinced me to do something I knew we both didn’t want and is trying to find things to get mad about when he was really unspecific and I did everything he asked when he asked.

When he persisted, I got really fed up and stupidly started ignoring him. All I did was go try unsuccessfully to buy some beer at the 7-Eleven, and then come back and watch Netflix in bed. After like, 30 minutes of not talking to him, I finally answered his Skype calls. I let him know what I had been doing and he didn’t believe me. I ended up getting annoyed again after he accused me of going to see the guy after he made him leave and demanded I go through my phone and texts in front of him. Thinking back, I should have, but I was pissed off and a little drunk so I refused. Then I muted my computer and proceeded to roll over and check through my phone, looking secretive about it, I guess (there was nothing bad in my phone). He flipped out – flipped the FUCK out. He broke up with me, called me a “cheating whore just like the others” (he’s been cheated on a lot in the past) and a bunch of other terrible names, told me I was the worst girlfriend he’s ever had, that he’s going to find someone new, I should go die, etc etc… I didn’t see all of these abusive texts until this morning, and I was appalled. I agree I should have been more sensitive to his needs and worked harder to reassure him, but I was completely honest about the whole thing – and I didn’t do anything behind his back.

I’ve been phone blasting him and texting him like crazy all day, and he only responded once, to answer the phone and tell me he’s still sleeping. This is not like him at all. He is usually very needy (so am I) and we’re on the phone almost all the time, and we text constantly when we’re not on the phone.

I’m very concerned. I love him, and I’m supposed to go visit him on Monday, and eventually I’m supposed to move to him and continue my schooling where he lives. The only reason I agreed to any of this cuckold stuff was to fulfill his fantasy – I don’t want anything to do with any guy but him. I don’t know what to do… I’m at a loss. I tried telling him over and over I’m sorry, I love him, nothing happened, etc… and nothing.

Someone, please… tell me what to do. Should I keep trying to contact him? Should I take him seriously? Is my relationship over?

**TL;DR: Long distance BF of 8 months wanted me to have sex with another guy while he watched over Skype, he ended up not liking it and is now accusing me of sneaking around with the guy behind his back, which I haven't been doing.

I guess I'll have to give some back story for this to make complete sense so here it goes. My parents divorced when I was nine and I went through a lot of emotional trauma involving separation and the too-early involvement of another woman on my dad's side. At the age of twelve my dad died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving my sister and I to be under the care of only my mom. My dad wasn't the best person, and even after the divorce when we spent half the time with him I felt closer to my mom because she wasn't borderline abusive and had a bitch of a wife, but that's another story. 

For the longest time I was depressed and dealing with anxiety and anger issues which strained my relationship with my mom, but I've been able to overcome that and become closer to her. However, the more I became closer to her the more I realized how unhealthy her behavior was becoming. 

I don't know if this is normal for a woman of her age, but she goes out to the bars a minimum of three times a week (Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday) and occasionally Thursdays and Sundays. The majority of the time she doesn't get completely smashed, but lately she's been getting more and more drunk while she's out. Ever since I've gotten my temps (temporary license for a teenager under the age of 16) she's had me drive her to and from the bars so that she doesn't drive while intoxicated.

Well, last night was different. 

She went out on a lunch date with a man around noon, and I didn't hear anything from her until 9:00pm. When she called she was incoherent and obviously drunk, but managed to ask me to come pick her up like usual. On my way to pick her up, I saw her drive past me on the road. I immediately did a u-turn and sped up to follow her. I had to watch as my overly intoxicated mother drove, swerving all over the road, nearly hitting cars, and I felt like I was watching my dad die all over again. 

Obviously when I got home I yelled at her, but she was too drunk to do anything but pass out. Upset, I impulsively decided to post on facebook (under her account) something along the lines of ""today I drove drunk while my daughter watched me almost hit several cars, etc."" I thought that maybe if it was public she would never, ever do it again. Well, after an hour of it being up I felt so bad that I deleted it and went to bed upset. 

This morning I woke up to my mom yelling at me, asking why I would do that, saying that she was people from work on facebook, and that she already started getting messages about it. We both took some time to cool down, and an hour later I went to talk and saw her crying about it. She feels extremely bad about it, and doesn't remember anything except going to the bar to drink because she saw her ex with a new girl at the same restaurant she went on a date. 

I don't really know what to do. I know it was extremely stupid for me to post that, hence why I deleted it. I just felt like she needed some reality check because I feel her drinking has gotten continuously more frequent.  Do you think I really put her job (she's a manager at an important communications company) on the line? Any advice on how to handle this, for both me and for her job situation?

*TL;DR: Father died, leaving only my mom in the picture. She goes to bars 3+ times a week and has me drop her off/pick her up normally. Drank her feelings away for six hours yesterday and decided to drive home intoxicated while I was following behind her. Had to watch as I almost became an orphan. Impulsively posted on her facebook about the incident, took it down an hour later, and now she's getting messages from people at work. Help?*

EDIT: I want to thank you all for your compassion and advice. You guys have made me feel loads better about this shitty situation. She has taken the day off from work and I've taken the day off from school, and we're amicably milling about the house. I'm not sure if I can bring it up yet, but I will eventually. We'll see how things are when she goes back to work tomorrow, but for now I'm content with waiting.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1366648216.0,,,True,t3_1cv7mk,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cv7mk/urgent_i_16f_impulsively_posted_something_on_my/,

I just wanted to think you all immensly for your responses to [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cdezn/my_boyfriend_is_becoming_famous_and_i_am/). 

Part of me feels though that I am giving a very biased view; and so it is hard for me to believe that it should end. But you have all spurred me into action. So I am going to talk to a friend of mine who can see a lot more than me. I am very embarassed and my bf has always told me to not talk to other people about our problems; but I am going to break it. All that swirls in my head whenever I see him is ""what happens when next time it isn't a pillow"". I am going to talk to her, and if I need to man up and leave she will tell me straight. 

I didn't read the thread for awhile because I was instantly embarassed and thought that everyone was going to call me a needy loser who needs to give her bf a break. The reaction was incredibly shocking to me; and interestingly, normally I just try and forgive these fights because ""it will get better if I don't make a big deal about it"". But it is like something snapped. I have been distant from him and have been pulling away naturally. Something about this felt especially bad, particularly because he threw the pillow at me very viciously when my head was turned and crying, apologizing.

For now I am focusing on my own life. I have set new goals and I am keeping myself busy. I am having trouble enjoying his company or even liking him right now, and so I don't really mind not seeing him. Leaving behind my surrogate family would be fucking hard, but... I feel he is getting more and more scary. I am afraid that one day it won't be a pillow. Fuck. It can't be over, fuck it. What is a reasonable amount of time to want to spend with your SO each week after 5 years? 

Also it is an international show (as in not the US) so most of you probably won't know about it ;) that is how it can have been going on for just over a month and he be on TV; its filmed semi-live.

First of all we want to thank everybody for their advice.
Since our first post we have practically talked non-stop about our relationship, how we feel, what we want or don't want and we have been very honest with each other.

While talking we realized that we have been struggling for about three years. Only the periods where it works have become shorter and shorter the last year and we both don't have the strength to make another try.

Also the problems regarding our sexlife turned out to be not as much a case of mismatched libidos but simply the lack of sexual attraction.
We asked each other how we think we will feel after the first break up-pain being gone an we both said ""freed and relieved"".

So we decided to be the good friends we already felt we are and change our facebook status to ""single"" on Valentines Day. Because one thing we will never loose is our humor.

1355259344.0,174,self.relationships,14omy5,My wife [30] of over 6 years cheated on me [27] with multiple people over the course of 6+ months.  What now?,TwitchingEyebrow,236,62,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14omy5/my_wife_30_of_over_6_years_cheated_on_me_27_with/,"I have been married for over 6 years and have a beautiful 5 year old daughter.  In October of 2011 I started noticing my wife was distracted more often and that our sex life was starting to get stagnant.  I even tried talking to her about it, but she would just say that she was tired or that she missed her family, etc.  Before we had our daughter we used to go out to bars and drink fairly often, but most of that went out the window once we became parents and I personally didn't mind because going out to bars was never really that interesting to me.

It started out with ""I want to have a girls night out"".  I willingly supported it and even encouraged it hoping it would get her out of her ""funk"" that she was going through.  Before I knew it these ""girls night out"" were happening every weekend and even during the week sometimes.  I started getting somewhat suspiscious when I started noticing that she was adding a lot of people (men) to her facebook.  After confronting her about it she assured me it was nothing and that they were just ""friends"".  One night while we were watching a movie together I noticed she was playing with her phone a lot and when I asked her who she was texting she just said ""a friend"".  After feeling really paranoid for awhile I looked at her phone when she was sleeping only to find that she was texting her friend complaining that a guy she had hung out with after the bar the other night decided he didn't want to go out with her that night because he was hanging out with his buddies.  I almost lost my mind at first, not knowing the worst was yet to come.  

After confronting her about it over the next few months I started discovering more and more guys that she was/had been hooking up with.  Ranging from making out, sexual favors, etc.  The total that I personally know about for sure (probably not accurate) is 8.  I tried for months to work things out if nothing else for the sake of my daughter, but her behavior continued and she basically used my house a hotel and continued to go out.  I went out of my way to please her and gave up anything that I didn't think she liked about me.  I honestly didn't know what to do until I finally had enough and told her we needed some time apart.  She took my daughter and went to live with her sister out of state for a few months.

Over this time I fell into the deepest depression of my life and used alcohol and prescription drugs (often mixed together) as an attempt to ease the pain.  Of course it didn't work and I severely damaged my career in the process and probably came closer to losing my life more often that I would like to admit.  

She eventually told me that since I didn't want her she was talking to some guy online and that she really liked him.  Over the course of a couple of months she told me that she missed me and wanted to come home and see me.  Little did I know she was just using that as an excuse to meet up with him and fuck him.  I finally drew the line and told her I was done.  She commenced with literally begging on her knees for me to take her back, using my daughter against me etc.  

A few months have passed and I'm currently living in a different country (military) for the next year.  She is living with my daughter at her god parents house right now and still tells me on a daily basis that she wants me back.  I'm completely over the whole situation and just want some closure, but I'm not sure how else to go about it because everytime I mention it she claims ""she's not giving up , etc"".  I'm trying to keep things civil for my daughters sake.  Advice?


TL;DR:  Wife of 6+ years cheated on me with multiple people during which I was trying as hard as possible to make things work between us.  When I gave up she begged me to take her back.







**Edit:**  Thank you for all the responses.  To fill in a little more information I know it seems as though I let things go on for a long time.  Looking back on it now of course I can see that I did.  At the time though all I wanted was to stay together as a family because I love my daughter.  I know now though that she will never be happy if the parents aren't happy.  I just want whats best for her.  

Also, I've only been out of country for a couple of months now for those that were wondering.  All of this has been going on for over a year now.  Thanks again.

**Edit 2:**  Thanks for the advice everyone.  It was good to get that out there and vent a bit as well.  I'm going to pursue a divorce as much as I'm able while I'm out of the country.  I'm still keeping things civil not as a deceit tactic, but because I honestly hope to keep things that way so we both can stay in our daughters life as equally and as much as possible.  Even after all the shit she put me through she is the mother of my child and I can at least respect that.

For those that were wondering she never really gave me a reason for doing what she did.  She was pretty wild before we were together, but a lot of that seemed to die down after we had our daughter.  I guess she just couldn't control it anymore.  For lack of a better phrase ""You can't turn a whore into a housewife"" applies here I guess.  Thanks again everyone and upvotes were handed out liberally for the great advice/words of encouragement.

1331913692.0,180,self.relationships,qzigy,UPDATE- Fiance jerks off into my clothes,threwawayayayayaya,231,51,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qzigy/update_fiance_jerks_off_into_my_clothes/,"UPDATE- http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qy5o3/i_am_disgusted_by_this_and_i_need_advice_before/

So we had a brief discussion about it last night.  I did not want to overwhelm him with all the great comments and suggestions I got from this post.  BTW He is a redditor and doesnt know i posted, i feel like he would be pissed it i ""aired our dirty laundry"" LOL.

I first off apologize for my wording from the title of the post.  I suppose the use of ""disgusted"" was an inappropriate way to describe my feelings towards his act.  I am not grossed out by his cum, him jerking off, or him in general.  I felt disgusted by the hiding it, the disrespect for my things, and the lying.  I am a very emotional person, so the use of disgust was probably exaggerated (OMG i am a girl, right? lol)

So when he came home from work last night, I first apologized for the way I reacted when I initially found my shirt.  I was pissed about it and called him a disrespectful pig, should have left out the pig part.  He accepted the apology and we began talking.

He claims that he doesnt remember using my shirt or hiding it, but since the proof was in the pudding (or closet) he said he must have hid it because he knew I would get pissed.  He also said he could have been drunk, but I dont know, he does some weird things when he is drunk and alone so it is possible.

I let him lead the conversation for the most part, but he was pretty quite about the act itself.  I began asking if it was a fetish for him to use my stuff, and he denied it.  He said it was just that ""nice things feel good on his dick"".  Made me lol pretty hard when he said it which helped lighten the mood a bit.

I believe that its probably not a fetish issue because I have never seen any other clue that he would have a fetish I didnt know about.  He is not very open sexually, but if in eight years he hasnt expressed a clothing fetish, I'd  be worried.  I think he is just a typical guy who likes to jerk it.  

As for us not being very sexual lately, I guess there were some underlying issues that the both of us just needed to say out loud.  In the past six months, he started a new job and has gotten several promotions, when he is stressed, he doesnt want sex (I think its weird, but thats how he was during finals in college too).  He has also had to deal with both of his parents going through cancer, which was also stressful.  

I have also not been happy with my work, and my family back home has been having a hard time.  We both take the weight of the world on our shoulders sometimes and hide the fact that we are hurting.  I hope our communication continues to grow from this.  A blessing in disguise to say the least.  

I would like to thank you all, for the good and the bad comments and suggestions.  I was able to try to be a bit more open minded about it, and not just jump to conclusions when confronting him.  I honestly never even thought about it being a fetish, so I appreciate you all looking at it from every angle.  Considering this way my first post and I got such great feedback, next time I need advice, I will come here!  Thank you again and I hope I will be able to help someone one day like you have helped me.

TL;DR My fiance just likes nice things on his dick.

I was mostly a weekend/holiday dad until she was 11 and her mom died in a car accident (her bf of the time was driving drunk- she was a good mom but she made a lot of poor life choices, especially when it came to men). Then I suddenly had this kid with me full time.

I love her and I try to be a good dad. But it's hard being a single dad and a lot of the time I feel like I'm failing. Work is a bitch and overtime has been my life lately, so a lot of nights I'm not home until 8. I try and give strong rules to keep her from going wild with all the free time and free house she has. 

And mostly, I thought I succeeded. She is taking an advanced placement class this year and always makes As and Bs. She plays the flute in the band. She has a couple of tight girlfriends and has never demonstrated much interest in guys. But above that, she is smart and funny and independent and a great kid to be around.

But I got home early and she wasn't there. She is supposed to tell me if she goes anywhere after school. I thought we could go to the movies or dinner since I was home reasonably early for once. So I call her and she doesn't respond. After an hour, I call her best friend's mom. She says that she hasn't seen my daughter in months?!? She was sleeping over last weekend.

I go in her room and am a little frantic. Right on her dresser, not hidden is a lighter. It looks very guyish and is a lighter. This makes me feel a little insecure in my parenting. So I open the drawer. I found a pregnancy test! And she still hasn't answered my call. 

I go on to her computer. She has fb up. Her conversations with her friends teetered between mundane, oddly intellectual, and vulgar. She is in a relationship, no guy listed. 

But her profile picture is of her with some shaggy haired kid who looks like he's in college. On other pictures of them, at the beach, someone comments ""Trevvy needs to get a fb"". She also posts a comment about how immature highschool boys are and that's why her boyfriend is nineteen and not a little kid.

Apparently they have been spending the night together, having sex (which she describes as hurting a little and being weird- if it weren't for cuddling after she wouldn't bother= that's not healthy), and he smokes pot- from conversations with her friends. She has never even mentioned him. 
 
She still hasn't called me. I'm panicking. How do I approach this? I don't think a 19 year old with his own place has any reason to date a 16 year old. But I don't think he should be a sex offender for it or even if he could with only three years between them. Also, I think her being around drugs is a stupid idea. A drug charge can ruin your whole life. I'm just freaking out.

What should I do?

tl;dr I(34m) came home early, my daughter(16f) was not home and not answering her phone. I found out she has a whole unknown life- including an older boyfriend(19m) and inappropriate behaviors- including sex and him doing pot. She hasn't been to her best friend's house in months. I found a lighter, a pregnancy test, and some revealing conversations. Where do I start?

1366478858.0,172,self.relationships,1cr130,My (27F) housemate/host (20s/30sM) in a foreign country is getting his creep on after a week - help!,TheClitortoise,229,57,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cr130/my_27f_housematehost_20s30sm_in_a_foreign_country/,"Long story, so tl;dr I've rented a room in a foreign, less-developed city for a month and am here alone with the host who started coming onto me really strong yesterday. I will be here for three more weeks. How do I manage this situation without causing bad feelings?

I'm working in a large, relatively developed city in West Africa for a month and for this first week it's been pretty tits. I'm staying on one floor of a villa in a middle-class residential neighborhood, which I rented through a woman my coworker put me in touch with. This woman and her husband live in the US and the three-floor villa is run by her husband's good friend, a single guy in his mid-20s or early 30s who lives on the first floor. I was told another American woman would be staying here at the same time, but I learned yesterday that it fell through, so it's just me and him for (as far as I know) the whole month.

For the first few days, it was great - he was friendly and respectful, and incredibly, generously helpful. It turns out we work in the same industry, so it's really fun to talk shop. He was a great host - showing me where everything is, telling me how much I should pay for things (everything is haggled here and foreigners of course get ripped off if we don't know what's reasonable to pay), even coming to walk me home from the taxi drop off at night. The protectiveness did get kind of stifling at times: for example, when I stayed late at work because we were wrapping up a project yesterday he called to ask when I would be home and tried to talk me out of going out for a drink with my (female) coworker afterward since it'd be dark out by the time I came home (this city is basically the safest in the region, the neighborhood we'd be in is very safe, and I was going to take a cab, so his concern was in fact unreasonable). 

I've not been too concerned about this since a) men here are generally very protective of women and b) I understand that as an obviously foreign woman who doesn't know the city AT ALL I'm vulnerable. Of course it bugs me that I really can't be as independent as I'm used to, but I do really, truly appreciate that someone here has my back and I like having a roommate who knows the city well.

But then last night shit got weird. We were drinking beer and eating dinner on the roof and having a great conversation - totally not romantic, talking about our field, about politics, sports, religion, then talking about differences between this country and the US - when he asks if I have a boyfriend. The way he asked it set off alarm bells, so I told him that I'm getting married soon after I get back (true story is I love my live-in BF tons but we're not engaged). Then he asks if I'd consider marrying a [his nationality] man. I said no, because I have a boyfriend at home. Then he says he bets a lot of guys here want to marry me, and asks what would happen if a [his nationality] guy asked me to marry them, and I said that hasn't happened yet but if it did I'd say I'm flattered but am already spoken for and am not interested. He says that would really hurt those guys, makes it sound sooooo saaaaad. He asks if he can ask me another question, I said yeah sure, and he pauses for a bit, plays with the label on his beer bottle, then says ""Nevermind, forget it"" (different language, but that's essentially what it meant). I change the subject.

Talk turns to infanticide in his country, which is unfortunately a pretty big issue. He was saying that a lot of time in rural areas husbands go to the city to work, and the wife gets pregnant by another guy, gives birth in secret, and kills the baby (abortion is illegal here and birth control can be hard to get). Totally legit, interesting (but of course troubling) commentary. But the way he said it was so creepy because he went on this tangent about how women have biological needs, if she's used to having sex she'll go crazy if she goes for more than a month without it, and it's only natural that she'd cheat if separated from her husband. Then he asks how long I'm here (he knows I'm staying for about a month - FUCK). I pointedly did not answer, just said that's ridiculous and that people can absolutely stay faithful to their partners, even with distance, and changed the subject again. And then later in the conversation he made another comment about how I'll break hearts and dudes here must be so sad that I'm not going to marry them and it isn't fair. I say I'm tired, decline another beer, and go to my room shortly thereafter.

This is extra troubling because for the past two mornings he would walk upstairs, supposedly to make sure I was awake, right after I got out of the shower and was walking around in a towel or undies - I believed it was an honest mistake, but after last night I feel really gross and violated about it. Especially because legs are a big deal here, and my towel only covers maybe the top 1-2 inches of my thighs - the Western analog might be a male host ""accidentally"" seeing a female tenant completely topless. For two days in a row.

I don't *think* I fear for my safety (despite the last paragraph), but I'm ruling out nothing - I bought a knife this morning, and for the first time last night, I locked my bedroom door. I did write the woman who I arranged this with to ask if her husband, who comes from this country, might have a chat with my host. She hasn't written back yet, even though she usually gets back to me very quickly and should be awake/checking email by now. If nothing else, having female tenants be so uncomfortable they leave is bad for business. 

I'm open to leaving and staying elsewhere but would strongly prefer to stay put. I like this neighborhood and the house and the price. And, though small in comparison, I think the accountant at work would be pretty unhappy about having to wire me more money and I'm worried about how this would impact company policy about staying in non-hotels in the future - lots of us prefer to have long-term stays in regular homes surrounded by local people, and I don't want my one unlucky experience to screw up my colleagues' future arrangements, all of which have gone really well.

Exacerbating this is the fact that several years ago I was raped by an ex shortly after I broke up with him and went to get my stuff from the place we'd shared together. This situation is absolutely triggering all the mental junk about that I thought I'd overcome - I know now that no place or person, no matter how comfortable or familiar, is 100% safe and I hope it makes sense how this situation would be extremely worrisome and causing me a lot of distress, even if rationally I'm pretty sure I won't get raped. I am worried the emotional impact will affect my stay here since I'd planned to spend today exploring, but instead I'm chilling - no, let's be honest, hiding - in my room because I don't want to run into him (I told him I'd be at the beach today, haven't seen him all day), and because I got hit on and bugged about being here without a husband this morning by a local and am just done with being harassed for the day. My fending off dudes in a foreign language limit has been exceeded; I am fresh out of fuck offs to give.

So reddit - especially those of you who live in more patriarchal countries with different expectations for interactions between men and women - what the fuck do I do? Is he just being friendly, and this kind of flirtation is a norm that's getting lost in translation? A friend suggested telling him that my ""fiance"" was upset and we shouldn't eat dinner or drink on the roof anymore, but I'm worried this may backfire because he might think it's because the BF guesses I have a crush on the host; also, we basically live together and it's weird to treat him like a tour guide but stop acting like roommates. I could move, but if this turns out to just be a difference in cultural norms I'd much rather resolve it - I think this guy is a genuinely good person who has just absorbed really fucked-up sexual norms. 

I so appreciate any advice. Thanks for reading my novella.

EDIT: People have asked which country this is and though I wanted to keep this kinda anonymous I suppose on the balance it's fine. I'm in Dakar, Senegal.

EDIT EDIT: Just to be clear, this city is wonderful and the people I've met here - male coworkers who I hang out with every day who are NOT creepy included - are absolutely lovely.

Am I crazy/controlling?",drinkdrive,216,43,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hd7qh/i_25m_think_my_girlfriend_21f_drinks_and_drives/,"Context: I'm a recovering alcoholic. I haven't had a drink in three years. My girlfriend of about 9 months drinks socially and it's never been a problem for me. 

Recently I have been concerned with her judgement when she has been drinking, specifically her willingness to get behind the wheel of a car to get home from a bar/party. She swears that she doesn't drink and drive but I think her definition of drinking and driving might be different than mine. The way I see it, buzzed driving is drunk driving, but I realize that college culture kind of silently accepts it as long as someone isn't totally wasted. 

I find it upsetting that she can tell me she doesn't do it when there have been several occasions when she is out and drinking, and drives home later. She says she waits a while until she sobers up, then drives home, but from my experience being around her she doesn't always have the greatest sense of how intoxicated she really is. 

Last night she went to a party and I stayed back (I occasionally go but parties aren't that appealing to me) because I had to wake up for work at 5:30am. She came back to my place at 4am and reeked of liquor. She was totally wasted, falling over herself. There is no way she wasn't driving completely drunk, even by her standards.

The last time I brought this up to her, she responded defensively, saying that I don't trust her and if I can't trust when she says she doesn't drink and drive then I need to think about how I really feel about dating someone who is not sober like me. I find that hurtful, since my concern about her drinking and driving is totally unrelated to my sobriety-- it's illegal, it's fucking dangerous, and if something happened the consequences could be life-changing or life-ending, for her and others. 

My question: am I being controlling by insisting that she changes this behavior? I'm admittedly pretty out of touch with drinking culture and I feel like maybe my perspective is clashing with hers because I'm not a part of it. When I used to drink, I would drink and drive all the time because I didn't give a shit about anything or anyone. Maybe it's wrong for me to project that onto her behavior. Maybe it's just that she is being careless or that when she is under the influence she just really sucks at deciding to do the right thing? I don't know, guys. I really care about this girl and I would be crushed if anything happened. 

Perhaps y'all have some advice or experience to share. Thanks for reading.

1370812318.0,173,self.relationships,1g03hb,I (24m) think my girlfriend (23f) might be trying to secretly get pregnant.,Riley_Duck,230,57,261,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g03hb/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_23f_might_be_trying_to/,"Okay, the first thing I should state is that I greatly care for this girl and can imagine myself having a future with her. I really enjoy being with her (we've been together for a little over a year), and I'm certain that she feels the same way. I should also note that we have, up until recently, never really had any major issues, fights in our relationship. For these reasons, we have been talking a lot lately about the future (marriage, kids, etc.) and where we see ourselves over the next few years. However, while she feels we are ready to ""settle down,"" I want to wait a little longer so that we can enjoy our youth for a few more years. This has caused some disagreement between us and did cause her to express concern over having to wait too long, but I thought that this was nothing major and told her to wait just a few more years (2-3).


As for why I think she may be trying to get pregnant, all I can say is that her behavior has been strange over the last two months.


First, I should note that, over the course of our relationship, we both have agreed that I would either use condoms or pull out, since she sometimes fails to remember to take her birth control; but she recently told me that I could start finishing inside her because she ""was going to do better about remembering to take her pills."" This caught me by surprise, and I told her that I was okay with continuing on the way things were, which seemed to upset her a bit. She didn't really get mad, but she seemed really insistent on me finishing inside her and promised me that ""it would feel a lot better."" At this point I had no reason to not believe her sincerity, so I did it a few times but then told her that I just wasn't entirely comfortable because I knew she had been forgetful in the past. This comment, for whatever reason, seemed to hurt her, so I suggested that maybe she look into an IUD as a possible solution to our dilemma. She responded by saying that she would rather stay on the pill and that I needed to just ""relax and enjoy the feeling."" One more thing I should note is that I have noticed she almost will no loner stimulate me to orgasm unless it's vaginally, which she claims is because she doesn't want to ""tire me out"" and ""wants my best."" However, this has never been an issue before and is another recent development which doesn't make sense.  


At first I thought this behavior was a little strange, but no big deal, right? However, I finally started to get a little suspicious when she started actively questioning what I would do if she got pregnant--and by actively questioning I mean that she brought it up constantly. I told her that we would discuss that if it happened and that we should consider all options in such a situation. This caused a fight between us where she ended up crying and saying that I didn't care about her and that I was being selfish by refusing to discuss our future (i.e. specifically state what I would do if she got pregnant), but we again talked things over and I apologized, although I'm still not sure what I did wrong. 


  Things seemed to get better from there, but I did notice that she was (and still is) talking a lot about babies and children, especially considering that we had discussed children only a handful of times before the last two months. Specifically, though, she has been talking them up, if you will. That is, she has been talking about how ""fun"" it would be to have a baby and how cute they are, and she also started saying repeatedly that I would make a great dad. My only response to this has been to reminder her that I would love to have children  but just not right now--to which she has consistently responded by saying something like ""sometimes fate has a different plan for us"" and that ""we have to be flexible.""


  However, what finally led me to believe that she was purposefully trying to get pregnant was when she started offering to buy my condoms. This was really unusual, as I have always bought them myself throughout our relationship and before that. When I asked her why the sudden urge to do this, she said that it was because it was convenient and something that all girlfriends do. I tried to press the issue further, but she ended the conversation by saying that she just wanted to take care of me. As of now, she hasn't bought any for me and I have no proof that she could be poking holes in the condoms, but I feel really uneasy. I don't want to hurt her by refusing to have sex with her, but I also don't want to have a baby now. This isn't helped by the fact that she still wants me to finish in her when we have sex. In fact, it has gotten to the point where I feel bad if I don't comply, even though I feel I shouldn't give in to her, because I want so badly to trust her. I think I really would be devastated if I found out that she has been trying to trick me into getting her pregnant.


Anyway, am I being paranoid about my girlfriend trying to get pregnant, or do I have caused to be concerned? Also, how should I proceed and confront her about my concerns?

 
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend's behavior has been really strange lately, which has led me to believe that she might be trying to secretly get pregnant.

**EDIT**: Thanks to all of you for your advice. It has really made me think about my relationship with my girlfriend and also led me to the realization that I need to talk with her about my concerns, so I plan on talking to her tomorrow. I want to give her the chance to tell me if I did or said something to make her think that I didn't want her in my future and possibly talk about why she has been so concerned with babies lately. I'm hoping that maybe this is just a phase or that I'm just being paranoid, but if that isn't the case, I'm not sure what I will do. I would hate to break up with her because I do care for her, but I also know that neither one of us is ready to have a baby.

So we've been together for about 4 years now. We met at university, we've both had a bunch of short- and long(ish)-term relationships beforehand, and things just went perfectly.


We're both from, and studied in, the UK.


Before I graduated, I was (almost out of the blue, but from a very legitimate source) offered a very well-paying job ($80k) as a software engineer in the US. The deal was for me to spend 2 months in the US, then I would work remotely from the UK, and visit the US for a few weeks at a time, a few times a year. Initially the idea of spending 2 months away from her sounded like hell, but we both saw that with the UK's economy in the state it was (and still is) in, it was a pretty damn good deal.


We were living together in an apartment that (with a little help from my father) we'd bought, and had just moved in when I had to leave for the US.


After the 2 months, and a Christmas break, I was offered a raise (to $100k); in exchange for another 6 weeks in the US, but this time they'd pay for her to come along for the ride too. She was still studying at that point, so came along, but only for 3 weeks.


After that, we lived together very happily for about 4 months. Then one day, I was offered another raise. To $140k. But from then on I'd have to spend at least half my time in the US. It took some time for it to sink in to both of us what was on the cards; trading a very nice cohabiting situation, for a part-time long-distance thing. There's obviously a whole debate on that itself, but in the end, we decided that I should take it.


We came to the agreement that I'd spend 6 weeks in the US, then 3-4 weeks in the UK. And just roll with that. She came over and chilled for 3 months in the summer after she graduated; we travelled the US, went to Canada, and had two very luxurious weeks in Hawaii. 


She'd graduated with a degree in crime / law, and through a contact of my boss's, got [legal gray area] an internship with a private investigator[/legal gray area]. After a month of that, he wanted to employ her full time, and sponsor her for a visa. If you're unfamiliar with the US visa system -- from an outsiders point of view, even those with higher education qualifications (I have a Masters degree, and I barely got in) it's one of the worst systems going. She's basically ineligible, because the US decided that the number of years spent in education outweighs the globally standardized levels of certification. An undergraduate degree in the US is 4 years, but in plenty of other places it's 3. We were told she's not even eligible to apply. Go back to school and get a Masters degree, or 3 years progressive work experience. 


She can stay in the US for as long as I'm there -- we're not married but there is a non-working visa for long-term cohabiting partners of people who have a working visa, and we have enough proof of that (proof of our joint mortgage is enough). But for her, it would likely suck, because she cannot work.


Since then, she's been back in the UK, and I've been travelling to and from my office and her. It's not easy, on either of us. But we've had enough long, hard conversations about it, and decided that we should give it a year, and reassess things. I work for a startup company. There's a fair chance that my job won't even exist in 12 months time. My visa allows me to transfer to another company, but it might be hard to find one that's quite so lenient on me disappearing from the office every 6 weeks. So I'd probably come home.


But if my job does exist in 12 months, then it means were doing well. I'm on track to have a raise and a bonus that would put me at $180-200k for this year; not including the fairly significant number of company stocks I own.


The trouble is; as much as we both see the upside to this, it really isn't easy on our relationship. She recently got a decent job in the UK, with some good prospects for advancing, and pays about $30k. We both work long hours (both our jobs expect at least 50 hours per week, and I've worked both days of the weekend for weeks in a row in the past), and with an 8 hour time difference, communicating isn't easy. We email each other from when I wake up to when she goes to sleep, but a phone call during the week probably only happens 2-3 times, for 30 minutes, when I get chance to take a break from working.


At the weekend, we Skype for about 3 hours each day, unless she's got plans otherwise (it's morning in the US, so I'm always available). When I'm back in the UK, things are usually excellent. At the weekend, we'll drive to another city for a couple of nights, or get a cheap flight to somewhere in Europe that we've never been. But a few weeks in, and I have to leave again.


I've come to the conclusion in my mind, that this is the situation we're in. I think it's far from perfect, but considering not many people are as fortunate as I've been, I think it would be wise to ride it out. Keep collecting the pay checks until I have to come home, or if the company survives the year, stick it out and get a pretty big payout in the end. I try and remove as many negative thoughts about how this is affecting our relationship as possible; not because I don't care (which is what she thinks I do it for), but because thinking like that is going to do nothing but make both of us feel bad.


She's very good at hiding her feelings, and will one day sit down and talk over all this, we'll agree on things, and move on. But then a few weeks later, she'll burst out into tears and anger at how I've escaped across the world. This is usually after she hangs out with her ""friends"" (right now, people she's been working with for about a month, have never met me, and don't really know her) that just make her feel stupid; by making out that she's some sort of idiot for putting up with me. ""My boyfriend would never, *EVER*, do that to me!"".


Last night, was the first time we've had an argument about this situation while I haven't been over in the US. Usually it comes after I've been gone for about 4 weeks, and one of us gets too busy that we don't get chance to speak for a few days. We talk it over, and then we're fine again. She's always said that she doesn't want this to go on for longer than a year, but this was the first time she said ""if you're still over there in 12 months, I'll have to leave you"".


My long-term friends, are all just mostly jealous because they know I make more money than they do (though they actually think it's quite a bit less than it really is), and think my girlfriend is ""so lucky"".


Her long-term friends, are generally very supportive.


Both our families are supportive, but hers have suggested to her in private that I should probably quit my job and come home. Though they don't know all the details, and aren't really aware that I'm not going to be able to get a job of this caliber in the UK.


**TL;DR
I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years, I took a job that requires me to spend 60% of my time on the other side of the world, about 18 months ago. I make a truckload of money, enough to support both of us comfortably, but if she joins me she'll have to quit her job, and won't be able to work.**


Has anyone else that's been in a situation like this got any advice/experience to share?


Was I just a massive cock for taking the job in the first place?


Am I the greedy, immoral slime ball that her co-workers think I am?


Is it unreasonable of me to want to make (a lot) of money while I can?


If you were me, would you have taken the job?


If you were me, would you quit my job?


If you were her, would you move to the US knowing you couldn't work (the deal includes a puppy of your choice, and 5 minutes walking distance to the beach)?


If you were her, would you just leave me now, because it's already been long enough?

I'm pretty confident that these gestures are nothing sexual, since which girl finds that attractive? But its at the point now where it is starting to get really emasculating and having an effect on my confidence since she is one of my closest friends and still makes those remarks.

We have a boat we keep at the local marina that we spend most weekends on. Last weekend we had a long day on the water with a lot of partying with friends and when we got back to the marina (9pm) I went to bed. My wife left to go hang out with friends on the dock.

I wake up at 12:30am and realize the wife is still not in the boat. Thinking she is probably drinking with the normal late night crew, I put on some clean clothes so I can go retrieve her. Note that it is pouring down rain and the docks have metal roofs so it is really loud and hard to hear.

I open the door on the boat cabin and come out into the cockpit, I look to my left and see my wife sitting next to the neighbor. I expected to see 5-10 people out there, but it is only the 2 of them.  I walk the few steps down the dock and am stunned by what I see: my wife, smoking a cigarette (she doesn't smoke, never has) with her hand down his pants working it good. He is facing away from me and talking low to her, they cannot hear me due to the loud thunderstorm. I stand there for what seems like an eternity but is probably more like 30 seconds before my wife finally notices me and gestures towards me with her cigarette. She mumbles something unintelligible, the neighbor looks up and immediately jumps up and zips up his pants. 

I am immediately heartbroken, pissed off, and stunned, all at the same time. I can't move. He says ""my fault"" and just stands there shaking his head, my wife doesn't move or say a word. I just shake my head and walk away, then go back to help my wife walk to our boat when I realize she is still sitting there. She is so drunk she can't talk and can barely walk.

I manage to get her into our cabin where she falls down and I see that she does not have any panties on. I start to get a real bad feeling about this. I don't sleep the rest of the night and we leave early the next morning after she finds her panties in the shower house. She cries all the way home while I plot the upcoming divorce in my head.

She claims that she remembers nothing, which is quite possible considering how drunk she was. I think she was more or less molested by a person who took complete advantage of her drunken state but I am still angry as hell at the steps that let that happen, including me not being there to protect her from predators like this and her letting herself get into this condition. I am also extremely pissed off that I didn't kick the shit out of my neighbor, I was stunned and still not awake at the time but I still should have done something. 

Next steps? She has said she will do whatever it takes to save our marriage, including never taking a drink again, but I am not sure it's salvageable partly because I am not sure of exactly everything that happened. I find it hard to believe she went to the shower house by herself and took her panties off and came back to the slip. Even if that were the case then I feel like the trust is broken between us and it will never be the same.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, it feels good just to write this out. I am as much disappointed as angry, we had a great life going and I feel like this has forced us onto a track that dead ends somewhere soon.

It’s going to be super long, but I want to provide a back story.

I’m working my dream job. I love it. Unfortunately, it has me travel a lot between US and Europe. I’m in the US for a while, then Europe for some time, then back across the water. Rinse and repeat.

When I say Europe I mean a specific major city; I just don't want people who know me to figure out this is me.

BEGIN BACKSTORY

In January of 2010 I met a really wonderful girl in Europe. A former model, now a fashion photographer. Stunning. Strong. Smart. Men were all over her, but she was head over heels with me. Within four months we were together every second outside work. Took vacations together. When I had to travel back home, she cried, and then we spoke every day for hours on Skype. 

I was in love. Then, in late 2010, the day after I once again left her and landed in the US, I was bragging about this wonderful girlfriend of mine to a friend. When he saw her pictures he did a double-take. This was the girl of a co-worker of his who also took occasional work trips to Europe. Just earlier that day he had been bragging about how he was taking a model on a romantic weekend in Paris in a couple of weeks (a week before I was scheduled to return).

I was in a daze. Couldn’t bear to talk to her. Her attempts to contact me got increasingly more frantic. Then they stopped. I flew back to Europe, and asked my buddy from the previous paragraph to ask his friend about the romantic getaway. He told him that the weekend sucked, and the girl was a total bitch. He was done with her. A waste of time and money. A few days later I ended up calling the girl and asked to meet. I wanted to have a face to face breakup and perhaps hoped for an explanation. Instead we ended up making up. I never brought up Paris. Gave her some bullshit story about why I didn’t talk to her. Figured we could leave it in the past.

By next January the Paris weekend guy was in the news again. He ranted to our common friend about his bitch of an ex-girlfriend again. How it was never good enough for him. How she kept on lying to him, had a boyfriend (me), and had flings with some dude she met at a waterpark, and a tour guide she met on a summer vacation. All before their Paris break-up . All while she was dating me.

We finally had our confrontation. She cried and swore that she never did anything. That the water park guy was a nobody; a friend of her girlfriend’s boyfriend. The four of them went somewhere together twice but she was never interested. The tour guide was flirting with her but she rejected him, again, not interested in the slightest. The guy she went to Paris with was an ex, but she broke up with him as soon as she got serious with me. Said she only accepted the trip because he swore it would be platonic, and when he made advances, rejected him and both were really mad at each other and couldn’t wait to never see each other again. She just really loved Paris; she lived there for a while, almost married a Frenchman there, and kept coming back all the time just for the atmosphere and the food. 

Broke up with her then and there. She kept on calling and apologizing and about two weeks later we made up yet again. We both understood the strain on the relationship because of my travels. We soon decided to move in together and that took a lot of the edge off. We lived very happily for the next year and a half.

Then by summer of 2012 we were making plans to leave Europe and live in the US together. I had a new job lined up. I sent her on another vacation while I was on crunch time. The morning of the day I went down to the airport to pick her up, in a stupid spur of a moment thing I took two large plush toys she had and set them up on the bed in a sexual position. I put my boxer short on the brown bear and put a dildo into the schlong hole, and wanted to put her thong on the pink panda. Well, lo and behold, what’s this flash drive doing at the bottom of her underwear drawer?

Oh look it. Here’s a bunch of old homemade porn with ex-boyfriends. Here’s some with me. Here’s some pictures from her Paris trip. Well, just one angry picture of the dude, and lots of pictures of buildings. Not too bad. Now let’s see. Oh, here’s her in a restaurant with the same guy just a month ago. And what’s that. A whole set of pictures of the handsome tour guide she was totally not interested in. And there’s a XXX subfolder there. Opened it, saw some dicks and pussies, fucking lost it.

Drove down to the airport and blew up. Told her to get her things and get out.

Somehow, and I can’t even explain how, she managed to convince me that I had it all wrong yet again. The Paris pictures proved that nothing happened there. The new meeting with the guy, well, just one lunch for old time’s sake while she sat by herself in our apartment for a month. The tour guide? Was all over her, kept asking to take pictures of him (she’s a photographer). And the XXX pictures? Never had sex with him, much less took pictures. Must have been some old boyfriend she accidentally dragged in that folder while organizing it. She’d easily prove it to me, let’s open the flash drive and look at the guy’s face. She said that so sincerely, I guess that’s why I caved. Unfortunately I had smashed the thumb drive in a fit of rage, so she could never really prove anything.

Well, I told her, I was crazy to believe her, but fine, I would. We got back together yet again.

A few months later my life collapsed. I lost my current job and my new job never materialized. I was in the US. She was in Europe. I was desperately looking for a job, money was running out, and so was time. 

We spoke every day. She grew increasingly more frustrated, and I grew tired of disappointing her time after time when yet another prospect fizzled. She even sent me money to help me out. 

Her birthday was coming up. We hadn't seen each other in six months. She offered to fly me to, where else, Paris of course, just so we could see each other, but right at the time I was working on a pretty solid opportunity. I also felt very weird having her spend so much money on me. So I told her, well, not now, but maybe in a little while, and it’ll be my treat.

Talk to her the day before, nice long conversation – she’s still mine, she’ll wait however long, etc. No idea what to do for her birthday, probably a little party. 

Her birthday. Call her on her cell. Get a subscriber unavailable message in French. Fuck. How the fuck is she in Paris?

She doesn’t pick up or answer for 10 days. Stalk her facebook. One of her girlfriends posts a picture of both of them near Notre Dame. Then, the next day, a picture of my girl and her French ex-fiancee at a restaurant. Fuck fuck fuck.

She Skypes me in a few days. River of tears. She just really wanted to be in Paris on her birthday, didn’t know how to tell me, especially after I rejected her invitation. Ex-fiancee was just a friend. Nothing happened, nothing ever could.

I don't give a fuck at this point, but I owe her a whole lot of money and my life is in ruins as it is, so we keep on talking.

END BACKSTORY

This June. Amazing opportunity comes up in Europe. Get a great job, tons of cash. Tell her about it. Well, she says, I’m at a yoga retreat that week. Why don’t you fly in next Monday so I can meet you at the airport. All right. No big deal. Get tickets for that Monday. Tearful reunion at the terminal. Just friends at this point. Few days later back to girlfriend and boyfriend, but it’s kind of not the same as it used to be. She has to take a weeklong trip for work. Then two weeks later she has another yoga retreat in Italy. 10 days. She has tickets with a layover, guess where. Paris.

She’s going to the retreat with three of her girlfriends. They’re flying directly there, meeting her at the airport in a rental car. Texts and phone calls while in Paris. Oh, how she wishes she had more time between planes. Text from Italy next morning. Picked up by girlfriend. So magical here!

Two days later I’m seeing off a coworker at the airport. And would you look at that. Who is that checking in across the way? Her three yoga girlfriends who she just had breakfast with in Italy.

Really chilly communication from me. She’s super happy and nice. Meet her at the airport on her return. Dying to talk face to face.

She cries and confesses. She really was in Paris for three days, not a few hours. Didn’t want to tell me so I wouldn’t freak out. Wasn’t with nobody. Just wanted to walk around and figure things out. And, oh, the thing about me not flying in that weekend of her other yoga retreat. There was no yoga. Her other other Paris guy, not the fiancée, the other one. He was in town. They went out dancing and that was it. Just for old time's sake.

Broke up hard. Almost 10 days ago now. She keeps calling me and texting me and telling me how she’s sorry and how she never cheated on me once and how I have it all wrong. And how she’ll never have another male friend, never even talk to a guy, how she only wants to be with me. 

I’m totally set on staying broken up. I’m still furious, mostly with myself. A part of me still whispers though, what if I have it all wrong, what if it really was a series of really unfortunate misunderstandings? That when we’re together, we’re great. It’s just that times apart, which are my fault, are ruining everything. I don't care if she's hanging out with guys, as long as it's not romantic or there's no sex. And I don't know for sure that she's fucked anyone.

We’re meeting tomorrow so I can give her all the cash I owe her. There’s obviously going to be a talk. I have half a mind to just give her the envelope and run, but of course I won’t. 

I’ve completely lost the ability to trust her. When this happened before, I wanted her to tell me nothing happened, I wanted to be proven wrong. Now I just want peace. But will a part of me always wonder if I had broken up with the love of my life for cheating on me, and she never did?

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend keeps lying about being with guys because she's afraid of my jealousy - yet I'm never jealous, just angry when she lies. Finally broke up after yet another ""nothing happened I swear"". Can't prove anything ever did. Filled with disgust and self-doubt.

**Short Update** Had my meeting. Turned into extremely painful 1.5 hours. Walked out. Didn't happen the way I hoped it would. Turned out even better. Totally reaffirmed my decision and erased all doubt. Very glad it ended this way. Full update when I'm done with work and maybe after I get a little drunk. Tough day.

Also, erased some personally identifiable info. Kind of been anxious around all my redditor coworkers today.

Alright, so he finally dropped his silent treatment and got in touch with me randomly almost *two weeks* after we fell out. In that two weeks, I consulted various family members, Reddit and realised just how deeply unhappy I am with my relationship. I went from confused and sad enough to consider staying with a man who had violent fits about my buying dresses on my own dime,  to doing pretty okay. I'm not elated, of course, because I did lose a good friend and a SO but I'm dealing all things considered. 

I'm VERY ashamed of myself for being so cowardly and doing it by text but if I had agreed to meet in person, I'm afraid I might have made a poor decision because, like I said, I am not very good at defending myself face to face due to how emotional I get. 



How the conversation went down (not verbatim, but almost)



**Him:** Your finals are finished, right?

**Me**: Yup. 

**Him**: So come round then and we can talk.

**Me**:*[did not reply because unsure of his intentions]*

**Him**: So?

**Me**. *[no reply still. I was panicking at this point because I felt my relationship could go either way depending on what I said. All the assertiveness and anger I built up had just vanished.]*

**Him**: Are you just going to pretend like I don't exist? Seriously? Seriously, grow up and stop acting like a little madam. I'm trying to reach out to you if you hadn't noticed. 

**Me**: Why now? 

**Him**: What?

**Me**: Yup, you're still doing it. ffs. Every time you do something upsetting, you tell me that I'm overreacting or that I'M the one who is actually guilty of it. Why are you telling me to grow up and communicate when you ignored me for the last 2 weeks? And then you have the nerve to just randomly text me to come around to yours? NO. Sometimes I wonder if you're doing it deliberately or if you're so oblivious that you actually believe what you say. 


**Me** [cntd. hit text limit] The worst thing is that you don't even care about me being ""childish"" when it doesn't clash with what you think. Most of the time you think it's CUTE and you know it. 


**Him**: I told you were still holding a grudge didn't I?


**Me:** Except I have every right to be angry with how you see our relationship and how you dismiss everything I say into either ""cute"", ""overreacting"" or ""nonexistent"" so w/e.


**Him**: Will you just come over so we can discuss this in person? This is fucking stupid and a waste of time for both of us. 

**Me**: No.


**Him**: Weren't you just complaining about me calling you uncommunicative? But okay, you don't have to do anything you don't want to, don't want to get in the way of your strop. 

**Me**. Thanks I guess.

[A couple of hours later]

**Him**:  Sainsbury's is doing half price on galaxy bars. ;)

**Me:** [did not reply]



At this point, I realised that I wouldn't even get anywhere with him even via texting because he was still dismissing everything I said and turning it back around on me so I decided to write one long, mad e-mail that I won't bother pasting at a time I knew he was asleep so he couldn't reply.  I can understand being insulting during a heated argument. I really do. What I can't accept is basically being told that I'm a unhinged womanchild after two weeks of him literally pretending that he didn't even recognise me. The fact that I'm finished with my exams and have so much free time pushed me over the edge. I have all this time, why would I waste it on a relationship that makes us both miserable?


The only downside is that I cannot go to collect my belongings from his house because he **absolutely** will not let me but I think the trade-off is worth it.

Am I missing something?,declare,239,62,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ax3a1/i_17f_told_my_mother_i_was_depressed_she_yelled/,"It's going to be a long story to lead up to, but please bear with me, and please excuse my grammar. Also, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit under relationships, I didn't know what else to put it under (my first time actually posting on Reddit!) I am a junior in high school, and I know life of a teenager is naturally stressful. With peers, pressure, and school. I have a job and I work about 20-24 hours a week. So my schedule usually consists of school, work, and seeing my boyfriend occasionally. Money has always been a huge issue in my family. My mom, dad, and I live in a one bedroom apartment that is upstairs of my grandma's house. It is also stressful that my parents have never really tried to keep our financial situation a secret to us. 

My brother (20) attends a university, and he is in a sorority. He also has an apartment, a car, and a cell phone all of which my parents pay for. They also send him about $160 a week. He is very involved in his school. My brother used to be in the suicide program, where he would take calls of people that were feeling depressed at his school, he's in a club to welcome new freshman every year, and he was an R.A for a while, but he couldn't handle it so he stopped. He is a manager at his school store, and he is a very popular ""ladies man"". 

I, on the other hand, am not very popular. I have a few great friends, with an amazing boyfriend that helps me through a lot. I kind of messed up a little freshman year of high school, so I can't get into a university right away. My mother has always said people that go to community college are losers (keep in mind she's never even been to college) and that upsets me because that's where I'm headed. She has always treated me differently than my brother, and my older sister (30F) who graduated from a university and is a successful accountant, with a rich husband. I can see she's a little disappointed in me for not being on the same level as my siblings, but I don't see why I have to be treated differently.

My mom has always been meaner to me than my other siblings. She's an alcoholic. She is also on a ton of pills, including anti-depressants, which she has been taking since her thirty's from my knowledge. My dad is a more laid back, mellow guy. He smokes weed a lot, but there's nothing wrong with that. They are the two most irresponsible adults you'll ever meet, though. My mom has always been mentally draining towards me. She's always telling me I'm not good enough, and starting fights out of the blue. I'm not afraid to yell right back at her anymore, because her fights are ridiculously unnecessary. She does it for her own entertainment, probably because she's bored and unemployed. I asked her one day while she was drunk, ""Why are you so harsh towards me for no reason?"" and she said ""because you remind me of your dad and you say things like your dad does."" Oh? My mother also has told me she doesn't love me in the past, which is fine, I can handle that. But she wants to make me feel bad over them paying for my phone bill (which is the only thing they pay for) when they pay everything for my brother. Including his brand new Ford Focus, and all of his girlfriends presents.
What my parents don't realize is, if they let my brother pay for some things on his own, we wouldn't be living in a one bedroom apartment. They don't care though. They want my brother to keep living in this fantasy that ""nothing is wrong at home"" and ""it's okay take $160 every week"". I'm lucky to get $30 dollars out of them every other week. I also have to buy my own car and pay for my own insurance. I also have not received a birthday present from my parents in about four years. I honestly don't care about that, though.

So here's the big story, I finally mastered up the courage to tell my parents I was feeling depressed, and I have been for a few years. I sat them down, was being very sincere, not blaming anybody. I said, ""I feel really down, and sad. I have for a while."" My mom said, ""So, you're depressed?"" I replied with a nod. She continued to jump up and say that's bullshit, it's your fault, it's your boyfriend's fault blah blah blah... Then she started to say you just want attention. Nothing's wrong with you. I just walked into my room and cried. My parents have always been harder on me than my other two siblings, and I don't even know why. My dad being too mellow is bad, because he has no say in anything, my mom runs everything. I don't do half of the things kids my age do. I don't party, I never drink, I smoke weed sometimes and they know (but don't really seem to care) so i don't understand what's wrong with me. A few days ago, I over heard my mom on the phone with my aunt telling her how my brother just got off anti-depressants and how he should be back on them because his life at school is ""stressful for little baby Dave"". This babying my brother thing while I get nothing is getting very old. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm sick of trying with them. They don't care and I can handle that, but fuck. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?

TL;DR: Mentally abusive mother coddles older brother (20M), pays for everything for him while he's away at college. While I(17F) am suppose to feel bad over her paying my cell phone bills (which is the only thing they pay for me). My mom makes appointment for brother to get anti-depressants, while she tells me it's my fault for being depressed, and that she's not taking any actions to help me because I'm ""being dramatic"".

(this will make you cringe)",Velfarr3,209,34,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jxrh0/friend_is_getting_walked_all_over_and_remains/,"I'm a 32 year old guy. The friend in this story is early 20's, with a long distance relationship to a girl who is a few years older than him. Keep in mind that I do not know 100% and can only give you what I do know.

Guy is a roommate, we live in Salt Lake. Girl is a LDR who lives in Florida. When I first met him through another friend, he was very charismatic and upbeat, and just funny. He told me that he had moved here from living with his girlfriend, and that someday he would move back out there. I sometimes heard him talking to his girlfriend in the background, often times giving her his debit card or credit card numbers; or buying something online for her. It happened often enough that I started to ask my friend about it.

This friend told me it was normal, and that he often wired her money. At this point, I was not aware of how much he was actually giving her. I continued to mind my own business, as he would talk to her while sitting in the same room. I would hear him get sad, because she had hung up on him. Then I'd watch him try to call her back several times in a row. This, I would later learn, was fairly common. I once asked him why he did not just stop trying to call her back, let her call him for once. He said ""she expects me to call her back"". 

One time, he was so worried, that he had me pay her phone bill because he was out of funds.  Later, when she was looking for a reason to be mad, she brought up that he paid her phone bill late and then hung up on him. I continued to keep my mouth shut, because it's his relationship.

Fast forward a few months, and I've learned that he pays her medical bills and her medicine. He had been driving an old car with 260,000 miles on it, and it had a bad power steering pump. My brother and I helped him fix it for close to $60, no sweat, as he just got his tax refund of about $1500. The next day, I asked him to go do something with us for fun; something involving a trivial amount of money. He said he couldn't go because he didn't have any money. He tried listing off reasons why, but could only think of his car repair and a parking ticket. I asked what happened to the rest and he said ""well I had to take care of *her name*"". I just cringed and said ""oh, I see"".

We get along quite well, and despite my considering him a good friend, I keep my mouth shut. I don't talk behind his back and he even had me add her on facebook.

Fast forward again, and this guy now has a 2nd part time job, very decent wage for his age. I now find out that, in addition to the previously mentioned; he is paying her rent and utilities as well. I see her making hints on facebook about how she ""needs cable"". I hear her asking him for things and he replies ""I'll have to see... how much is it?"" - I don't know what she's asking him for. I've watched her hang up on him for not immediately saying yes to something she wants. Then I watch as he tries to call her back. She knows what she is doing.

I keep my mouth shut, but it's getting hard to watch him do this to himself. 

Remember this kid I described in the beginning? He now does nothing but sit on his computer, plays old games and eats what I can only describe as ""college level"" cheap. None of us can get him to leave the house, and he mopes about. I finally ask him when she will be moving out,  -because all LDR's should have an end in sight. He replies with ""I dunno"" in a tone that clearly states he doesn't think about it. I said ""You need some finality, you can't just sit here and never see each other."" and he replies ""we've been doing it for 2 years, we're fine."" I reluctantly let it drop. It was more of an inquisitive probe, rather than a conversation. He really seemed to love her, so I thought maybe there were extenuating circumstances that I had not taken into account.

Fast forward another month or two, and I've found out that he has a 2nd Facebook profile to talk to her. His family hates her, and he cannot let them see that he is still ""with her"". He has some friends come out from another state. While they are here, I ask them about her, and find out that they hate her as well. I begin asking other people what they thought. Sometimes ill-concealed malice, but mostly just frothing at the mouth hatred.

I find out that he dropped out of high school, moved into a hotel with her, and used up his college savings. Once dried up, he had to move home. This is where I come in, looking for someone to take up a spare room for a very reasonable fee. Lucky timing for him, as his father had just told him ""You cannot live here if you're sending her money"". I am his enabler, apparently.

Just the other day, he tells me ""*girls name* and I decided I'm going full time at &lt;new job&gt;"" (he had previously been part time). ""She helped you decide that you would go full time?"" Now I'm looking at his lifestyle. He does nothing, buys nothing, and only drives to work. Example: The soles on his shoes are worn so thin that he cannot walk on hot road, it burns him. When told to buy new ones, he says ""I just can't justify spending money"". His rent and utilities are only 10% of his income, because I'm generous. ""So why go full time?"" I ask, ""because she needs more money?"" and he says -with an embarrassed tone- ""yeah"". I raged inside, but didn't let it show.

I can't handle this anymore, so I remove her from friends on Facebook and when he talks to her on the phone, I ask him to go to another room. Yeah, I know, Facebook drama is lame. I can only say that when I removed her; I didn't write, I didn't make it known, I just removed her. I mention this part, as lame as it is, because this set her off. She really liked me, apparently, and wanted to know why. I ignored this, because I hate causing drama. Well, she twisted his balls, and made him ask me continuously why why why? I simply told him ""don't worry about it"". I came home and my brother was with me. When I was asked again, my brother said, loudly ""why the fuck does she care?"" - he reasoned that my roommate should be just a tad jealous that she was so concerned with why I was not her friend. With as much courage as he could muster, he posed that question to her, as it seemed to make some sense to him. Why would his girlfriend care all that much?

 He had been asking her for months to move out, and you probably wouldn't believe that someone in an LDR who loves you could skirt the issue EVERY TIME or flat out tell you they ""could just leave you"" (jokingly, so he says) - she said that when he cornered her about it. In plain text, she didn't want to come out. She told my other roommate that ""he has a good thing going, and I don't want to fuck it up by moving out there.""

He asked me why I treated his girlfriend ""this way"" and said something about how she probably wouldn't want to move in now. I said ""she isn't going to move out here"". He finally had something to tell her, and of course, she blamed everything on me. Now she COULDN'T move out because I didn't like her. He says she hates me now, and if he defends me at all, she hangs up on him.

I've tried to talk to him about her. He is delusional, though I don't know to what extent, because I'm not a mental health expert. I'd put him at a 9 out of 10. He will say things like she is perfect, and that no other girl can possibly compare; or that there are no good looking women in this state. His voice changes when he talks to her. Yes, there is girlfriend voice, and there is this; it's unlike anything I've ever heard. He doesn't work out with us in the garage (full bench and free weight set) because ""she doesn't like buff guys"" - the fact is, he wants to work out. This is how deep his infatuation goes. He is no longer his own person, but whatever she wants him to be.

I come home from a night out, from work or from just doing something with other roommates; and there he is, sitting on his computer. Sometimes eating leftovers of a meal that he cooked a few days ago. Usually playing the same game he's been playing all month, something that he bought for $5 in a bargain bin or something that was given to him.

He should have so much money in the bank, because he has no debt. He should be having fun, because he wanted to start classes this fall. He should be happy and carefree. He is none of these things; he is... hers.

I don't know where to go from here, and as much as I'd like to say fuck it and just ignore him, I actually care about the guy.

Edit: I invited him out with a few mutual friends. He was bragging about his next check and how big it would be (I forget why) - and when I asked him to come riding he said he didn't want to spend any money. I said ""but you just said you were getting a huge check"" and he began lying to me about everything. I said ""I knew you would say no, and I know exactly why.""
I don't know how to begin here. When someone will lie to themselves, and you, how do you know that what you say holds any meaning to them? I spent a few months dragging this guy out, and paying his way for shit like movies and food, because I truly assumed he was a broke college kid. The fact that he could allow me to do that, when he was sending all his money to her, just irritates me. TIL I'm too generous.

TL;DR - there isn't one.

Some context: I have lived abroad since I was 16. Completely sheltered before that. Got assaulted by this boy he encouraged to pursue me at age 16. A bit bitter after that.

 Anyway to cut a long story short, I have been living with a white guy for a year now (earns more than me, hardworking, smart, funny, wants kids - this info will be relevant later). He proposed last week. We are travelling back to my country to attend a mutual fren's wedding. He is excited at the prospects of meeting my dad but when I emailed dad with a photo n the flight details this is what he had to say (note I have not flown home to see them since early last year since my dad had a heart attack n was hospitalised)::

Email 1: ""I hope you understand that I am in no mood to see any stupid angmo unless they are of international status or nobel price winner.

Marriage and proposal to them is just like passing shit. Does not have any meaning at all. They can divorce or kill you the next day.

I think you should seriously think of what you want for the next 10 to 20 years.""

Email 2: ""Prevention is better than cure. if you go out with somebody who has nothing to lose in punching you to pieces or even killing you, then you are just been damp stupid. I am sure you known the typical profile of woman abuser-- extremely charming, caring and go to the extreme like buying the whole shop of flowers etc etc. But when you look carefully at their background and account, you will find that they do not have any money at all or are in debt, and usually lots of problems within the family, hopping from job to job etc etc.

Any responsible man would not propose to any woman until they are sure they have the means and a steady job to maintain a family.

Be very careful of any man who just suddenly propose to you after just a few months like you last encounter which could be worse.

There are a lot of men who prey on easy woman victims even in here.

Get yourself a small gun, electric tisser or pepper is a better mean of defence, but not against sweet talking man. You just have to be careful. The easiest way is to ask them to wait for 10 yrs until you got your post graduate qualification. If they are still there waiting after 10 yrs, then you can be sure for once.""

Email 3:
If he can send a million A$ to me, then I would be impressed

Email 4: From the scatter information I got, I understand that that guy is just a drifter like your previous boyfriend. No permament job, no PR and just surviving from day to day. You are recreating the same scienario as before. This is a disaster that is going to explode and it will be worst this time. For the man, with nothing to lose, marriage is just a game. I seriously hope you do not fall into the trap. If he is really serious, ask him to wait for 10 years and if he remain faithful and get himself a good job and prove himself, then I would definately have no objection. I think at this moment, he is just treating you like a toy to be thrown away when you outlive your usefullness. 

Email 5:The problem with all these stupid White Man is that they just don't know how to save money. Hence their own country is going to the dogs.

Email 6: I prefer you only mix with girls. The only good successful women are those who do not marry and mix with other women for their whole life. The rest with men, become useless housewife only know how to get pregnant and eat get fat.

I'm an agnostic atheist and my girlfriend is a Protestant Christian. We've been together nearly 4 years. I am going to be attending grad school and she is in undergraduate school. We have lived together for a year and we're pretty boring people. We're both introverts and have had maybe two fights through the duration of our relationship. I'm flexible and she's flexible. There has been no cheating or jealousy feuds. Sex maybe once per 1.5 weeks on average. You can said we are 'content' or 'happy.' We're best friends.

Around Christmas time last year a member of her close family died and she's really starting to develop her relationship with God. I've noticed her becoming more distant and I suspected it's because she's re-evaluating what she wants in a partner and in life. We've had a talk before about Christianity. She wants a Christian husband with Christian values (all of which are the same of mine; I was raised Catholic/Protestant). It's important for her partner to be Christian because it has something to do with purity of marriage and how that helps you build a closer relationship to God. She wants to better serve God in any way she can. I respect her views and her motives. I went to church with her last weekend.

About two weeks ago when I was kissing her before bed she said that she doesn't want to have sex out of marriage anymore and that doing it makes her feel guilty. I'm flexible, but this one is definitely a curve-ball. We've talked about marriage and agree that we're far too young, and want to wait until we are 28-29 years old to get married. 6 Years is a long time without sex. She's okay with that wait. Sex is important to me because I believe that it creates and shows love and also it's fun. I just don't believe you have to get married to do it. 

It might be easy for you to type ""just break up,"" but if you haven't built something for 4 years, it's a little more difficult to understand why this isn't easy especially because we're good friends in good standing.

Anyone have any insight?

1357710848.0,171,self.relationships,168gcl,UPDATE: Should I break up tonight or after our expensive vacation together (26m 26f)?,throwaway_blahblahla,222,51,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/168gcl/update_should_i_break_up_tonight_or_after_our/,"[Original post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/166yrc/should_i_break_up_tonight_or_after_our_expensive/)

**ANOTHER UPDATE: I cancelled the meeting, and then he asked if he could still meet to have a discussion about himself so this won't happen again with anyone else in the future. I agreed. We're meeting later tonight.**

So I broke up with him a couple hours ago (we went back to his place after trivia). I showed him the thread, he LOLd at the bunk bed comments, and then dove into the meat of the thread. This update is going to be a bit strange, since I showed him the post and he's been reading all your comments. He'll probably read this too.

**As far as the assistance he's been giving her:**

We went back and forth quite a bit - him arguing that his wife's situation in both the incidents I mentioned weren't a regular occurrence (she's about to move into a new place, apparently, and we just crashing temporarily). He also argued that he didn't financially support her (though I've seen him pay for food, events, and other stuff, and he mentioned paying for car insurance, helping her with a security deposit, etc.).

He told me there was no difference between the way he'd help out a good friend and the way he's been helping out his wife. I replied by pointing out that wife he has yet to be divorced from =/= good friend. I then asked him if he'd put up with the same behavior from me, if he were in my shoes. He said ""yes"".

**The reason he hasn't actually gotten a divorce yet:**

He told me they haven't gotten officially divorced because they are both too ""lazy"" (his word) to take the required paperwork wherever they need to take it. It's already signed and ready to be delivered. I've met her/hung out with her on a couple of occasions, and she doesn't seem like a particularly lazy individual, and neither does he (and I told him that).

**Regarding the sex/bunk bed incident:** 

He said he didn't think it was a big deal at all, because he would see me later in the week and it wasn't imperative that we have sex that night (paraphrasing here).

**One annoying thing worth mentioning:**

He kept asking me if I wanted to talk to his wife so she could confirm that their relationship is 100% over/there's nothing going on between them. I was really surprised that he thought this was appropriate or would make me feel better. Maybe he's less self-aware than I thought.

Eventually, he started repeating his explanations, and I had to go to the bathroom. When I returned, I brought up Sundance, saying that if he still wanted to go, I'd be fine with being friends, having him come to interviews, etc. with us, but suggesting that he bring an air mattress to sleep on. I also made it clear that I wouldn't stand for any attempts at causing jealousy/drama - for example, I don't want him to bring anyone back home to hook up with, and I agreed to do the same (not that I would try to play stupid, shitty games like that). He wouldn't look at me while I was talking to him, staring up at the top bunk the whole time. Eventually he muttered, ""sure."" I said, ""I guess I should go, then"" and left.

**We texted back and forth afterward, and here's what happened:**

&gt;Him: Drive safe. 10:38 PM

&gt;Me: Thank you. All of this really broke my heart, but I was too attached to you considering the situation you're in with your wife, and I just had to protect my emotions. 10:40 PM

&gt;Him: I would like to still talk with you about it when I'm not as blind-sided. I thought we shared something special. I've never met someone that clicked with me as much as you did. I want to fight to preserve that. I love you. 10:46 PM

&gt;Me: I love you, too, and I feel the same way about the romantic connection we had. But, honestly, I don't see this being resolved anytime soon without some major soul-searching on your part. 11:18 PM

&gt;Me: My feelings for you are going to be difficult to let go of. I'm heading to &lt;friend's&gt; apartment right now to be consoled about it by her and &lt;another friend&gt; and a couple of other friends. 11:20 PM

&gt;Him: I'm willing. I read through all of the comments to your post and they brought up some good points that I missed during my initial skimming. Would it be possible for us to meet up tomorrow to discuss it? 11:22 PM

&gt;Me: I don't think I can answer this reasonably when my emotions are so potent. I'd like to say yes, but I know it's a terrible idea for both of us. 11:38 PM

&gt;Him: I'd like to talk it out at least once before we leave for Sundance. 11:40 PM

&gt;Me: Okay, you can come over at 7:30 tomorrow, if you think it will help. 11:42 PM

&gt;Him: Okay. 11:44 PM

I know you guys are going to yell at me for what I said during our conversation - I was feeling a bit weak/vulnerable after the breakup, despite sticking to the facts and not getting weepy during the breakup conversation we had moments earlier. 

Anyway, I don't think we'll reconcile anytime soon - he has to deal with his own baggage first, and I think the one commenter who said he should break up with me and wean himself off of his wife before even thinking about dating is correct. Otherwise, the same thing'll happen with the next girl (who's likely to be far less tolerant than I've been).

Either way, we're supposed to be seeing one another tomorrow night to discuss things further.

**tl;dr: Broke up with him, heard numerous excuses for his behavior. We're meeting tomorrow night to talk about things further.**

I just found some inappropriate texts and pictures on his phone to a girl he dated in high school. Talking about how he wants to fuck her mouth, asking for pics of her tits, commenting on how big they are. She says she wants to make love to him, he wants her to come visit. He says he's moving in a couple of months, and she asked what's stopping him, and he said, ""Nothing really.""

No mention of his smoking hot girlfriend who he loves like crazy.

This all started just a few days ago, when he found her on facebook, from what I can tell. If this were a one time thing, I might be able to get over it. He's depressed about not having any friends, and maybe he needs some attention from someone who isn't me.

But he's cheated on me before. He's kissed two other girls. Another girl came to me and told me they fucked, but he convinced me otherwise. And these are just the incidents I know about. I'm guessing there's plenty more. I had some real trust issues for a while, but we've worked on our relationship, and I forgave him. I really did.

But now I know that he's not going to change. Those things didn't happen because he was wasted... they happened and will continue to happen, because he seeks it out. He might not be physically intimate with that girl, yet... but why wouldn't he be, if it were possible? And sending dick pics and dirty text messages (especially when I don't get that kind of attention from him) is still cheating.

My problem is that we live together, and our finances are very entangled. Actually, it's more my finances that are at risk. His phone is under my name. He just bought a very expensive TV on my credit. The bills are all in my name. 

Does anyone have some advice on how to prepare for a break up?

If you know you're going to leave, but need a few months to be financially (and, fuck, emotionally) independent, what steps do you take?

I already have a savings account with a significant amount saved up, but not enough to get me started in a new city/state.

Literally almost everything in our house belongs to me... or I bought it for us. Should I take everything?

I love him more than I can bear to think about right now... but I need to emotionally separate myself from him. I don't want him to know that I know about the other girl until I'm ready to leave. How do I sleep beside him, knowing what I know?

How do I let him tell me he loves me, when he's talking to other girls like that?

What would be the most satisfying way to leave this relationship, for me? Should I tell him about finding out about the other girl? Or just hire some movers and disappear one day?

Does he deserve a chance to explain himself?

How do I let go of this person who I've made so important to me...who clearly doesn't care for me nearly as much?

**TL;DR: Caught BF cheating. What is the best way to leave him? How do I prepare financially and emotionally?**

**-----------Update---------**

This has been a really difficult morning for me. I'm trying to act normal, but I haven't gotten any rest, and some of your comments have made me have to leave the room for a quick cry upstairs. So he keeps asking what's wrong, and I don't have an answer for him... all I want to do is talk to him, and tell him everything I'm thinking and feeling, but I know if I do this before making a plan, he'll talk me out of leaving. And I can't afford to let that happen.

I know I can't stay in this relationship anymore. No matter how much I love him and wish we could work things out, this isn't a healthy place for me to be. I've packed three big trash bags full of clothes and shoes and old purses to take to Goodwill, which I'm about to go drop off. I've made a list of things I plan to take with me, and a few small things that I'll leave for him.

I have a checklist for utilities that I'll need to get shut off... the phone will probably be the hardest thing. It's only his number on the account; mine is still on my parents' account. I'll just have to take the TV with me and pay it off myself. I couldn't sell it for anywhere close to what's left on it; we literally bought it like two weeks ago.

I'm going to start looking for jobs and other living situations as soon as I get home from Goodwill. I think the deadline I'm going to give myself, to get out of this place, is by the end of the month. To be honest, I'm really scared... I've never really been alone before...and I love him much more than I have anyone else in my life. It's going to be really hard. But I know it has to happen.

Four years ago, our son, the most wonderful child in the world, was born. He was beautiful, sweet, intelligent. The perfect baby, even through the crying and late night feedings. When he was two years old, he fell into the deep end of our pool and drowned. 

This destroyed my wife. When our son was born, she quit her job to stay home with him. She adored him, and he, her. They were inseparable, he was the light of her life. And I adored their relationship, and was very close to him as well. His death devastated us both. But I healed. It still hurts, there's still a hole, but I can live day to day. My wife is still grieving. She cries in his room, refuses to let me box up his clothing and put it in the attic. It has crushed her. She is a shadow of the woman she once was. We've tried marriage counselling and solo therapy, but she closes up whenever a therapist tells her to let go of the death. She sees nothing wrong with this. I suggested maybe we try for another child, and she lost her temper with me. We've been sleeping in separate rooms since- me in our room and her on the futon in our son's room. 

I love this woman. We've built a life together. Some day, I want to have another child with her. But I need to know how to help her through this. I've done everything in my power, but my actions just make her mad. We've had sex twice since our son was born, once when he was alive and once shortly after the death.

1348455304.0,172,self.relationships,10dh1j,Please tell me why I [29m] am selfish,absolutethrowaway2,210,38,197,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10dh1j/please_tell_me_why_i_29m_am_selfish/,"So I have been building up to this question for a long time now and I think it was partially triggered by a post the other week about the guy whose girlfriend has all these strict rules she enforced with sex and how she rarely ever had sex with him.  It resulted in a ""bestof"" that made the front page, the tl;dr of which was ""stop being selfish and focusing on yourself and instead double down on being awesome to her.  Take all the pressure off of her pleasing you physically and instead focus your efforts on every other part of the relationship"".  

This really hit home for me as I am in pretty much the same place as that guy was.  Long story short, almost a complete lack (once every 4-6 weeks), a complete unwillingness to try anything when it does happen and many rules surrounding it, and a complete lack of change in these circumstances despite me communicating how unhappy this has made me over the last 1.5 years it has been occurring.

I have read /r/relationships and /r/sex a lot over the last year and half and these same posts keep getting made wherein the guy is frozen out completely by his SO.  And without fail the response is always the same.  Focus on her, stop being selfish, romance her and take her on dates, sweep her off her feet, hit the gym and get in shape.  So my question is why?  Why am I the selfish one?  Why do I need to take her out on romantic dates, sweep off her feet, woo her, etc, etc?

I'll start by saying that I have been trying that, although I could definitely do more.  The gym thing isn't an issue as I am in better shape now than at any point in our relationship.  I try to cook dinners, bring home flowers, tell her what she means to me, and in general be a good husband.  And yet here I am 2 years into being married and the taps were pretty much shut off the day after I committed for life.

So why am I the selfish one?  Why is it always the guy who has to bend over backwards?  The voice that I hear in my head says ""I don't need a blowjob to be coaxed in housework.  I don't demand that she not gain weight or I won't cook meals.  I don't expect anal before I work to arrange romantic getaway holidays.""  I just really have to ask if a person made a post wherein the person they were dating stopped working right after they got married and was now just relying on the other person to support the family if someone would write a bestof post that made the front page saying ""you are being selfish saying 'I want them to work. I want them to contribute to the household.'  See how much you are saying I?"".  Would there realistically be suggestions that the person should take work to sweep their SO off their feet to try and convince them to get a job!?  I feel like the general consensus would be that this person is being inconsiderate to the other person and that they should think about getting out of the relationship.

I'll pre-emptively respond to criticism of the job comparison by saying don't bother bikeshedding 1,000 posts talking about how sex and contributing through employment to the family are totally different.  It was the first comparison that came to my head and is likely imperfect.  Instead substitute another area of a relationship that you consider important and ask yourself what advice you would give if one party were to completely stop contributing to that part of the relationship.  The general analogy is what is important not the specifics.

I feel like the only two sides I see in any of these posts are ones saying ""you need to stop focusing on yourself and work harder for her!"" or some PUA asshole talking about how whipped the OP is.  But I feel like there is an unrepresented middle ground, closer to the PUA side I guess, saying ""Why isn't this something to be upset about? Why can't I say that the wife is being selfish and inconsiderate?  Why am I the unreasonable one?""

I'll finish this by saying that I absolutely do want an answer to the question.  I fully recognize that in my current emotional state I may be overly bitter and unreasonable.  Maybe someone here can give me the perspective I need to see that I actually am the selfish one.  Honestly, I actually do want candid feedback.

TL;DR: Why is the guy being shut off from sex (me) the selfish one?  Why do I have to focus even more on her?  Why is this the standard for sexual issues, but if I was an unemployed deadbeat people wouldn't say she needs to be even more supportive of me?


******EDIT*****
So first I want to say thank you for all of the replies.  I posted this because I did want advice and what I saw as the advice being given in other posts just didn't work for me. In case it is not obvious I am a logical, straight-forward person, your classic Concrete-Sequential or whatever that Meyers-Briggs classification was.  I don't like just accepting advice or arguments, especially when I feel that the logic and reasoning behind them doesn't work or isn't thought through.  I debated a bunch in school and to this day still approach things from a ""facts and logic or GTFO"" standpoint.  So I made this post partially as a challenge to a bunch of the unjustified claims that I had seen before.

But I also made it because I feel like being convinced of your own rightness, and unwilling to change you opinion is a poor way to go through life.  I was hoping that some posters could show me flaws in my reasoning, and support their arguments.  Clearly I am not Jesus/Thor/Buddha, and maybe I just needed someone to tell me that to my face.  And I did get a number of really thought-provoking posts.  

I also appreciate people coming in from all points of view.  Whether pragmatic (suck it up anyway because you can happy or you can be right), sympathetic but tough (you are not being selfish, but here are some things you need to ask yourself), or adversarial (you are being selfish).  I also appreciate the women posting to give some perspective on their sexuality, and although I probably started off unnecessarily aggressive I appreciate people coming from the ""PUA"" camp.  By and large I have found their opinions not the standard ""asshole"" opinions I was talking about, wherein a post is just 10 sentences of calling the OP a pussy or faggot, while simultaneously talking about dominating women, possibly physically.  Instead they have worked to express that maybe there is a more hard-nosed ""realistic"" view of female sexuality that I am ignoring.

I guess what I am trying to say is that for the most part I haven't read too many posts that were content to just throw their point out as though the self-evidence of it was obvious.  Most people have at least tried to anticipate counter-arguments and provide the logic behind their views and that is what I really appreciate.  It has definitely given me much to think about.

Before I get started, I would like to thank everyone who posted in my original thread. I have never sought for help from the Internet before and I have to say it was a very positive and rewarding experience. Even if your comment was mean or ""trollish"" I found it very useful. Even in such comments, there may be a nugget of truth that can only be found if said in such a manner.

And to the people who sent me private messages, I thank you. If I didn't respond, I apologize. Believe me, your words have encouraged me very much.
I found that indeed she enjoys watching men masturbate. I performed this for her and she found it very satisfying. At first she was very hesitant and would question what I was doing, but I held fast and kept going. She would tell me that, ""This isn't working"", but she couldn't look away.

We tried different positions and found some that worked well. I managed to convince her to go on top more which, despite some initial complaining, she found very rewarding. We used the position to ""prime her up"", before we tried other positions.
Since my last post, I lost an additional 5 pounds. This isn't a whole lot, but it helped increase my confidence and allows me to continue this incredibly powerful journey.

I suppose all is not good news. To those who said that ""something was up"" was indeed correct. I have found that she has been sharing and masturbating to a person I know. It was as I suspected, this person has a large penis. I believe this and her frequent use of the dildo is what caused her to desire a larger penis.

I have confronted her about this and she admits to it. She does not feel guilty as she felt that since I wasn't pleasing her sexually, she needed to release and this person was capable and available of helping her do this. I am sad and have been for quite some time, but I have a hard time blaming her. I feel that this is my fault for not doing enough to satisfy her urges.

She wants to have a one night fling with this person. She doesn't love him or care of him. She finds him unattractive, but she wants his penis. She wants to know what it is like to have something of that size inside her.

She asked permission. And being the spineless coward that I am, I agreed to let her. I was reluctant, but she kept rationalizing it saying this is what she wants. Just once. I tried to say no, but I kept blaming myself. That this is my fault as to why the relationship is the way it is.

I am lost. I feel empty inside. I hate myself. But all I can do is just keep trying to lose weight, keep learning new techniques and just ... I don't know, try to somehow convince her to change her mind.
I have a feeling I know what everyone will say, but please do not hesitate to say it. Thank you for listening.

**Edit:** We have broken up. She cried, I cried. It was messy. We're still talking about living situations as this job is very important for her and losing it now would be bad. I feel awful, but once I said put my foot down, saying 'no' came easier.

I'm drained, I feel empty. 2 years down the drain. I thought this would make me feel better, but I feel awful. I've ruined her life. But there is something hidden inside me that I enjoyed.

Is this salvageable?",kyonk,212,42,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f72ov/my_fiance_30m_wants_to_break_up_with_me_27f_after/,"My fiance (30m) and I (27f) have been dating for 10 years. He is my best friend, and I really can't envision spending the rest of my life without him. However, about a month ago he told me he probably doesn't want to get married or be together anymore, and he was just afraid of hurting me. I requested we take a break to figure things out, and as time has went on it seems a story has unfolded.

I was his first serious girlfriend. His first everything, really. In the past he has expressed that he wonders what it would be like to date other girls. We went on a break years ago where this was possible, however he never pursued anymore, and eventually asked to be back with me exclusively. Lately he has been telling me how he'd like to be friends with a girl from work. I was perfectly fine with this, but at this point it seems like he really just has feelings for her, and he is letting it interfere with our relationship. For the record, this girl doesn't seem interested in much of anything with him. He asked her if she'd like to talk outside of work, and sent her contact information. She completely ignored him. She also goes out of her way to be buddy buddy with people at work, however not with him. On top of this she has a boyfriend herself. Him and I have talked extensively about this situation, and without seeming jealous I have tried to point out that while she seemed friendly at work, the fact that she hasn't reciprocated any of his requests to develop a friendship probably means she is just being professional. He can't live with this answer though, and seems convinced he can be friends with her. He has gone as far as to ask me if she ever wanted to hang out if I would be okay with it. He claims he would be fine with just a friendship with her, but at this point he is letting her get to him and effect his mood, which I find unhealthy and a bit strange.

I understand that people in relationship develop crushes. While I think I am jealous to a certain extent at that idea, I accept that ""crushes"" are pretty much harmless, and as long as they aren't acted on it's fine. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a few crushes myself over the years. However, they easily faded and I always wanted to stay with my fiance.

Last week him and I had a long discussion about this girl, as well as his desire to make friends. While I am fine with little to no friendships, he isn't. I have told him he should pursue friendships many times throughout the years, but now it seems he thinks I am to blame. He specifically wants to have more female friends (although he would like more of both), and he is under the impression that having a fiance is repellent for making friends. Over the years we have had married friends and friends with children, and he seems to think these kind of friends aren't good enough because people change after these life events. I have tried to explain that being single isn't going to make him a magnet for female friends, and instead he needs to work to form friendships that aren't based off of superficial things like marital status or parenthood. 

As for our own relationship leading up to these events...I thought it was good. We were finally out of debt after 4 years of struggling. We were both making money. He has his first full time job, and while he isn't feeling intellectually stimulated, he is happy it's a job. We very rarely fight, and enjoy many of the same things. We joined a gym and have been trying to stay healthy. One of my parents died a few months ago, which has been hard on both of us, but he has really been my rock. My other parent then got very ill, and was on the cusp of death for awhile. Luckily, she is recovering now. We were under a ton of stress during this time because of constant hospital visits, and as soon as it calmed down he talked to me about his doubts. 

I would add that one other reason he has expressed that he is unhappy is because I have a physical handicap. I am not wheelchair bound, or anything like that. However, I have a less than stellar time getting around. I can walk and do simple physical tasks, however one thing I could never do in our relationship is go on long, rocky hikes with him. He seems to resent me for this and think of me as a burden in this sense. I am at a loss at what I can do about this, since I was born this way. This is a disappointment he has talked to me about though.

So, I guess my question is...is there anything I can do to fix this relationship? I am not delusional. I don't want to continue to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me, but I am so confused about ways I can repair this.

Has anyone sustained a happy, long-term relationship in similar circumstances?",thraway321,234,62,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ddutv/husband_m_29_prefers_masturbation_to_sex_leading/,"I fear I have already lost my mind after 4 grueling years, so please bear with me as I ramble on. My question is, can I save my marriage or is the well too poisoned? I need to know (a) if it is perfectly normal for some guys to find their partner desirable yet not display it through words/actions/expressions and prefer masturbation over sex, (b) Does my husband have a porn addiction, and (c) is there a magic pill or algorithm that will change my current perspective and not let his need for porn bother me. 

I'm (F27) 5'4, 106 lbs, and used to think I was attractive. I think my husband (M 29) is gorgeous. He's a wonderful, decent fella, yada yada.  Also important to note, I'm brown, he's white. Ever naked pic and bit of porn he looks at has naked white women. I've asked him several times if he was just inherently attracted to white women but he is adamant this is not the case. 

We've had a terrible sex life right from the beginning, but because of all the drama in our lives, he always attributed his low sex drive to circumstantial problems (implying it would change when the circumstances did.) But over the course of 4 yrs, I've discovered that his sex drive matches mine, he just prefers to play solo. I feel like I'm dying the death of a thousand papercuts and am now convinced I'm hideous to my husband, he'll never desire me, he'll never put me ahead of his needs. However, he insists he loves me and desires me sexually, he says he is willing to change and has made certain improvements in other domains of our relationship, and insists that his preference for masturbation has no adverse effect on our sex life. I'm more inclined to believe that he has a porn addiction (and the very common “death-grip” issue) and he is unwilling to acknowledge it. 


Here are my reasons (which I have communicated to him several times):
*I used to initiate and get rejected 9/10 times. 
*He can go months without sex but not without masturbation, actively choosing one over the other. I crave sexy times every day.
*For the most part, sex is always in the dark, under the sheets, right before bedtime. No spontaneous sex, no experimenting with different positions, no sharing or exploring fantasies, no foreplay (In all fairness, there were a couple months were he'd initiate spontaneous sex frequently but that stopped.)
 *Generally he finishes in 5 mins, is “too sensitive” to go again, has absolutely no desire to touch me once he's done, and I have to finish with my vibrator. On days that he lasts for much longer, he starts going soft while fucking me and sometimes is just unable to finish. Either way, sex with him leaves me frustrated and hurt.
*2/3 times he prefers to masturbate instead of fuck, eagerly waits for me to leave so he can masturbate, faps probably every day but wants to fuck me only once a week (some months it's even more infrequent.) 
*No matter how I touch his dick, it always goes limp in my hands. He has a certain technique that I seem unable to replicate, no matter how hard I try. (When I ask him to teach me he shuts down.)
*Blowjobs seem to work fine
*If he has been looking at porn, he gets really hard and initiates sexy times, but on many occasions he starts going soft while inside me
*If he hasn't had any external stimulation and I initiate sex, he never gets fully hard nor does he seem too enthusiastic. 
*He has never looked at me with carnal desire nor do we have spontaneous sex (expect for aforementioned couple of months.) In previous relationships, if I were bent over while doing a chore my bf would drop everything and fuck me. There were certain places I could touch him that I knew would turn him on. Certain dresses/skirts ensured I got fucked that night. None of this exists with my husband. He has never asked nor tried to discover any of my special spots, never revealed his own, is averse to trying new things, no matter what I wear or say, nothing moves him unless he is already horny, which later leaves me feeling like a cum-dump.
*A few months ago, after several tantrums, discussions, calls for help, he tells me that he might be a porn addict and would try the full “reboot” that they recommend in  “your brain on porn” support group – no stimuli, no fapping, re-wiring the brain so to speak. This barely lasts a month (during which we are fucking on a wayyy more regualr basis) before he needs his release.
*During that month he gets sullen and grumpy (keep in mind we are sexually active and he gets to orgasm every time), is always irritated or edgy, and generally has the demeanor of man with no will to live. So he gives in, rubs one out, and now claims that he is not a porn addict and that was never the problem, so he shouldn't have to quit. 
*In 4 yrs, he has gone down on me 4 times. I had to ask/beg every time. I used to go down on him all the time, some days 3-4 times a day, hoping he would eventually reciprocate. I estimate I've given him close to 200 bjs over 3.5 yrs.  
*Before we got married, I explained how important sex and feeling desired was to me – he promised we'd have sex 5 times a week, he'd go down on me, and if his preference for masturbation was a deal breaker then he'd quit entirely. So far, he has broken every single promise (including all the ones not relevant to our sex life) and finally admitted that he would never quit masturbating.

Since I realize how ridiculous it is to expect someone to never masturbate (considering I need to at least twice a day,) I do understand his perspective. But I feel the last 4 yrs have been traumatizing (there have been sooo many other problems too,) I'm convinced he doesn't find me attractive, and porn (other naked women) gives him something I can never give. My self-esteem is ripped to shreds and I'm tired of feeling ugly and unwanted on a regular basis. I was never a prude and porn was never a problem in past relationships. Yet now, I feel like it has to be one or the other. I feel like I've lost out on my youth, beauty, and sanity while waiting for him to love me the way I need to be loved. Since he won't quit porn even though it means I walk out on him, does this mean we're done? Has anyone been able to get past something like this? If I stay with him, am I doomed to a miserable existence with no passion, no romance, and mediocre sex? I know the lust fades eventually but we didn't start out with any. At least, none on his part. Can anyone help me understand this?

tl;dr - hubby prefers to masturbate, ignores my needs, I feel lousy and want to get out. Keep wondering if this can be fixed though - either the relationship or my head.

Thanks for the advice. We spoke about this last night and I told her exactly how I felt. I wasn't trying to attack her and I basically asked her WHY she did it and how it made me feel. She told me she just enjoyed validation from strangers and she was always insecure about her body and has dealt with body image issues ever since she was 12. And then she started crying and felt terrible and said she would never do it again.

I told her that I am there for her if she ever feels insecure and she doesn't need to look to others for that. And she understood. We hugged, kissed, and made up. This morning, I saw her on her laptop browsing reddit and when she went to the bathroom, I checked her gw account through reddit search and she had deleted all her submissions and even deleted the pictures off of imgur. 

I guess it ended well. Thanks for everything guys!

To put a short story even shorter, I went out with my work friends again last night, my girlfriend called me, got angry and whatnot, accused me of cheating (that's what all her coworkers said I was doing) and just general called me a fucker. Even when I came home and took a shower she snooped on my phone again and texted some of my female students (I teach University students) that they were the reason she was breaking up with me and not to text me anymore.

She then got kind of sad and went to bed talked about ""maybe one day we can be together"" and kissed and cuddled with me for one last night. In the morning, she packed her bags quietly, and went back home. Haven't heard from her since she left. I spent today eating chicken tenders and watching youtube, pretty much like nothing happened.

tl;dr: We broke up, she's gone now. Everyone was right (and I knew it) about the seeds of these problems having been planted with all the stalkerish things she did because she can't trust me for some reason.

1355175010.0,169,self.relationships,14mjaq,I [28M] am currently unemployed and my wife [ 28F] is now the sole source of income. It is a struggle but her constant reminders about the situation are making me resent her.   ,Creaturepreacher,254,85,295,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14mjaq/i_28m_am_currently_unemployed_and_my_wife_28f_is/,"Me: 28M- unemployed for a year. Trying to find a job, but the prospects are slim. 
Her: 28F- Sole income provider
Together: Married 4 years.

My wife is a fierce type A personality. She is good at problem solving and managing situations, and awesome with money and budgeting. I usually love these things about her because she just tells me what to do and I do it, and things are great. Last year I got fired from my job for something very much my fault and very stupid. It really was a blow to her and to our finances. I have been looking for a job ever since but things have been tough. I have a knee injury so labor jobs are hard for me. I have a useless degree that I don't have work experience in. I use to be a System Admin., and that is what I am good at, but finding another job in the industry has proven difficult. 

It is partly my fault because I don't really want to settle for a McJob. I would just strangle myself if I had to work in food service or retail. I just can not see myself being happy at that sort of job. 

I know my wife is struggling to make things work with stretching her salary to pay all our bills. She mentions it to me all the time. She makes me sit with her when we do the bills, she is consistently reminding us of our checking and savings balance. I understand why she is doing it, but it just makes me feel bad and then my confidence level takes a dive and then I don't want to look for a job. It is getting to the point where we are having fairly intense arguments about the money and finances and me not accepting just any work that comes along. 

I get that she is struggling, but I can't seem to explain to her that the more she bugs me about it, the worse it becomes. In the beginning she was very understanding, but now she can't even enter a room without staring me down and asking me why I don't have a job yet. She constantly sends me links to jobs that she knows I would never do/ never be happy at. 

I am trying my hardest, honestly, to find somewhere that will work, and when I find that place, I apply and follow up and do the best I can to get the job, but it doesn't happen.

She has even gone so far as to set me up with networking lunches with guys from her industry, knowing that their is no way I could do marketing/sales. 

Last week we had a fight about how she wanted to get a second job because she was tired of always being broke. She said, "" If you refuse to step up then I will do double the work for both of us."" That just hit me. I apply constantly. I don't know what more I can do. It makes me feel horrible.

We have a rule now that she doesn't/won't provide me with spending money because she made that money so although she covers the basics, if I want to have money to go out and eat with my friends or if I want to buy something I have to ask her and then she sets up a chore or errand for me to do for her or a relative so I can earn the money. 

It is making me feel like a teenager stuck in my parents house. 

How do I explain to her that she needs to start treating me with respect so I can find the confidence to pull myself out of this no job slump? How do I fix my marriage because I am just one bad day from walking out that door? 

Also, I told her about how I feel and she said that if I refused to grow up and take responsibility for my actions then she would rather see me go because at least then she would only have to support herself. 

I just want a little support. Something to tell me that it is worth it, and I am worthy of a job. 

**tl;dr: Wife berates me for not having a job after a year of unemployment. She controls my spending like I am teenager. There is resentment from both sides. How do I get her to be more understanding while I try to fix our financial situation?**

I'm 23 and my husband is 25. We've been married for over a year now and have dated for 5. We have a 3 month old daughter.

He's a research scientist, and he recently won an award, so we went to the party/ceremony (it was basically just everyone talking and eating fancy hors d'oeuvres followed by a small presentation of his award and all the media stuff).

I haven't really felt like doing anything lately, but I wanted to be there with him and thought it might be fun to get dressed up and go out. My sister has been wanting to babysit our daughter anyway... That was a bad choice. There were a couple nice people there, but it was almost completely just his unbelievably pretentious colleagues and the ""higher ups"" (old men and their trophy wives). So, at one point I was talking with a woman that my husband works closely with. She's was an engineer, and eventually we started talking about the project they were working on. I make a few comments that weren't true (I thought they were at the time... at least it was how I understood it after my husband tried to explain it to me...) and she got offended, called me stupid, and said that I shouldn't even be here. Ugh, self-confidence destroyed. Immediately after that I go and find my husband and he's talking to some old guy I've never met. I go stand beside him and hold his arm and then the old guy says something like ""Is this your wife? She's not bad looking, but I'm sure you could do better."" Seriously, WTF.

I didn't know what to say so I just left. I'm glad I was able to get outside before I started crying :/. My husband followed me out and I told him that I was just going to wait in the car until everything is finished (we were a 4 hour drive from home). He runs back in to tell his boss that there is emergency and he has to leave, and they'll have to do the media stuff tomorrow, then takes me home.
So now I made him look unreliable in front of everyone. Awesome.
I'm still really hurt about what happened, but the saddening part of it that they were kind of right. Whenever I get my husband to tell me what he did today when he gets home from work, he'll try to explain it as best as he can, but I never understand. I've tried reading about it online too, but it's all too confusing. I guess I'm just an idiot. And although I don't think I'm unattractive, I did use to be in a lot better shape and going to the gym more often wouldn't kill me...

If it's too long, the title is a good summary....

For the past year or so I have been very sexually frustrated. I've never had an orgasm with him. (I've only ever had 1 with a guy so that's not exactly the problem but I'm sure it plays a larger role than I am willing to admit) 

He knows that I have been sexually frustrated as I have been vocal about it and have come up with suggestions &amp; ideas that would help make it better for me. The problem is that even though I have let him know how I feel (multiple times at least 10 conversations have happened where I have let him know how I feel and have let him know ways we could solve the problem together) he has not made any attempts to help me fix this problem, which is the only major problem we have. He's pushed my hand away from his cock many times and has turned down sex over 50 times.. which has taken a huge toll on my self esteem. he seems to only want sex in the morning and never puts in any effort for morning sex. It normally happens by me being stoked on the morning wood and taking advantage of it cause it seems to be the only time I can get it. So I give him a bj to make me wet then hop on. I feel like he doesn't care about my sex life and only cares if he gets off. As soon as he gets off all sexual contact is done. i am left to finish myself off or I just don't finish at all. 

Now, I don't want you guys to only have my perspective cause I do try to see it from his angle and this is how I see it. He gets frustrated with me because I always want sex, and even though he tries really hard I have never had an orgasm. He doesn't want to have sex with me because I get irritated and grumpy when I haven't had sex in a while and the grumpier I am the less he wants to have sex with me. He feels reluctant to have sex with me because he feels it's never good enough. 

Last night was somewhat the last straw for me. For the past WEEK every day he has been promising that he will have sex with me. And every day he puts it off until the next day, and that happened every day for a week until finally on sunday we had morning sex.. which lasted like 5 minutes and I got no foreplay at all.. I hate feeling like sex with me is some chore that he has to put off until the chore can't wait anymore. I miss feeling desired. So I told him again that this is not okay and that all I do is wait for him to come on to me (cause i'm sick of being rejected all the time and he said that I should just wait for him to come on to me) constantly and it's not fair of him to keep doing this. All he said was ""I'm sorry I keep doing this to you"" and went to sleep on the couch..

Basically my question is am I wrong to be planning a break up over this? And how should I word this break up without hurting him that much? And how can I make it so he knows that i am actually done this time. I don't want to be sucked in again, every time I try to tell him this is the last straw I always end up giving him another chance because he promises he will try harder and I want to believe him but this is the 4th time he's promised to try harder and then not made any efforts.

I remember people asked for an update and so here's what has happened so far.

The plan was to lay out all out for her that night and present the ultimatum that I was going to move out if things didn't change.  She got home though and had a really bad day and was upset so I didn't do it that night. We just hung out, turned our ringers off, and had a really nice night.

The next day my determination was actually kinda waning as far as the ultimatum, but when she got home the first thing she said was about all the voicemails she got from her sister and asked me why I shouted at them.  When I told her about all the calls in a row and the screaming over the answering machine she just rolled her eyes at it.  Really quick my frustration came back full force so we sat down and talked about it.

Usually it turns into a fight, but it really didn't escalate that much this time.  At first she tried to get me to agree to be more patient, but I told her that was bullshit, it's been over a year and nothing has changed.  I also told her how I didn't think she really believed they were going to change, but I thought that she's waiting for me to change, to get used to it.  She tried to deny it and to make it out like I was over-reacting.  Then I told her that I loved her and I knew that we could have an awesome life together, but I can't live like this and then I told her that I was going to start looking for another apt. over the next month or so.   I told if she really thought that she could make it so that things are different then I wouldn't need it, but that I was done being patient and understanding about it.  I made it really clear that I didn't want them out of our lives, but that there needs to be some very basic boundaries and we both need to stand our ground about them.

She agreed about the boundaries, she said that she would make it clear to them, but if was going to be looking for an apt.  that meant that I already had my mind made up.  Then we talked about different options.  We talked about moving a little farther away and she said that if it really came to it that she'd rather us move farther away than me getting a separate apt.  It was kind of an exhausting conversation, but I was feeling more optimistic about things than I have in a long time.

She went over to her mom's alone to talk to them about it.  She didn't really go into details about how they reacted, but by the next day I noticed that all three of them had un-friended me on facebook.  I think to teenage girls that's the equivalent to 'you're dead to me'.  I was really ok with it.  I felt a little guilty about the 11 year old.  I think she really did like me and I don't want her to think that I don't like her, but I was afraid to even touch the can of worms and bring them back full force so I just went with it.  

Everything was good for a few days.  They still don't call the house, but spam her cell instead.  When they come over they pretend like I'm not even here, which is fine.

Now I'll tell you exactly what happened next and I'll try to leave my assumptions out of it.  I work at a diner as a cook.  I started getting complaints about the food.  Hair being in it (I wear a hair net), the order being prepared wrong, and general complaints about the taste of the food.  All from teenagers.  Last thursday a teenage girl ordered a burger and after a bit the waitress brings it back to the kitchen with the top bun off of it and a loogy stuck to the bun.  She had to report it to the manager.  This is after I've had the other complaints.  The manager knows me and I tried to explain what I thought was happening (that her sisters had rallied teenage avengers to fuck me over), but I'm sure I came off as crazy and I wasn't put on the schedule this week.  He told me that I wasn't fired, but just give it a week until whatever is happening to blow over and come back.

I know it's a total assumption without proof, but I didn't care.  Autumn and I fought about it and I did put it on her sisters.  She tried to get me to calm down and said I didn't know it was them, teenagers are just assholes sometimes, blah blah blah.  I hadn't really stuck to my own ultimatum as far as looking for another place, but I said I was going to and we could either move out town together, or I would get a place of my own.  She was getting mad because she doesn't think it was her sisters and told me that I was being ridiculous and that if I really need to move she guesses I should look for a place on my own.  Then she went to her mom's.  She said she was going to prove me wrong about it, but she ended up spending the night without letting me know and when she came back was cold to me.  

I tried to talk it out with her, but all she would say was that she wanted to move past it.  Neither one of us brought up the moving out bit, but I haven't really made it any secret.  I am looking now.  Things are ok here for right now, but it's really tense and we both kinda avoid talking about her family.  

Honestly I'm not really sure what's going to happen.  I have this week off, I'm going to be looking at apts.  I really do think they set up this bullshit with my job and if I'm going to be with her we need to get farther away from them.  I have sinking feeling in my stomach though that when it comes down to it she's not going to come with me.

At first I just thought he was a guy who needed to buy a lot of stuff, but then a few months ago he basically ran out of small items to buy and it became apparent he was really just coming into the store to speak to me. By this point, as is normal practice with regular customers, I'd already told him my name and been perfectly friendly to him for a few months. 

This is usually what happens: he will walk in, stand by the till and refuse service from anyone else, until he gets the chance to speak to me. I'll ask him what he wants and he'll say 'oh nothing, I just dropped in to say hi' and then will try to force an awkward conversation. He can't remember how to pronounce or spell my name from when I told him months ago (it's an unusual one) and tries to ask for clarification often, which I fob off with excuses like 'it's fine, nobody says it right, just call me whatever'. He's tried, in various awkward, forced ways, to 'casually' ascertain my facebook details, tried to find out the name of my band (it's a guitar shop so most of us are in bands), where I hang out, what gigs I'm going to be at, my soundcloud, etc. I am a poor liar and when on the spot I panic and never think of something stern to say in reply such as 'I don't give out my facebook details to customers', but instead deflect these questions by mumbling things like 'I never use facebook' or 'I never go out; yup, I'm boring'.

He also will stare at my crotch and/or boobs if he thinks I'm not looking; this has resulted in me putting on a baggy jumper every time I see him come into the store which nonetheless does not stop him from trying to stare through it. Recently I've been staring him down pretty hard when talking to him and not breaking eye contact, which for the most part seems to control his staring (although I can see him having to control himself to stop himself from looking). Additionally he doesn't behave this way with other women that work in the store, so presumably it's a bit of a crush or something.

I've shoehorned in that I have a boyfriend, and also when it became apparent that he was coming in to talk to me I became quite abrupt and non-conversational with him. Obviously, being a customer/employee relationship there's only so much I can do to communicate with him that I'm not interested in speaking to him. 

I assumed it would drop off when it was clear I was not interested, but it's gone on for so ridiculously long now that I feel I'll have to do something else to discourage him. I don't want to be mean, or rude, or embarrass him; he's obese, has a lisp, English isn't even his first language and he's so socially awkward, sometimes I can see him forcing fake confidence. I feel his actions are probably born out of loneliness and sexual frustration rather than being some kind of genuine asshole, so unkindness is probably not what he needs. What I'd really like to understand is what the fuck he thinks he's doing? Has anyone else been 'this guy' in their lives and can explain what he hopes to achieve by pestering me? Doesn't he understand that it's awkward and unwelcome? Does he think over time I'll warm to him?? 


TL;dr - customer at the shop I work has been pestering me for almost a year, want to understand his mindset and what he hopes to achieve, and also how to make him stop without being a dick to him and maybe even helping him be less of a fucking wind-up to women in the future.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_15kv3c,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15kv3c/dont_understand_what_customer_mearly_20s_hopes_to/,

Taking the high road is a thing you should always try to do, but revenge is almost too easy!

I started dating M 4 months ago, and for the last month we've been sort of on the rocks. She started dating him less than a month ago. He, obviously, never told us about the other. Her and I met and had a long discussion yesterday and both texted him ""We need to talk"", so I'm sure he knows something is going down with us, but he doesn't know how much we know. We haven't said anything to him since. 

He's very charismatic, very good at manipulating people. I've been with him for a little while now, so I'm used to him and have built up some resistance to the way he handles me. Since she only just started to date him, she's still pretty swept up in his charm. She knows that what he's doing is bad but since she still has strong, ""new love"" feelings for him she may not want to go to the extent that I want to go to (and may even want to stay with him!) That's fine, I will only go as far as she wants to, and I don't want to poison their relationship any more than it has been. She seems like a nice girl; I want her to be happy. I will be talking to her tomorrow about what she wants.

I want to put him in a very awkward and disadvantaged situation because he always seems to have the upper hand in one-on-one discussions (manipulative, remember?) I also want him to face the consequences of his actions. I don't want to do anything actually physically hurtful or drastic: I was just thinking of having a serious discussion with him about our future together (he maintains that we have a chance for a good one), with her listening in the other room, and then spring her on him! I was also thinking about slapping him just because I've never slapped anyone before and he seems deserving of it. Clearly my ideas of vengeance leave something to be desired.

Anyway, I've heard that the best revenge is living well. Well... I can always do that afterwards, right? But in all seriousness, if you think I shouldn't do anything about this situation except break up and urge the other girl to do the same, please tell me why. I'm pretty high on emotions right now (and excitement... this feels just like a movie!) so I am probably not thinking reasonably about anything.

It's worth noting that we work in the same place, frequent the same areas, and will have to be dealing with each other for the next year at least. So there's my only argument for ""forgive and forget"", but it's not a very alluring one!

Well, I'm getting settled in with my father and I figured now is as good of a time as any to let everyone know how I am doing.

The overall state of my well being is **not good**. I am very depressed. I'm depressed because I have no friends and I miss my mother like crazy. I know, I shouldn't miss her because she is the lord of all that is sick and wrong in the world, but I do. 

My mom has called my dad probably 300 times in the last 3 days threatening to sue, to have him arrested, etc unless he brings me back. He isn't caving. I can tell it is taking a toll on him though. He has been very helpful and open with me. He explained that when they divorced my mom was psychotic towards him. Every time they were anywhere near each other a physical altercation was not far off. He told me he didn't want to put me through that and since he was getting nowhere in family court that he thought it was best to just leave. 

As far as charges go, the initial charges the police arrested them on were dropped. The states attorney said there was not enough evidence to pursue it in court. However, I have a restraining order against him, they would not give me one against my mother. The attorney said he will look into filing other charges but it is very unlikely that will happen unless the order of protection is violated. 

Other than this, not much is going on. What do I do about the deep sadness I'm feeling? Should I call my friends and explain to them that I moved, or is it best to just leave everything behind and start working fresh? I just feel... hopeless, I guess.

My girlfriend of three and a half years, recently accompanied some new friends/classmates to one of their houses in Mexico for a bonding experience. I couldn't go because I have exams coming up this week, but I didn't object to her going because our relationship has been one of trust and openness from the beginning. Somewhat of a perverse testament to this fact is that she admitted all of the following openly.

Last night the group went out dancing and drinking until the sun rose. When they returned to the house, one of the guys came on strong and she gave him a bj. She tells me she was very intoxicated and it was a mistake, but takes full responsibility. I believe that she didn't want to hurt me as she has, but I am still very troubled by her actions and failure to conduct herself in a manner that would prevent such an outcome.

It is very horrific for me to imagine a woman whom I have loved so very much, give such a cheap token of lust to some fucking dude. We're supposed to be classy, educated, genuine, ethical people! That's who we've aspired to be together! I feel humiliated and embarrassed even if no one else finds out.

So I guess my question is how am I supposed to work this out with her and move on without feeling like I'm somehow disrespecting myself?



**TL;DR:** My girlfriend gave a dude a bj in Mexico, I'm torn up about it, still considering reconciliation. Wondering how to do that and retain my self respect. 

**Edit**: You've all given me a lot of food for thought, I really appreciate all of your advice. Going to bed. I am exhausted, and frankly quite sad. I'll be back tomorrow with any updates. 

**Edit 2**: OK, so I guess a bit more information is required, both about her drinking habits and about what took place between them.

So GF recently started graduate school, something that has been a source of tremendous stress and social anxiety. As a result, when she drinks lately, she tends to go overboard almost every time. A recent episode involved her puking in a cab. Unclassy behavior from an otherwise classy woman. We're talking Jekyll and Hyde here.

As far as the infidelity, I had her explain everything in as clear of detail she could. The details in order of importance, he didn't come on her face, he didn't come period, she stopped the encounter after 5 minutes most of which involved kissing, they did not spend the night together. 

You can base your advice on the assumption that I can tell with certainty if she is telling the whole truth. Seriously, this woman can't keep my Christmas presents a secret. My certainty is based off all of he nuances you learn about someone over three and a half years and are quite difficult to communicate here. She is simply not a good vessel for secrets, they cause her far too much anxiety. 

The jury's still out. She has a hell of a lot of work to do if we're going to stay together. I've witnessed older, more mature couples overcome infidelity before. I might be up to the challenge considering how good everything has been up until this point. This is terrible. She comes home tomorrow, we'll see....

To put things in perspective, she had recently achieved (her first) orgasm one night I had helped her though her cloths.

So here we are dating... going out to dinner a few times a week, making out on the couch like teenagers. If I press her too far sexually, she then regresses back and that is not done for a few weeks. Meanwhile I am thinking, that I will never be close enough to marry her if we are not progressing the relationship (foreplay, spending the night, maybe even moving in with each other at some point).


------------------------------------------------------

When I asked her values she states the following. :

""I dont want to be test ridden like a car"".

""If I am going to act like the wife, why not become the wife"".

""Its harder to just walk away when you are married"".

""I would feel less of my self if I was living with someone who did not marry me"".

""Marriage is great for taxes"".

""I need to be engaged before we do anything more than we are currently doing"".

""I know you want to buy a house, but I wont move in unless we are married (once we are married I want us to buy a joint house together so were both on the title and the partner could never say ""this is MY house"".

""We could sign a prenump if you want"".



--------------------------------------------------------


Like this is some formula for a relationship, minus the love that would somehow fall into a good relationship.

I dont see any of this shit above.. I want basic love, love that would flourish into a normal sexual life, and progress into a strong relationship, then marriage.

I currently feel none of this and here is she talking about heavy, outdated formal dating. Dont get me wrong I like this girl, but every time she talks about this I drift further apart.

**TLDR Current (relationship novice) girlfriend is making me jump through all the traditional dating to marriage hoops like its some sort of magic formula for a successful marriage, I am not feeling any of this and see it as a receipt for disaster.**

She wants to have the talk tonight, so this may actually be the end... we shall see.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

In 2005 we got married in a secular ceremony. I rushed through college, getting my bachelor's in 2.5 years, got a shitty job I didn't want because it paid well so I could buy her a house and we could have kids just like she wanted.

Yesterday, on our 6th anniversary, she tells me she's a born again Christian, she's felt the call of God, and that she now loves the lord and her church more than she loves me or our daughter. I told her that I can't abide that, because I can't see how anything, deity or otherwise, can be above your own child, and that her inflexibility would tear the family apart. Her actual response: ""If that's God's plan than that's fine.""

I feel betrayed. I feel like this is not the life situation I signed up for; she wants me to love God more than my daughter and if I don't then I am essentially to be cut loose. What a shock that my atheist wife woke up one day to a sudden revelation, and if I don't come along I get left behind.

I haven't slept or eaten I'm so stressed out by the whole thing. I feel like my only options are to either go along with a lifestyle I don't want and beliefs I don't agree with, or to be cast out.

I asked her if she now thought our gay friends were sinners (we have tons of gay friends that we've known for years that she's never had a problem with, in fact, they were her friends first) and she said yes. I explained to her that that is exactly what I was talking about, that she is not the person I married.

This last year she was accepted into medical school and moved to a city that is two hours away. I still have a year left of my PhD program so I had to stay and finish up before I could move to that city with her. Things were going really well and I saw her nearly every weekend since she had moved out. 

I have known for a while that I wanted to marry her and she talks about getting married all of the time too. I was waiting until I was closer to finishing graduate school and until she was settled in medical school before I proposed. I spent quite a while shopping for the perfect ring and planning the how I was going to propose. I even asked her parents’ permission (which she told me I should do if I were to propose).

I asked her to marry me on Christmas Eve at my Grandparents farm in the middle of a lavender field. I told her we could get married whenever she wanted and that I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. She looked shocked and told me she wasn't ready yet. She wanted me to propose after I had moved back in with her this summer. She thinks we needed to plan our engagement more before she would feel ready.

Needless to say I am pretty upset and I never in a million years thought she would say no. That whole Christmas was awkward and the time since then has been difficult.

It gave me tons to think about and I had a lot of it on my mind when we spoke at length last night. I definitely realized how hard this is going to be for BOTH of us. We agreed that taking this celibacy thing day by day rather than a specific amount of time is going to be more beneficial for our marriage. Although she did give me the occassional green light to have a fling, I won't be taking the opportunity if I can help it, which I think if we both support each other in this thing, I can do.


Me(29), her(27), married for 3 years and have a one year old together.

Our marriage is fantastic, it really is. We love each other and are pretty happy people in general, so when we are together, it's always just great. I'm not sure where to start in order to get all of the facts out there, so please bear with me.

My wife is a very spiritual person. She does not practice any religion, but she definitely gravitates towards eastern philosophy and mostly Buddhism. She is very active in a local Buddhist organization where we live. Her district had a guest speaker come into their ""temple""(It's just a building where they get together and meditate, and I'm not sure what else to call it) last week. This guest speaker talked about his life experiences and his published works, but also spent a great deal of time talking about this ""year to live"" thing he did. It's basically where you seriously pick a day to begin living for the last year of your life as if you were to die in exactly a year. I don't want to get into everything it involves, because that's a whole different story, but in short, she has chosen to participate in this.

Her sexual history is complicated and it has really hindered her life in many ways. Now, although she asked me on my opinion of this before taking the vow, I am now finding myself regretting it.  The year to live thing is tailored to the individual and with the help of her mentor they decided on what courses of action or inaction to take for this ""last"" year. Because of her torrid sexual past, she is very passionate about her vow of celibacy with this. I totally get this, and really do support her in this self growth thing, but fuck...a year with no sex and no sexual acts! 

I love her to death, and although I do support her, I'm having a hard time coping already and it's only been a week. My libido is very high and although masturbation and porn can hold me off, I'm not sure if it will suffice for an entire year. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Our relationship is very open and I honestly know that she would not be upset if I had a one night stand here and there as long as I am safe about it and she knows about it. I guess I'm just hoping for some encouraging words or any advice from someone who has been in a similar situation.

Thanks for everyone's input on the situation; everyone's outlook was helpful. I thought a lot about it and decided not to tell her about finding the letter as I thought it may upset her more. I worked from home today as our dog walker was out of town and my gf isn't yet stable enough to take our puppy out several times a day. I noticed how quiet she was all day and how she has been wearing the same baggy sweatpants since Sunday. I confronted her this evening that she seems really down and upset about things. She broke down and told me that the stress of everything that has occurred lately left her feeling so out of control that she resorted back to the one thing that makes her feel in control, her bulimia.

Me 24f, my boyfriend 26m, together for 4 years.

My BF is friend with this girl, let's call her V, since they're
children. My BF likes V as a friend (I don't mind it at all) but
she's kinda in love with him for years. V asked him out a few times (even
before we were together), he always said that he wanted them to stay friends.

But something came up, V was diagnosed with a brain tumor. A week ago the
doctors told her family that it was the end, she has only a few weeks left.

My BF went to see V 3 days ago, she was very depressed and
afraid to die. She told him that she was in love with him since they're 12 and
asked if they could spend a night together before she dies. My BF didn't
responded, he said he'll talk to me about that, which he did. He said that
this choice was mine.

So here I am, we're all sad about the situation and I have this decision to
make and I **really** don't know what to do. Both choices are awful:

* Refuse a dying girl her last will
* Let my boyfriend cheat

I'm a pretty jealous girl and we're planning our wedding for in a year or two
so that would be really weird to let my BF do that...
V asked my BF to keep this secret so I can't really tell my friends, most of
them know V.

This is so weird Reddit, help me.

I'm making this post because I only just checked into this account recently and had some messages asking for an update. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost nine months now. She'd made it clear pretty early on that something bad had happened to her and it has left her with a bit of anxiety, but it was only in early December that we talked about it a little more. 

She had a very abusive childhood. Her father and older brother used to molest and abuse her, but they moved away when she was thirteen. Then last year her brother moved to her town and started stalking and harassing her before he finally sexually assaulted her again which caused her depression and anxiety to resurface. She then moved away to the city we're currently living in to just try and get away from her brother.

After she told me this I convinced her into getting some help. She's been diagnosed with PTSD and clinical depression and is on some anti-depressants. She's seeing a psychologist weekly at the moment and from what she's told me it seems to help her a fair bit. I'm know she's not going to get over her depression or PTSD in a few sessions and I know it could take a really long time-- or even that it may never fully happen. I'm really happy with our relationship right now, and I know she feels the same. Not much of an update, but it's something!

We've been together for just under 10 years now. These are the deal breakers in no particular order.

-She loves WoW (which is fine) but a good portion of our conversations are about it. I haven't played in years and find the topic tedious. I try to act uninterested or change the subject but it doesn't help.

-She doesn't have her license. Probably not a big deal for some but I have to drive her to work, she's a baker, and it really destroys my sleep patterns. This is becoming a bigger and bigger gripe of mine. I bring it up and she ignores me.

-Poor diet and lack of exercise. Typical, I know. I try to watch what I eat and I run. I want to look good for her, is it too much for me to ask her to do the same?

-A lack of independence. She won't make phone calls for important things for herself like making appointments or banking. If I'm out for the night and there's no food she'll text me saying she's hungry instead of walking a block away to the grocery store.

-She can be a passive aggressive nightmare. Instead of arguing with me she'll just hide in the bedroom all day and not talk. If I leave she'll send me a lengthy text about why's she's upset which just makes me more angry than before.

-She's an introvert. Again, that's totally fine, she wasn't that way when we started dating and I realize people can change. However, I consider myself a pretty active extrovert. Sometimes she'll make me feel guilty for wanting to go out when she just wants me to stay home with her, where she'll just play WoW and I'll just sit there bored on reddit.


Wow. I just made myself really depressed writing all this down. I'm sure there's more I could complain about if I put some thought into it but I think you guys get the idea. If you read this far, thank you! Your advice will be greatly appreciated!

Now I can't handle it and I want out. ,hardlyaperson,238,70,294,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u09mu/destroyed_my_family_with_a_car_accident_that_was/,"My wife (30 f) and I (32 m) have been married five and together seven. Before the car accident my wife and I had an amazing relationship. She was my best friend and our little family was my life. A year and a half ago my wife, who was nine months pregnant at the time,  and I were on our way to the in-laws for a family get-together . The roads were a little slippery thanks to a light rain. My wife and I had been arguing a bit over a job offer I had just received that would involve relocating far from her family. I remember that I was very angry over her inability to be considerate about my needs. I am angry driver normally so this really put me in a bad spot to concentrate on my driving. I was going on and on about the wonderful opportunity that this was and I looked over to notice that she had fallen asleep. I instinctively reached over to wake her up and for some reason I turned the wheel. I lost control of the vehicle, sending us into an embankment. Everyone was wearing a seat belt. The accident caused so much damage to the fetus that it only lived an hour. My wife was left with permanent damage to her spine and is now wheelchair bound, possibly for the rest of her life. She also has problems remembering things thanks to a head injury she got when a tree went through the windshield. She can remember most basic things but she gets confused easily and will sometimes start entire conversations over and over. 

I was banged up for a while after the accident (broken ribs) but for the most part I got pretty lucky. I now spend the majority of my days caring for a wife that is in the situation because I drove angry. 

She really wanted children. We tried for so long. About three years ago she got told it wouldn't happen for her so we invested our entire savings and took out another mortgage to try IVF. The first series failed but we got lucky with a second try. That kid was suppose to be our miracle. 

My wife can't forgive me. She can't forget. She cried all the time. Sometimes she forgets that she lost the baby and touches her stomach and asks me what we will name him. Then she will remember and just lose it all over again. It is soul crushing. 

I recently connected with an old friend from college who has really helped me through the pain. A woman who I know trust with my everything. We fell in love, I am still married to my wife, I am her main caregiver, and I still love her but I don't know if I can be with her anymore. I hate to be thinking this but I would give my everything to move on from this life and start a new one with this new woman. I want to try for kids again and my wife can't. I want to be happy and live a life. The life I live now is nothing. I talk to my wife about it from time to time and she gets notably upset but says she won't keep me from it. I can tell she is shattered though. 

We are both in therapy and the therapist has encouraged us both to stick it out, but I don't think it is worth it. 

Am I a bastard for wanting to leave this situation and move on? Her parents are older and she has no siblings. I honestly don't know who would take care of her. She can do most of the day to day stuff by herself but she does need help lifting herself, remembering things that she forgets to write down, and a few other things. 

I feel guilty but I can't handle it anymore. Any help would be appreciated.

He had plucked his clothes out earlier and just left what he thought was mine behind.  I go to sort mine... and bam, frilly lacey thong.  It's actually kinda fucking cute, but NOT MINE.  I do a load a week usually, but I haven't been completely ""done"" with it all in three weeks so it has to have appeared in the last three weeks.  (establishing a time frame here)

About 2 weeks ago he went to the bar down the street with a friend of his.  *They were there for 5 hours*.  I called him at hour 3 asking how it was going (mostly making sure he wasn't passed out in a ditch somewhere) and some articulate (read: extremely drunk) female yelled something into his phone about me being a whore o.o  Okie dokes...  He said he'd be home in an hour.  Two hours pass and I call him again, he's walking home.  At this point I'm just hoping he had fun but I find it a bit odd that he was at this tiny bar for 5 hours.  

He got home that night fairly drunk and pretty much laid it out this: 1) He'd had ""several women throw themselves at him"" that night 2) He wishes he'd have taken them up on their offers 3) He and I had better start having sex again or our marriage is going to come to an end.  I'm bawling my eyes out by the end of this argument because I pretty much feel like a slab of meat to him.  From the argument, I kinda picked up that he's been trash talking me a bit that night to whoever else he was drinking with because he was awfully riled up.

To explain the absence of sex from our relationship as best I can, when we try penetration it hurts.  (Doctor says its my bone structure?  Still a bit wtf on this one and getting a referral to a gyno)  If I say it hurts and we stop, he gets angry.  I've told him we need to avoid penetration until we get through this and he says he shouldn't need to follow ""a million rules"" about how to touch his wife.  I really don't even like trying anymore because it always leads to a fight.

We've already duked our issues from that night.  We're still not having sex, but we are getting along better in our daily lives.  I imagine he either did cheat on me to some degree or that girl sneakily stuffed her panties in his pocket.  I'm not saying I'm going to leave him for one fuck up, we've gotten through worse.  

Fudge, this is getting ridiculously long.  I truly apologize - if I could explain it in less detail I would.  I'll wrap this up with suggestions from the sidebar... I'm 22, he's 28.  We've been together for 4 years, living together 3 years, and married for 2 years.  

**So my questions are 1) Should I even bring this up again or just file it away?  2)  If so, any tips on how to not be a dick about it?**  I figure if I'm overly direct about it, he's going to lie and that gets us no where.

**TL;DR: Found panties in laundry after husband was out being a drunken hooligan one night.  How to be rational about this?**

He lost over 80 pounds right before we met so I never knew the ""fat"" him, I've only known the stud with the six pack abs.  As time goes on, he's becoming more and more outgoing and likes to meet new people.  This is great but at the same time, this is causing problems.  He went from getting absolutely no attention from women to constantly getting hit on and it makes me nervous/sad/jealous.  I can tell he likes the female attention and that's understandable considering he's been deprived of it almost his entire life but I can't help but feel... jealous.  

It doesn't matter where we go, it seems like women are constantly ogling my boyfriend and/or eye-fucking him.  Yes, he's hot, but he's mine.  On one hand, I want to say something to him but on the other hand, I'm afraid to because I don't want him to think I'm a psycho girlfriend.  

I could definitely see myself getting married to him.  He's *that* kind of guy.  He's special to me and he's not like other men.  My boyfriend treats me extremely well and he doesn't even compare to any of my ex-boyfriends.  I feel like he's in a league of his own - That sounds cheesy but it's the truth.

I won't say I don't know what happened to put it in his head, because I'm pretty sure it was always there, but I don't know what happened in the last two months that made it an absolute requirement for his happiness. 

I know for a fact I wouldn't enjoy it it, based off of previous experiences. I've had sex with a woman before one on one before to experiment and I didn't really enjoy it. After that, with my previous boyfriend, I relented t a MFF threesome and hated everything about it. I didn't enjoy touching her, and I sure as shit did not enjoy watching them fuck. I tried it, and I don't like it. And it that make me a prude or something, then fuck it. I guess I'm a prude. 

My bf constantly brings it up. Before sex, after sex, eating dinner, watching TV. Just constantly. Not only that, but it seems like he already has the whole thing planned out without my permission. He has the girl he wants to do it with picked out, and has even asked her if she's interested. We got into a huge fight about him asking her. To me, that's crossing a major line. I can deal with a little flirting, or him checking out another girl, but seriously. Too much. 

Recently though, he's begun to accuse me of not caring about what he wants after telling him no over and over again. I've explained to him to him before all over the reasons I don't want to, which I think are rather valid, but it doesn't seem to matter. This seems to be his dealbreaker. He absolutely has to do it or he won't be content in life. Have a threesome, or I'm an awful girlfriend. 

Am I being unreasonable? Should I just suck it up and go through with it so he can be happy, and we can drop the whole thing? I'm worried that if I don't, he's just going to go find a way to do it anyway. 

I don't know. There doesn't seem to have a mutual meeting point here. One of us is just going to have to suffer. 

TL;DR: I know from past experience that I want nothing to do with a MFF threesome. My boyfriend acts like his happiness in life absolutely depends on having one. We can't find middle ground.

Thanks so much for all the comments on the original post. It really helped me to make a decision without feeling guilty. I'm very excitedly getting ready for my birthday this weekend! 

I didn't end up confronting the bride, my mum told me that she'd contacted her again and asked if me and my sisters were catering still, I told her no. I had a much more reasonable discussion with my mum this time, I told her my reasoning and she thought it was very fair. She thought it was really strange that I was never contacted directly as I don't live with my Mum, I am an adult renting my own house. She feels like hired help herself when it's her best friend, she said she'll go through with it anyway because the bride has helped her in the past. My sister and I have had a bit of a falling out so I don't know what she's doing. 

I talked briefly to my Dad who had no idea that the wedding was this weekend. He was surprised at first, then said while he was friends with the husband to be before, after the divorce of the bride to be and her first husband (who was my dads best friend and friend to me that committed suicide) he was very flustered and strange whenever he saw him. Apparently he'd always be asking my Dad about how the marriage was between his now fiance and her then husband. He must have felt guilty about jumping straight into his friends ex-wifes bed and expected my Dad to have an issue with him which he never has. Dad kind of shrugged it off, said he'll send them his well wishes and that it's sad 20+ years of friendship has all turned out like this.  

Glad I'm not going to be a part of this weird emotionally charged wedding. 

TL;DR happily not going to the wedding. The no invitation seems to be caused by the husband to be's cowardly attitude

** ****** **

First of all, I just want to give a big shout out and thanks to CasualCrab for his/her help in calling the local polizei and a few other places for me. Thank you, also, to r/relationships for being so supportive and encouraging.

This morning, Marco [messaged back and gave me a number to reach Jorg at] (http://i.imgur.com/KJNkW.png). I had woken up at 6am from yet another nightmare, so I immediately loaded up my Skype credits and made the call.

First try, some lady picked up, didn't understand a single word of my English, rambled at me in angry-sounding German, and then hung up.

Second try, this time I entered ""bitte kann ich Jorg sprechen"" into Google Translate and hit the audio pronunciation with the volume all the way up. The man who answered goes, ""Ah yes! Jorg! He is with his mother, please call back later.""

Well, I have to be in lecture later. In fact, I have to be in lecture all day ""later."" (Tuesdays are one of my worst days, with nearly 8 hours of lecture nonstop, and I couldn't focus at all.) Throughout the day, I texted dozens of my German-speaking friends asking if they could help me make another call around 10:30pm PST, but everyone was either leaving for Thanksgiving or was too busy.

I spent the entire day biting my nails.

10pm, my roommate and I spent half an hour practicing our German using Google translate.

10:30pm, I made the call a third time with my heart in my throat. I squeaked out a ""Hello, sprechen sie englisch? Can I speak to Jorg?"" and he answered.

Drumroll, please?

** ****** **

Turns out the majority of you were correct in assuming that he had been committed to a hospital/rehab of sorts. His parents were concerned at how hard he was working and how stressed he constantly was. Jorg, himself, felt like he was diving headfirst into the dirt so they made a decision together to get a psychiatric evaluation and get some rest in a rehab ward for exhaustion.

I'm beyond relieved that I know where he is now, and that he's safe, but after hearing his voice, I immediately broke into very very angry sobs. The amount of stress and worry he had put me through this last week and a half... well, that doesn't matter. At least I know he's okay now.

Apparently, he's still planning on coming to California in the spring to do the whole visiting scholar thing for the law school, and is still flying to Florida this winter. I don't know how much I believe him because I'm scared of putting too much trust in him, but we'll see.

Thank you again, Reddit, for helping me through this scary time.

Lately, I started seeing some warning signs and she said some weird things to me.  One night she didn't come back until the next morning and insisted she fell asleep at her friends.  Another night I went to sleep and woke up to her coming back at 4:30 am - I didn't worry too much because I've had those nights, but after the other occurrence it bothered me.  After a recent fight she brought up seeing other people (well first she said just I should which I found deeply troubling), but then dropped it.  I didn't convince her out of it, we came to a mutual understanding and were going to focus on our relationship.

Last night, she was going to go out with some friends, but never left and just stayed in and drank with me.  When I asked why she wasn't going out she just said she changed her mind (but she already did her hair and got dressed?  That never happens).   Pathetic me... I looked through her text messages when she fell asleep.

Turns out she cheated on me.  

She was constantly deleting his texts and only had the last two days worth.  She was going to go out with him that night but he had gotten high and fell asleep (yea he's a real winner).  I made some racket and she woke up - I confronted her immediately about it.

She confessed that she had sex with him, and of course, it was a huge mistake.  Between what she told me and what I know, she has been seeing him for about a month and only about 3-4 times total.

**[EDIT]** He is a coworker of hers for a job that ended last week.

I told her it was over between us (I thought I would have shouted more, but is was mostly just sadness).  We were up for hours, her groveling for me to keep her, and me trying to accept what happened and not give in.

She then told me that the last time she saw him, he had insisted on not using a condom which she said no to, and he tried to force himself on her.  She told me she was only meeting with him again (at a bar) to confront him about it.  I don't know if this is true, but even if it is true and she was breaking it off, I can only believe that she would have kept seeing him if he hadn't turned out to be such an enormous douche.

This morning I made her pack her things (not all of her things, sadly) and made her leave.  She is absolutely desperate to get me back.

I am furious at her and I have been extremely militant responding to her saying basically that we are done and that we don't have a future.  

I am so angry and disappointed, but I am struggling.  I've never been this sad before and I still love her.  I feel like I shouldn't give her a second chance, but I feel empty without her and I know she loves me.

Do I give her a second chance, or should I go through with completely breaking things off?.

**tl;dr gf of 1 1/2 years cheated on me and I'm having trouble breaking it off because I still love her.**

**[UPDATE]**

Thank you so much for the responses &lt;333

I texted her that the ""rape thing"" was complete bullshit, I was packing her things, and I am getting tested (scheduled Tuesday).  She told me that she only saw him to smoke and talk about work and didn't mean to have sex, and didn't expect to the next time LOL.  THE BEST PART: she amazingly told me in the same text message that she had become infatuated with him.  Sooo she secretly saw a guy she had feelings for expecting to drink and smoke but not have sex, and then not for that to happen the next time... and she didn't bother addressing the dressed up bar thing.

After pressing her more, she finally gave up trying to get me back and is all ""maybe we shouldn't be together""...

Today was crazy tough and you guys made it much better.  I've still got some more tears to cry and shit to throw, but I'm going to make it through this one.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to rub one out and play borderlands with my dude.

Everyone, I have an anti-climatic and, for me, heartbreaking ending to this story. I haven't posted an update since because I couldn't bring myself to post it sooner, due to being drunk and upset most of that time. 

I told her to quit her job, that was the only way I could be sure the affair would end. She argued it wasn't easy to get another one but eventually reluctantly agreed to do it. I also informed her that I'd planned to invite my friend along with us. Here, she told me to stop talking. 

She then basically told me she didn't want to be with me any longer. She originally said she wanted to stay with me for the children but now realises she can't stay with me anymore. Apparently I'm not attractive, dull, bad in bed, each reason felt like a crushing blow to my confidence and my heart, as cliché as that sounds. She told me this on Saturday morning. 

She left an hour later with her stuff to go to his place (for those who said, he hasn't got a wife. He is divorced.), I informed my friend and my parents, they had the kids for an extra couple of days. I'm actually glad I didn't have to go through this meeting, as she probably would have ended it there in front of him which would have been more embarrassing. 

I'm going to speak to a lawyer and begin divorce proceedings at the end of the week. I'm temporarily looking after the children at the minute, although she's coming over tomorrow to see them. 

This is the end of my marriage, I didn't realise how not in love my wife was. She's obviously never felt the same for me, this will take some time to get over.

But I'm worried I might just be bored.",Desolationrow122,205,41,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jx2lj/i_32m_dont_think_im_happy_in_my_marriage_anymore/,"We have two kids, 2 and 6. I'm the stay home dad, my wife is the Ivy-league educated bread-winner. We got married six years ago -- we've been together for 3 years before then -- when she(we?) got pregnant with our son. We decided I'm going to be a stay home dad (I never went to college, spent most of my 20's as a member of a death metal band that never amounted to anything) and that sounded fair. I even liked the idea, actually. I felt lucky. So many books to read, so many movies to watch. I even like to cook.

Well, fast-forward six years and my day in-day out existence is killing me. I feel lonely, unappreciated... Unwanted. We have sex maybe once two weeks and it's the kind of sex that makes me feel empty afterwards. I want to say it's mechanical, but that's not it. I think a better way to put it might be... She treats sex like it's something she has to do for my sake and I can tell. She doesn't come, but tells me that ""it's okay"". That she doesn't mind. I try to make her to come but she always conjures up some kind of an excuse and then tells me ""I don't want to fake it and lie to you."" I proposed ideas to spice it up, but she doesn't like toys and thinks any kind of role-playing is ""silly"". (To be fair, she did give it a chance and it was silly.) I point-blank asked her what her fantasies are and she said she ""doesn't have any"". I was actually surprised at this and didn't believe her at first, but she re-assured me until I believed her. Now, I genuinely think she's telling the truth. I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse. Also, I should add, I have a 1/100 chance of getting sex any time I try to initiate.

And here's the worst part: I love my wife, I really do. She's strong and trust-worthy and lovely. I know I can depend on her. She's a great mother and a great wife. She's rational and loving, and I would jump into a volcano for her in a heartbeat. But lately, it feels like we're just roommates or something. And it didn't used to be this way. When we first met, we were all over each other and we fucked like rabbits. And, trust me, she came back then. We had a ""bedroom towel"" because she'd get so ridiculously wet.

I love my kids and they're also strictly filed under the category ""people I would jump into a volcano for"". It's just... I'm not sure I particularly adore being a ""parent"". I know that sounds fucking awful but there is a loneliness to it that I wasn't prepared for. And there's a stigma -- stigma is the wrong word, but bear with me -- to being the dad who takes care of the kids. I can't socialize with the other mom's (this isn't anyone's fault but everyone is so visibly uncomfortable) and people look at me like a failure. Example: My father-in-law, who is a mix between a bully and a clown, is always saying stupid shit. It's so obvious that he doesn't think I'm worthy of his little girl and that's fine. That's his opinion. But the fucker actually, and I swear, I'm not exaggerating this, told my wife that ""he found her second husband"" and gave her some guy's business card. While I was there. When I acted surprised, he gave me the ""Relax, I'm just breaking your balls"" routine but who the fuck does that. I wanted to fucking punch him.

I feel trapped and soul-sapped. I feel powerless. I feel like pre-cancer-diagnosis Walter White. And, at the same time, I feel guilty for feeling like this because, hey, talk about a first world problem. I'm well-taken care of, I have a lovely wife, I have two smart children. Meanwhile, all but one of my friends is already divorced and one of them is going through an ugly custody battle.

Last week I was having a beer with one my buddies, the still-married one, and I started talking with a twenty-something red-head who was sitting next to me at the bar. (Just to be clear, I wasn't hitting on her, I didn't even initiate the conversation, she thought I was someone she knew.) We joked around -- she called me boring, I retorted that I used to be in a metal band -- and I made her laugh. I was smooth, I was a... person. Nothing happened, obviously, but I just couldn't not think about her for the rest of the day. Now, I'm not stupid, I know I wasn't really attracted to her. It was the idea of her. My coke-head father left my mom and me for an insane twenty two year old when he was around my age and I wouldn't do that to my family. Or to myself, for that matter.

Sorry, this is pouring out. I just don't know what to do. Maybe I'm depressed? Maybe I need some kind of a medication? Or is this normal? Is this how I'm supposed to feel? Is this just another stage of the human experience? Should I just suck it up, because, fuck it, some children in Africa are dying of hunger every six seconds and I'm here whining. I mean, actually, fuck that, I don't need to go to another continent, just looking through the problems people have here -- drug addiction, dealing with violent, insane people -- my problems are just funny in comparison. But it feels really real to me.

Anyway, I'm just gonna shut up and press enter now. Thanks for reading. Sorry I rambled.

So, to make a long story short... I told my parents everything. How and where we met, my plans on moving to the Netherlands to be with him as well as school (and not *only* just school), how well he treats me, etc. Went out on a date with him this past weekend, stayed out until 1 am. No fucks given--told my parents straight up ""I'm going out with him and will be home later. I have my phone and it's always on. Call me if you need me. I will be safe!""

And you know what? *They treated me like an adult.* Said ""ok, have fun! If you two are going to be in a relationship, you'll need to see each other. Be safe and make sure he respects you.""

The next morning when dad asked me what time I had gotten home (he was already asleep), he joked ""why so early?"" and smiled.

I didn't want to sleep over SO's house to show them that he's a gentleman and he respects their wishes of me not sleeping over there again until they've met him. If all goes well, I should be bringing SO over to my place tonight after work to meet my folks (and cats).

So, as tactfully as possible, and after I couldn't take the extreme touchy-feely and him literally sitting on top of me while I tried to wind down after work and reply to texts, facebook messages, etc. I had received throughout the day in privacy, I suggested we talk.

I tried not to get into too much detail, because I wanted to be as not-hurtful as possible. Keep it clean, so to speak. 

I said to him straight up that he just wasn't what I was expecting and I didn't have any romantic feelings, and I wasn't comfortable with how things were heading. I said that this sadly didn't translate as well to real life as I had hoped, and surely not how he had hoped either. 

He seemed completely fine with me in real life vs. internet - I was apparently the only one having the trouble conditioning myself to the fact that he was nothing in person like he portrayed himself on the internet....

He gave me the silent treatment, I asked if he would talk through what he was thinking, but he refused. I said that anything he decided to do would be fine at that point, if he wanted to stay he could have my couch or daughters room (she was away for the week), or he could find a hotel, or he could use my phone and internet to change flights if need be. Whatever he wanted to do.

He went off to my loungeroom to sulk, and proceeded to fall asleep. I brought him a blanket so he'd still be comfortable in the night.

The next morning, I went to work. I asked if he wanted me to drop him anywhere so he could go exploring, and he asked if he could just stay at my house. I agreed, and told him I was putting a lot of trust in him being at my place considering I don't know him at all in real life, and to please respect my privacy.

When I came home from work, we talked briefly. He was irate, very bitchy. I said I wasn't comfortable with where the conversation was heading, and I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable even with him just around me.

He asked to use my phone and computer to check flights and hotels, I agreed. He spent an hour searching info and calling numbers. He told me he had already spent the day looking up this info, so I'm not sure why it took so long. Anyway, he eventually booked a hotel, and asked me to drive him there.

On the way he was digging for more information about why I don't feel a connection. I didn't want to say ""because I find you as repulsive as a Gollum physically and the idea of you flopping around on me makes me physically sick, and you're bland and boring as hell - sitting behind you while you go through every friend on your Facebook, telling me stories about every single one of them, for HOURS, is not fun!!!"", because that is hurtful, I just simply repeated myself that I don't feel what I thought I would, and I don't feel comfortable around him.

He got very bitchy at this point.

He mentioned that my house was ""easy to break into"", because he locked himself out but got himself back in.

He said, in a very condescending manner, that running away from everything that makes me uncomfortable is an excellent way to live my life.

He said he wouldn't give me an apology for anything.

I simply said that I am not asking for an apology, just respect.

Curiosity got me and I checked my internet history....he was at my house all day, after all. He spent most of the day creeping my male facebook friends.

He knew I was going to my best friends leaving party on the weekend, and was conveniently outside the bar (which he knew the party was at, since it was set as a public event).

And today I found out that he had asked a mutual friend of ours to spy on me and report back to him anything I say about him (after he had a dig at me in one of his statuses about ""unexpected hotel costs""). But I am not the kind of person to unleash personal info on my friends in such a public manner like that....I apologised to our friend that he was dragged into high-school drama that is so petty and incomprehensible. 

He sent me a huge email outlining everything he liked about me, hated about me, and the whole thing boiled down to him wanting me because I am ""hot"", and that I am apparently lying to myself and I'm a narcissist, all while admitting he has a big ego...

Honestly, he really, really shouldn't have a big ego. :/ 

He also said that a working relationship doesn't need the ""feeling"" I am after romantically.


Let's just say, I am really happy I dodged this bullet, but I wish I anticipated this sooner :( Thanks for the advice guys. It's been REALLY hard taking the high road on this one.

**TLDR** He turned into an entitled brat who attempted to pressure and guilt me into being with him, and recruited mutual friends to try do this for him also, after I said I don't feel comfortable around him and don't see us working.

1360033297.0,165,self.relationships,17wrf5,UPDATE: Me (F24) - My son's father (M24) picked my son up from daycare on Monday and haven't heard from either of them since,madjack818,199,34,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17wrf5/update_me_f24_my_sons_father_m24_picked_my_son_up/,"[Link to first part] (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17ocfy/me_f24_my_sons_father_m24_picked_my_son_up_from/)

Okay. So there were quite a few questions in response to my first post, so I'll try to answer a few of the most common ones before I get started.

1. If your family was helping your ex, are you sure **you're** not the bad parent here? You're really making yourself look like a saint. A. Yes. Positive. I was a rowdy teenager before I joined the military, but I grew up when I became a mother. I had pretty bad postpartum depression, probably due mostly to my ex's controlling/abusive ways and the servicemember's irrational fear of seeking mental health aid. I could have said no to the one year overseas assignment, but because he had me convinced I was a shitty mother, I thought they were better off without me. Two months into my assignment and finally seeking help with my depression, I filed for divorce.

2. Your ex's brother his helping him? Your husband's brother? I'm so confused. A. This is my sister's husband, who is also my ex's best friend and employer.

3. What sort of custody agreement do you have? A. None. We have joint custody and a divorce decree that does not specify any kind of visitation rules; I know now this was badly done and a huge mistake on my part for agreeing to it. Again, I never set foot in a courtroom, and had no idea what I was doing.

4. Was all this in Texas or Oklahoma? A. We were married and divorced in Oklahoma, I only mentioned Texas because all of my ex's family is there and I was concerned that he had run off to there.

5. WTF?!? WHY YOU WEIGH YOUR SON AFTER DAD'S HOUSE?!? A. It started as a sort-of growth chart. His doctor has always mentioned that he seems underweight for his age, so I started tracking it. Obviously, the only times I could weigh him were when he was with me, and I started to notice that he was not only not gaining any weight over like 5-6 months, but that he was actually LOSING weight after having been at his dad's.

7. Child support? A. I never asked for any, I knew my ex didn't have the money for it. Apparently, OK has guidelines somewhere mandating child support from the father to the mother (WTF?) so the judge awarded me a whopping $43 a month. I've never gone after my ex for it and he's never paid it, because *$43 a month*

If I missed any other major questions, let me know. Otherwise, back to the story...

The first lawyer I met with, on Tuesday, seemed really pessimistic about the whole thing, telling me that I might not only not get full custody, but that I might also be required to pay child support to my ex. He also recommended getting a second opinion. Done. *next*

Quick sidebar: I did receive some texts from my ex finally, stating that he would continue to keep my son from me until I agreed to his new custody order, formalizing the every other week plan (okay, no problem) and putting in writing that my son would attend school in the school district in which my ex lives. The reason I won't agree to the school district is because, being in the military, I might have to move. I'm not going to set that in stone.

Any requests regarding when I can see my son again are met with 'not until you sign my paperwork' from my ex. He did not return my son to me on Sunday and took my name off the list at my son's daycare, essentially preventing me from picking him up. I haven't tried going up there with my divorce decree in hand; will try.

My sister has now openly involved herself, telling me to just agree because that school district is the best in the state and 'custody agreements shouldn't be this hard'. That I should remember to keep my son's best interests at heart, and that he just 'lights up when his dad walks in the room'. My brother-in-law's business (painting/siding/general home repairs) is their larger source of income, and they've hit a dry spell with jobs lately. My parents were going to give them some jobs to help them get through a slow time, but are now refusing until they fire my ex-husband. While I certainly appreciate having such support, I cringe a little inside at the divide this has caused in my family. 

I have spoken with *quick tally in brain* 6 or 7 lawyers since this started. I'm doing research and shopping around this time, because I went with the first lawyer I talked to when I got my divorce and ended up in my current debacle.

The plan now is full custody, with supervised visitation. I helped cover up many of my ex's mistakes in the past so he could continue to be with his son. Never once have I tried to keep my son away from his father. He told me very early on in the day on Monday that he was going to pick up our son from daycare, and I said okay. Then he did this.

After my several calls to the police department to have them to welfare checks at my ex's house, along with the two conversations with my sister, I have come to some conclusions: 1. My ex is not staying at his house and 2. They are staying at my sister's house; she is not only housing them, but suffering financial strain as a result of this mess.

I have appointments with three lawyers tomorrow, and will have started court proceedings by the end of the week.

Following the advice of several lawyers, DHS, police, JA, and Family Advocacy, I have started gathering my evidence. I have photos and the insurance claim paperwork from when my ex fell asleep at the wheel with our (then 9 month old) son in the car, rolling off the highway, and submitted a records request to the relevant police department for the actual police report of the incident. I have photos my ex sent me while on that trip (unfortunately with no datestamp) showing him letting our son play with a hunting rifle. I have the medical records that show that his father was denied clearance to come with me overseas, as well as documentation from a mediator showing that HE would not allow ME to take our son with me. I have submitted another request for the police report from the one time I actually called for help when he was beating me(he'd loaded a shotgun and pointed it in my face), and have some of the documentation of the marital counseling and hoops I had to jump through as a result. Turns out the state we lived in at the time doesn't register firearms, so no help there trying to show how he would take most of my paycheck and buy guns and ammo. I have pictures of the bug bites from his dad's house. I have backed up and exported copies of all of his texts to me.

There's more, but honestly.... WHY didn't this occur to me sooner?! I tried for so long to help him still see his dad. I never wanted to take him away from his father, but going through all this has made it so clear to me that I should have at least fought for full custody from the start.

To quote a line (in various forms) from MANY novels: Wishes build no bridges. I've got to work with things the way they are, and hope for the best. Thank you to everyone who offered advice, questioned OP, and sent hopeful messages my way after my first post!

Background: Husband (48) and his ex-wife divorced 2 years prior to my meeting him. Ex-wife cheated on him, asked for the divorce, remarried her lover and had more kids - all this happened prior to my meeting my husband. They had joint custody, but the kids primarily lived with their mother since my husband had to move to another state for his job. 

When I met my husband, his son was 11 and daughter (Jen) was 9. They are now 23 and 21, respectively. My stepson and I have good relationship (he calls me for Mother's Day, texts me every so often, etc.). I've tried to do as much as I can for the kids (my friends think I've gone overboard), even as far as when Jen's mom and my husband couldn't take her on her college tour, I drove Jen cross country (just me and her) to visit universities she was interested. She now attends one of those schools. 

However, Jen has always had issues with me being the ""other woman"" in Daddy's life and has repeatedly done things to make me look bad. I've let it go before thinking, she's just a kid, she wants to be Daddy's little girl, she doesn't get to see her Dad very often, etc. etc. But now I think my tolerating all this may have created a monster and I need to put a stop to it. 

Current situation: My husband has a new job (same company, but different position) and now travels 4-5 days a week. He's always been crazy busy with work, so sometimes communication with the kids tends to fall on my shoulders. Not a big deal, I accept I married into a family and as a step mom, that's part of the package. 

We live quite a distance from the kids, so this summer (as we do every summer) we started making plans for them to come visit us. Jen is taking summer courses at university and is only free on certain dates. My husband can't take off during that time *at all* (busy work period). So he and I discuss that (since he's traveling), I will send her an email letting her know that we'd love for her to come this summer, but Dad is only going to be home ~3 days a week for the 3 weeks she's here. I sent her a nice long note saying I'd love to have her come and spend time with me, but we just want her to be aware that Dad is traveling a lot in his new job. Either way, she and I would have a ball &amp; we could do a lot of great stuff together - we live in a really fun town (she's never been here before) and I won't be working when she visits. 

Jen responds to me with an email saying, ""No problem, we'll have a great time, even if Dad isn't there!"" 

Jen simultaneously sends her Dad an email message (he showed me) saying, ""[Stepmom] said I **ought not to visit** because you'll be traveling."" (Followed by a lot of sad smiley faces).  I proceed to show my husband the email I sent her &amp; her response. He acknowledges that my email *in no way* could have been taken to mean she ""ought not to come"" and he even goes as far as to say she's being a brat, trying to stir trouble. But he won't call her on it, saying I should let it go, ""She's just a kid"". 

I consulted my sister-in-law and she (on the mark) said, ""Jen just wants her dad to change his work plans, so she feels important. You know how she is…"" 

TL; DR: My stepdaughter has repeatedly twisted my words and thrown me under the bus for no reason other than to get Daddy's attention. I tolerated it before, but she's now 21. Is it time to start calling her on this stuff?

**Edit: Wow, guys… didn't expect this kind of response. Thanks for taking the time to give your feedback. I sincerely appreciate it.** 

I've tried to respond where clarification was needed, but my key take aways for now are:
 
* She's an adult now (THANK YOU for agreeing with me on this). I can *and should* address this with her. Not in a confrontational way, but rather to let her know that it hurt my feelings to hear she felt unwelcome after my email saying just the opposite.

* Let her know that Dad &amp; I share our emails and conversations (so that she knows better than to try pull this crap again).

* My husband needs to step up more (wish me luck). 

* As a couple we need to time our interaction with the kids better. In this instance, we both agreed to contact Jen &amp; let her know her dad's travel schedule. It wasn't that he was throwing it over the fence at me, we just assumed it wouldn't matter who told her about it as long as she was made to feel welcome. We should have timed it where he called her up *first* to say he wasn't going to be around and *then* I should have sent my email officially ""inviting"" her.

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jczw1/update_i_21f_turned_my_little_brother_17m_in_to/)

I don't have much to update on the situation with DFCS, but I found out for sure today that they're actively trying to get pregnant again.  And have been for 1.5 months, apparently.  Never mind the fact that they contribute absolutely $0 financially to caring for the two existing children, and never mind that they don't even seem to like those two... they're trying to have another.

I'm talking to him about it right now.  Alice was just diagnosed with very early stage endometriosis.  Here is what he said:  

""Yes we have thought about it alot and talked to the ob/gyn about what the endometriosis can do during pregnancy and he said that it wouldn't affect the pregnancy at all that being pregnant would actually help the pain because the increase in hormones would dry up the infected tissue for a short while.  We want to have one before the endo spreads because he said it will eventually scar the fallopian tubes and make it harder for her to get pregnant.  He also said that the only 100% cure for the disease was a hysterectomy.  Trust me I know everything is confusing but it just seems like this might be the only chance we would get before things get bad.  I am going to all these hiring agencies as soon as I turn 18 and I am also working on this house alot.""

I'm trying to reason with him that endometriosis doesn't just advance overnight and that it would be far more responsible to wait at *least* a few months and make sure he has some sort of stable job and a safe place to live.  I brought up that the baby is in a struggle for weight gain right now (they still blame it on her reflux so it's a valid argument in their eyes) and they should focus on getting her healthy before having another.

I also brought up the complications with both of Alice's previous pregnancies and the likelihood for a repeat preterm birth, and just generally how they aren't prepared in any way to raise another newborn.  None of it seems to be getting across.  They are determined to keep playing house, and they are about to bring another living person into their games.

Any ideas for how I can make him see reason?  Is it hopeless?

I am (18/f). When I was in 5th grade my parents divorced, sending my mom on a downwards spiral. She became and alcoholic and was abusive toward my little sister and I. My dad got custody of us when I was a sophomore in high school, and my mom moved to Pittsburg (a couple hours away from where I live) with a boyfriend. He knocked 4 of her teeth out. She had previously been engaged to a different boyfriend, and gotten pregnant and miscarried with another. Also the one she had been engaged to introduced her to heroin, which she is now addicted to as well. 

When I was a junior in high school my dad and his new wife and my sister moved to a new town, and I stayed in the old one to finish high school. I moved in with my friend and started working at Taco Bell so I could pay her mom rent. My mom moved to Santa Cruz (4 hours away) with a new boyfriend, who got her pregnant last month. This is probably the 15th guy since my dad, she goes through them pretty quickly.

She was in and out of the hospital for the last year, couldn't come to my high school graduation because she had attempted suicide by swallowing pills, and was in the hospital. I haven't seen her in months.

**Current problem:**

Today, she called me (Her old phone was disconnected so I had no means of getting ahold of her before, she always just calls me when she wants to) and said that she and Michael (her boyfriend) were broken up, and she needed to stay with me. I live with two of my friends in an extremely small camper, there are only 2 beds. She is going to come over tomorrow and spend the night, but I don't know how that could work permanently, especially since she is unemployed and we can barely afford our monthly bus passes as it is, let alone groceries. She is pregnant, and she has nowhere else to go. What do I do?

Thank you everyone for responding to me, I have read and considered all of your posts.

I told my mom she could come over and stay only one night, but she isn't here and she hasn't called me (said she would by 10:00 a.m. it is now 1:00 p.m.) I called the number she called me on yesterday and the woman said that she had left. I don't have any other way of contacting her. I'm kind of freaking out right now. But I shouldn't have actually let myself believe that she would come over because she has always been a flake.

I have known her all of my life, and I am very close to her and her family.  I love her very, very much.  I do not love her SO (24m) so much. 
  For context: they have been together for about 2 years on and off.  They broke up after a few months of dating due to him being emotionally abusive.  I was none too thrilled to hear that they got back together, and then she broke the news that she was pregnant.  I was devastated, but I supported her.
  He stayed by her side through the pregnancy, and he moved in with her and her parents to help care for the baby (she also has another child from a previous relationship).  He proposed to her, and they decided to have a short engagement.  She asked me to be the Maid of Honor, and I agreed.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt and was actually kind of happy for them. 
 The last couple of weeks I could tell something was wrong.  She finally told me he had called off the wedding, and had left her.  She told me again of all the horrible things he had said and done.  She swore she was done, deserved better.  
 Now, a week later, the wedding is back on.  She asked me if I would still be a part of the wedding, and I refused.  I did not say anything negative to her, I let her know that I am still her for her, but I just can't stand in a wedding that I am not truly behind.

I have never, in my entire life, wanted children but was willing to have a child for my husband or adopt at some point in the future. He does want children, but I am just starting to get recognition in my career and he hasn't had a steady job since 2009. The longest he has stayed with a company was 8 months. Due to my long hours and our meager income I felt like it wasn't a great time to have a child and though he tried to dissuade me, I did end up convincing him to agree.

I've found out that since the day of my abortion, he has been lying to me about various things I'd rather not speak about. Not cheating, but just him doing things behind my back involving work/friends/money. 

This all came out after an incident last week led to me to snooping around. I asked him about why he was doing these things and he said that since the abortion, he has just not seen me in the same way. That he desperately wants a child/family, and while he loves me he just feels that I will not bear him children, and thus he feels less need to act like a responsible adult/husband.

I don't know where to go from here. Honestly my trust is completely shattered from all the secrets. I had no feelings about the abortion until now, and now I feel so guilty. I think about our inability to raise a child and I feel even more guilty. I am also pretty upset that he didn't come to me sooner and tell me he was having regrets, and that he chose to punish me for it all this time instead after he gave me the go ahead. 

How do we talk through this? I'm just not sure what to say to make him feel better, or how to accept the fact that he has been lying to me for months, or worse---how to accept the fact that he lied because of my actions. I'm sorry if this is a controversial subject, but thank you for any advice you can offer.

**TL;DR: I(25) had an abortion. My husband(28) is not handling it well. How do I make this better?**

**Edit:** Umm geez, I didn't realize this would be such a sensitive subject for so many people. To answer a few questions:

1. Of course my husband knew I didn't want children before we were married. It is not a secret, it is something that I have said over and over to everyone around me. But really, I'm 100% okay with having children for his sake. During our engagement, we agreed that we would have children **A)** after I graduated from college and  **B)** once he got to the point where he made over $x a year. I would be a SAHM until all the children were in grade school, and then we would decide if we wanted to home school or figure something else out. This is what we **both** wanted. Neither of us want to send our children to daycare, and both of us want to make the most financially sound decision as to how much we work. In 2009 I was a junior in college and my husband was due to make $x, right on schedule. Suddenly the company he had been with since college decided to sell to a larger one and lay everyone off, with offers to rehire for an insulting amount. He sent out applications for ELEVEN months until he got a call back, still from someone wanting to hire him for less than he was making before. He quit just before I graduated, because they were horrible. 
So I went to work, because I could and because I had to. But my career is no where as lucrative as his and will never be. A child right now would mean we have to go back to only being able to enjoy our lives when my husband is working, scraping by when he is not. No college fund, limited attention, and few of the experiences that a child deserves to have. When I said I ""convinced"" my husband, this is what I meant. Only that I presented this information to him. I thought that he understood and agreed with me. I cannot raise a child the way I want to and the way HE wants to, without our income being higher. Even if that means that I have to work harder so he can stay at home, it's okay. But I can't give that to him right now. If I wanted to make this decision by myself, I would have had the abortion in secret and not have told him. I told him because I wanted us to come to an agreement. It is clear that y'all feel he was bullied and I see that now. I wish I had seen it then. I truly thought that he could see it was not the right time. I never wanted to wait this long to have a baby either, and I do wish we had had the chance to have a child when I was younger. I understand that he wants a child regardless of our situation, and this pregnancy has only made him desire one even more greatly.

2. This is not a simple predicament and I am very sorry for what I have done to my husband. I am sorry to all of you if I came across as being self-absorbed. My question I meant to ask was, ""how can I fix this for my husband?"" It was not, ""how should I put my husband in his place?"" I know that what happened is my fault and I am not trying to blame him for the way he is feeling.

3. This was not a planned pregnancy. We have never, ever had another pregnancy scare in all our years together. I wanted to go off the pill and switch to the IUD. My husband didn't want me to get an IUD because he was worried it would poke him. We used condoms. It slipped off for the first time ever. He said he hadn't cum yet. I didn't take Plan B because I thought recent research had shown the pull out method to be effective. It was a mistake and I recognize that this was also my fault. I am back on the pill and we are still arguing about the IUD.

4. I have spoken to him and he seems more settled now that it is out in the open. I think he just wants to be comforted. We'll see what happens.

Me and my husband have been married for almost a year now. About 10 months ago he told me while we were just cuddling and chatting that he wishes i had a beach body. He said it is his preference. He said he would be more attracted to me. I was pretty shocked, because i never though he's not fine with my body, because i liked myself exactly how i was.

After that all kind of bad things came to my mind, i was comparing myself with his ex partners. He is my first serious relationship, my first love and my first sex partner. Unfortunately he lost his virginity a month before we met with a random woman in his car. That just bugs me so so so much. I know it is normal to have more than one partner in your life, obviously, but I promised myself that i will give my virginity to a guy i will marry with. I just feel betrayed. I know i can't blame him, it is not his fault. How the hell was he supposed to know that he will meet with his future wife a month after.

I asked him if her ex partner was skinnier than me and he said ""what do you think my answer will be? Isn't it obvious?"" he basically told me that she was skinnier every single way. I am not dumb. I know exactly that do not ask questions which answers you don't wanna hear. But i am so broken that nothing can hurt me more than this. 

I was a really confident girl but now i can't even stand naked in front of my husband. Every time i have to i feel like i can't hold it back and i'm gonna cry. I don't want to make him feel bad. I'm 174(5 feet, 8 inches and a half) cm tall and i weight currently 70(154 lbs) kg. He said that i'm chubby. I just hate that the one person i care the most in the whole world (literally) is saying things like this to me.

However, i have decided not to cry my eyes out anymore and i am gonna have this crappy beach body and i am gonna be confident again. I've been trying to find a good picture about a girl with a great body to motivate me, but i don't even know what a good beach body looks like. 

I just need some advice. Please help, maybe you have some experience with that.

tl;dr - I have huge insecurity issues because my husband tells me that he wishes me to have a beach body. Im depressed and not happy. His previous relationship with his ex sex partner bugs me daily because he keeps saying that i'm chubby and the ex was skinnier in every way.

  Last night, this friend and I were hanging out, having some drinks, and watching TV. I can't usually stay up as long as he can, so I told him that I was going to my room to sleep, and that he could hang out watching TV as long as he wanted. I went to my bedroom and immediately fell asleep.

I was then awakened again to him touching me in a more private place.

They were together 5 years, engaged, and a month from their wedding. This was 2 years ago. She died suddenly from a brain aneurysm. The weird thing is, my last ex had a dead girlfriend too and dating him was strange, to say the least. 

I just found this out last week when I met his parents. I understand his apprehension in talking about it early on. I want to be supportive, but it still makes me feel strange. He doesn't have photos of her around, but his parents do. Their engagement photos are prominently displayed in their home. It's not like, one or two either. They even have them hanging in the guest bathroom. He told me he feels weird about the photos (I didn't even mention them) but that his parents loved her so much. 

Honestly, I am not sure if I can deal with it. I like him enough, but I don't know if I'm prepared to be his first girlfriend after the death of his fiance. It has only been a few months, we haven't exchanged L words yet, and he seems like he digs me but I don't feel like there is a strong enough connection yet for me to want to deal with this.

Am I a coward for wanting to back away from this relationship? My last ex's girlfriend died in a car accident a year before we started dating. I couldn't deal with it then. There is something different about being with someone whose relationship ended tragically like that. His parents loved his ex too, and couldn't stop talking about her in front of me. Even TO me. They'd say things like ""It's too bad you couldn't meet Christie. She loved animals,"" when I told them I was a vet tech... Uh... Ok...

I don't want to let him get very close to me and THEN let myself realize that it's too heavy for me. Is this an apprehension I should bring up before backing off? Do I just need to get over it and deal with it? What about his parents? They didn't mention her at dinner BUT it seemed like there were times they ALMOST did. 

tl;dr Boyfriends ex died. Not sure if I can deal with the dynamics of that again. What can I do?

We have been together since high school (7 1/2 years) with the occasional bump in the road.  It's been 2 years since our last real fight and things have been great.  We are both very happy together and I think it's time to make it formal.


My boyfriend has expressed frequently, especially lately, that he wants to propose but can't find the money yet.  He has a lot of debt, which doesn't leave room in his finances for the kind of ring he wants to buy (see also: not the kind of ring I want!)  I want to beat him to the punch to be contrary and so he doesn't spend a ridiculous amount of money on a ring when something 1/10th of the cost of what he's talking about spending would be just as nice.  Also, our relationship is pretty silly in that I am a tomboyish girl, and he is rather effeminate for a guy, so I think he will find it entertaining if I do the proposal.


I'm not planning anything lavish or expensive, preferably just something quiet but clever I can organize at home.  I plan to buy him a simple engagement ring even though I know men typically don't get one.  We had promise rings at one point but they were cheap metal and broke - so I'll be getting him a ring for posterity, nothing super fancy, though.
  

I'd like to propose on a specific day that's not for a few months yet, so I have some time to think about how to do it and if it's a good idea, but, if I do go through with it, I'm stumped on how a guy would feel in this situation or how he would like it to happen (if at all).  Personally, I find the big, sappy, public proposals really intimidating and would never want to be proposed to like that, and I'd imagine guys wouldn't want that, either.  


Guys: would you find it too weird if your girlfriend proposed to you?  How would you like her to do it?  Would you find it irritating if you were planning to propose and your girlfriend beat you to it?  
Girls:  Have any of you done this, and if so, what did you do?  How did it turn out?


TL;DR:  Planning to do a big role reversal and propose to my boyfriend, does anyone have any success stories, horror stories, or insight on the matter for me?  

*edit: since this keeps coming up, I forgot to mention that I have told him several times that I'm not interested in an expensive ring, but he seems adamant - like it's his duty - and I can't fathom why.  His brother proposed with a $3,000 ring and seems to feel like he would need to do the same to be adequate.

I'm engaged to a guy, been so for over a year, been in the relationship for three years. We have a 4 month old baby girl together.

A friend of mine is coming to pick up the baby and watch her for a few hours while I confront him after work. I have screen shots and print outs and back-ups of all the evidence. I'll ask him straight out if he is hiding anything from me, and if he isn't immediately forthcoming, I am going to throw it all at him.

I thought the sex was going really well, even post baby. I thought we had a future. It's all been one big fucking lie the whole time. Now I'm staring down the face of single motherhood. My dreams of a sweet little family in a comfy home filled with love are gone, destroyed.

When he comes home, I am going to confront him, and then I am kicking his ass out. He can sleep in his truck, I don't give a fuck. Maybe he can go spend a few nights with one of his fuck buddies. The baby and I will stay here at home.

This situation is beyond fucked up. He's the only one with a job, since we decided I'd be a SAHM. We were still in the middle of combining finances, so my name is on a few things, but not anything that can help.

We returned from his work conference in Miami. We don't have a lot of money so it was a nice getaway for me. Everything was paid for by his job except for my flight. He had the luxury of choosing his own flight so he chose one on which I could also get an affordable ticket.

I knew we wouldnt have a lot of time together but I took the opportunity to get a few days to myself. I was alone most of the time but I had fun. On the last night there was a spouses' cocktail reception where an employee's SO could join in (about half the people there brought their SO). It started at 8. I get ready and wait for my husband to join me.  By 830 he shows up and says its canceled. I was confused so I asked him why and he told me everyone was drunk. ''Do you really want to go up there?  We can go.''. Then I said, ''You just said it was canceled.''. Then he says,  ''Yeah it is. Lets go for a walk.''

 At this point I was kind of mad. I had just spent the last hour getting ready. He could have texted me this information and I would have happily put on my PJs and watched a movie in the hotel room. But he didn't. And on top of that I didn't really believe it was canceled so I was annoyed by the possible lie.

 The next day we re flying home and the flight is delayed by 2 hours BC a flight attendant called in sick. Well according to my husband, its my fault, BC if it weren't for me coming along on the trip, he could have taken a more expensive flight. And he only got stuck on this cheap airline bc ,''I HAD to come along ."" Apparently flight attendants dont get sick on expensive airlines. This was said to me in front of the other passengers in the terminal. I was mortified 

When I later tell him how ridiculous his logic is (when we're at home BC I don't like a scene) he tells me that I'm really annoying when he's trying to work. And that for the next conference I'm definitely not coming. It was pretty hurtful and I felt myself starting to cry so I left the room. 

I'm not sure how I'm annoying. I rarely text him when he's working. And if I do and he doesnt respond I do not text again. I just assume he's busy. Sometimes he replies a couple of hours later apologizing and my response is usually,''NP :)""

I don't even call him when he's working. I feel very hurt by what he said and on top of that I'm confused. I would never treat my husband like he was an inconvenience. 

I feel like something bigger is going on here. Do you think he's fallen out of love with me, or wants to cheat on me? Do you think he's hiding something.

1372395286.0,165,self.relationships,1h8au5,My bff (28f) is having a destination wedding. My friends and I (27f) are in her wedding party but think that the resort she chose is too expensive. Help?,snoosnoodeath,214,49,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h8au5/my_bff_28f_is_having_a_destination_wedding_my/,"Just some background:

We have all known each other since early high school. At least 15 years. In 2011, my friend moved to Toronto to be with her bf (now fiance). My friends and I are still located in Vancouver. It is a 5 to 6 hour plane ride in between locations. She is still in school and her and her fiance bought a townhouse last year, so things are tight and she can't afford to fly back home as often as she would like. She's budgeted to come home once a year. 

There are 4 couples involved in the whole story:

A- 27f &amp; 27m-married for one year, thinking of starting a family but holding off until after friend's destination wedding. Own a house, and bought an investment property in the last few months. 

B- 27f &amp; 28m - living together, 29m seems to be saving up to get a ring for his gf. 

C- 27f &amp; 31m - my bf and I, living together and have plans to get married in near future. 

D - 28f &amp; 29m - the bff and her fiance. Moved to a different city in 2011. 2012, they got engaged and bought a townhouse together. They schedule the wedding for June/July 2014. 

So it comes time and we start talking budget in a Facebook group. This whole time, it was assumed that it would cost $1200 per person. Pretty big expense per couple, just under 2500. 

Now they are telling us to expect 1700-1900 per person. That's the range that the travel agent told them to tell us would be a safe amount to put away. 

Well... this caused a bit of an uproar in the group. They were ok with having to spend more to go to our friend's wedding and try to be there for her, but the resort she chose is one of the more expensive ones available. Understandably, because she wants a nicer location for her wedding. 

The thing is... we have a opportunity to go stay at one of the villas, at a significantly reduced cost (1000 per person), and would prefer this IF it does turn out that it would be too expensive for us to stay at the resort. 

I brought this up to her during a recent phone call, and she got really upset. She said she has friends from the new city going and have no problems paying the amount for the resort. She thought this would be a big group trip with all her close friends because she doesn't get to see us very often and misses us. 

She's upset that we would stay at a different location because we are in her wedding party and it means that we wont get to spend as much time with her. She imagined that we would be staying at the resort the while time. 

She said that she told us 2 years in advance to give us time to save up for the trip. 

From our point of view:

1) She lives in a city where in income is higher and cost of living is lower. The townhouse that she bought in her city would EASILY cost 1.5 times more in our city, while we get paid 2/3rd the salary they do. Of course her friends in the new city can afford it, their disposable income is greater than ours. 

2) Bff thinks that we will be spending the entire time in the resort and there is no need to go anywhere else. The group wants to go for excursions, which adds to the cost, but if we're going to be in a new country anyway, might as well explore it. 

3) She has other guests coming with her (about 15 other people) and it's not like she's going to be spending her entire time with us. 

4) We were never consulted about what we were comfortable with paying. She's unhappy even if we were to stay at the resort next to hers, but is available for a lower price. 

5) Everyone know that weddings are expensive. It seems unfair that we would be subsidizing her wedding at our expense. Especially when we also have things to budget for ourselves. Ie: engagement (B), wedding (c), family (a) etc. 

I tried suggesting that she join us at the villa and then meet up with her other guests later, she didn't like that idea. We suggested finding a different place to stay at while having the wedding at that resort, she said this is one of the few that accepts kids. 

In contrast, my bf's cousin is getting married in May next year, about the same time. She chose the resort but is subsidizing a significant of the cost. 

So Reddit, how do I bring this up again? Are my friends and I being unreasonable and should we just suck it up and be happy for our friend for her big day? Is there a way I can explain it to her to get her to see our point of view?

1367296458.0,163,self.relationships,1de45c,UPDATE: My mom [50] is threatening to disown me [f23] if I go on a trip that she thinks is unsafe.,guebjnjnlnppg,253,90,341,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1de45c/update_my_mom_50_is_threatening_to_disown_me_f23/,"[[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d1cnk/my_mom_50_is_threatening_to_disown_me_f23_if_i_go/)]

First off, I want to thank everyone who commented on the last thread with their personal stories and advice, especially those of you who understood how it's not so easy for me to just say, ""Fuck off, Mom. I do what I want."" I wouldn't even want to handle it that way.

After distressing over it for days (seriously, I think I literally made myself sick with stress), I decided that I was going to go to SF. I told my mom, ""I've thought about it a lot, and I've decided that I'm going to go on this trip. I know it worries you, but I don't think driving at night should be a big enough concern to keep me from going. I love you, and I'll keep you updated throughout.""

Surprisingly, my mom did not erupt. She just asked, ""Why do you *have* to go this weekend? Is SF going to disappear if you don't go this weekend? Is your friend going to die? You act like this is the only chance you have to go on this trip, and you know how much it would worry me. You guys would be driving at night, when you'd be tired and visibility would be low.""

I told her, ""No, of course I know that SF is always going to be there, and that (friend's name) isn't going anywhere. But the opportunity is here now, and I want to go, and I think that's a good enough reason.""

And without warning, my mom broke down in tears. She could barely get the words out; she just kept repeating, ""You broke my heart. You broke my heart."" Worse still, she told my younger sister (who was also on the line), ""And if you agree with your sister, then you broke my heart, too."" She got so upset that she couldn't talk anymore, and she just walked away from the phone (it was on speaker).

At this point, my dad took over and gave his perspective. Some of his key points (all of which he explained very calmly): 

* ""You know it's not like we don't want you to be happy or have fun. Your mom is just really worried about you. She loves you.""
* ""Think about how much your mom has done for you. There are some things she does for you now that even I don't understand why she does them (e.g., cook food for me to bring back to my apartment). Considering how much of herself she's given to you, if your mom feels very strongly about something, you should really take that into consideration. It's not often that she feels very strongly about something.""
* ""If I had any opportunity to make *my* parents happy, I would do it. Every time.""
* ""I understand where you're coming from, but you have to understand where we're coming from. We're not American parents; we show our love and concern in different ways.""
* ""You say that you're not trying to hurt us, but your intent doesn't matter. Whether or not you were trying to, we're already hurt.""
* ""Look, you're an adult, and you have to make a decision. At this point in your life,  is this trip--your independence--more important to you than what it would do to your mom?""
* ""If you feel like you need this right now, like you need to make a sudden break from us, instead of letting it happen gradually, then do it. But up until this point, you've been letting it happen gradually, right?""
* ""You have to decide: what's more important? Your family or yourself?""
* ""If you go on this trip, would you even really enjoy yourself given everything that's happened? Knowing that your mom feels like this? And if you enjoy it, what kind of person does that make you?""
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I'm just saying.""
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I'm just reminding you.""
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I just want you to know.""

It would have been easier if he had been yelling at me. 

I didn't say much during this. The conversation ended with my dad telling me to take some time to think about it, and to let them know the next day (which was the day I would have left for the trip).

The next morning, I got this text from my dad:

&gt; I found your mom awake crying in bed this morning. Her eyes are swollen because of how much she cried. If you think you are grown up, love us, and appreciate what we did for you, then you know what to do. Call me if you don't. We have sacrificed so much for you over your life. Ask yourself how much you have done in return. Actions speak louder than words, especially in times of need. Ask yourself what you value most in your life.

I know my mom was overreacting, but I couldn't handle knowing that my actions had caused her so much pain. I couldn't handle knowing that my mom was sitting there thinking that I didn't give a shit about her and everything she's done for me. And if I went on the trip, while she probably wouldn't disown me, she'd take my decision to mean that I cared more about myself/hanging out with my friends than her, and that would cut her so deep, I don't know if our relationship would ever be the same.

So I decided not to go. It's not a decision that I'm happy with, but really, none of my options would have made me happy. Every 5 seconds I flip between feeling really upset at my parents for their emotional manipulation, and anguishing over whether I really am an unappreciative daughter for being so dismissive about my parents' concerns. It's all I've been able to think about for the past few days, and it's really taking an emotional toll on me.

I don't know how to proceed from here on out. I'll be seeing my parents this weekend, and my dad has already started pretending like everything's hunky dory. The good news is, my mom seems to be happy now (according to my dad's text; I haven't talked to her myself). I feel like I need to have a conversation with them about this, but I'm not really sure how it would go since I don't see any possibility for compromise when it comes to my desires vs. their ""legitimate"" concerns.

Reddit, I just need some general advice. How can I help my parents understand that when I make a decision they don't like, it doesn't mean that I don't respect and love them? And if they were being emotionally manipulative, how can I explain this to them? I find myself replaying the discussions I had with them, and since I can't come up with cogent arguments that I can see them understanding, I start doubting whether or not I'm in the right...

**TL;DR** - I told my mom I was going to SF, and she had a meltdown. After hearing my dad's speech about how much my parents have sacrificed for me, I ultimately decided not to go.

Is it? Is it unreasonable for me to be annoyed by this?

Background: I am 22M. We met in school and were friends for 3 years then we started dating. (E: I've known her since 2006 and have been dating 4 years now) We were together for six months before moving to separate unis and continuing the relationship long distance. It was not without challenges but neither of us was unfaithful. She has always been quite jealous and this is not the first time that I have caught her going through my private messages/texts. (edit: The last time was about 2 years ago and her jealousy issues have improved a lot since then). She now works in our hometown while I am doing my masters' year in a town 2 hours away.

She came to visit last weekend and we were having a great time until I went out for a cycle and came back to find her flustered and closing tabs. I reopened them and found she had been in the history, deleting it. She had a post it note with a seemingly arbitrary time and date on it.

I asked her what she had been looking for but she would not tell me, and any time I tried to investigate she would not let me. I ended up physically lifting her out of the room and locking her out so I could see what she was looking at, since to my knowledge, there was really nothing I had to hide.

I found the post-it corresponded to some messages to some male friends. All the 5 minutes I was looking she was yelling for me to let her back in, which I ignored.
I eventually let her back in and got her to calm down as she wanted to leave.

When I got her to talk about it, she claimed that the time corresponded to messages between us, she sent me a song, I sent her ""sex bomb"" by tom jones as a joke and she alleges that in between those messages I was looking at my ex gf's profile. This had actually happened at a different time a day later and it was evident she had copied it down wrong.

Edit: Can't believe I missed this out - I had not looked at anything to do with the ex-gf since december when history indicates i looked at some pics. GF thinks she might have accidentally deleted this but I see no way this would happen and I certainly have no recollection of it.

While I have nothing to hide I was quite upset about her seeming lack of trust and breach of my privacy. Even if the ""you've nothing to hide you should let me search"" was valid, it is clear that mistakes can be made (and they were here!) as we are only human. She insisted that most girlfriends do this and that it was entirely forgiveable, even though I made it very clear last time that my private messages are private.

Is it normal for SO's to look through messages and browsing history? I've never looked through hers.

**Am I wrong to be upset by this? Is it unreasonable want to keep my messages private, whether or not I have something to hide?**

We have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids. My wife recently lost a lot of weight and perhaps related to that, has been getting more attention from guys. She is a housewife, and I work. Last summer we decided to ""open"" our marriage by allowing sexting with others as long as we told each other about it. 

After she started acting shady, and I had seen that she deleted a chat conversation from our shared email account, I snooped into her personal email (I hadn't prior to that) and found out she was having an emotional affair with an older man that was more than just sexting. She was hiding the extent of it to me. She would say things to him like she loves him, how their ages don't matter, etc. 

I bring this up for 2 reasons. The first is that I have always stressed open communication, but she wants to hide things and when I snooped (which I felt really bad about) she was really, really angry about it. Pretty much tried to turn the fault around on me. She said it was all fantasy in her mind but when I brought up the emotional affair thing and it doesn't really matter if its online or real life, she agreed that it was inappropriate and would stop talking to him altogether. 

We decided to close the marriage again and she promised to stop chatting with all guys without my knowledge (besides some guy friends she knows in RL) until we could build some trust back up. I also told her I would no longer snoop on her stuff, which I did not for few months. 

I was getting a weird vibe again so I ashamedly snooped on her texts. One her BFF's husband was chatting with her, trying to get her to send naked photos. She did not (from what I saw) but she clearly enjoys the attention, sending him winks and photos of her in her workout clothes - the same ones she might post on instagram for example.

So this morning she confronts me about snooping on her phone. I explain that I had that weird feeling again and how I saw what he was saying to her and how I thought it was really inappropriate. She says she didn't send him anything and asked what she should say to him. I thought she should make it clear that she will not send anything like that and if he says that again she will cut off all communication. 

**TL;DR:** So why do I bring this up? We clearly have trust issues. Am I right for being upset about how she handles a guy that asks for nude photos? Am I a huge asshole for snooping into her stuff?

 Now she is being distance, and not caring at all. I'm thinking about moving out, because it's better to be alone than to be with somebody and feel alone. Unforchunately, in order for her to have the opporotunity I had to take a less paying job, and now I don't feel like I'm financial secure (not to mention all the medical bills etc).

I guess I need another perspective, who is right and who is wrong? Should I expect her to be there for me? Should I move out, or just stick it through? 

TL;DR: I got sick and wife doesn't want to be there for me.

UPDATE: Just to clarify, this isn't a long term illness and she won't need to be my caretaker. I expect to fully cover in the next 12 to 18 months. It just happens this particular drug can damage areas of that body that heal very slowly (nerves, tendons).

My fiancé and I had a long conversation about this and there is more to the story than I was aware of initially (surprise, surprise!).  There is actually a pretty good reason for him wanting separate homes for a bit: he has just re-entered counseling because he has been struggling with anger issues that he thought he had put behind him. It has apparently been very difficult for him to control his temper for the past month or so and feels he needs help to avoid taking it out on me. I knew that he had these anger problems and that he had damaged his past relationships with his temper (snapping at little things, verbal abuse, punching walls…no physical abuse) and tendency to bully, but he had also done a ton of work on himself, stayed single and lived alone for along time before we met, and gone through a lot of counseling and he believed he had it under control. Unfortunately he is going through some family issues AND trying to quit smoking which is making him even more on edge than he would be otherwise.

I had no idea he was struggling with this because he has completely kept it to himself and not acted on it. He decided to re-enter counseling on his own and didn’t tell me any of this because he didn’t want me to be afraid of him or not feel safe (I’ve never really seen him lose his temper, he thought if I did I might just up and leave…honestly there is a chance that might have happened).  To be clear, the things that have caused him to get angry have not been things that are rational or anything to do with our relationship. Little things have been setting him off, like not being able to find his other shoe in the morning or forgetting to set his alarm and oversleeping and he has been fighting urges to take it out on me just because I’m the one that is there.

He has apologized over and over for not being open with me and for the way he made me feel,  he realizes that he handled this very poorly and says he absolutely does not want to lose me.  After thinking about it for a few days he wants to continue living with me but also wants me to know I have the option to move out temporarily if I feel like he’s getting out of line and it won't mean we are breaking up or he is less committed/loves me less. His original idea was for me to get a small studio in the building we already live in and for us to still stay together most nights, probably for no longer than 6 months while he worked hard in counseling…that wouldn’t be so bad so I guess we will see how it goes.

1369031656.0,159,self.relationships,1eoigg,"I [21F] have dug myself into a hole by lying to my family and friends for years, and I don't know how to fix it.",whattosaythrowaway,218,59,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1eoigg/i_21f_have_dug_myself_into_a_hole_by_lying_to_my/,"I've managed to build a whole house of lies for my family. I never meant harm by it, but at this point I can't imagine the truth to be anything but excruciating to them. I feel I should provide some background:

I love my friends and family. I'm lucky, because my parents worked hard to give my siblings and me a much better life than they had. They're strict, but I've had a very comfortable life.

I have what feels like a nigh-pathological inability to let others know about my failures. And this has manifested in very bad ways since I graduated high school.

Senior year, my parents pressured me to enroll in their first choice college instead of mine. It was three hours away from my city, where most of my friends were staying to attend college. My first semester was a fiasco. I gave up on even trying to make a friend, sank into a depression, and became fixated on my long-distance boyfriend. In a move I still don't understand, I failed the two classes I was captivated by and scraped by in two classes I found boring. This resulted in academic probation. 

That lit a small fire under my ass, and I fixed things just slightly second semester. I hid my failures from my parents, though, saying I'd gotten decent grades. They had no reason to doubt me.

Sophomore year, I backslid, and my grades were bad enough for the dean to put me on a mandatory semester of leave. This was where my lies got ridiculous. I intercepted the letter that was meant to inform my parents of my suspension, and I led them to believe I was going back for my fourth semester. Instead, I crashed on friends' couches for a semester and worked small cash-paying jobs. At one point I traveled fifteen hours away from my home to work a two-week gig, and I was constantly waiting for my parents to discover the awful truth.

They didn't. When the semester ended, I had my father pick me up from the campus of the college I wasn't currently attending. I bummed around that summer and, the next semester, I went to community college halfway in between my home-city and my college's city, trying to improve my GPA to get back into the college my parents thought I was attending. I got a 4.0, but my dean balked on some administrative matters and I was told I wouldn't be able to return until the next fall. 

I felt like I was *so close* to fixing my situation, and that I couldn't possibly let my parents find out then. So I orchestrated my most daring lie yet, which was that I was going to study abroad. My parents had no reason to be suspicious, and I set off for a semester in a foreign country, where I *did* attend an independent study abroad program.

I got great grades, and was accepted back to my original college. At home for the summer, I felt amazing. I thought I was finished with dishonesty; I could go back to school, put my nose to the grindstone, and be done with the school I hated in a few short semesters. 

Halfway into the semester I came down with a bacterial infection that wrecked my life for a while. I was getting treated for it at the college health clinic, but the medicine wasn't helping much. I slept twelve hours a day, and I ended up failing two classes. The dean's justice was swift; this time, I couldn't intercept the letter, which informed my parents that I was being put on a year of leave due to my low GPA. They were *insane* with anger, but I still covered up the truth. I told them that it was the sickness that derailed me for one awful semester, and they determined that I would stay home, get treatment from a proper doctor, and take a few classes at a local college.

So I have been home this spring semester, and I've made excellent grades at my local college. I'm a top student in all three of my classes and feeling excellent. The treatment for my illness is finished, and my symptoms seem to have gone away. I've reconnected with old friends, and I'm in perhaps my first healthy relationship, with a kind and stable guy a few years older than me. 

No one knows that I attended a total of three semesters at my college. It hasn't been an issue all semester, with me getting treatment and attending classes here. But now my parents are discussing my return to the original college. I proposed staying in my city to finish my education, but it caused a row that had my parents demanding to see my transcript. I panicked and managed to deflect, but since then I've been consumed with panic and anxiety about what to do.

I want to stay in my home-city, excel in classes, and be around people I love. I don't know how I can make the transition without revealing the truth to my parents. If possible, I want them to *never* know; they both have heart problems, and I am seriously worried this could cause a severe reaction, like a literal heart attack. 

The anxiety is making me shut down a bit inside. Part of me wants to cut and run: leave them an apology letter explaining that I need some space, move somewhere, finish my education and reappear when I've made something of myself. Another part wants to try lying even further to try and stay in this city. 

I have been consumed by guilt about this for three years, and I just keep escalating my situation. I feel like such a fucked up person. What could I do to make the best of this situation?

Sorry to make this such a long one. I think it can actually be summarized quite succinctly: 

**TL;DR: In order to avoid my parents' disappointment, I hid my failures in college for three years. I've finally started to get my life together this semester, but they are very close to finding out that I received low grades in three semesters of attendance, instead of decent grades in six semesters. I don't know how to salvage this situation. Ideally, I would keep them in the dark in order to not risk aggravating their health problems.**

A little background: I [26/m] have been dating my girlfriend [26/f] for two years and living with her for one. We have a solid, comfortable relationship. I'm planning on asking her to marry me as soon as we have shored up our finances. She recently lost her job and is looking for a new one. I am applying to grad school and working in the meantime. When we're together, we spend a lot of time in the same room, but doing our own thing, Redditing, etc. We try to plan a date night once a week, but that usually turns into take-out food and a movie on Netflix, since we don't have much disposable income. She rarely comes to my work functions because she thinks the girls I work with don't like her (that's not true, or at least I haven't seen it). I'm very happy with her, but recently a coworker's relationship has been making me question my own.

One of my coworkers (25/f) is working with us before she heads to law school in the fall. She's dating an older guy (32), a doctor, and they've been together for almost three years, but she graduated college at 20, so I don't think their infatuation with each other is the result of gold-digging, which is what I originally assumed. 

They seem to be a perfect couple. She raves about how proud of him she is and how much respect she has for him. Even when she's gabbing with the other girls in the office about a little fight they've had, it's always in a laughing way (""He dutch oven'd me! Can you believe that?! Ughhh!""). She'll cook him dinner and take it to him at work when he has to stay late, and along those lines, they have a standing breakfast date every time he works an overnight shift. 

He reciprocates from what I can see. He comes to work functions and brags about how brilliant she is and how he was lucky to find someone that pretty and also interested in him. He picks her up for lunch sometimes. They travel all over the place, the biggest example being the four-week trip across Asia he's surprising her with over this summer before she starts school, during which he's going to propose. I know about it because he's asked some of our help in planning it and securing the time off with her bosses. 

I've tried to do little things to make my girlfriend feel special, but every time I do, she either doesn't react the way I would expect her to, or she is gracious, but rarely returns the favor.

I know part of my jealousy is over the fact that my girlfriend and I can't afford to travel or spend nights out on the town like they do. But something about the way they talk about each other and look at each other makes me feel like something is missing in my relationship. 

Tl;dr - Coworker and her boyfriend are all lovey-dovey and do exciting things while my girlfriend and I coexist and watch Netflix. Am I jealous of their lifestyle or their relationship?

I'm 35 and have been married for 12 years. Sex was pretty good and frequent before getting married, but pretty much stopped on the wedding day. We didn't even have sex on the wedding night. Immediately after the wedding all oral sex stopped; she won't even let me do it for her.

For the past 10+ years we have been having sex less than 10 times per year, which meets the definition of a sexless marriage. If it were up to me I would have sex every day. No matter how much I have complained, begged, planned, romanced, etc, she still refuses my advances. Even worse, the past two years she has started feeling pain on those rare occasions when we do have sex. 

About 7 years ago I was at a bar and ended up making out with a girl I met. She invited me back to her place; on the way there I changed my mind and went home. A couple days later I told my wife that I was seriously thinking about sex with other women, that I needed sex, and maybe we should get a divorce. She promised things would change and convinced me to give it another try.

Things improved for a few months, but then went back to how they were before. For a couple years I continued to try everything I could think of to get her in the mood, but nothing worked. She would promise sex for things like birthdays and anniversaries, but when the time came she would be too tired or have another lame excuse. 

About 5 years ago I simply gave up. I mostly stopped initiating sex, stopped doing things she wanted me to do, and pretty much zoned out. We've gone on like this for so long, I feel more like roommates than spouses. Despite all of this, I love and care for her very much; I know she loves me too.

I've thought about divorce on many occasions, but I feel trapped. She has mentioned suicide on several occasions; she often says things like she couldn't live without me, if I die she would die, etc. 

After years of a sexless marriage, I made a bad decision and had an affair. There's no excuse for this, but I was badly missing sex and didn't feel like my wife could handle a divorce. I met up with this woman on three occasions and on the last we had sex. Unfortunately, my wife found out about it.

When confronted, I told her I wanted a trial separation or an open marriage. I could live happily with an open marriage, I love my wife very much, but I do have sexual needs. With a trial separation I was hoping we could both date and maybe she'd realize we're not in love. She will not agree to either option and wants to try to work it out.

Since she found out she has hurt herself on a few occasions by pounding her head on the wall/floor, hitting herself, pulling her hair... She has also drunk large amounts of alcohol and taken too many sleeping pills. I've been very close to calling for help, but I have been able to calm her down. She has now promised me she won't kill herself, but I'm not so sure.

We have gone to therapy, but the therapist is solely concentrating on the issue of sex. Oddly, my wife now wants sex all the time. She has even told me she wants sex with strangers and that if we do the trial separation she might not be able to resist strangers. At this point I feel like she's playing games to try to make me jealous. Unfortunately, I no longer want sex with her. I can definitely go through the motions, but I'm not into it. I still find her beautiful, but maybe after so much rejection something between us has broken.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. Maybe a divorce would be best, but I really don't think she could handle it. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

I had a bit of a whirlwind romance with someone I thought was the girl of my dreams.  Did the dating thing for a few years after meeting, proposed, planned a whole wedding together, etc.  I was really on cloud nine.

I've always been a bit of a hopeless romantic and IMO treated her like a princess during the course of our relationship.  There was even a good period of time that I supported her entirely while she looked for work post college.

Well, fast forward to a few months before the big day I'm still utterly clueless with my head in the clouds when she comes home, breaks things off in a matter of an hour and drives off to go stay with her parents.  I'm, needless to say, devastated, but I try to piece my life back together.

A few weeks go by and the roommate of one of my groomsmen calls me because he ""needs to get something of his chest.""  He's known for a while that my ex-fiance and one of my best friends had been sleeping together for a while and couldn't carry the secret anymore.

I haven't spoken to either of them since this incident but it's been well over a year since everything happened and what I'm asking my fellow redditors is how does one get back out there when they have such crippling trust issues?

From the beginning of of our relationships I made it clear that I'd be making this move -- the decision definitely was not an impetuous one, and Bob always knew about it. Unfortunately, Bob is not yet ready to relocate to my city, but plans to ""eventually.""

The lack of end-date for the long distance has caused some tension in our relationship. We argue a lot more now, and I often find myself hopeless and lonely. I also wonder if I'm putting all this time and effort into a relationship that's ultimately going nowhere. However, I love Bob very much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. This is a shitty situation but I've always been positive that it's something we can work through. We've talked marriage and we know it's on the horizon, but again, there are no real dates or plans set. It is our deep connection and love that has helped me overcome the distance, and it's been enough... until now. 

I fucked up. I had a moment of weakness and slept in another man's bed. We didn't have sex or hook up, but we cuddled through the night. Alcohol was involved, but that is no excuse. Right now I feel so sick and terrible. I've never cheated on any of my partners, never thought I was the cheating type, and I want to spend the rest of my life with Bob. I honestly can't imagine what was running through my mind when I let my guard down. It was such an incredibly shitty and selfish thing to do. I was only focusing on what I wanted in that exact moment and thinking of no one but myself. 

I will never, ever let something like this happen again. I am going to completely quit drinking and going out. I need a major lifestyle change -- I've developed too many bad habits, and this is a terrible culmination of my tendency to overdo it on nights out and drink too much. Right now I am debating what to do, and although I don't deserve it, I need some advice. People on reddit seem to fall into several different camps. Do I fess up, or would I just be fessing up to assuage my own guilt? A part of me just wants to bury this. I want to bury it and forget it like a bad dream. I want to worship Bob and nurture our relationship and be an amazing partner to him. I wonder whether or not I'd want to know if Bob did something like this... and I think... probably not. However, I also feel like he deserves to know so he can make his own decisions about the situation. I don't want to treat him like an idiot and keep him in the dark. I'm really torn up and scared right now, and I need someone to help me think straight.

He already had plans to go to college but decided to go along with them immediately since he met me, and wanted to have a better future for himself. No too long after that he moved in to my apartment, got a pell grant for classes and took up a part time job in food service and everything was great.

I make less than 22K (entry level position, moving up is slower than I'd like, but not nonexistant and I love where I work) and he made 10K after taxes, but we were comfortable and had even begun socking back money for savings. Even though we don't go out much, now and again, we could treat ourselves with nights out now and again. We have a nice apartment together and live in safe area. He was able to pay for all his essentials like insurance and gas for his car, pay the power bill and groceries, which he was more than happy to do, even if it meant not having much money for himself. On birthdays he tends to get new work shoes and nice clothes for college, just the essential things and he was happy with that too. 

He constantly told me how grateful he was for the opportunity to go to college, since he didn't have to pay rent here, and we live within 30 minutes of his current college. I asked him many times if he was resentful at all of me taking (almost) all his paycheck each time, but he just smiled and told me it was a small price to pay to be with me and start working on a career.

It's not hyperbole when I say, until yesterday, everything was bliss for us. No fights. Our personalities meshed. The arrangement I described above worked great. I'm wildly, stupidly in love, more so than I've ever been in my life. We always make time for just cherishing each other's company. We talk about marriage after college and both have promise rings.

A couple weeks ago, he dropped out of his lit class, because, admittedly, the professor was being damn demanding of a freshman to sophomore level college class in terms of endless papers and expecting literally 200+ pages of material read each week with no regard for other classes. This class is easily retaken with another professor down the road, and he was about to face midterms in his crucial engineering classes, so I went along with it. He was only taking three other classes since he was working part time.

Yesterday he told me he was failing Chemistry, and saw little hope for saving it. I was blown away. He'd had two other tests he bombed and waited until he bombed the third to let me know. He said he wanted to quit working and focus on school full time.

I went numb. I knew this meant drastic cutbacks on everything, even though we already live a frugal lifestyle. I have not owned an item of clothing that has not come from a yard sale or thrift store in three years. We don't have cable. We rarely go out to eat. I was hoping to put my 1k tax refund toward a new computer for both of us since the current one I own is five years old. Maybe even take a nice beach vacation with some of it. Not possible anymore. I already feel the resentment creeping in, because I worked part time while in college and busted my ass to get my Bachelor's. I spent most of last night feeling utterly numb and just trying to think of ways to cut our grocery bill (~$60 weekly) even more. Trying to figure out of food stamps are an option. Hoping against hope his junker car holds out until he graduates. Hoping that he doesn't get hurt since he has no insurance. I feel so utterly lost in the woods and alone.

I need help but don't know where to look. I have not spoken to him since last night, because I'm trying to fight back disappointment, anger and the horrible, terrible feeling I should cut him loose to retain my sanity. I know he really is trying. He studies a lot. But I feel he could be doing better than this, since again, I did it myself once.

I don't want to give up on him, but the prospect of having to stick to an even stricter budget (22K for two people after taxes, renting an apartment) wearies me and makes me fear for our future, since this would likely be the story for four more years.

**TL;DR My boyfriend is about to quit his part-time job because it is supposedly making him fail college. This will leave us effectively destitute and will impact our quality of life to a degree where I fear I will resent him or worse, dump him. I do not want to leave him in his time of need, and I still love him, but I feel like I have nowhere to turn. What can I do?**

EDIT: I think it is important to mention if he quits college without getting a degree, he will have to pay back all his Pell Grant money, which stands around 7-8 thousand right now.

**RE-EDIT 4/8/2013:** Sorry I've not been more responsive, but we had our talk last night. Thank you for all your comments, truly, I really did read them all. I found the one from the Bio teacher especially helpful and encouraging.

Since he'd had about 24 hours to think about the whole situation, I asked him to let me know what he thought about the whole thing. He reiterated that he would be visiting his Chem teacher during office hours today to see if the grade was salvageable in some way. He said he'd be in contact with Financial Aid shortly thereafter depending on the response. He said (without prompting) that I'd been doing more than my fair share to keep him afloat, felt horrible for letting us both down, and realized it was just not possible to carry on without finanicial support on his end. He said he had hoped to look into getting student loans next year, but would continue his job until he was eligible/the paperwork went through. He insisted that he really did enjoy being at college and his core engineering classes.

I was happy to hear all of the above, but added he absolutely had to see someone to address his writing/reading/studying shortcomings, and a Chemistry tutor if the prof indicated there was still time to pull his grade up before semester's end. He agreed, and even said back in grade school that he'd been put in a special class for slow readers, but never saw anything come out of it, since they just made him read books endlessly and give him tests on the content, with no real direction on improving his methods or any strategy. (I didn't know about this, but it wasn't so much hiding it from me, moreso I'd never really asked if he'd gotten help for his slow reading. I've always been a very fast reader, and had no baseline to judge between normal reading pace and a truly slow reading pace until now. I'd just assumed I was biased there and maybe he really wasn't *that* bad.)

He also agreed with me he has to better learn how to budget his time, and yes, he had been out of school too long and had never really had to study in High School so had never really learned how to. He loathed coming home and having to do schoolwork and admitted he had too many distractions (video games) and he wanted to take them out of the front room so it wouldn't be as easy to just plunk down on the couch and play when he should be studying.

It wasn't an overly long, drawn out and painful talk, and he really did step up and own his fault in it all. I really do believe he will do his best to turn this all around.

Thank you all so very much for all of your suggestions, I saw truth in much of them, and it really helped me gather my wits and have a civil discussion, just like I'd hoped.

**RE-EDIT TL;DR He immediately came forth and admitted he screwed up. He will get help for his studying, reading and writing skills, will try to salvage Chemistry if possible, will budget his time better, and will continue work until student loan applications get the okay. He definitely wasn't just telling me what I wanted to hear, since I let him speak his peace before I ever gave my opinion. I feel so much better thanks to all of your insight. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone I knew about it without them automatically telling me there was no hope, and he was just a leech. I never believed it, since I've been in relationships where I absolutely HAD been used, and knew this was different.

EDIT:  !!!  I just replied to a few of you guys without realizing I was on my real Reddit account.  I'm so so sorry!  I deleted my replies so if you're wondering what happened, it was just me not paying attention.  Sorry about that!  The replies were mainly thank you's.  So embarrassed....





So, the past few weeks have been fairly hectic.  I haven't been able to update you because he got fired AGAIN, so he was always here and I couldn't get on the computer.  I've got a little time right now and I'm hoping I can remember what I wanted to say.


I saw a lawyer.  I felt better afterwards about all the legal issues that I'll be dealing with and the fact that he's not going to take my kids away from me.  But I won't be using THAT lawyer because he said ""how does a college educated woman stay with somebody for 20 years and think this situation is normal?  Couldn't you have looked this stuff up?"".  I'm not going to work with somebody who's going to make me feel stupid.  I get enough of that at home.  There's plenty of lawyers in the sea, so I'll get another one.  


I started therapy and it was an interesting experience.  See, about 15 years ago I tried therapy and while I was explaining my situation, the therapist was trying not to fall asleep.  It was embarrassing and I figured if I was that boring then there must not be anything wrong.  So I never went back and I was expecting a little of the same thing this time.  I was wrong.  The therapist immediately took charge and called another lady who's an expert in psychological abuse.  She is going to meet me once a week in addition to my regular appointments with the other therapist.  My first meeting with her is in a couple days and I'm not really sure what she's going to help me with but I'll find out.  



I don't understand why I feel so guilty that these ladies are wanting to help.  Why do I feel so terrible?  At first I was so relieved and felt a huge amount of anxiety leave me.  But now I'm worried that I'll either let them down, or something.  I'm not sure how to describe it.  I'm not sure how to tell them that I'm so scared to be thrown out into the world on my own without the basic skills that I used to have but now I've forgotten.  I don't even remember how to make simple decisions that aren't based on what to cook for dinner, or how to clean a stain out of a rug.  I think the only way to describe it is to think of someone who wakes up from a 20 year coma and they're handed an iPad and told to use it.  I know that's a little extreme but it does explain how I feel.  I can barely remember how to structure a sentence anymore when I write.  I can't talk to people without talking really, really fast because I'm afraid they'll cut me off so I stumble on my words.  Or I stop right in the middle of a conversation because I can't remember a small word that I'm trying to use to get them to understand me.  I hope that the therapist and this lady help me figure out how to fix all this before they throw me out alone in the world.




Well I'm running out of time here and I can't remember everything I wanted to say.  But I wanted to tell everyone that I really do appreciate your help from my last post.  I learned a lot and it lit a fire under my ass to get out and get things done.  Thank you!  And to the person who sent me Gold from the last post - I smiled and it was a wonderful gift.  :)




Edit - forgot the tl;dr:  Thanks to everyone's help in Relationships, I've gotten the help that I need!

Oddly enough, my boyfriend decided to surprise me at the office today with lunch so I was able to address the issue right away. (Thank you to everyone that gave me advice!!)

Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z567d/i_23_f_found_weird_pictures_on_his_23_m_computer/).

I had reminded him that I used his computer for work last night and I eased into the conversation by asking how old his computer is (it's an HP laptop, with webcam built in). He said he had bought the computer when he was 17 and of course he asked why I was curious about that. I told him that I had seen the pictures of his sister on his computer and wanted to know why they were on there. 

He replied with: ""Yea, there's a lot of pictures of her on there. I wish she would stay off my computer. She's spilled drinks on it and I really don't trust her with my things anymore.""

When I told him they were nudes in the recycle bin he looked shocked and very disgusted. He said ""Why the fuck is she taking naked pictures on my computer? That is so gross."" He seemed genuinely freaked out. My boyfriend basically uses his computer for facebook and music. So I felt bad I really thought there was more to it. 

He asked if I deleted them and I said no. He was angry I didn't and said when I get home I have to be the one that deletes it so he doesn't ""have to see that shit.""

He told me things like he was upset I would accuse him of incest. He also said that he will not be letting his sister use his computer anymore. 

Well Reddit, I feel like an ass. 

**TL;DR- He said he didn't know about the pictures. He is upset I was accusing him of having an sexual relationship with his sister. I feel dumb.**

Won't let me (32M) take my son (18 months) out of the house",meteorbath,218,64,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18myxy/wife_31f_is_irrational_addicted_to_weed_and/,"Married to my wife now for 2 years, been together for 5. Picture perfect relationship right up until she got pregnant. She became verbally abusive and let our home go to shit. The place looks ransacked.


I figured it was hormones and did what I could. I work as an engineer, earn good money but work long hours, I leave the house at 7am and get back around 8pm most days, sometimes later. The 'nesting period' where a mad spurt of cleaning before the birth never happened, she just lay in bed with her laptop. She doesn't want a cleaner because she doesn't want anybody messing with her stuff.


When I met her she was a bit of a loner, but I 'got' her quirkiness and her jokes. We fell in love very quickly and we were both insanely happy. Now I don't even recognise this woman who is my wife and I wonder what happened to my wonderful girlfriend.


It's hard to exaggerate how filthy our home is. I cannot walk in a straight line through the house, there are shoes, plates, clothes, books, magazines and garbage all over the floor. There are pots of rotting and mouldy food in the kitchen. She gets groceries delivered and occasionally I cannot even open our front door because she hasn't put them away.


I try my best to get the place inhabitable when I get home but our son is a light sleeper so there's not much I can do once he's in bed. And when I'm home I obviously spend every moment with him before putting him to bed.


My wife smokes a lot of weed in joints mixed with loose tobacco. I'd say she smokes one long one every two hours or so. She straps our son in to his high chair in front of the TV and goes out the back. I can't convince her to cut down let alone quit. I paid off her dealer to say he was completely out but she found someone else.


Things came to a head last week. I had a really bad chest infection and took a couple of days sick leave. I was hanging out with my son that morning since about 6am. My wife slept on. She rolled out of bed at 10am. I made her a coffee, gave her a kiss and told her I had to lie down. She said she hadn't 'woken up yet', meaning she wanted a joint. I told her I was really sick and exhausted. She wasn't happy, but took my son onto her lap anyway. As I closed the door I heard her tell my son 'Your dad is a fucking shit'.


I couldn't believe it. I really had enough. I packed some clothes, told her I tried my best to put up with her but abusing me in front of my son was beyond anything I could tolerate. 


I told her I couldn't live with her filth, her weed habit nor her abuse anymore. I'm staying in a motel a few miles away while looking for an apartment. I told her that I'd like to take my son on weekends, and so here's my big problem.


She says it's not good for him to have two homes and that she doesn't trust me. She will only let me visit him for two hours and I'm not allowed to take him out of the house. The poor guy barely gets fresh air. 


A year ago I convinced her to go to a counsellor. Things seemed to be going OK, and I started attending too. In our final session, the counsellor told her that she was depressed, overly dependent on me and stuck in her 'inner child'. My wife responded by leaving the building and walking 5 miles home. Kinda hit the nail on the head, Mrs. Counsellor. Needless to say my wife believes that the counsellor just didn't like her and was against her from the start.


I know that somewhere inside her is my beautiful, loving girlfriend. But she won't get help and it will 100% affect our son. Is there any way of solving this without going through lawyers?


I'm seriously considering quitting my job so I can take custody of my son if I need to. Money is great, comfort is great, luxuries are great, but being a good father comes first and I would be happier on welfare knowing my son is happy and not listening to my abusive wife. Thanks guys.

His best friend that he talked about a lot was with him (his family couldn't make it, so he tagged along with us for the day) and even being only 7 I knew right away that he was going to be a big part of my life.

Fast forward 11 years...I am now 18 and he is 29. During those years he stayed in constant contact with my family and even called me at least twice a month to talk to his ""little princess"" I've been there for him through tough times and he has been there for me so much that I don't know how I survived without him in my life.

So, as the title already stated..I fell in love with him around when I was 14 and tried to talk to him a lot more than we already did..we became even closer, but I knew I had to keep it friendly and try to force myself to just see him as another brother. Even when he got married I supported him and just cried on the inside wearing a mask of happiness. Even if it was 'legal' I knew I had nothing to offer him.

Well, 7 months ago he got a divorce because his wife cheated on him while he was deployed, he found out when he came home. I talked to him every night for over a week on the phone or skype listening to him vent/cry about it while I was nearly dying inside wanting him to give me the chance to make him happy. The deployment was the end of his career and he was honorably discharged and went home to attend college.

You should have seen my face when he told me which college he was going to, it was the same one that I had just been accepted to. We spent an entire wonderful month together in his apartment (my parents idea..so I could check out the campus with him and they were relieved id have someone to 'protect' me) before I moved into my dorm. Now we see each other regularly, usually always hang out after school for at least an hour or two...and I started to sort of lose control.

My feelings for him have really started to manifest, I catch myself being overly flirty and sort of teasing him. I'll purposely bend over in front of him or while were watching TV to ""turn the volume up"". I grasp that I am acting very childish..I've had boyfriends before, but none of them made me feel so amazing like he does. I guess I sort of started thinking that I had to show him that I am a woman now and not his 'little princess'. And I did catch him eyeing me up and down once or twice when he was drinking. (I wanted to jump him so bad when I noticed)

So now that you know the backstory..the question I have is: How do I confess my love for him? I can handle rejection..I think anyway..but I really just want him to know how I've felt over the years and hope he feels the same way. I am scared he wont understand and will always see me as the little girl he had on his shoulders at the zoo. Or worse he won't want to see me anymore because it will be awkward.

Some more backstory: My parents absolutely love him, my Brother loves him and so does my sister, my sister is more his age and has tried to ask him out before but he has always been rather distant with her compared to me, she used to complain to me all the time that he never talked to her.

Again, I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the above link. I have read all of the comments.

So like I said in the thread, I did speak to him earlier in the week about this whole incident.I am going to try to type out all of the important points he and I spoke about.

I did mention that he and my friends hit it off really well. Unfortunately, he told me that my already inebriated friends were being dicks to him at the start. It only looked like he was getting along with them, because he kept shrugging off their constant teasing and tried to have a good time.

He told me that I chose my friends over him and even though our relationship has not been for a long time, he feels that situations like this are good indicators to him to know if the person he is with is someone he wants to spend the rest of his life with. He pointed out that if the situation was reversed, he would have left the party with me without any hesitation, because I am the most important person to him and that he would rather spend the rest of the night with me in a foul mood taking out my anger on him than to go out and have fun with all his friends. He also said, ""Sweetie, I would not want to be anywhere else in the world right now but here with you.""

I asked him why he didn't confront my friends when the teasing was getting to him. He responded saying that from his experience, being confrontational with somebody that is drunk especially when you are sober is pointless and it is best to just walk away from the situation.

So after we spoke, I apologized again to him telling him that this entire thing was 100% MY fault and not his. I told him that I should have been there to defend him and that I should have left the party with him. He is the most important person in my life and I should have handled the situation better.

Today when I was home alone, I invited my boyfriend, ""Boyfriend"", over for some ""alone time"", and my stepdad came home early and caught us. He immediately called my mom, who is out of town ATM, and told her what he saw. We're planning on having a ""big talk"" about everything when my mom gets home in &lt; 2 days.

So for now, I'm grounded from seeing or speaking to him (alright), and I'm not allowed to be home alone (also alright). Preliminary discussions seem to point to them being more shocked than mad, and I think they're more disappointed about me lying about my sexual activity than anything. My mom was raised a staunch Catholic, though she said she only expected me to wait to have sex until I could ""clean up my own messes"" (read: take care of a baby) but not necessarily be married.  [EDIT/NOTE: A couple people mentioned/asked about what I would do in case of pregnancy. If I were to get pregnant, I would most likely have an abortion. I watch my periods VERY closely (even though I'm on the pill) so I would definitely ""catch"" a pregnancy early enough on to not have too many moral qualms about it. That's my ""plan"", but I know that I'd obviously have more emotions to weigh if put in that situation. Oh and I've also made it a point to always keep enough cash of my own on hand to pay for such a procedure.]

Now, readers should note that this is my first intimate relationship, and before I got it on with this guy, I talked to the family therapist about it, and she said that it's my body and really none of my parents business. I went ahead and scheduled my own appointment at Planned Parenthood to get birth control, which I take every single day at the same time, just like you're supposed to. I've also gotten Gardasil. My boyfriend and I also use condoms to be even more secure. I like to think that I'm being fairly mature/responsible about this. Basically, I'm not a dumbass.

I have a very good relationship with my parents, and I've always been a ""good kid"". I get straight A's, have a job at an okay restaurant, don't drink or smoke or do drugs at all, that sort of thing. I usually tell my parents everything, except for this. I'm really worried about how this will effect my relationship with them, and I overheard in a phone conversation between my mom and stepdad something like, ""Well, she obviously can't be trusted..."" which is fair, but GAHH. I feel horrible for betraying their trust in me, but on the other hand, I'm a teenager who had (responsible) sex with her boyfriend. Honestly, I'm sorry I broke house rules, but I'm not sorry I slept with someone I love. Is that okay? Can I say that? I'm feeling so conflicted right now...

EDIT: Some details. For those of you concerned about my reliance on my parents financially, my mom/stepdad would NEVER kick me out or cut me off under any circumstances. And even if they did, I also have a dad/stepmom duo involved that I haven't mentioned that I can turn to.

EDIT CON'T: Other details. Between my mom/stepdad, and dad/stepmom, I have three (count 'em, three!) siblings that are &lt; 3 years old. I know babies. I know diapers, I know Thomas the Tank Engine, I know baby sign langauge, I know my stuff. I've helped take care of these guys since they started being birthed when I was 14. Hell, I'm 17 (almost 18!) and I have to keep a carseat in my car for toting children around. I know 100% what I'm ""getting into"" with the sex stuff.

**UPDATE:** I spoke to my mom a little bit more via phone, mostly talked about feelings, etc, and I told her I was worried about how Boyfriend was feeling (he had to be completely in the dark about everything because I'm not allowed to contact him.) So she sent him [this text](http://i.imgur.com/1tTkddL.jpg) which I thought was really wonderful. I love my mom. Thank you all for your wonderful responses and I will be sure to make an update thread after this ""big talk"".

1369586081.0,156,self.relationships,1f355a,How can I (18f) make my boyfriend's roommate's Filipino wife (20f) feel at home?,j3nnyyy,198,42,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f355a/how_can_i_18f_make_my_boyfriends_roommates/,"Sorry, I realize the title might be a little weird. My boyfriend (25m) has been living with his roommate (30m) for about a year now, but they have been friends for years. They started living together when the roommate came back from the Philippines (where he had started a business and a family, but lost his business). Over the past year, the roommate has been trying to get his wife (20f) and baby girl (6mths) to America, which he successfully did, and they have been here since Wednesday!

That is all very great, but the poor wife has not been doing so great. She's extremely homesick, which is expected, and she's taking care of the baby by herself. The roommate works two jobs, so he really is barely home. When she has free time, she's constantly cleaning up the apartment. She even hand washes all the dishes (including my roommate's) because she doesn't like the dishwasher.

It's really difficult for everyone, and I feel like it's not my place to step in and help. The roommate didn't even let my boyfriend be there for three days, because he wanted privacy (which is understandable, but my boyfriend could have at least slept there). The roommate doesn't have parents; he has an aunt and uncle, a brother, and a few friends. I feel like it's important for his wife to be around other women, because she was surrounded by the women of her family in the Philippines every day. The only women the roommate knows are his aunt, his brother's wife, his friend's wife, and myself. None of these women are around, but I'm around almost every day with my boyfriend, so I feel like I should help her out. I'm just at a loss how to.

I met the wife yesterday with my boyfriend, while the roommate was working. My boyfriend is a cook, so he was showing her how to make cookies and brownies while I watched the baby. After, she seemed very tired, so we offered to watch the baby while she napped. Unfortunately, we know very little about babies, so we woke her up with a crying baby about a half an hour later. We went out to eat at a little local dinner after the roommate came home, so it was around 9 and no one was there but us. Still, she couldn't order, didn't like the food, and ended up crying. It's understandable, but I just don't know what to do to help her.

This morning she immediately asked my boyfriend where I was, so maybe she feels better with another girl around. I don't know. I'll be going over there soon. Even if I can't do much for her, it's fun to play with the baby, and I know that helps a little.

I guess I'm just wondering: Has anyone here dealt with this kind of issue? How can I make someone feel at home? How can I help out with a six month old baby? Is anyone familiar with Filipino people, and understand their customs so I might be able to, too? And any other advice you can offer.

Thanks, and sorry about the length.

TLDR; Filipino woman JUST came to America with her infant. She only knows her husband. How do I make her feel welcome?

Edit: I appreciate all the advice everyone has offered here. I had the chance to look through this thread this morning before going over for a bit, and it was very helpful.

The five of us intend on going to some parks and other restaurants very soon. She is very shy, and it seems like she doesn't want to go anywhere without her husband right now. She uses facebook to keep in touch with people back home, so I showed her skype, and though I hope her relatives will be able to get it, her relatives go to an internet cafe near their home, so I don't know how useful it might be. A lot of people are also mentioning cooking, which is very helpful and something we can definitely do together. I'm a vegetarian, and she eats very little meat, but she did show me how to make a vegetable lumpia, which was a lot of fun. I also really appreciate the baby advice, though I know that there are a lot of informative subreddits and other places online for that. 

A lot of you have been wondering where we are located. We are near Detroit, and I know that there is a lot of diversity here, but I am not familiar with any Filipino people or places. I'm not sure whether or not she would be interested in it, as we are about a half an hour outside the city, which is further than her husband would want to take her anyway. Some of you have brought up taking her to church, which is a good idea, because she and I are both Catholic, but her husband is atheist and wouldn't really like that.

I think that with a little time she'll open up and be really friendly, she's a very interesting person and we get along very well, she's just shy right now. I'm going to try and find Filipino restaurants or markets to take her to, but first I'll show her what's nearby on walks. All she knows right now is the apartment, and the grocery store next to the apartment. There's some issues, because her husband thinks that he can get whatever she needs, or go anywhere she needs to go with her, but that's another post I guess, haha.

Anyway, thanks to everyone. Let me know if any of you happen to be familiar with the area, it would be a huge help. ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1369698596.0,,,True,t3_1f355a,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f355a/how_can_i_18f_make_my_boyfriends_roommates/,

She has been acting secretive for a while, and on Wednesday she told me that she had a huge secret. She has been secretly dating a guy. Which if she was just dating a normal kid, I'd be really happy for her. But this guy is older, married. This whole situation is so FUCKED, and I don't know what to do. I love her and I want to help her, but I'm so out of it. I need help really desperately. 

The guy and her has been seeing each other since December. He is a lot older than her. Like in his 30s (maybe late 20s?). I've met him once. He gave us a ride and Emily just said he was a friend of a friend and she acted like it was super random that he was there. This was in like February. He was super nice and I didn't think like anything about it. Whatever, just a guy. Kind of cute, if I'm being honest, but I just thought he was like a family friend. 

Well, this guy and Emily have been together for like six months now. She hasn't told me how they met or anything like that, but they've been secretly seeing one another. He drives to visit her and he has been taking her out on dates and they've become serious.... or at least like she thinks they are serious. I don't think he lives where we do since she said that he drives like an hour. Emily won't tell me anything about him but I'm almost 90% of where he lives. But its kind of a big place so it doesn't help. 

Emily wouldn't tell me that he was married at first, but yeah he is married too. Awesome. Supposedly, his wife is a bitch, but yeah... guys lie. I don't know why she is with him, when he is such bad news. Who dates a married guy. WHO IS ALSO TWICE YOUR AGE?! Like I'm trying to explain this all to her and she won't listen. To her, he is perfect. Like she wants to tell me all of these little things that are going on with them. Since she confessed, I've been having to hear her little stories. Like about how he does all these romantic things for her, buys her things, and then he like ignores her too. I just don't know what i'm supposed to do... dating married people is wrong. And dating older guys is kind of weird... for her and him. I think she should stop, but I don't know how to tell her without like seeming like I'm hating.

I do. If there is no remedy for this I will still stay with her. She is my best friend and all the weight in the world cannot change that.

My wife and I met a long time ago. We went to the same high school and started dating after running into each other in college. She was (and in most respects still is) perfect. She is smart, considerate, and highly motivated; and at the time she was fit and flirty. I found her highly attractive. We used to go hiking together. We would skip town on the weekends and go to the beach. We would stay out all hours of the night, and come home and have marathon sex. It was great. Hands down the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. If Disney were to make a fairy tale about a guy’s dream, it would be the life we had together.

Lately over the last 5-6 years our life has changed dramatically. We are no longer in college and haven’t been for a while. Life has slowed down. We both have desk jobs, and we live in the suburbs. Everyone gains weight when life slows down. I know that. I also know that no one is perfect; I too have gained some weight. Life happens. But the cute little girl I used to go hiking with is now obese, and it has made a big impact on our lives.

It all started when my wife went through a depression. She and her father were very close, and he died unexpectedly. It was hard on her. About a year later (about the time we got married) she had trouble finding a “real” job. The highly motivated girl in college was now unemployed and depressed. We worked through that, as best we could, on both counts. She is now back on her feet, and back at work. But she never shed those pounds she gained during the depression. She went from a size 4-6 to a size 18-22+. I’m not exaggerating. I wash her clothes, so I know her dress size. This additional weight is a lot to carry around, both mentally and physically. I know it depresses her. I see it on her face when she looks in the mirror. It bothers me too; somewhere between size 10 and 18 I just quit being attracted to her. It pains me to care about her so much, and then not be able to “get it up”.

Last year, my New Year’s Eve resolution was to get fit again. I hoped that my wife would follow suit. The weight was fairly easy for me to lose; all my friends (and their wives) are fit. The guys golf on Saturday mornings (we walk the course), and we go running or hiking a few times a week. Her friends are not as supportive. 
Basically I want my old girlfriend back. I want to get back to having marathon sex. I want to find my wife physically attractive again. I want to be happy, and more importantly I want my wife to be happy. I know her. And I know she isn’t happy. She cries after going out with my friends and says, “I’m the fattest person in the room.” She cries after sex sometimes too. She doesn’t feel attractive, and sex isn’t even a shadow of what it used to be, when we do bother to have it.

I want my wife back. I know she is in there somewhere. She still sends me flirty texts. She still grins that devilish grin that speaks volumes of what she wants to do to me. But once we are alone that all falls apart. She doesn’t sleep naked. And neither of us is motivated to have sex. On the off chance we do, she has to have the lights off. I’m no longer physically attracted to my wife, and it is eating away at me. I’m NOT going to let this beat us. We have made it through worse, but this problem has been around for years, and I’m looking for some solution.

We have been married for only five months, but have lived together for a total of seven years prior to that and dated for a year before moving in together. 

For my wife’s new  job requires her to travel on occasion. Recently she was out of town for three weeks on business.  She was able to return for the weekend, but was very busy during weekdays so we were unable to communicate much. This was ok. I understand that if her employer is willing to pay to ship her off and put her up some place they are going to want to be sure she is being very productive. Every night we would talk on the phone for at least a few minutes when she called to let me she was doing ok and I need not worry. During the day time we would chit chat via SMS to keep up. 

Things seemed ok. Except for on the second week she was away one night she wouldn’t answer my calls, respond to my texts or anything. I was worried sick. She had sent me an SMS at one point saying she was going to be stuck working really late, but it was incredibly unlike her to not at least give me a quick call. After being up exceedingly late worried I finally managed to get some sleep. I woke up and she still hadn’t called me back and was not answering her phone. Eventually she did call sounding groggy as hell saying she had been at work very late and promptly fell asleep upon her return to the hotel due to exhaustion.

Yeah, I know. That should have been a big bright red flashing sign. And it was. I had a very, very deep suspicion that she had cheated on me. But I’ve known my wife a long, long while and it was so, so very out of character for her to do this. I made a mistake I’ll never make again. I trusted her instead of trusting myself. Anyways she came home that weekend and things were ok. I rapidly shuffled my suspicion to the back of my mind and went on with life. Things seemed ok. 

Fast forward to the weekend she returned for good after spending three weeks away. I was helping her unpack and found a package for the morning after pill in her bag. Being a married couple and not being aware of her having some need for the pill it was immediately pretty obvious. I was sitting in our bedroom and the sensation of the walls closing in around me was one of the worst I have ever experienced. I think I briefly blacked out for a second. I went ahead and confronted her and after a few seconds of shocked horror she confessed.  She had met a man over the internet for the purpose of sex and had proceeded to fuck him. Three times over the course of her first two weeks out of town. That was the second worst day of my life.

There was a lot of anger on my part, a lot of shame, a lot of yelling and questions. She clammed up. When I asked who it was she claimed he didn’t know she was married and it was personal. When I asked what she had done she claimed it was personal. It was only when I was driving her to her parents home that she admitted a few details like that it had occurred three times over the course of her first two weeks out of town.

 I dropped her off at her folks, drove home and proceeded to spend two days at the bottom of a bottle. I came two at one point when she stopped by to check on me since she was concerned and at first tried to take a reconciliatory tone but it rapidly fell apart and I told her to take what she needed and get lost. On the third day after I came out of my booze induced stupor she called me and I actually answered. She came over, brought a pizza and sat and talked. She told me that she still loved me, but that things had been bad for a while and she felt alone, distant, etc etc. It was a long talk and many more subjects than that came up, but that was the jest of the why. Other details also came up as well. I don’t know why I wanted to know them but I asked and she constantly was resistant to answer. 
Eventually we reached the point where I did feel at least we had a frank discussion about our relationship and what she had done. I still loved my wife then (much like I still do now), and I felt we could fix things. Any semblance of trust we had was destroyed, but with time we might be able to put things back together.  She moved back in and after some awkwardness we did go back to some semblance of normalcy. I was still in a lot of pain and things were not good, but we talked, we went out to eat and I thought we were on track to fix things.

Then she left her e-mail account logged in before going to work. I know it was a violation of her privacy to start digging, but she had never given a reason for her infidelity that I felt was the exact reason. She had brought up many, many issues that I do not doubt contributed to it but I still felt there was something I didn’t understand. I was like a moth to a candle. And that’s how I discovered there was a second man. Apparently he was a premature ejaculator (I shit you not it was there, possibly the only time my hands stopped shaking and I almost had a chuckle), but she had invited him back again. He had declined.

I called her. And I asked who he was and told her to come home ASAP. She came back from work and once again I confronted her. And yes, there was a second man she had slept with once on the first week. The first she had cheated on me with. I brought up that I had asked her to come clean. Tell me everything and she claimed that she was afraid. If she told me about it she was afraid I would be even angrier and leave her. Then I prompted her one more time. Is there anything else you haven’t told me?

There was. A third man she had sex with on the third week.

I can see no way on Earth to salvage this. I do still love my wife and I view the whole three weeks as just one big cluster fuck of bad decisions on her part. If she had just come clean with me in the first place I might have actually been able to put it behind us. Things were actually going well after we first made our peace and started trying to move forward. I had hope we might be able to pull through. Now this though. More lies.

/r/relationships I know what I have to do, but I don’t want to do it. The day I found out she cheated on me I thought would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It was today. We talked a bit further and she claims she was terrified to tell me the full details for fear I would leave her(I do actually believe this, not that it makes it right). That it would never happen again and that she was sorry.

We moved here for her new job and I am now 600 miles from my family and friends. I don’t actually feel trapped buying a plane ticket and flying back would not be an issue, but she begged me to stay her over tears. A little shred of me still hopes things can be fixed. That we can go to counseling and work through whatever the hell happened. After the initial admission I did feel that we were starting to rebuild. Things would never be the same, but not necessarily worse.

Anyone have any advice? I think it’s pretty clear at this point there is no salvaging this no matter how much I would like to. How effective is couple’s counseling? I’ve researched a bit because I really need to keep busy right now and results seem to vary very wildly. I feel crushed and like I only have one option that I find distasteful.

Wow, I just scrolled up and I am sorry this is so long. I hope it’s not overly rambling at any points I did my best to be concise. It’s just a lot to deal with.

**tl:dr My wife cheated on me while out of town on business. When caught lied about it extensively. It turned out to be way, way worse than she initially admitted. Is there any way to fix this?**

My girlfriend (28f) of 6 months mentioned that she thought her period was coming because she felt tired. I (24m) was confused by this because the timing was wrong. 

After some probing she said that she hadn't taken any pills for ""a couple of weeks."" During that time we have had unprotected sex multiple times. I feel that unilaterally stopping birth control without talking to the other person is a gross violation of trust.

She said it wasn't a problem and wasn't my business because 

1) She can't get pregnant since she hasn't had her period for three months (the internet indicates this is untrue); and 

2) She stopped so as to get her period because she was uncomfortable without it. This is a matter of her health which is her discretion.

Given she has full health insurance and I told her to see a doctor the last time she missed her period, I'm not happy with this explanation. We had openly talked about birth control and she had asked me for advice on it because I have more knowledge and experience with it. [eg: Can I skip the inactive pills? What do I do if I miss a day? etc] 

I'm sort of shocked that she would unilaterally decide to stop taking birth control pills. I feel like this is a large violation of my trust. 

I'm not particularly worried about her being pregnant or trying to get pregnant (although I suppose there is a small possibility of either), but I'm still unhappy about it. I feel like she ran a pregnancy risk without talking to me about it which is extremely objectionable to me. Am I being unreasonable?

**tldr:** GF (28f) of 6 months stopped taking birth control for health reasons without telling me. She says this is fine and a non-issue because she has not had a period in 3 months so cannot get pregnant. I disagree strongly.

**EDIT1:** GF has stated she doesn't want to have kids and (by my evaluation) is not in a good position to have kids.

**Edit2: Thanks everyone for the advice and supportive comments!**

**Update: 5/28**

Talked to her again. She seems pretty guilty and has admitted she is in the wrong. She has reiterated that pregnancy is not an option for her.

Her explanation: She was really busy and didn't have time to see the doctor for a follow up appointment and renew her prescription. She didn't tell me before sex because 

1. she (incorrectly) thought she couldn't get pregnant, 

2. she (correctly) thought I would be pissed off at her laziness and poor time management if she told me,

3. she wanted to have sex.

This explanation is extremely believable to me. Her previous statements still don't really make sense, but I think she was trying to justify her actions to herself.

She's in the dog house for now but I things are likely going to be fine.

**tldrupdate:** She didn't tell me because she didn't think she could get pregnant and is slightly incompetent. I believe this. She is very sorry and won't do it again.

**Update2: 5/29**

Considering pushing GF to get a Depo-Provera shot (since hasn't behaved responsibly in taking pills). I suspect she will be unhappy with that suggestion but will agree. Does that sound reasonable?

We've been together a year. I've been taking a new birth control for about six months now and only started sleeping with him off the condom about a month ago. I guess the birth control I was taking wasn't working properly, because now I'm pregnant. 

I'm in school and work two jobs. I moved out of my house at nineteen because of an abusive relationship with my father, so I can't go to my parents for help if I was to try and have the baby. 

It's still very early, probably about two weeks in. 

I don't have the time or the money to raise a child. One of the jobs I work involves a lot of heavy lifting, so I wouldn't be able to work it during the later part of my pregnancy. 

So, abortion feels like the only option for me. I don't think I could afford the time off work just to have the child, let alone raise it. But my significant other wants to keep it. He's always wanted to be a dad. I've explained to him why I don't want to keep it, but he's convinced we could make it work. For the record, he isn't working right now. He's living with his mother right now, who is also not working and they just received a foreclosure notice on their home. He's been trying to get work, but hasn't come across anything yet. So, how he thinks we can raise it is beyond me. He just keeps saying, ""We can make this work. Give me time."" 

I've already accepted that it's not possible. Both our lives, or at least mine, would be ruined. I understand we made a mistake, but there's just not a lot I can see done. But I don't want to completely disrespect his views by going to get an abortion anyway. Is there any advice you guys could give me to convince him I just can't have this child? 

EDIT: A lot of you seem to be very supportive of it being my decision. I appreciate that. But I need advice for how to help him cope with it. I'm pretty sure I can't convince him I'm doing the right thing, but I at least want him to feel like I'm giving him say in what will happen. I don't want him to feel like I'm just ignoring him. 



EDIT: [IMPORTANT] I talked with him after reading this thread. We discussed adoption for awhile. We decided that in the end, he would not be getting what he wanted through it and I would not be getting what I wanted (Or needed, as I believed it). It's not compromise, its just another option that neither of us thought practical. I couldn't risk losing my scholarships or breaking from my job. He wouldn't get to be a dad. I made it clear to him that by making the decision to have the child, he would be putting the health and well-being of the girl he claimed to love in jeopardy. This got his attention. I explained how I would suffer in the long run. Explained how it could ruin his life as well. We'd be putting a lot of pressure on his family, since my family couldn't be involved. I asked him if wanted to raise a child with the best possible future or raise one who'd be struggling everyday. I reassured him that we could have children in the future. He said he was under the impression that abortions could cause women to have difficulty having kids later. I said the earlier I get it done, the less chance of that. 

He left to go for a walk after we talked. When he came he agreed the abortion was the best choice, but he wanted to go to the clinic with me. He feels like he put me in a bad spot and wants to be supportive here on in.

**SUCCESS!!!**


I finally maned up and kissed the girl!  And it was great!  She was cooking us dinner after we worked all day, walked up behind her, made sure she had nothing in her hands that would spill/burn, grabbed her arm, and before she could say a word our lips were together.  The kiss lasted for about 10 seconds before I pulled away.  She blinked several times, obviously stunned, before she asked ""what was that for"".


While she was finishing cooking, I went into this 10min speech of everything: how I felt, how absolutely stunning she is, how amazing her personality is.  She just listened and blushed, sometimes downplaying herself to which I'd reiterate my point.  After we finished dinner and I rinsed the dishes, we sat down for some TV and a movie, when she snuggled in and turned me towards her and kissed me back!  Not long, but just a return of the favor, which let me know she was OK with the fact that I had kissed her.


Sadly, we both fell asleep on the couch watching the movie, so there was no makeout sesh, nor sexytime (which I believe it's that time of the month), which is OK.  We've still got our date tonight, and I'm sure there will be more time while out and once we return to continue to get intimate.

[First update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t02j6/updategf_doesnt_show_relationship_on_facebook/).


I totally forgot I posted my story to r/relationships awhile back. Figured I would update one last time.

The past two months have been turbulent. My girlfriend wanted to press charges but has been reluctant to do so. She said that he'll get better, things will work out, etc. Kinda pissed me off, but it's what she wanted to do. 

On top of this, she was acting weird, i.e. hanging out less, not being as cuddling when we do hang out, and even deleted her facebook. I figured this was all due to stress from finals and finding a job. After telling her time after time if she needs to destress that I'm there for her, I finally confonted her about her emotional distance about three weeks ago. She told me the following:

1. She will not press charges against her friend.
2. She thinks that it's best we split. 
3. She mentioned that she's going to start dating her friend, as it's simpler for everyone (?)
4. If I mention any of what happened in the past few months to anyone, that the guy will have me killed. Well alright. 

So uh, at the end, she went psycho and I lost a good gal in the process. 

The guy texted me (I'm assuming he got my number from my ex) saying that he won, and I best never talk to ""his girlfriend"" again. 

I'm somewhat hurt, but moreso bewildered. In the past three weeks, I've been doing the normal post-breakup stuff; drinking with friends, working out, and of course, lots of fucking. 

So yeah, I know thing will get better, and I feel I dodged a bullet.

Most of the following is verbatim...I know because I keep replaying everything in my mind.

A...lot has happened in the past couple days.  We talked Friday night...many tears were shed.  Saturday, we went out to dinner as a family, and all was right with the world.  Sunday night we laid in our bed talking and laughing, and both of us felt great.

Yesterday she came home and we talked again, and then she said something along the lines of ""Fake it till you make it.""  I asked what she meant, and again, her face fell.  

""I don't want to sound douchey...""  

""Don't worry about that, we're supposed to be talking.""

""...I don't love you.""

*long pause*

I'm in a bit of shock, because that had been a huge part of the past seven days, in deciding whether we should try to make this work, or end it now before we were incapable of being amicable.  I sit there and she says, ""But that's not necessary...I care about you.  You're a great person, and a wonderful father, and no matter what we can stay together.  People stay in loveless marriages all the time.""

""So...this past weekend, when we kept saying we loved each other and we wanted to work on this, you were...lying?  Or did you just not realize it?""  I asked.

""I...I decided it didn't matter so much to me if we're otherwise happy,"" she answered.

Another long pause.

""We can still do this,"" she said.

""I...don't know if **I** can,"" I answered, ""I assumed we loved each other, it had changed but we still did love each other, and we could work on it.  This...this changes things.  For me.  I said years ago, I wouldn't stay in a loveless marriage...when did this happen?""

""A couple weeks ago, I guess,"" She answered, ""Maybe a couple months.""

""...any reason I didn't have the right to know about it before now?""

""You said you wouldn't get mad so long as I was honest.""

""I'm not mad.  Somewhere inside I'm ecstatic that you told me.  Just, this is a bit of a shock after this weekend and all our talks,""  I muttered, ""I kind of wish you had told me this earlier.  Before we spent the weekend trying to figure out where we were.""

""My parents don't love each other.""

""Your parents are miserable, and have created a toxic family that controls everyone...I...I'm not going to do that.""

""We have kids,"" she said.

""That's not a good reason to stay married if we're at this place...that's actually a horrible reason to stay married.  Can you love me?""

""I don't know.  We can try.  People do it all the time.""

""I...need to go to for a walk.""

So, I went to the park.  I smoked half a pack of cigarettes in about 20 minutes.  I watched the ducks.  I came home.  And I packed my overnight bag and took my pictures off the wall.

""You're leaving?""  She asked, tearing up.

""I don't think I can stay...""

""The kids?""

""We'll figure it out...I want this to be amicable.  I don't want a fight.  We'll divide things as best we can...Lord knows we don't have much that isn't already protected on both sides.  I'd like the house down south where my family is...we'll figure out a trade for your half of it.  It'll destroy the kids if we do this the wrong way,"" I said, ""I want to be clear though...if you dick with me about my children, I will scorch the goddamn Earth under your feet.  Anything else we can come to a compromise on, but if you or your family try to dick me around about my kids, I will rain Hell over this county and use every resource I have to destroy all of you and everything you hold dear.  I will never try to screw you with them...you're a wonderful mother...but I will not put up with any shenanigans where my kids are involved.""

""Understandable...I'd never do that,"" she answered, sobbing.

""You wouldn't,"" I muttered, ""Your family would.""

""I won't let them.""

""You sure haven't stopped them from doing anything else...""

""I'm sorry.""

""No, I am...I shouldn't have said that...both of us got us here.""

She's quiet.  I'm quiet.

""Can you sleep on it?""  she asked.

""I don't know if it'll change anything...""

""Please?""  

So I did.  We slept in the same bed, not touching, not talking, the kids between us watching a movie.  This morning the alarm went off, and I got up and took a deep breath...then woke her.

""Yes?"" she said.

""...I'm going back down south.  I'd like to take the kids with me.  We'll be at my parents' house.  They need to know, and it'll help to have the grandchildren there when I tell them.  You know they won't try to dick you over.  I need you to help me get them packed while I go downstairs and switch the passwords on my accounts and set up mail forwarding.""

""...You're leaving?""

""...I guess so.""

""Your job...""

""...can go to hell.  I can't lose you and then stay up here.  It'll kill me.  I need my family if I'm going to make it through this.""

We packed the kids.  I loaded the car.  The kids were still sleeping when she left for work this morning, and we stood at the front door looking at each other.

""I don't want you to go,"" she said.

""I really don't want to go,"" I said.

*silence*

""Would you like me to wait until you get home tonight?"" I asked.

""Will it make it harder?""

""It'll give me time to think without you here.""

""...okay.""

She picked up her wedding ring and put it in her pocket.  I left mine, with the medallion she got me for our first anniversary, on the table.  I haven't put either of them on today...normally I never take them off.

Before she went into her office, 40 minutes ago, she called me.

""I can't do this.  I have to know.  I won't be able to do my job if I don't know,"" she said.

""I...can't give you an answer.  You've had more time to think about this than I have.""

""No I haven't...""

""You knew all the facts...I just found them out yesterday.  This wasn't a minor fucking detail,"" I muttered.

""Don't get angry, please,"" she asked.

""I'm not.  But I have to process this...I have to think.  I said Saturday the ball was in your court...it's not anymore.  It's in mine, and I don't know whether to dunk or dribble.""

""I won't be able to concentrate,"" she said.

""I'm sorry.""

""Maybe you should go,"" she said, ""just to clear your head.""

""If I go, I'm probably not coming back...no matter how much it hurts.  I can't go through this again.""

""...so you won't give me an answer?""

""I can't.  Not at this second.  I need to think...I've given you the same answer without a pause all weekend.  I didn't have all the facts then.  I need a day, at least, to decide...I'm sorry.  It's not about whether it's hard on you right now.  I know it is, and I wish I could tell you one way or the other, but I just can't.""

""I understand...Can I call on my lunch break to check?""

""I'll...try to figure it out before then.""

""...okay.""

So, Reddit, here I am again, this time with a packed car, sitting here, smoking and watching my children play, and trying to decide what to do.

I don't think I'm asking for advice this time, though I'd be happy to take it.  Just...trying to decide if I stay and try to rekindle love with no guarantee of success, or go and try to make a new life.

It'd be easier if I didn't still love her...or if I didn't want to stay.

**TL;DR**  Wife and I talked all weekend and determined to work things out, go into counseling, and try to save our marriage.  Determination was made based on both of us saying we loved each other.  Yesterday she told me that wasn't true, but she would be happy staying in a loveless marriage.  I'm not, and am now even more hurt this wasn't mentioned when we were trying to decide whether to stay or go.  I have roughly three hours to determine whether I want to stay or hop in the car with the kids, go back to my hometown, and start the process of losing the life we built together.

I'm the original OP but didn't remember my login for the old throwaway.

I am very sad to be here making an update on this post due to the fact that my mother has decided to end her own life. I am going through many different emotions right now, some of which are emotions about what emotions I'm feeling. Because you guys are the only ones I'm going to write to about this... I'm just going to dump my feelings here, okay?

I'm very upset that she put my grandparents through this. It was apparently a rather bloody suicide. She cut her wrists, which I have been told is very hard to do ""successfully."" I imagine that she actually took some pills and/or alcohol as well and that the cutting was simply an overt attempt at ""proving"" that it was intentional suicide.

I was incredibly shocked at this news because she has never attempted previously (beyond her binges that I've always considered suicidal). She had apparently been speaking openly about the possibility for several months, including asking my grandfather where he kept the guns last month and completing her will last November (all unbeknownst to me of course).

I feel a lot of regret right now because I didn't want this for her and I hurt because I wish I could have been there for her. I feel some guilt (I know, everyone is telling me I shouldn't) because she was obviously in a lot of pain from being cut off and from never getting to meet her granddaughter. My daughter will really really never be able to meet my mother..... it's insanely sad to think about.

Her brother-my uncle (who got in contact with me) said that she was on probation for a DUI (I think her third) in a double hit and run (which made the papers in my city) and was required to do breathalyzer tests at home multiple times per day and had (obviously) broken that so was looking at the crappy end of a tunnel leading her to jail. 

My mother was a very egotistical woman. She was a master manipulator. She was successful at leading me to doubtful thoughts about my own sanity for many years - that *I* was selfish for not forgiving her and for all the horrible things I said to her when she was drinking. But my mother was a very tragic woman. When she was sober, especially when I was younger, she was so vibrant. She rode her bike religiously and participated in charity rides. She loved music and soap making. She was an entrepreneur. *She would have loved her granddaughter.*

How does a person with this much pent up anger and sadness act at a funeral for their mother? How does the only child of this person stand in the spotlight and grieve while other people wonder why I have the anger and regret and more anger that exists inside? 

Her first hospitalization was February of 1987, when I was six months old. My daughter turned six months old at the beginning of this month. **I am going to be a better mother to my daughter than she was to me.**

Thanks for listening. Hopefully I can start to rebuild my relationship with my grandparents.

I think this is a larger subreddit and maybe I can get a wider array of opinions. 

A lot of people involved so I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. 

My wife and I have been together for 5 years and married for 3 1/2 years. I am 28/m and she is 30/f. We have no children together, and we agreed to open our marriage up a little over a year ago (late 2011). Initially it was for her to explore her bi-side and we had a few group encounters. Eventually my wife ends up meeting some girl 20/f who ends up moving in with us. They are ""together"" in their own way, and occasionally we will play together but its mostly her and my wife. My wife also met a guy over the summer who she sees quite frequently. That guy is 40/m (approximately) and I don't really care for him, but he is harmless. I just feel kind of sad for him, and I don't worry about him too much but he is part of our life. 

Initially, I was fine with her just exploring on her own because she had an uptight childhood and I was enjoying the threesomes that she set up, and I thought it was a phase. We could have fun for a year or so and then put it behind us and move on. So I had no plans of dating anyone else. Once her guy friend got involved, my opinion sort of changed. I didn't care enough at the time to forbid it, and my thinking was I would cause issues by telling her what she can and can't do. 

But I started to act more and more single and put myself out there. Our initial agreement was total upfront honesty, but I threw that out the window. I really didn't like our house turning into a hotel, with my wife and her lovers around all the fucking time. I ended up having different three one night stands in August, and out of those ONS I met a girl who I started to have feelings for. That girl, Abby is 26/f and she was my respite from my wife and the madness at home. We saw each other casually for the first month or so, and I dodged around the house set-up and open marriage, but eventually came clean. We took a break when I told her I was married, but eventually she took me back. 

She took me back around New Years and we've been seeing each other a lot and she is kind of forcing my hand. She wants me out of my house and a divorce filed soon, or she is out. Right now, I'm struggling with what to do. Do I pursue Abby and abandon my marriage or do I try to give it one last try with the wife. Do I owe it to her to say lets do away with this poly garbage and see if she is willing, or is it better to cut my losses. 

**tl;dr Wife asked for an open marriage to pursue bi interests. Eventually she brings in her GF as a live-in partner, and adds a male partner. I go against our agreement and start pursuing other women, and meet someone else. The other girl wants me to leave my marriage.

My boyfriend finally got home tonight from his weekend stay at his parents and things did not go as well as I had hoped.  

I'll start off by admitting that I've been an emotional wreck since yesterday and that probably didn't help matters.  I thought it would have been better to wait until he got home to talk things through but I think that just made things worse because I spent all night last night being pissed off.

He got home, hugged me, everything was normal.  Before I even brought up what happened last night, he says to me, ""So I hear you had a rough night?""  That's when he goes on to tell me that my lying bitch of a ""best friend"" CALLED HIM after our fight and told him that I basically attacked her.  She called him at midnight and pretty much cried to him for over an hour!  He said she was ""scared"" that I was going to make him stop seeing her.  He told me she admitted her feelings to him during their conversation also.

My boyfriend said he was caught off guard about the whole thing and didn't realize she had feelings for him.  (I don't know if I necessarily believe that).  So now I'm the one that looks like the bitch.  He says he's on my side but he's not acting like it.  We had a heated argument for over an hour (mostly me yelling and crying).  He says he just wants everyone to just move on from the fight but I can't!  

He's tired from his trip and didn't want to fight so he said we could talk about it tomorrow.  He didn't even want to stay the night.. he left and went to his apartment without even giving me a kiss or hug good-bye.  I can't help but feel like he's taking her side even though he says he's not.  I don't even know what to say.  What a shitty weekend this has been.

We figured (at first) we would stay at her house, get our debt cleared up (while paying her rent), and then move out to get a new house. After staying there for a while, my wife started liking the house so we offered my mom that we would buy the house from her so she could go off and do the fun &amp; crazy things she wants to do. 

Everything was great until we started noticing a difference in the kids. They started going to my mom (grandma) for everything instead of my wife and I, no matter how much we told them that they have to come to us first. My mom also added to this by correcting my attitude now-and-again to the kids, which is kind of a subliminal message that ""grandma has control over what daddy can punish us for."" It got to a point where my four year-old blatantly told my wife, ""I don't have to listen to you. Just grandma and daddy."" Red flag.

My mom and wife also have parenting differences, where if a kid was throwing a tantrum, my wife would let them scream it out and learn ""screaming to get your way isn't going to work"". My mom then scolds my wife for letting the kids scream and goes to comfort them. Teaching ""hey, if I scream, Grandma will do X, Y, and Z for me.""

We recently decided that it would be in our best interest to move out after we get my tax refund (which clears up all of our major debts and allows us to move into an apartment/complex). I'm just worried about hurting her feelings when it comes to us constantly saying we want the house.

We were also looking into houses closer to my work, as I'm currently a half hour away and we could get complexes way closer and save a boat-load of money on gas alone.

Finally, my wife and I did the math and it would be a couple years until we'd be able to afford the house. Which, frankly, I don't know if my marriage can stand a couple more years of living with mom.

I do love her dearly for giving us the opportunity to clear things up. I don't want to come off as some unappreciative brat. It's just something we need to do and I need a good way to tell her.

And we both have really strong feelings for each other. 

My phone recently died and he helped me get a new one this month, which he bought for $100. So I know that I still owed him that $100 for the phone.

The other day I went over to his place to exchange our belated Christmas gifts and such. Things were going great, and when I had the chance I put $100 on his desk in front of him for the phone. He put it in his wallet later on and I even saw him put it in. 

Later on his friend and mom came home. He then had to go pick up his little cousins from school with his friend. And his mom left too to pick up their aunt, leaving me alone in his room in his house. Now I've been to his place several times and been alone without him there in the room loads of times. I didn't do anything but sit on his desk and draw. 

When he came back with his friend and two cousins I went downstairs too with them. Later on when we 3 were getting ready to leave for school, he goes through his wallet and says he's missing money. He then looks frantically about in his room. And called his mom several times to ask if she took any money out. But she didn't pick up the first few times he said. So we all head to school. Me splitting with him at a station because we go to different schools. 

Later on when we got home from school. He kept on asking me through texts and calls if I had taken money from his wallet because he's missing $150. Which I've denied everytime.

 He has not stopped asking me since then and its been 2 days now. He's telling me he's eliminated his mom and friend, it can only logically be me. He even said he thought he could trust me in his house. How the next time I come over he'll just ""magically"" find the money. And every time he asks I keep on telling him I never took it! 

I don't know what to think I've never stolen anything nor been accused of anything like this in my life. I don't know what to think or do? I've now said that we should end this, because, I don't think I'll ever be okay with such an accusation. What do I do?

We have 2 kids.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wrfi3/my_wife_of_9_years_is_seriously_thinking_about/)

[Update: going through counseling...](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ww13m/my_wife_of_9_years_is_considering_leaving_me/)

My wife came clean about what was on her mind. She didn't bring up anything brand new, but laid everything out on the table.

She told me she hasn't felt in love with me or felt attracted to me in any way in a long time. I said ""how long?"" and she said ""long"".

I asked ""were you ever in love with me?"" and she said ""I don't know"".

I asked her about the time we spoke on the phone (we met online, long-distance). She said she was 17 and wasn't sure if she felt love or not, but it was exciting and her life was shit at the time.

I asked her about when we met in person when I flew to Canada. That was always our best time. We had a blast and had great sex and loved each other greatly, it seemed. We were so afraid we'd never see each other again after that.

She said it felt exciting and she was attracted to me and had fun, but said even then she had doubts inside. She said she has been repressing these doubts a long time because I seemed like the ""nicest"" man she ever met and I was older and had my shit together and could clearly provide her with a great life. She said it seemed like she should feel lucky and fortunate to be with someone so nice and she could clearly see that I loved her so she felt wrong for any negative feelings that may have crept into the back of her head.

She said she wasn't completely turned on by my body type. I'm a lanky, nerdy guy. Her father is a burly man who builds houses with his bare hands. Her grandfather was a tall, stalky man who also worked with his hands.

I've brought up my own insecurities about this fact before, but she has always calmed them. Now I see I was right to have those insecurities.

I told her I was puzzled because she initiated contact with me after seeing my photograph and being attracted to me. She said she was attracted to me, and also that I seemed exotic to her since I had long hair at the time and had a laid-back, almost surfer-like appearance (in reality I can't even fucking swim and I'm an indoor person).

I sent multiple pictures and always conveyed that I was a tall, lanky nerdy type and she said she thought that was cool and was tired of pot-smoking losers around her.

I asked her if she was turned off when she met me in person and she said that she wasn't. We had sex almost instantly and many, many times during our ""vacation"" together and she said she was very horny and it was very exciting but now after reflecting on it she isn't sure what her actual emotions were.

She was 17 at the time and I told her I understand and I don't think she was intentionally trying to use me even though it may have worked out that way.

She said she cannot enjoy sex with me. I asked her ""for how long"" she says ""a long time"". I asked her if she ever enjoyed sex. She says that over half of her orgasms have been fake, except lately where she no longer tries to fake them because she doesn't care anymore. She said she even faked one when we first met, which hurt because I always saw that as our best sex.

I asked her why she didn't say something sooner. I said I wish we could have worked on things together but she said she didn't know how to say it and she thought there was something wrong with her for having these feelings.

She brought up multiple habits of mine that she finds highly unattractive and repulses her sexually. She said I cross my legs European style and she hates it. She's told me before, and I try not to sit that way, but it's a habit.

She said sometimes the way I talk or motion with my hands or facial expressions seem feminine or awkward to her, and it completely turns her off.

We married in a whirlwind 6 months after she met me, and after only moving down to the states with me for a few months. We did it so she could stay and settle down and find work, but I wasn't looking for a fast marriage and neither was she. We just did it and I poured my soul into making it work, and to her credit she did, too.

I see how much burden she has carried and despite my own feelings I actually feel sorry for her. I asked her why she didn't leave. She said she didn't want to be a 19 year old divorced woman.

Then she didn't want to be a 20 year old divorced woman...

Then she didn't want to be a 21 year old divorced woman...

It slowly became easier to stay than go home, even though she misses her family dearly. In the particular place she lived she has nothing to go home to and her family is not stable.

She said she told her grandparents that she wanted to stay home one time when she was visiting (meaning not go back to the states with me). Her grandmother told her to follow her heart. Her grandfather told her she made her bed and she should lie in it (he is a traditionalist when it comes to marriage).

Her grandfather passed away shortly thereafter.

9 months later we had our first child, unplanned. She told me when she found out she was pregnant she cried in the bathroom for an hour while I was sleeping (not about responsibilities of parenthood, but of her feelings inside).

She said a woman asked her recently how her marriage was and she said ""fine"" and the woman replied ""just fine?"" and it made my wife realize her true feelings she was repressing.

She said a friend of hers recently spoke about relationships and asked my wife ""you're in love with him though, right?"" and my wife replied ""yeah, I love him"" and the friend said ""no, I said *in love*"" and my wife said ""umm..."" and the friend said ""you don't know if you're *in* love? silly!"" and that was the end of it but it made my wife realize she needed to have this talk with me.

This hit me out of nowhere, and I finally know why. It wasn't my fault. It wasn't because I didn't do the dishes enough. She was repressing this.

I told her I felt sorry for her, and that I had no interest in keeping a slave and she was free to go. I told her I couldn't be with someone who didn't love me. She said ""no I do love you!"" and I said ""you know what I mean"" and she just looked sad.

She was crying, I wasn't. It was very strange. I truly felt sorry for her even though she has kept this inside for years and it affected me. In so many ways I can look back and see how this affected me.

I always used to read funny jokes about how married couples don't have sex and it made me feel better. I tried to feel like it was okay that my wife never expressed passion towards me. Now I know it wasn't my fault.

I told her that I wished she said this right from the start. I asked her why we planned to have our second child. She said it seemed like the thing she should do. She said it seemed like she should be happy with her life and she should want to buy a house and a big car and have a sibling for our first-born to play with and that's what someone in her situation should want to do.

I asked her why she wanted to go out to see a movie with me last night knowing what she felt inside. She confirmed my suspicions that she was just trying to do a friendly gesture and that it might be fun but didn't change her feelings, obviously.

She said I was the nicest guy she ever met and wasn't sure she'd ever meet someone as truly nice as me who loved her as much as I did. I told her she could find any guy, and its the truth. She said she thought I was the only one who would put up with her since she thinks she's fat. I told her it's the wrong reason and she's not fat and many people would want her for who she was. I started feeling more and more sorry for her.

She said she was afraid I would try and take the children away from her and I told her of course not.

She asked if we could be friends and I said that honestly no, not while I still have feelings for her. She said she wishes we could still do big family activities if we separate and I told her that honestly I didn't feel like I could. She was sad but said she understood.

It felt like things were finally over after our talk. In a strange way it felt like a relief. Still, she said we shouldn't do anything right away, and I agreed. This was the first real talk we had in a while and it was after midnight. I didn't want to get into talks about custody or if we'd sell the house.

She seemed to indicate she would be willing to do another counseling session even after all that came out. She said she felt like she needed counseling of her own, and space to reflect on everything.

I asked her if she felt that now that everything was on the table, was there any reason to think that us trying to go out on dates together from a fresh start would have any chance of rekindling a spark that she may have had at one time. She said she wasn't sure.

I asked her if she was just saying that to make me feel better, and if so I'd rather hear the truth so I could get closure and move on, and she said she honestly wasn't sure. I asked her if she'd be willing to start over on a new relationship and see where things went and she said she wasn't sure.

I said ""that means no doesn't it?"" and she said ""I honestly don't know. That's why I need space"". I told her that I needed closure and she said she knew, and was sorry. I told her that I had to be honest that I had feelings even after hearing so many terrible things, but that I would never be with someone who didn't really love me.

I know everyone is going to jump on me here for saying all that. The truth is that I still feel that deep down we had something at one point and it wasn't just based on me being a well-adjusted guy or nice or caring or whatever. We had sex like rabbits at one point. I felt passion from her towards me.

Part of me wants to think that maybe with this out that part of her still exists, but the other part is trying to be logical and recognize that I was just told to my face that she feels no real attraction and I should respect myself and move on even if she comes around and says otherwise down the road or thinks she may have made a mistake.

I told her I was not okay staying in a holding pattern while she went out and experimented with other guys. She said she had no intentions and wasn't speaking with anyone, didn't know of anyone.

I asked her point blank what she would do if someone asked her out and she said she would probably feel excited and she feels like she really needs passion in her life after not having it for so long.

She said something along the lines of ""I want passion and if it's not with you then I still need passion"".

I am trying to think logically but inside I keep grasping for signs that she still has a spark inside for me that might come out after some distance.

Maybe she'd go on a few dates or fool around and realize she does have passion for me but it was impossible to express with so many things gone unsaid for so long? Maybe she would find me attractive if I did not seem so depressed due to her not wanting me. If I felt more confident or seemed like I was moving on.

But I can't accept that I need to let her ""screw around"" and then come crawling back. I told her as much. I said if she intends on seeing anyone that she needs to tell me now so we can consider this over and I can move on and she said ""I don't know"".

She later said ""don't worry I doubt anyone would ask me on a date"" and I said that didn't make me feel better and it wasn't what I was asking her and she said she understood but just needed time and space.

I asked her again this morning if she could give me the closure I need, and she that ""I feel that right now we should separate"". I asked her ""does this mean you won't think about this and later think maybe we *shouldn't separate after all?"" and she said ""I don't know. I'm just trying to give you closure because I know you keep asking me but the truth is I just don't know"".

I asked her if we could at least agree that we weren't ""on the market"" right now while we sort this out, and I don't remember what she said but it sounded non-committal. I didn't get a warm-and-fuzzy. I told her again ""if you see someone I have to consider this over and I want to know if that's your intent"" and she again said she didn't know and just wanted to table it.

I am so fucked in the head right now. I am reading all of your previous advice. I am going to try and do the ""180"". I am going to read up on books like ""The married man sex life"". I am going to try and be strong for my kids and hang out with friends and move on.

It's just so very difficult. You guys have no idea how much your input has helped me throughout all this. I know it's not the most ideal outlet but you guys are the only one who knows all this. I am going to try and explain this to a friend tonight. I am in such a fucked up place right now in my head that I just don't know what the fuck I want to happen or what is going to happen or anything.

Thanks for reading all of my walls of text.

**tl;dr:** Wife came out and clearly stated, without any ambiguity, that she has felt a huge burden inside because she has felt like she wasn't sexually attracted and didn't feel passionately in love and felt like she has no choice but to just live with that feeling the rest of her life and ""suck it up"". It has affected our entire relationship. I don't know if there is any hope at all of ever finding the initial spark that brought us together. I want to believe it is there, but I know in my head I have to plan to move on now and I'm probably an idiot for not moving on no matter what happens. You guys are all I have.

**Update:** You all are wonderful, wonderful people. Thank you so much for all of your kind words, it has helped me and kept me sane more than you know.

I am hanging with friends tonight, giving the wife space (we're on a ""time out"" at the moment), and the wife agrees there will be no 'other people' for either person unless/until a divorce is finalized.

Last talk before we agreed to take a ""time out"" was that she feels sure she should ""move on"". I asked her if she was 100% she would not change her mind as we proceed down this path and she said ""no"". I said ""Then that's what you need to think about during this time out because I'm not going to invest myself in one decision and then hear second thoughts, etc"".

So, we're getting a divorce. :(

The more I thought about the entirety of our relationship, the more I realized that it's been romantically one-sided for a very long time. The sex has always been great, but it's been me asking and initiating and her obliging for probably 7 of the 9 years that we were together. I've been the one giving hugs and kisses, and while she hasn't been completely cold, I could always tell that she hasn't been as into it as I have been.

I don't know. What I'm trying to say is that her questioning her feelings for me has been going on for longer that I really care to think about, and she was just trying to push herself to stay with me. We've been best friends for almost a decade, but now it's time to move on.

I just wanted to thank you guys for all of your input. I'm going to try to get through this. It's hard, being the guy who's still in love. But I'm not going to trick myself into thinking that I can make this work. I'm really just sad that my son has to grow up with divorced parents. Well, I'm sad that I'm losing my best friend too, but I'm really sad for my son.

1363645305.0,151,self.relationships,1ajwx9,[UPDATE] I'm [23F] concerned about my boyfriend's [21M] relationship with his female friend [21F]. ,qwerty12345asdfjkl,186,35,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ajwx9/update_im_23f_concerned_about_my_boyfriends_21m/,"Originial Post -http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/174r5i/im_23f_concerned_about_my_boyfriends_21m/

TL;DR My boyfriend was hanging out with a female friend of his a lot while I was gone over Christmas break. They were out drinking until 2 am and she was coming over to his place. I knew they were friends but I'm concerned because I didn't even know about this until my friend told me.

I know that not too many people responded to my original post, but I need some additional advice about this situation.

My boyfriend and his ""friend"" haven't hung out since my previous post (3 months ago). That is, until last week. I'm normally not like this - but given my previous concerns I was anxious about him spending time with her.

I snooped. I know I shouldn't have. I know I should have just asked him. The thing is, he's so great! He doesn't seem like the type AT ALL. Even after what I found out previously I'm still not sure what to think.
This is what I found on his phone:

There was a short conversation about making plans a couple of Saturdays ago. It didn't end up happening because of a family issue, though.

Him: ""If you're okay with it, I would like to reschedule and I do want to catch up. I feel like it would be good for both of us."" 

Her: ""I think you're right. Do you happen to be free on Wednesday? If so let's not go to [bar]."" 

Him: ""I work until five. Do you want to do supper or something?"" 

Her: ""I'll be at work until 6:30. I'll just text you after and we can figure it out."" Him: ""Supper you think or just some drinks? Or whatever you are thinking, I guess it doesn't even have to be drinks."" 

Her: ""If you want to do drinks that's fine. I usually try to eat something quick/healthy at home during the week. I'll leave it up to you"" 

Him: ""That's cool with me. Text me when you're off and tell me when and where."" 

Her: ""Will do."" 

Him: ""And one more thing, have a good day tomorrow."" 

Her: ""Thanks :) you too""


Later ---


Her:""I'm just about to leave work. What were you thinking for tonight?"" 

Him: ""I'm okay with anything. Even if you just want to hang at your place too I'm seriously okay with that as well. Whatever you think."" 

Her: ""Are you opposed to [bar]? If it's lame we can do whatever. Maybe you can meet [her cat] lol""


Later, after they hung out:


Her: ""Hey, I had a good time tonight. You home safe?"" 

Him: ""Yes ma'am. And yeah I had a really good time.. catching up and all.""


I know there's nothing glaringly awful in there. This is the first time they've hung out in three months and I just feel there's something off about it. Another issue is that I'll be leaving in May for four months back to my hometown. It's 2 1/2 hours away. These are the same conditions in which the original concerning incidents occurred - when I was gone for Christmas break.


Am I crazy? Be honest. In fact, please tell me that I am.


TL;DR: Feeling uneasy about my boyfriend hanging out with a girl who he knows had/has feelings for him. Wondering why they're hanging out again after three months of not seeing each other.

**EDIT: I told him I saw the texts and apologized for violating his privacy. I said that I thought it was inappropriate for him to be spending time with her and asked him why he felt the need to see her. He wasn't mad. He just got really quiet. He said he was sorry and I knew before it even came out of his mouth. Yup. He slept with her that night. Thanks to everyone who didn't tell me I was crazy.

No serious breakups or separations.  She has a son [7] that I've been basically the father of since he was 2.  We started living together around year 4 of the relationship.

When we met we worked together, we partied together.  There was quite a bit of drinking involved, but the connection was true and we have been happy (for the most part) to this day.

Just recently she's been telling me that I cannot drink alcohol in the house anymore.  I don't drink to get drunk, I don't even drink to get a buzz.  I have a beer or two after work and it helps clear my mind after a stressful day.

I've tried reasoning with her that it's harmless (generally speaking) and that she's being completely unreasonable, that many people do the same.  Every time the issue arises she's like a broken record: ""not in the house, not in the house..."".  It's nearly impossible to get a word in edge-wise.

How do I (or is it even possible) to reason with her?  She's always been very stubborn, but never controlling.  She is under quite a bit of stress with her work, and I've attributed her recent behavior changes to that.  She has been recently prescribed anxiety medications, which she doesn't take regularly.  When she takes them she's sweet, loving, helpful, and understanding.  When she doesn't she's stubborn, controlling and argumentative.

Any advice /r/relationships?

I criticise what she likes and she storms off

I joke back with her and get told im ""in a mood"" 

She constantly tells me I dont treat her like shes special despite my best efforts to do so.
She makes absolutly no attempt to do anything nice for me or actually stops me doing what I enjoy so we can do something that benifits her.

When shes upset about things im expected to say and do the right thing to cheer her up. 
When im feeling low im expected to stop being miserable and not bring her down with me.

Court hearing is on Monday. Don’t want to look at him.
I'd really appreciate it you'd take a few moments to read my whole post.

Hello Internet

This coming Monday I have to see my ex boyfriend in a UK civil small claims court. We split up 2 years ago (he cheated on me). I was very ill with depression at time and practically had a complete meltdown when the relationship ended. 

We lived together, with my young daughter (now 9). We moved to a new city where I had no friends and family, we were in our joint rented house for about 8 months and then he left. He wouldn't return his key, take his belongings or vehicle and didn't pay me a penny for his share of the rent for the 4 months remainder of the lease. This house was taken on based on both our income. Prior to this move he didn't have a job and I covered much of the bills and he racked up a lot of credit card debt.

When we moved he chose to get into even more debt. When he left the house (pathetically I wanted him to stay, utter emotionally co-dependant) he walked out of the job he had recently got to go live in a squat. He decided to make me his cash cow. He wrote a financial agreement saying I owe him £4k plus 20% APR and over a period of time (basically creatively planned so I pay off his debt, he’s claiming back gifts etc) I just gave in. He was being HORRIBLE about it, threatening to come back into the house and take my belongings while I worked. I had no one I could turn to. For the sake of a quiet life, I signed in the end. By this stage I was living with a friend feeling really vulnerable and being eaten alive with debt and anxiety. I just wanted him to go away. It seemed like the easy option by this point.

I stopped paying the monthly payments a year ago. It’s taken a further year for this to come to court. He made the application but he has not stuck to the court time table.

As evidence, he has submitted every IM conversation we had after he left (nothing is sacred), emails that show me giving in. It appears amicable, but it’s partial email transcripts. In my bleakest days, I deleted every trace of him out of my life. The case is ambiguous and contradictory but the fact remains, I signed the agreement. I cannot afford legal advice so I have no idea how this will go down really. I have tried to be as factual and chronological as I can and he has gone for the mud-slinging approach.

If I lose I will get financially black listed for 6 years. But worse than that, I have to face this man who BROKE me. I had a year of CBT and am still on meds for anxiety to this day. It helped but I don’t know how to cope with this, with being cross examined and second guessed.

This could go either way, it really could. The worst thing is I don’t know how to I cope with seeing this guy again. It's affecting me really badly :(

Any tips, reddit?

First Update:  http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/154vzb/i_29m_have_separated_from_my_gf_22f_and_it_was_a/

First, I really want to thank everyone who has given me support, and offered their advice.  This subreddit really helped me, and reading other posts really made me feel like I wasn't so alone in the world.  So, thank you.

Alright, here is the update.  I made it through the holidays.  They were tough, and I really wasn't much fun to be around.  It feels so long ago already, and it was a lonely time.  I had anger in me.  Lots of it, I would see couples, and I would instantly hate them.  My self-worth was incredibly low, and I failed at eating right and exercising, and I was so stressed and worked up, just eating made me nauseous and was difficult to keep food down sometimes.  I lost a lot of weight, which is bad, because I am already a pretty skinny guy.

I did a lot of soul searching, and I listened to everyone's advice, and I took time for me.  I know I was not always fun to be around, and I had ups and downs, but I spent a lot of time with friends.  Not being alone is great, and having friends listen to you just say the same things over and over again is great.  

Suddenly, I no longer felt like talking about it.  I looked at our relationship, and looked at myself.  I have a BA in English, and a minor in music.  I wrote a book two years ago, and used to play drums in a couple bands.  I realized I no longer have any drive in life.  I stopped writing, stopped playing music, stopped being this happy go lucky, magnetic and charming person I used to be.  I was just coasting through life, and that was how I treated our relationship.  No, I am not blaming myself for the breakup.  It was her being immature.  But, any healthy relationship needs me to be happy with myself.  That was something I needed to change.  That was December 29th.

I got off my ass, shaved, forced myself to eat, put on a suit, and went to the bar with some friends.  There is a lot to be said, and even slightly therapeutic about knowing you look great.  I wasn't out to troll for drunk girls.  Just, decided I would actually be social, meet new people, and have fun with my friends.  It was great.  I started feeling my self-worth again, and started seeing myself as a great catch for anyone, and that I have a lot of value.

New Years eve rolled around, suited up again.  Went to some house parties, went to the bar.  Met up with many friends.  Actually met some girls.  Ended up going to one of their houses after bar close, and I stayed up until 5:30 in the morning with these girls.  Just me and five ladies.  I did not sleep with any of them.  I informed them of my situation and said I am just really happy to be talking to some new people.  We exchanged numbers, and I now have a great group of girls that I spend time with.  Yes, I am aware that one or two of them are attracted to me.  But, I don't want to rush things, and I am completely honest with them of my feelings.

They invited me to a dinner they do on New Years every year, and it is a sort of tradition that they eat black eye peas every New Years, and it is supposed to bring good luck for the next year.  Anyone else ever hear of that?  It was a first for me.

I constantly am trying new bars and restaurants, heck, I even switched grocery stores.  I am becoming social, meeting new people almost every day, and I feel pretty good.  Yes, sometimes it still hurts, but I am realizing that I deserve someone who appreciates me, and will contribute to my life as much as I'll contribute to theirs.  My ex, she is not the girl for me.  I thought she was.  But, there WILL be someone better.  I know that for certain, because I will be better.

I started writing and playing music again.  Actually, I went out and bought a ukulele.  Those things are amazingly fun to play!

Sorry it is long, but here is the last bit, and it was the most liberating thing of all.  I woke up to a text yesterday from my ex.  It read:
""Hope ur glad, things with (her new guys name) couldn't be worse!""

My response was: ""I am sorry.  I don't understand how it is my fault though.""

I let it go for about 30 minutes, then I just got kinda steamed and wrote another response, some of you may think it was bad.  But I felt amazing after.  The response was long, but necessary.  Here goes:

""Actually, no.  Screw this.  You are broken up over a guy who did exactly what I told you would happen?  And you yell at me because of that?  All the time convincing yourself feelings for me changed so you can feel better about leaving me for him?  You are more broken up over a freaking 4 week fling and blame me?  Now you are saying how you want to lie in bed all day because things aren't working out with him?  You are more broken up over this 4 weeks than you were in our last three years together.  Screw that.  I deserve someone who appreciates me and all I offer.  I do everything you wanted and he does nothing, yet he is the one you want?  Fuck that.  I'm better and you will realize that someday, but I am certain that day will be too late.  I thought that you were the one for me, but you aren't.  There's other ones.  I treated you better than anyone has and probably better than anyone will and you just throw it away like it doesn't matter.  Good luck with this new guy.  I am done with this""

I felt so freaking liberated.  My life will improve.  I will be for the better, and I am moving on.  People aren't wrong...  Things will get better.  You just have to work at getting better.  It doesn't just happen over time.  If you allow it, you'll be stuck on someone forever.  Actually trying and working on getting better is how things get done.  Get out, spend time with friends, stop putting your ex on a pedestal, you broke up for a reason, even if it wasn't your reason.  There IS something better for us out there, don't waste time on people that won't waste time on you.  

I know I am not 100% fixed, and I know it's still a long road ahead.  But, I feel like I am taking the right steps, and I have been happiest in past couple days then I have in the past six weeks.  Thank you everyone.

TL;DR - Decided to move on, stop hoping to get back with the ex.  Learned I need to improve myself, and made lots of new friends.  I am getting better.

Hi Reddit. Before you start calling me a psycho, I’d like to give a little background before I say why I did it… (this is long, sorry!)

First- Relationship: a little over 8 years. I'm F 27, he's M 27. No kids. 2 cats.

Question: What do I do about my boyfriend's friendship with a woman with whom I believe inappropriate things have happened?

I've had a persistent, nagging suspicion for several years surrounding the friendship between my boyfriend and a woman he was acquainted with in high school. Apparently, they lost touch after high school, but ran into each other at college (my boyfriend and I were in a relationship at that time). When I initially met her, she seemed reserved but pleasant. Over the years, however, I have noticed that a level of hostility from her has arisen. It started with her avoiding me while at social gatherings and gradually escalated into general passive aggression and an almost frigid attitude (after reconnecting with my boyfriend, she was introduced to our friends and weaseled her way in to our group, so I have to see her quite frequently). While I liked her well enough at first, her constant flirting with my boyfriend and unfriendly disposition toward me has lead me to dislike her immensely. The last straw was her completely ignoring me at my own birthday dinner- no hello, no goodbye. Nothing. (she also brought a guest with her to the restaurant- I didn't know she was coming nor did I know who she was). A small time later, a good friend told me that she had been glaring at me the entire dinner and every time I would say something she would roll her eyes and make some sort of snooty face at me. I did not see this, but my friend has no reason to lie about it as I hadn't mentioned to any of them my feelings about her. After that, I decided to be civil but distant. I would observe her at social functions and noticed that she always seemed to immediately find her way to my boyfriend and stay by his side for almost the entire time. I have tried to discuss with him my uneasiness about her, but he’s either incredibly daft or he doesn't want to admit to me that her behavior is that of someone with a crush. I firmly believe it’s the latter... Since they reconnected at college, they've liked to grab coffee and hang out with each other over the years (alone). He’s even been to her house (I've never seen it, she lives alone). She calls/texts him frequently and it seems that she uses him as some sort of emotional therapist. She’s also apparently borderline suicidal (according to him).

For a long time, I have felt that there was something going on, but refused to believe my boyfriend would do that to me. Then for some reason something began to really nag at me. She kept popping into my head. Whenever she called, my boyfriend would leave the room. They would talk for a very long time- sometimes hours (he barely allots me 3 minutes when we talk on the phone). They would send texts to each other late at night (sometimes I would ask who he was talking to, and he would tell me it was nobody, but I looked over his shoulder one night and saw it was her). At first, I had foolishly hoped he was telling me this because he didn't want me to get any ideas about them, but I quickly realized that was incredibly stupid of me. Why would he lie? What was he hiding? Finally, I’d had enough. We have had several disagreements about this woman and how I feel about her and how I believe she feels about him. Obviously talking about it wasn't helping... I went into my boyfriend’s email and searched her name. Two emails from her popped up. One of them was very upsetting. The email said the following (paraphrased from her to him):
“I crossed the line tonight… I shouldn't have tried to kiss you… You are just so easy to be around and I feel so comfortable with you… But you are right- we need boundaries… If I ever try to do that again, just push me away and tell me a lot that you don’t want it and hopefully it will sink in… I hope you weren't in too much pain when you left :)”
His response (paraphrased)
“It’s okay [yada, yada]… and don’t worry, they weren't too bad :)”. (“They” were his apparent blue balls…). And yes, the happy faces were in their emails.

Needless to say, I was incredibly peeved. To be fair, the email was from 2009, but that just doesn't seem to matter to me. After reading that, I looked into his Facebook. I found messages between them from 2010 that consisted of her asking how much he charges for photographs (he’s a photographer) because she wanted him to take some “experimental” photographs of her so that she could see herself “the way [he sees her]”. He responded that he wouldn't charge anything and that if she meant nudes, then he would have to install Photoshop on her computer and edit them at her house “for obvious reasons:)” (clearly indicating I was one of those reasons). She responded that they would talk when she got back (I don’t know from where). There wasn't anything after that, so I don’t know if the pictures were ever taken, but I have a sinking feeling that they were…

I also checked his text messages. There weren't any from her. But I know they were texting the night before, so that means he deleted them.

I know I shouldn't have gone into his personal stuff. I know it was wrong and childish and rather crazy. In my defense, talking wasn't getting anywhere with him (he would not admit that she liked him and that perhaps the behavior was inappropriate) and my intuition has been screaming at me for several years now when it comes to this woman.  I pulled the email back up and went into his office and told him that we needed to talk. I wanted to know why he didn't tell me (a different woman had tried to kiss him once before- he told me about it and he broke off the friendship with her without any prompting from me). I wanted to know how long it had been going on, what else had happened, etc. He told me that nothing had happened since. He said that he didn't tell me because he knew I would freak out about it and he didn't want to lose her as a friend because he “cares” about her. Then he turned the discussion into how I was the bad guy for looking at his private stuff. I almost left the house that night. Instead, we ended up sleeping in separate beds. I did not tell him about the stuff I saw on his Facebook- he was so mad after I told him about the email, I didn't want to tell him more.

The next morning, we spoke again. He wanted to know if I was going to tell him they couldn't be friends anymore. I responded that I wasn't going to tell him who he could and could not hang out with. I didn't know what to say, so I told him to “keep doing what you’re doing.” I did ask him, though, that if the tables were turned, would he want me to still hang out with that person- I reminded him that he asked me in the past to stop hanging out with a male friend with whom I attended primary school because he felt that there were feelings between the two of us; while I can say that there was a time when I did have feelings for this man- in primary school- nothing ever happened between us and we became good friends instead. I ended this friendship for my boyfriend because he told me he felt uncomfortable with it.

So, after that novel (sorry!), here’s my dilemma: We are in this kind of truce at the moment and I can’t let this thing go. Later that morning he said that there was no point in us being mad at each other and that he was over it. I agreed to avoid another argument so close to Christmas... So what now? Like I said, he doesn't know about the Facebook thing and I can’t tell him about it now. He asked me to promise never to “invade his privacy” again and I really don’t want to get into another argument... But I can’t get this out of my head. I think it’s the nudes that are really getting to me. I mean, if her trying to kiss him gives him a hard on, what would taking nude photos do? What else has happened? 

…There is so much more to this story, but it would be too long to add to this post. Let me know if you want more. I will say, however, that in the past, I was the one creating problems. I never cheated on him- though he thinks I did (very, very long story- think Ross and Rachel and their “break)”… there are many ways to create problems in a relationship and I have probably done the majority of them. I am not an innocent in this or anything of the like. But I would really appreciate some advice…

tl;dr: I've already confronted him, but I'm the bad guy- What do I do about my boyfriend's friendship with a woman with whom I believe inappropriate things have happened?

1348855033.0,153,self.relationships,10mnpj,I'm a married man that had a 4 year affair. There was a child and b/c of some legal issues I now have custody of her. How can my wife and I integrate her into our family and explain this to our kids and friends/family? ,InfinitEGY,285,132,399,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10mnpj/im_a_married_man_that_had_a_4_year_affair_there/,"I am **45/MALE**. I have been married for **20 YEARS**. 

My wife is **42/FEMALE**. Our children are **17, 15, and 13** 

My affair lasted from **March 2007 to May 2011**

My daughter is **10 months old** 

My affair partner is **23/FEMALE**

**TL:DR** I had an affair for 4+ years. The affair resulted in a daughter who is now under my legal custody. My wife and I are reconciling and we want to raise my daughter as our own. I am unsure of how to explain this situation to people who are naturally going to be curious as to why we have another child without giving TMI or embarrassing myself and my family. I am looking for advice on how to proceed. 

I'll try to keep things simple. I had an on again off again affair with a troubled young woman. It was wrong, inappropriate, unbecoming, etc. The affair is over and has been for over a year now. I have apologized to my wife and we are working on healing our marriage. 

At the tail end of our affair the affair person ended up becoming pregnant. There was some dispute as to whether I was the father and the timing was a little too convenient. Daughter was born in December 2011. Paternity was confirmed in the Spring of 2012. I've been spending several hours a week with my baby since then and paying child support. Within the last few weeks my former affair partner has been going through some legal issues that are likely to jeopardize her custody. In July she was arrested on cocaine possession and around the same time ended up with a DWI. I began to become concerned with the health and safety of my daughter and the affair partner agreed to turn over custody of our daughter to me. Currently we are ironing out the legal matters with our lawyer but it should be done soon. My former affair partner is going to have to serve a 30 days sentence sometime this year (she probably won't serve all 30 days but she will be in jail for some period of time). We will have the transfer done before then. I won't be getting child support from her which I suppose is fine, even though it is slightly unfair. 

I have my wife's support in bringing my daughter into our lives. What we are unsure of is how to explain our daughter to our friends and family. My wife does not want anyone to know about the affair and we have not told anyone about it. I agree with her decision. I don't want my teenage children to think worse of me because of the affair. I do not want my wife to be humiliated because of the affair. 

That leaves us with basically the option of telling people that we are adopting my daughter and that she is unrelated to me. I am not sure if this level of deceit is the best way to go about this. I don't know what other choices we have. I am curious to know if this forum has any other advice on how to proceed. What other options are there for this? 

**9 PM EDIT/UPDATE**

Want to clarify a couple points. This is more of a ""cover story"" for extended family and friends. With my daughter there won't be any deception. When she is old enough I will explain things. She will know that I am her daddy and I love her and that she is mine.

I also realize there are people that deserve the truth. My wife. Alexa (my baby daughter). My kids. And then there are people who don't deserve the truth like extended family. So it may end up there are two stories. The truth for my family and the cover story for others. I do not look forward to confessing to my children but it will have to happen at some point. I accept that. 

Wanting to explain away this is more my wife's idea than my own. She needs to be able to hold her head up high and I want to respect her wishes. She could have left and didn't. I am grateful for that and I feel that I owe her this. 

The explanations that I've thought of and that have been offered are 

- Adoption - Seems like the best choice at this point

- Surrogate - It is an acceptable option except there is a 10 month absence that is going to be difficult to explain

- Total Honesty - Perhaps the easiest story but one that will cause my wife and me shame and humiliation 

- Sperm Donation Gone Awry - This has been thrown about a few times and I suppose it works. It does seem kind of unheard of and complicated. We'll see. I think this is too contrived to work. 

I appreciate all the advice. Lots to think about. I will go over some of these options with the wife. We are going to get Alexa from my affair partner early next week and I would like to figure something out before then. I will try to post an update to this post in a couple weeks.

There have been issues of cheating in the past (nothing major -- one happened a year or so into us dating, when she kissed an ex-boyfriend because I was always at work and she was feeling lonely, and the other happened two years ago while we were on a break, when she thought she was getting feelings for one of her friends, they kissed, and he tried to go down on her, which resulted in her kicking him off and leaving. The last one I can't really hold against her though, as we were on break. Anyway.), but we've tried making things work. Throughout the marriage, she hasn't had very many friends, which has caused her to feel depresssed.

Lately, she's been trying to reconnect with some of her old friends, which I've supported. They're hipsters, so she goes out to the city a lot and stays out late, leaving me and our child at home. Like I said, I've been very supportive of her making new friends, but going out once or twice has turned into going out almost every night, and getting into situations which make me uncomfortable. The other night, she went to the bar with one of her female friends, and the night ended at some friend-of-a-friend's house, where she went swimming in her underwear with some guys who were very obviously trying to get in her pants. She told me all about it the next day, and I don't really thing she'd do anything, but I feel like putting herself in that situation in the first place is a little inappropriate.

I could just be being a huge prude right now, but her being gone all of the time, on top of her recently stated ""I just don't feel as commited anymore"", are making me feel very uncomfortable. Is there a way that I can approach her about maybe cutting back on her away-from-home time so we can try to rekindle our romance? Or should I just bite the bullet and hope that she finds a modicum of happiness with her friends?

tl;dr - My wife's out with her hipster friends almost every night, looking sexy and getting hit on.

We have 2 kids together that are 6 and 1 years old, girl and boy respectively. My wife, and I'll call her Jill were best friends before we got married. I am a touchy person and I've told her that I like to be hugged and kissed ect and this used to not be too much of a problem. Never regular, but not barren as it has been for the past several years.


I've scanned these boards along with many others trying to find folks in a similar spot and saw where alot of people had what was called the ""talk"" about your needs in marriage.  So I did this. And it did not go well at all. She did become defensive about all of it and crushed me with 1 sentence. I suggested marriage counseling and she told me: **""Yes, I will go to marriage counseling, but I will never be the person that you want me to be.""** 


Things have been cooling off for many years now, to the point to where she will avoid any physical contact with me at all. When we go to sleep, I put my hand on her as a pat to say ""I love you"" and the response I get is: ""Do you mind, I'm trying to sleep?"" If I touch her during the day, she will literally walk out from under my touch. Anytime that I mention anything that is anything sexual, she says ""I'm ignoring you."" and walks away.


I also read where stress is a big factor, so I worked to eliminate all stresses in her life to help out. I now do all the cooking, I get the kids up for school or give our son his morning bottle so both wife and son sleep longer. She wanted to go to part time, though it was a stretch I said fine. She said she needed time off of work, so she took a month off at home, to come back for a week and then take the weeks worth of vacation that she had scheduled earlier in the year. 


Then I thought maybe its physical, so even though I was about 190 pounds I started exercising as well. (Kind of to relieve the stress of living with someone who ignores me and to see if she was no longer attracted to me) I am starting to get  cut, and continue to work out with my kids to spend time with them. Nothing. 


I love her family and have taken them on as my own. Sundays are spent at our house watching football, letting the kids play and having fun. All of her family, which I consider them all to be close friends now, think everything is A-OK. She's happy and considerate when they are there, but when they leave; she goes back to reading and playing Facebook games and pretty much neglecting that I'm even there.


I'm stuck.
I don't know what to do, or think or anything.
I fear that I will lose my kids or never see them.
I fear that I will lose my family or *her* family more like.
I'm really scared that I have become a statistic. That I have become one of those people who is miserable because of a trapped situation, with someone who is unwilling to meet the one thing I ask, and I don't mean sex. Sex, while it would be uncomfortable, I could live without. But simply acknowledging that I am there and acting like you actually like me.

I have a good job, upper management in a small company that I worked my ass of to get. I do take care of myself. I do love my kids, and my wife. I just need something, advice, help... something I don't know.

Thanks for the rant, sorry it was a wall of text.

I can breathe and start to rebuild my life. While I hurt, I feel incredibly lucky.

When our romance began it was truly like something straight from a fairy tale; he was charming and funny and caring. Plus, we had everything in common. He loved doing everything I loved to do: kayaking, hiking, going to dive bars, taking random trips and drives, shared the same interest in books, humor, foods, and we both wanted a family.

I was absolutely head over heels in love. Honestly, I still am. He's like a magnet, just draws you in over and over.

Slowly, his facade began to crack. His mind games and lying were like no other; he was always on my mind. If I wasn't with him, I felt anxious and couldn't focus. He would blow me off, say mean things, draw me back in... I would cry every couple of days after a while. 

I was losing my friends and family who only saw me as a former shell of my happy go lucky self. I almost lost my job, once, too.

This is the short story but there is about a year's worth of stories and bitter memories that would make you think ""why the FUCK did you stay that long?! Are you crazy?!"" So much wasted time and so much pain.

A few nights ago, we sat down to eat the dinner I made and I snapped. I finally snapped. I said ""I love you, thank you for seeing me tonight""

He said ""this chicken is gross"".

I responded ""not even gonna say I love you back?""

""No. I will say when I feel like it"".  He knew that would hurt me. Another jab.

In that instant it felt like I woke up from a dream. Why the fuck was I putting up with this? I got up and grabbed my things.

""Where are you going?""

I said ""Listen motherfucker, I am leaving. You are a fucking narcissistic asshole  so I don't expect you to understand or care, but you can literally eat my fucking shit. PEACE."" 

He's been blowing up my phone since then. But I am done forever.

[First update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1acs0q/update_husband_24_keep_pushing_something_im_24f/)

It's been a while since I have updated but I figured I might as well because I just separated from the military and I am leaving tomorrow night to start our new life together.

Within the past few months my husband and I have found a home that we both love and we are closing next week.  I am happy to say that this is just going to be our home for the two of us and there will be no roommates.

Ever since my first post my husband has come to realize that living with your best friend is not always as awesome as it may seem. There have been no arguments but he just can't wait to have boundaries and space of his own. Another awesome thing is his best friend and his wife found a new home about a mile away from ours.

So in the end, it all worked out and we are both incredibly happy about this outcome. I can't wait to fly out tomorrow and start my life with my husband in our new home. Thanks for all the support everyone.

~~~

Pretty sure this was all my fault, but I have no clue how to fix this.


First off, I will call the boy Kop. 

Kop and I are on the same swim team, and he asked for my number one day. I gave it to him, and he texts me every single day. I look through my phone and my inbox is full of messages from Kop. I respond to all of them, since we don't get to hang out that often (he's a grade higher, and we go to different school districts). 


We exchange texts, and during actual face to face contacts he hugs me after practice. I was oblivious at the time, and just went along since I thought he was being nice. It went on for a few weeks, and one day we asked me a question asking about my love life. He said he was looking for someone, and I said I was just heading into the realm of dating, and don't want to dive head first. I actually don't want to start dating until the middle of high school if I had time.


Kop was being more intimate in his daily hugs, and other team members started to notice. Oblivious me still didn't pick up what he was getting to. I've never paid attention to people dating or my own love life, and I thought Kop was just a really close friend at this point. Up until he asked me another question, I was still clueless. All of his questions were asked in text, and he never confronted me about them in person. 


The texting went a little like this:


K: Hey StopTextingMeDude, what kind of guys are you interested in?


S: I dunno, I still got a long way until I start doing things. I told you a don't wanna date till later.


K: Would you be interested in me? 


S: Why?


K: I would like to date you.


**PEWWWW! Mind blow what-am-I-supposed-to-do-now?!**


I am extremely under experienced  in the dating region of society, as you can see me not registering ANY signs of Kop showing me his interest before that text. 


I told him in person the next day I wasn't interested in him, and I thought he was a really great friend, and maybe in the future, when I am ready I could date him. He didn't respond like he would in text, he was shy and snappy in his answers. He texted me again that day about why I wouldn't date him, and told him that I wasn't ready, I considered him a friend, and it wouldn't work since we can't hang out much as kids in school.


I told Kop that we should wait and see what happens in the future, if things turn around for us. During that time I asked him what his plans/actions of dating me would be, and I didn't like it...


- Hanging out, a lot, with no regard for studies or time apart

- Making out often (he knows I have never dated before)

- Abandoning my close friends for him 

- And lying to my parents to be with him


I told him I wasn't interested in doing those, and he said ok, I'll think of something else.


Texted me the next day with ""new"" plans, but they were just the same things, reworded.


I told him my ideas if we dated, the usual couple things of hanging out and cuddling and spending time together, with just long enough to have time for ourselves and to be within the boundaries of parents
 rules. He completely tossed away my ideas, saying it was a stupid plan and it wasn't dating. 


At this point it was I only a month after my confrontation with Kop, and I decided I didn't want to date him.


Few days later I met him again after practice and sat him down for a talk. I told him about how he was ignoring my suggestions and just pulling out his own, and how he never actually talked to me face to face about what we are trying to connect. He didn't say too much, and it wasn't anything to defend him strongly either. I said to him that I don't want to date him if he acts like this in the future.


His texts that night blew up. All caps: ""WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME. AM I NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME THEN WHY DID YOU LEAD ME ON?""


I didn't know how I answer, so I didn't respond other than a: ""I would be interested, if you would listen to me and talk to me in person and not through the misunderstandings of texting.""


I didn't speak or text him after that, but he still texts me everyday. He never tries to approach me in person and seems to run away from me if I try to talk to him about this.


Kop's texts are something like this:


""Think about the future, we'll be happy together""


""There will be no one who will understand you more than me""


""You're making a mistake by not kissing me""



I don't know if I actually lead him on, and would like to know how to stop Kop from trying to make me date him.

**TL;DR** Older teammate has a crush in yours truly, and I was oblivious to it. He kept pushing signs on me (and I thought he was just really nice) until he texted me his proposal to date, but I declined since his plans were controlling and he never spoke to me other than texting.

I love him, without any doubts about it. I just feel like he isn't trying, and it's getting hard on me to push for things I want that I feel he should do without me asking. I'm a bit angry, and I don't have anyone else to be talking to about it.


He doesn't enjoy holding hands, making out, fingering me or going down on me and has only fingered me twice. Both times were amazing and made me think maybe he was going to change but they were spread apart by months and still I don't get to enjoy it. I initiate the sex about 95% of the time, in which I get rejected about half of the time. It hurts to be rejected.. but if I don't ask for sex I don't think we'd be having it. 


And I LOVE making out, and holding hands, but he just says his hands sweat and that he doesn't like making out. He hasn't been in any serious relationships before me, but I still feel like I'm worth trying for.. All of these things are really taking a toll on me, and making me feel extremely insecure. I've told him about this stuff quite a few times and each time he tells me he will try but I honestly don't think he is trying as hard as he could be. We had this conversation a week ago and since then I haven't initiated sex and so we haven't had sex. I get that I'm far more sexual than him, but he says sex doesn't really matter to him. It used to, we used to have sex all the time and even though he didn't do those things I enjoy, I felt wanted then. I don't want to push him to do things he doesn't want to, especially since I have PTSD from being sexually abused by my father when I was 5 so I would never wanna make him feel like he has to do anything he doesn't want to.


He is a gamer, which I have NOTHING against. But I have something against coming second to a video game. I feel like he has more fun playing that, than he does spending time with me. I'm a gamer too, but the fact that he always wants to play and not do much else really makes me resent video games. I also don't enjoy going to bed alone more than half of my nights. But he's been working on that and coming to bed with me more which has been nice to see some baby steps. It's things like that, that make me believe he wants to change and maybe it will take longer than I think.. 


Don't get me wrong, we make dinner each night together and we do some stuff together, and when we do I think we have fun. I just feel like he thinks of me as a best friend. Which isn't a bad thing.. I want to be his best friend. But I want to be his girlfriend, and his lover too. I don't want this post to be full of negativity, because that only shows one part of our relationship when there is way more to it than all of this. A lot of this is just stuff stuck inside my head that needs to come out and be rationalized with help from other people. We have an amazing connection, and can always make each other laugh til our tummy aches. I wouldn't want to trade that for anything, and I'd rather struggle with him for a while than go out and try to find anyone else. He cares about me and always makes sure that I'm okay, and I don't doubt his love for me because I know it's there and always has been. 


How can I talk to him about this in a way that shows him I'm willing to help him change, or help with anything he needs to make things right? He tells me he wants to change and that he needs my help but how do I go about actually helping? Him wanting to change is the first step in my eyes. I know he loves me, and he shows it in different ways by bringing me my favorite drink when he stops at the store on his way home from work, and I can see it in his eyes when he looks at me. But I need to feel wanted, I need to physically feel like more than just his best friend. This is a man I want a future with, and I'm willing to work out the differences we have to make it. I just don't know how or where to start.

Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who replied :) They were incredibly helpful! I spent quite a while thinking about everyone's opinions, and I think this particular issue was what pushed the relationship over the line for me. There were many many problems, both sexual and non-sexual, and I felt it was best to break up with my boyfriend as a result. 

When I spoke to him about my concerns during the break up, he repeated that he found the taste of oral unpleasant, but had ""still been trying to get past it"". He mentioned that even showers and spas didn't get rid of the taste entirely either. This response didn't go any way towards making me feel better. 

Later that day when we spoke again online (I felt I owed him answers to all of his questions), he said that ""a lot of guys don't like oral and never even TRY"". Mindbogglingly, he also said ""There's research that suggests women lower their inherent disgust when it comes to sex and sex-related things. I couldn't as much as I wanted to."" That was something that *really* went quite a way in showing me how he truly felt about it. Despite telling me this, he STILL maintained that he was ""trying"".

In regards to a lack of manual stiumation, his answer was ""my fingers can hurt and cramp after even brief fingering sessions"" which was ""really straining on my fingers and wrist"". Considering my arms are usually about to fall off when i give him a handjob (to the point where I'll often need to prop one hand up with the other arm), this didn't wash with me either. 

Ultimately, he informed me that he believed I needed ""professional help"" because I had kept the fact that he made me feel quite sexually repulsive from him for several months. He refused to acknowledge how difficult it was for me to even contemplate bringing up this topic with him, and again was just baffled at the kind of person it takes to ""hide"" such an issue from him (keeping in mind that I *did* tell him about most of the individual issues, but i hadn't yet stated that they had made me feel repulsive at times). 

With all of that in mind, as well as the other issues that were present in the relationship for many months prior to this, I'm absolutely certain it was the right decision to end things. And i appreciate the responses everyone provided me... the validation on this particular matter really helped :)

Him: [m32]
Relationship duration: 6 months.

First, I must reveal that we do in fact have anal sex on occasion.  So I am not against it outright.  Ideally I would be open to it once every couple weeks.  He asks for it a few times a week, I want him to stop asking, because all his asking has made me less interested in having it at all, and of course anal sex itself is not the most pleasant of experiences. I have explained this to him.  He still continues to bring it up, and is now getting frustrated with me when I say ""no.""

He bought a buttplug for me to use to stretch myself with anytime I feel like I'd be into it.  We went to the shop together and I picked out one I liked.  I haven't used it much though, because I have't been feeling into it.  He has, in frustration tried to make me feel bad that he spent money on me for something I don't use as much as he'd anticipated/hoped.

At the beginning of our relationship we had been having anal more frequently. This is because I often had anal with the guy I was dating shortly before him, which made me more stretched than I am now over time, but it also hurt a lot less with the ex because his penis was very small. I told my current bf at the beginning of the relationship that I would be up for anal maximum once per week.  That was my rule with the previous, smaller guy.

Every time I have anal with my current bf it is very painful, hurts 90% of the time, and for days after I bleed (after using the toilet) and am in pain. Even with A LOT of lube.  I do have powerful orgasms, but they are on top on the pain.  Because of all this I recently told him that I have changed my mind and I decided that I want anal no more than once every two weeks, considering the pain and healing time.  It does make me a little concerned about incontinence later in life as well, considering that there is obvious pain and damage each time, I have told him this concern.

We just had an argument about it, and I am looking for a way to explain to him that it is my body, my choice, and to be upset with me, and try to make me feel bad about changing my mind on the frequency is not his place, and is very unseemly. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 6 months [m32] gets frustrated with me [f25] when I refuse to have anal sex, and tries to make me feel guilty about not using the buttplug he bought me, as well as just today becoming very upset with me when I told him that my preferred frequency for anal has changed from once per week to once every two weeks (based on the fact that his penis is definitely larger than my ex's, and causes more pain and a longer healing time than I was used to at the beginning of the relationship when I told him my once per week rule).  I also worry a bit, and have shared this worry, about the possible permanent repercussions of the higher frequency (incontinence).

What do I make of this?,thrownaway3870,207,52,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1404pq/i_28m_blew_up_on_my_girlfriend_25f_last_night/,"Ok, /r/relationships, I am going to take my best shot at summarizing my situation.

Some backstory: My gf, A, and I have been together for over a year now, but we've had quite a long, and somewhat rocky, history together but besides all the trouble we've had in the past, I still love her.

Last Wednesday, before thanksgiving, I wanted to meet up with A in the evening to hang out, she told me that she was too tired to do anything, and just wanted to crash. I struggle with insecurity but my gut instinct was that she wasn't being completely truthful with me. I pressed her to at least let me come over for a cigarette (we live very close), but she insisted she wanted to just goto sleep. I asked her multiple times during the following week if she really didn't go out, that it would be okay, i just wanted to be in the loop, but I still heard the same story.

Fast forward to yesterday... I made plans with A to have a night in together where we could just relax and watch movies. After picking her up from work in the afternoon, she said she was going to go out with her friend for a few drinks. I brought up the fact that she already made plans with me, but I was okay with her going out. She extended the invitation to me as well. Later that evening, we head over to the bar and we start our usual routine of beer drinking and dart games but her friend never shows up. Im feeling a little uncomfortable at this point because I am in a bar that I never really goto, full of people that i do not know, while A is bouncing around, chatting with her friends. She introduced me to 3 different people, all while saying ""This is..."" and not ""this is my boyfriend..."" which pissed me off. She said she just forgets, but how do you forget that? Bullshit.

Anyway, later into the night, we're shooting darts with a few people when I hear her and another friend talking about the night before thanksgiving, the night she so adamantly insisted she was not out for. I was able to confirm with her friend that she actually was there, and had lied to me.

I confronted her about this, and she was quick to deny it, then gave me excuses, and finally she admitted to ""being out for just an hour, and only had one drink"". Which i know isn't the truth either.

At this point, I am very angry with her, I close my tab, and leave her there. She calls me after 2:00am and says shes walking home. The bar is only about a mile from where I live and I say I'll come for her, so she can at least get home safely. On the ride home, I completely lose it and all I can do is scream at her. 

I feel terrible right now. I dont know whether or not I am being played, or if its just my own insecurities getting the better of me. I dont think she is cheating on me, but I definitely dont think I am getting the truth from her. I don't know what to do, any advice would be a huge help. Thanks

tl;dr: Caught girlfriend in a lie and ragequit the bar last night. I dont know if i'm being played or just insecure.


Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has chimed in with their opinions and thoughts. It's given me some valuable perspective on myself, my girlfriend, and our relationship. I talked to her and apologized for the way I acted last night and we agreed to sit down and talk about this as calmly as possible.

Help!,BGGRCSHNBTTRPSHN,181,30,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vreld/girlfriend_lacks_a_social_life_help/,"My girlfriend is 33 and I am 34.  We are both moderately successful attorneys and are moving at breakneck speed towards engagement, marriage and rug rats. In love. In love. In love.

Her prior boyfriend was physically and emotionally abusive. She had trouble getting out of the relationship due to a lack of social outlets.  Once a clean break was made her mother moved in with her for 6 months to keep her company.

She is a wonderful friend and it is not fair for her to not have a rewarding social life.  I do happen to have a great social life and my friends all think she is great.

However, when I am not available due to work commitments, or when I am out for a boy's night, my girlfriend stays at home with her dog and watches tv. Tragically, if I was not in her life this would be a 7 day a week habit.

I have known loneliness before.  She is not open about her frustrations but the are readily apparent.  For obvious reasons much of her happiness depends on me.  I understand and accept this.

However, last weekend at dinner when I was under a lot of stress I mentioned that my work commitments might keep us apart for a week.  I wanted to be upfront rather than be wishy washy when date night arrived.  Her reaction was near tears and I also saw anger somewhere in her eyes. I got scared and a bit angry.

After a relatively muted fight, I told her that if she had more social outlets the prospect of going a week without seeing me wouldn't be so bad.  She knows I am putting in extra effort at work for legitimate and unavoidable reasons.  She was deeply hurt by what I said and I admit I chose my words both poorly and at an ill opportune time.

Since then she has been in a funk.  I also told her that I was insecure about her feelings for me, because I know that during lonely periods in my life i was willing to make many concessions for companionship.  

If we go the distance, I want my girlfriend to have a happy and satisfying life in every area.  But I also want to 'know' her when she is happy in every single area and will do anything I can to make that happen.

These are difficult areas for me to discuss with my girlfriend because she has a few walls up.  It doesn't help that her abusive ex exploited her loneliness and made her feel unwanted by anyone.

How can I help the love of my life help herself? I want to communicate my hopes to her but thus far all I have done is offend her.

TL;DR - GF has no social life and it affects our relationship and concerns me about our future.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your replies and suggestions.  I did not handle the initial conversations on this subject well and have decided to let it air out a bit.  I do think I unfairly projected my own ideals of what a social life should be on her. On the one hand, I know she wants a better social life but when you have a demanding job and a blossoming relationship it takes up almost all of your focus.  I would say that my biggest concern will continue to be that when either the honeymoon fizzles or my girlfriend develops new social circles she will realize I was just filling a void.

--------------------------------------------------
STATUS UPDATE

I sat her down last night and had a long talk. I told her completely that the threesome was a bad idea in our relationship and that I was very uncomfortable about it and will not go through with it. She understood and was in agreement. But as so many had brought up, that was not my main concern. I told her what worried me the most was how she was against the idea of a random and how quickly she brought up two guys at work that she was interested in. She got defensive and that she just picked them randomly, not even thinking about it. I told her flat out that was bullshit, that you just don't pick two guys like that that you work with, so quickly. She then said, sorry and that she regrets bringing their names up. I asked her why them and she said, because they remind her of me. WTF? 

I told her my concerns with her and that if she has feeling for them. She told me no, that they weren't even attractve and had nothing compared to me. She said they were cute, but I was way hotter. At this point I told her just to stop. It's funny, the one guy she mentioned, I think is/was the main target if you will. I've asked about this guy before, and his description has gone from ugly and old, to middle aged, to in his early 40's and cute and now back to old and short. I'm fucking baffled. But one thing I realized as I was talking to her, is that I have no desire to put up with this bullshit. I will not be pushed around if things escalate between them. Simple as that, i'll take the kids and we're gone. She knows I'm pissed and I hope she understands that. But time will tell.

About our relationship since a few asked. We actually have a great relationship, weve been best friends first then fell in love. We've always been very close, with much talking and not so many fights. Shes very mature for her age, more than me actually, lol. 

I will say this, and fuck me you guys are going to kill me. She cheated on her boyfriend with me when we were bestfriends still. So...sadly I do know what she is capable of. I'm afraid she just gets bored with relationships, from what shes actually told me in her past. So...time till tell.

Thank you again all for the kind words and amazing advice. Umm, happy valentines day?

What do I do now?,HeCheatedICried,189,37,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ocddy/caught_him_cheating_fuck_what_do_i_do_now/,"I never anticipated being in a situation like this.  I also never thought I'd submit relationship issues to Reddit, but here we go.  

Background: New relationship, I'm 28 and he's 29.  We just moved in together a month ago, and have been seeing each other since last June.  He has a ""best friend"" who happens to be a female (was my friend too :( ) and they hang out a LOT.  I haven't brought it up to him but it does make me uncomfortable.  I see a change in him when we are around her.  He isn't as affectionate.  I just got a new job and also I do not have a car; I'm working on getting paystubs to put money down on a car.

So on Sat night we were all supposed to hang out.  I didn't go because I had a weird feeling.  He never came home that night.  He never called to say he wasnt coming home.  I KNEW something happened but I didn't make a big deal about it; I just conveyed my disappointment that he didn't think to text me that he was staying out.

He has been even more weird since then.  Hiding his phone, changed his phone password, hardly affectionate. I did what I shouldn't have done and I realize it's a HUGE breach of trust, but I went into his phone and looked into his messages.  They slept together, are both torn about it, have been sending emails back and forth over it.  His text said he didn't want to approach me bc we lived together and he was just waiting till I get a car. Oh, and also, THEY DIDN'T USE A CONDOM.  We have had sex maybe 3 times since then.  

I didn't say anything to him about it yet.  I don't know what to do.  I'm not going to freak out and trash his place or sabotage him or anything else crazy, but I have never been in this situation and I just don't know how to proceed.  I've also emailed a few places on craigslist about rooms for rent (he doesnt know this. I did it after I found the texts).

Fuck.  How do I approach a guy I totally rely on about cheating on me?

**tl;dr Found through text messages live-in BF is cheating on me. How do I tell him I know since I went through his phone? How do you talk to someone who is cheating on you?**

(edited for Mods)

**EDIT AND UPDATE**

**Thank you, reddit.  Kind words, well wishes, ""friends"" to lean on sincerely helped me having a more objective POV in all this.  I genuinely appreciate the kindness all of you have displayed.  There ARE good people out there.  Kisses to all of you.**

**UPDATE:** 

*So he texted me asking if we could talk tonight, and i guess my snarky reply led him on. He asked why I responded the way I did and I replied ""Because I know"".  No response.  I told him not to bother dropping me off at work, that I would find my own way.  No response.  40 mins later he says hes coming.  I replied that i wasnt home, so dont bother going home to take me to work.  He called me twice, I ignored the calls and texted that I needed to weigh the gravity of the situation before I spoke to him.  He said ""what?"" playing stupid.  Or maybe he is.  who knows.  My response ver batim: *I'm not a fool.  I know you slept with A----.  its a shame you couldnt tell me the truth.* (no response, so ten mins later I followed it up with,) *"" You also didnt use a condom with her.  then you slept with me multiple times.  Whats worse is your concern isnt for my health by possibly exposing me to any STD's, but rather more relief that she couldnt get pregnant because you pulled out.""* No response.*  

*5 hours later (I'm at work, he's home) he wants to know when I'm getting off work so he can pick me up.  That was his response to me ""I know you cheated"" texts.  When can he get me? He doesnt want me walking in the dark. Unfuckingbelieveable.*

*I got myself home (to his dismay) He wants to talk.  Asks if I will talk.  I said ok.  then he waited for me to start.  I told him I had nothing to say to him outside of responding to what he had to say.  then he said ""I'm really sorry"" but like a little kid does when you tell him to not to play with balls in the house and he breaks a vase.  totally insincere.  That was troubling.*

*He admitted it.  He owned up to it.  He also said she's mad at him too (I called BS, audibly) and said he regrets it and that he wouldnt do it again (I called BS again).  At that point I asked him to produce texts and emails proving they dont have feelings for each other and that they are both remorseful.  He cant, because he deleted them all. ""How convenient.""  He asks what it means for us.  I tell him point blank that as soon as I can get out I'm leaving.  As we continue to talk, it comes out that he ""lost interest"" for me and that if he ""really loved me he knows he wouldnt have cheated in the first place"" While I kind of agree, I wouldnt admit it, instead I explained it seemed liek he was turning it around on me, that it didn't matter, he still did something wrong and knew it was wrong.  He reluctantly agreed.*

*I asked him why, if he thought he didnt feel anything for me, did he not approach me about it sooner. ""I was going to."" I pointed out that he didnt even TRY: blowing off ""date nights"" staying out with her and not calling, hanging out with her 4-5 nights a week.  ""You dont hang out with me 4-5 night a week.  After you slept with her, you went to the circus with her the next day, by yourselves.  The next night you went to play pool together, by yourselves.  I'm supposed to believe she's mad at you too and that neither of you want anything together?  I give it two more days before you hang out together.  She'd fuck you again too."" OK perhaps my last sentence was out of line but Oh well.*

*He first said I didnt have to leave, then seemed to have changed his mind when I indicated it was guaranteed that I leave ASAP.  Was he protecting his pride? IDK. He said I can stay as long as I need, I dont have to leave right away, he will still take me to work.  He will give me money for a car and a place-- ""FUCK NO.  I dont need your pity, and I don't need your sympathies.  I will sleep on the couch till I make proper arrangements."" He said he would sleep on the couch but I didn't budge.*

*He tried to discreetly blame me here and there but I called him out on it.  he did apologize, said he knows he was wrong, but that we lost what we had, and thats why it happened.  I pointed out relationships were about trust and communication, that it was unfair of him to make that decision without trying (honestly he didnt) and without consulting me.*

*I could see he felt bad, but I think more for himself.  He asked if we could stop talking about it.  than he went to bed.  he said ""You're a smart, beautiful woman, you have a lot going for you..."" fuck, that made me sick hearing that.  I simply replied ""not good enough to have your trust, right?"" and let it go.*

**tl;dr: we spoke civilly, he apologized but I question the sincerity, he says I can stay here till I find a place but I dont have to rush it. Offered money, rides to work, etc... I'm in survival mode and other than couch sleeping and whatnot, I'm not taking any other handouts from him.**

Im not really looking for advice at this point, Im kind of just looking to vent. I have a story to tell, and I need to get it all out


3 weeks ago I was with my fiance putting a check in the bank under our sons name and She breaks up with me. Her main reasoning was that she felt seperated already from me and wanted to see other people. From my point of view at the time I was blindsided and heartbroken, like full waterfall tears. But this is what lead up to it:


Last November we were arguing alot, in fact so much that we went on not talking to each other for 2 days even though we lived together. That friday morning she wanted me at her moms house to watch our son, he was given to them on the weekends so we could both work. I get there a bit late in the morning because of traffic, by about 15 minutes, she still doesnt talk to me except yell at me for being late. 

I tried to say I tried dispite our fighting and it couldnt have been helped. She ended up leaving quickly and angry. the next monday she tell me she was mad over the weekend and there was a party and she ended up kissing another guy. I was torn up inside, and had a hard time forgiving her, and i held it against her until we broke up 7 months later.


with months to come we had great moments and terrible ones as we were in our own apartment taking turns watching our son. we'd each work but she made more money then i did so pretty much paid for everything. I worked a half hour away like she did but in the other direction, and id come home tired and not wanting to do anything but sleep, especially since our son (ranging from 4-12 mos old) woke up in the middle of the night wanting to be fed. Id go to bed at 1030 like he would but i had to get up by 3 to work an early morning shift. I felt tired all day.


That was partially due to my lack of good health. Im 6'1' 268 lbs (was 286) and i didnt have energy, I ate crap foods, and i slept at awkward times on account of my son and my job. I didn;t want to go out, I enjoyed staying at home with both of them, she on the other hand loved going out. I enjoyed playing my games or working on my model hobby to relax, and i did it so often that i felt like i was always being yelled at and needed a couping method, so i turned to my interests.


Now the guy she ended up kissing months ago moved into her moms house around march because his family moved away... So im like holy F*** I cant get rid of this guy. to make it easier she stayed at her moms occasionally on the weekends with our son because her job is 2 minutes away from that house, so she was there, and he was there.. yea I felt great.


we got to the end of our lease at the begining of june and we were looking for apartments together but were still fighting alot. Ultimately we decided to not get another apartment because I couldnt afford it with my job and lack of hours. we decided to get a storage unit and put everything in there until we can get back up where we want to be... Damn that was a mistake.


4 days before we were ready to move I got the shingles. for anyone who knows this virus, its uncommon but not unheard of to get it at my age, and the intensity and be a painful rash to a knife in your side. Of course i get the one that felt like a knife, and my job had to keep me out of work until i got better. so for the next 2 weeks i couldnt work and didnt get a paycheck. 


We moved apart with our stuff in the storage unit, she back at her moms with our son, i was back at mine an hour away. my sons birthday was the 4th, mine was the 8th, we celebrated both at her moms house which was a party for him on a saturday. it was great for him, but I saw the guy there. The guy she kissed. I wasnt happy, and I looked unhappy too. I felt better once my friends showed up at the party but for the most part i was annoyed he was there.


so 2 weeks and seeing my son 1 more time we got to the bank and had our break up. I cryed.. alot. I cryed more then I ever have. I mean ive gone through breakups and i knew how they hurt, but I was going to marry her, and I have a son with her. I feel like I lost my significant other, my best friend, and my son all at once. 


I was devestated to say the least. I got in my car, and drove home, an hour away. An hour.. hell of a long time to be stuck with unpleasant thoughts. Immediately as i got to the street of my house i kept going and headed to the gym down the street and signed up. I was crying to the guy which was EMBARRASSING to say the least, but it got me a better price haha and i signed up. 


I ended up talking to one of her friends who lives 2 miles away from me and explained what i was going through, and she gave me advice on how to win her back and to sit her down and explain what i planned on doing. I called her to set up just that but she didnt want to see me. So I poured my hear out telling her i saw my mistakes and i was working on them and hoped that she woudl reconsider. She didn't, in fact left no idication that she was at all interested in me anymore.

 I spent over an hour on the phone with her, crying most of the time, telling her I see where i faulted and im working on it. To her it was just words, and i took too long to realize it, she said.. she didnt love me anymore.


My new goals were clear, I had to change... myself. In not so many words I asked was she already seeing someone else or is it the guy who she kissed that lives there, she said no on both, and said he was a boy and she needs a man. I wasn't that man, and I see that. I loook in the mirror everyday and i want to punch the image because of what i thought was my fault. 

She wanted to go out, I was either too tired or didnt have the money. She told me to get another job and I looked but i rarely found anything i was interested in so i stopped looking. I couldnt buy groceries or baby supplies on the money i was taking home, my gas bill took thr brunt of it, along with rent and car insurance, she paid for one of my rent months because i didnt have it.


after the breakup, I got advice from everyone i could, friends, family, her family, co-workers. everyday i would seek advice from someone, anyone, and id feel good for 10 minutes and like crap for 6 hours. For a guy who slept almost 10 hours everyday I got les then 4 hours each night after the break up, sometimes i didnt get more then 2. 


I changed everything that got me in trouble, starting with my health. Went to the gym as often as possible, I went out and fixed my car which i should of did months ago, and I got a new job, FT 5 minutes from her house so i can see my son at least 5 times a week instead of whenever i can afford to go down there.

 I lost almost 20 lbs by going to the gym whenever i can, and my new long term goals are getting down to the weight of 204 so I can qualify for National Guard, get trained and work Part time for them, and come back and go to school.
I went from doing nothing in my life, enjoy the fact that i had time off from my screaming son and the fights to loosing them and setting the goals i need to have a future. The whole process was a wake up call kick in the ass. To say the least, I feel like i needed it, i just wish it didnt involve losing them both.


So this is where im at today, its almost 4 weeks later, and I miss both her and my son. Ive lost almost 20 lbs so far, and ive gone to the gym the past 5 days in a row thx to my insomiac adrenaline run. I hate not seeing my son grow up so i took a Full time job down by her house and i start it next week, im also keeping this job i have for gas money purposes. This whole thing shook me up, and I was in pain. I wanted to sit in the corner and cry, I still do. My eyes are watering a bit typing all of this, because its painful. Its been almost a month, believe me its still there. 


I have these long term goals after the break up when i should have had them months even years before. I sat on my @$$ and I lost my family because of it. I get the cold shoulder from her anytime shes there and I go to see him. I am mad at myself for being a boy instead of a man for so long, and im also mad at her for what i believe was a bunch of crap to just drop me like a bad habit and not try and work it out. Oh I have anger, its great to channel at the gym.


Like I said, im not really looking for advice, I just, needed to write it all down and see it for myself, kind of keep a record of it. I tried the whole journal thing but the papers get wet with my tears and its pretty pathetic. I am continuing to get fit, and im going to get my son in 4 days and have him for 2 days sleeping over. after that i will have 2 jobs so i dont think i will have him as much. I hate myself for letting it get this far, But in a way im glad it happened because I probably wouldnt have changed anytime soon. 


Lastly I want to say that I have every reason to believe she wants nothing to do with me ever again. But im going to continue to try and get my life back, and hopefully her too. If it was a girlfriend or even just a fiance it would have been easier, but shes the mother of my child, like it or not Im in her life, so I still believe there is a chance that we can work it out later on. Im not a boy anymore, I grew up with a swift kick in the ass. It still hurts, but that pain is a reminder that i have to keep going. If not for the possibility of getting back with her, or for the better of myself, then for my son. He gets 1 father, and im not screwing that up again. Im emotionally drained, but im not giving up, not yet.

(23F, 24M)",ilikethrowingthings,225,75,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ht7jp/update_he_punched_a_windshield_i_screamed_bloody/,"This is an update to this post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hrdfn/he_punched_a_windshield_i_screamed_bloody_murder/


I decided to make a new post because I left some key bits of information out of my last post that I think would change a lot of people’s perspectives. Immediately after he broke the windshield he broke down, I’d never ever seen him break down like that. It was completely out of character for him. He’s going through a lot of stress right now and I think it’s finally getting to him. He said he would get the windshield fixed as soon as he could and he was good on his promise, he took it in today while I was sleeping and it’s good as new.


As far as the constant time with his family, his dad was recently diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of cancer and has been undergoing incredibly difficult chemotherapy. We’ve been spending a lot of time over there because my boyfriend really cares about his parents and I think he wants every second with them he can. I’m very supportive of this and I care about his parents very much too. It does cut significantly into our alone time but I would do the same if the roles were reversed and I really do enjoy time with his family.


As far as abuse, I think that word can get flung around a little too much sometimes. I’ve been in an abusive relationship and, trust me, I’d hightail it as fast as I could at any sign that the man I’m currently with could end up like the man I was with. I didn’t really explain how this was a great relationship because I didn’t think I needed to but he’s only raised his voice a handful of times in the time I’ve known him, always listens to my problems, goes on crazy diets with me to be supportive, wakes up early to make me breakfast every morning before work, is there for me emotionally when I need it and we’ve planned a future together. He’s the primary caretaker of the cats and is wonderful with children. He’s never even remotely lifted a finger toward me or threatened me. In fact, he knew I was so shaken up after my last relationship that he saved money to buy us some expensive self-defense classes so I can feel more comfortable in my own body which might explain the out-of-character stuff punching. People envy our relationship because I think they envy him. This weekend was so freaking out of character that I think it’s the reason I had to post to Reddit about it.


I think everyone’s right, we take each other for granted. I’m guilty of it too. We talked about it and he was confused when I said we haven’t been on a date in months because “we’re together so often!” I had to explain to him that grocery shopping and picking up dinner and watching a tv show before going to sleep is nice but it’s not relationship-building. It’s not the kind of quality alone time that brings you closer together. All the things we do with other people (rock climbing, hiking, going out for drinks and talking, swimming… fireworks) those are the things that I want to share with just you sometimes. That I NEED to share with just you because I struggle being with people in such intimate situations after awhile. We’re going to make it a point to separate chores and real time together so I don’t feel as neglected in the future.


This weekend was just a shit storm of little things that were unavoidable. The friend gave no notice, showed up at my boyfriend’s parents’ house and announced he was staying. All our plans that day originated from that house so there was no way to avoid him. He doesn’t have any family of his own and is really lonely so I can understand why my boyfriend is so hesitant to blow him off. I should have been more understanding at the time, that’s where I believe I was selfish. What really infuriated me is that the friend drove back to work Friday then drove BACK for the weekend even after all that shit went down. Boyfriend finally had a talk with the friend yesterday and hopefully he’ll be more respectful of our time and give notice in the future. I’m pretty sure he hates me now but I’m okay with that.


So basically, as an update, we’re working things out. We had a date last night. He cleaned the house and got the windshield fixed this morning. We’re going to try to communicate more instead of just assuming the other person understands us (ex: the what is a date? conversation). It’s going to be rough but we’re going to make it work and grow close again. He feels terrible and is trying to show how much he values me, I feel a little distant so I’m not the best audience but I’m trying. This weekend was just a handful of unavoidable bad things that we’re going to work harder to communicate about and avoid in the future.


I should have put all this information in the first post but it would have been so long! I thought I got it across but I realize now I failed. I would like to know if your position remains the same in light of all the new information because maybe I am just wearing rose-colored glasses and need to re-evaluate the relationship but as I stand now I’m not sure it needs such drastic measures. Just time, communication, and mutual support.


**tl;dr:** Every time I try to tl;dr something I leave important stuff out so here goes: his dad is very sick which is why we spend so much time with his family, I support that. We weren't on the same page that grocery shopping does not count as quality time together so he's going to work on making sure we have relationship-building time. The friend was rude but he has no family so I can understand why boyfriend tried to include him but they had a talk and maybe the friend will be more respectful in the future. This really was a one time thing and we're going to work it out but I'll have my eyes open going forward.

We had a son together in July 2011, and I am currently 9 months pregnant and about to pop any day.


Anyways, we got into a fight. I decided since I was helping him out with his job, that I would go into his email and delete the resume I sent to him, which I had made. I just had some instinct and I decided to snoop. Now he has always been the type of guy to talk down about FB, Instagram, Twitter, etc.. but I saw in his spam folder that he had something on Twitter. I pulled up his page and low and behold.. nothing but flirtatious comments to other girls. Stupid guys always have the same password for everything, so I decided to go on his twitter and look up his messages.. to find that he has been privately messaging a girl since December 2011. He asked her if she would still fuck him.. and she would deny him etc. I also saw in the end of the lind that he had given her his number. Well.. I decided to confront him on that and now he is flipping the script on me.


I decided what best to do but to contact her and find out what really happened... she told me that they had met up a few times and he actually slept over her house in Jan 2012 and he gave her a smooch. Whatever that is. He told her he was homeless and living out of his car... but the backstory to that is:


Ever since I had our son, I felt like I took full responsibility for our son. I took care of him, gave him baths, fed him, etc. While he played video games, go to the gym, and practiced breakdancing... so he claims. I trusted him with all my heart. We were living together in PHX and ended up moving to San Jose where all our parents were and thats when everything went down south. SJ being both our home towns, I felt like he got caught up in the whole being back to his roots and wanting to hang out with his friends.. he started to lack responsibility even more for his son and I. I eventually couldn't take it anymore and told him he was taking us for granted and we didn't want to wait around for him, so I decided to kick him out because I felt like if he wanted to be with his friends so be it... and that's when everything started.


Now after confronting him nearly a year and half later about the situation.. he is telling me that this is all my fault because I didn't have to kick him out. Maybe I resulted into something really drastic but at the time I didn't know how he would understand and thought maybe he would console in his boys to figure out what to do. I take full responsibility for that. Never in my mind would I have thought he was being promiscuous because I had that much faith in him.

Hey Guys. This is the second update.

I met with her yesterday to pick some things up, and we talked for good 1,5 hours. About everything that had happened in the time we didn't see us, the weekend and so on. Pretty nice talk actually.

Then, I asked how she feels about this breakup, and we talked openly about this thing. She told me she feels very awkward without me, because 5 years are not so easy to walk off. But, she said, ""In the moment i think it was not the wrong thing for breaking up"". And, I must say, I could relate. If everything falls apart and you need to learn to live on your own... i guess i would not have broken up, but i would have wanted distance. 
Either way, i asked about how we should keep in touch, after all my stuff is gone, and we both said that we don't want to lose each other, so we keep contact regulary and meet up sometimes. But, with distance. 
I guess i can live with that for the moment, even though i badly miss her.
I don't know if she managed to grief about her loss, but i did not want to talk about it yesterday... 

TL;DR:

So, all in all, we again had a great talk, much laughter and keep in touch because we both want it. i can't say if something new emerges out of it. But I'm confident.

I keep you updated.

My boyfriend is a redditor, so I'm using a throwaway for this one. We [25f, 28m] have been dating about a month. Things have been moving somewhat fast, but we're both on the same page so it hasn't been a problem. In just about every aspect of the relationship, things are awesome.

Now on to last night. I have been trying to give BF oral sex because it's something that I *really* enjoy doing for someone I am dating. Every time I try, he stops me fairly quickly. It is surprising because I have always received glowing reviews from previous partners in that department, but it was seeming like he hasn't been into it that much. 

BF and I were laying in bed last night, so I asked, ""It seems like you don't enjoy the way that I give blowjobs. What can I change to make it so you are enjoying it? It's important to me. I imagine it's important to you.""

BF says ""It's just that my ex girlfriend was REALLY GOOD at blowjobs because I like face-fucking and she didn't have a gag reflex and you do.""

As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he knew that it was harsh. I was really hurt because here I am offering to work on this problem and he was shutting me down like I'd never be as good at it as his ex. Well, yeah...maybe I won't ever be as good, but why shut me down before we even try? Anyway, we talked it through and I felt better initially, but the thought keeps creeping back in.

Now I keep thinking, how often does he compare me to her? Do I measure up? Was this just word vomit and bad timing for a one time thing or is this a pattern? I realize that exes of his will be better than me at some things and I'll be better at others, but having it thrown in my face and being shut down was really hurtful.

What do you guys think? Am I over-thinking this?

It really is just a lot of stupid, little things, but it's constant....and there have been a couple big things too.  Probably the worst was when the 16 year old stole $300 from us and no one would do anything about it.  Her mother threatened to tell her probation officer unless she gave it back, but nothing ever happened.

As far as the little stuff it really is kinda minor.  I've been converting stuff to dvds for them.  They had just send me the stuff yesterday and I've told them a bunch that it takes a little time.  I worked the night shift last night and hadn't even started it when they started calling this morning.  When they call and no one answers, they hang up and call right back, over and fucking again.  I just tried to wait it out and go back to sleep.  The 5th or 6th call, the 11 year old screams at the top of her lungs over our answering machine.  Two more calls after that.  I don't know exactly how long they gave me, but I just got back to sleep and they started up again.  When I gave up and answered, of course it was just about the fucking movies.

My gf and I keep fighting about it.  She admits that it's not fair that she lets them keep disrespecting boundries and it's always something that we just need to be patient keep working on it, but it never changes.

This doesn't really become the issue, as the real problem is with all of my friends (m and f ages 21-30) that are jumping into marriage, and then getting incredibly judgmental about my decision not to do so.  

After playing the bridesmaid umpteen times, people have started to go through the ridiculous pressure of ""so, when are you going to make the leap?"" They often ask if my boyfriend has made any strides in saving up for long-term expenses, or gasp, even a ring.  They don't care for the answer that I give. This has grown very old, and despite changing my occupation to being a full time graduate student (and having OTHER things on my mind,) it doesn't stop their jabs, or flashing around their engagements, their children, and their stable jobs that provide decent wages.  They've begun to pull away from me, preferring company in ""other adults"" or ""other families,"" noting that my ""singlehood"" WHICH ISN'T EVEN THAT, but they consider relationships to be dichotomous, an anomaly.

My mother has given me a five-year time limit on grandchildren, and has been very vociferous about the fact that she doesn't want my current partner to sire them.  In the meantime, she continues to provoke arguments, that the ex-boyfriend (of five years) which my family was very close with, was the love of my life, and that I will never have something as great as he was.  This, mostly, was because he desired marriage and offspring.

Now, my current partner has very little interest in reproducing, or making formal any legality that puts us beyond co-habitation.  This creates much dismay amongst the peanut gallery, to which I'd like to tell them to kindly fuck off, but they've been my support group for years, and I've few places left to turn.

I'd ultimately like to get married, yes.  Maybe pop out a kid or two, or even foster a good few.  BUT!  I feel like I'm working on borrowed time, and that my decisions to delay ""mature adulthood"" are consistently being looked down upon by my friends and family, and that they believe that my relationship is going nowhere because this isn't the end goal.  They've even got me believing this tripe.

I get it, I'm still young, and should not have to feel this way, as there are fantastic people that don't marry until their middle years, or don't marry at all.  However, with the immense peer pressure that I'm encountering, I don't know how to cope.

It seems like no matter what I accomplish as a human, I will not be considered an adult until I marry or procreate.  This is fundamentally flawed.

TLDR: My parents and friends want me to tie the knot, (as do I, someday,) but no one seems to want to hang out with me until I do, or chide that my current partner isn't up to snuff.

So I couldn't wait until the next day to talk to my girlfriend about this. So I texted her, ""How would you feel if I wanted to stop saying ""I Love You"" every night when we end the conversation for the day?

If something is bothering you or if there is a problem with the relationship then the best thing to do is talk about it with your girlfriend or boyfriend. This will keep a little problem from forming into a bigger problem. Also every guy and girl are different so what might upset one person may not upset another.

I've been at work all day and it will probably take me too long to respond to each post now, so I'll just thank you guys here. The things you have said have made me feel that much better about telling him no.
Unfortunately he's been sending me on a ruthless guilt trip all day. I guess now we aren't speaking, I'm not sure when he'll want to talk to me again. He has also been texting my father all day, and we are both pretty worn out from the things he's been saying.
I just hope that most of you are right and he will get over it soon.** 

I'll try to keep this short, but I'll include a TL;DR at the end in case I am unable to do so. I will also bold key points.

My brother and I have had a pretty good relationship our whole lives, and this is the first time we've ever really fought about a serious adult issue.

My brother wants to buy a new car.

Yesterday my brother had a big falling out with my father because he asked if my father would cosign, and he refused. This morning my brother approached me about it, knowing I have really good credit.

At first I said I'd see if I could get approved. I have never cosigned for anything, and thought it was just simple and would require no money or effort from me. Now I fully understand the cosigning process, and what it means, and I'm really not sure I want to be held responsible for making the payments if he cannot.

He wants me to cosign on a **$20,000** vehicle. 

I bring home about $500-600 a month. **I only make $9/hr**, and **I only work part time** because I am in school (and paying for it).

I do not own a home. **I live with our father** so I can put more of my money towards my schooling.

**It's not that I don't trust my brother** about making car payments. **It's that he is currently working as a temp**, and does not have a permanent full time job. Also, he frequently complains about how much hates his job and the company. Now that he wants to buy a car, he swears that they are about to make him full time, it will just take six months to do so and he needs a car now because his current one is falling apart.

**I feel like I shouldn't cosign until the company decides to actually take him on as an employee**.

**My father and I had another idea.**

I drive my father's **2005 Chevy Trailblazer** right now. He was about to **sell it** (I will drive another of my dad's cars to/from work). We decided that **instead of selling the 05 Trailblazer**, he could **give it to my brother** and let him make small payments of like $100/month to my dad. That way **he would have a nice,reliable car** that's not falling apart.

His response to that idea?

**"" No. I don't want an SUV. Sorry.""**

The car he wants is a **brand new 2012 Toyota** with all the bells and whistles, built in GPS, digital radio, etc.

Now, he's not wanting to have anything to do with me. Making public statements on **facebook** about how sad it is his family can't trust him, etc. Won't talk to me without sending me on a guilt trip, and basically **making me feel like a really bad person** for not wanting to cosign on his car. It's getting to the point where it's actually **stressing** me out, and **he holds grudges**. Big time. I'm afraid this won't go away for quite a while.

My question is, **should I have cosigned?** I just don't think I'm in any kind of a position to be financial backup for someone else, especially when that person makes twice as much money as I do. I'm proud of my good credit and don't want to take the chance of messing it up or going in debt, which is possible because like I said, he is only a temp.

**Was I in the wrong, and is there anything I can do to make this right? I've tried explaining my reasons for not signing to him but he won't listen. He's taking it as a personal attack.**

I thought about telling him to just go ahead and see if I can get approved as his cosigner, but I'm afraid that I will ACTUALLY get approved and then end up having to do it.

**TL;DR My brother wants to buy a car and needed a cosigner. My father refused. I refused, and he's making me feel really bad about it. I only make $9/hr at my part time job and don't think it would be smart to put my name on a $20,000 note in case something happens to where my brother can't make his payments.

Thanks everyone that gave me advice yesterday-all of you were insightful and no one made me feel like a cold-hearted jerk for finding the situation to be troubling.  


So I didn't ask the bf about his ex all day yesterday-I felt I was not in the right place to talk about it, being overtired and still in my initial reactions.  I went and had a great workout, a healthy dinner, a loooong shower and went to bed super early.
  


This morning, I asked if he had heard anything from her and we got to discussing.  I found out a bit more information about the phone call-When he answered, she said 'Johnny has made me really hurt and upset again'  Johnny seems to be the guy that she followed down to New Orleans.  She was upset and because of her previous e-mail about cutting, he wanted to talk her down a bit, because he's one HELL of a wonderful guy.  About 5 minutes in, he heard a female voice in the background.  He asked who it was, and Cait replied it was a friend from work.  When bf realized she had someone with her, he told her he needed to go.



So, she had mentioned cutting and speaking to a councilor about it in an e-mail the day before the phone call.  He also mentioned that she is usually on an anti-anxiety medication that she had recently stopped taking due to the cost.  I asked my bf if she had been a cutter previously in her life-if he had seen scars on her arms when they were dating.  I feel like bad coping mechanisms like cutting usually manifest in high school aged girls, and that later in life there is a chance of falling back into it.  He said no-but that he had thought her comment sounded much more like a suicide attempt-not small cutting.  Whoa.  That's some info I didn't know.  He admits he's not sure one way or another what kind of cutting she was referring to, but assumed the worst.



Now, when my bf told me that there had been another person there, I felt like this 4am phone call just went from being a reasonable isolated incident to entering into inappropriate territory.  I told my boyfriend that, in about the same words.  He wholeheartedly agreed.  He said while he considers her a friend, he didn't think they were that close and was pretty confused why she would call him.  Although, he did say she was known as a prolific drunk dialer back when they were dating.  



He said that Cait had called to apologize during the day.  On the phone call, he told her that the phone call was inappropriate.  I'm not sure what else was said in the phone call other than 'Are you seeing the councilor that you mentioned-you need to make an appointment ASAP'.  


He said he was sorry either of us had to be woken up for it and that her ringtone is now silent.  She mentioned she had an appointment with a councilor today to talk.  I told the boyfriend that I wish there was a way we could ensure that she was truly getting help.  Then he questioned, for the second time, if this was a cry for help and if he should contact her parents.  I told him I just didn't know what was right-without knowing her relationship with her parents, or even much about her in general....I just didn't know what the right thing to do was and I was sorry.



We (really he) decided that he would write her an e-mail asking about the councilor and what the facility was that she was going to so that we could check it out/make sure she's being seen.  He said he wanted to make it clear to her that she had to give him this information-kind of like 'if you're gonna be calling me at 4am, i deserve to know exactly who you are seeing for treatment'.  He also wanted to express to her that calling in the middle of the night during the week is just not conducive to our lifestyle.  He wanted to make it clear that I would be moving in with him in the upcoming months and therefore calls like this would be effecting me as well (I'm honestly not sure how often they e-mail or how much they share in those e-mails).   He also wants to communicate that he would be happy to talk to her during normal hours-and would really prefer if she was sober when she called him.  



My boyfriend tells me sometimes I have great 'emotional wisdom'.  That I seem to be good at stepping back from a situation and evaluating it from all angles to consider all parties, whether its when we are fighting about something or giving advice to friends, etc.  I always respond saying 'I got all those skills from 2 years of therapy!'  But man, he doesn't give himself enough credit.  He's such a caring thoughtful guy without being gullible (honey, do you think she is just crazy and looking for attention?  or is this a real cry for help?).I am happy that he has a plan to make sure she's being cared for, as well as a plan to make the boundaries of their relationship, as he sees it, clear.  I'm also happy that we see eye to eye on where those boundaries are.  


I am happy he is so open with the information, as well as the fact that he truly values my advice (even if I don't know her well).  I am so very lucky to have him as my partner in crime.  


**TL;DR**After being woken up by my (27f) bf's (31m) ex at 4am, bf told his ex it was inappropriate to call at that hour, and plans on ensuring she is getting help as well as reinforcing that he's there for her (just not at 4am).

I genuinely enjoy being with him, he is a good man, goes the extra mile at home and does a lot for the community, works hard etc. The one recurring problem is his kink level vs. Mine. Because I don't always respond well to his kinks. (Not that I shut him down, generally I'm willing to try stuff but he can tell when it doesn't turn me on in the same way). So he goes to the internet for porn/chat from time to time. In general I'm OK with this as long as its anon and doesn't involve real information/names/potential to get out of hand. Well I found some IRC chat logs the other day that really bothered me to the point where I've told him its a deal breaker. For one there is a theme of incest with his sister when he was a teenager. The bigger issue is there is a theme of attraction to one of his stepdaughters. That he basically wants to seduce one of them when she is older. I get that this is fantasy but it comes from somewhere, right? He says he is into pushing limits and the forbidden. And he pushed too far. I can't fathom that he got off while talking about molesting one of my daughters. Even if it didn't happen for real I just am so creeped out by the thought process. My daughters are YOUNG. Am I right in ending this or is it normal to deal with a kink by chatting it out rather than acting it out? He says he has issues because he was molested at a going age and that has shaped some of his fetishes. This doesn't exactly comfort me. 

TL;DR 
Boyfriend of 2 years fantisizes about being with my daughter but hasn't acted on it and doesn't plan to. Is this a deal breaker? Or should I give him a shot to try counselling. 

Update: I want to reassure everyone that I did leave, right away and my children are all in a safe place. It is over, absolutely. It's a heck of a mess to clean up because we own property, cars, etc together and there are things we do need to work out. I'm sorry if it came across as pathetic to ask. I know I could never have looked at him the same way again and it's very easy when I have to look at him to know what I need to do.

 It's harder when I think about a few days ago how in love I was and how I thought the rest of my life was going to play out. Planning a wedding. Home renovations. Life. Ya know. I am mourning what I have lost. I know it's selfish, and I know I should just be angry and this should likely be easy but there it is. 

I want to thank everyone for taking the time to help a random stranger from the internet. Know that there will likely be days in the future when I feel really sad and I look up this post for reassurance that I am not to blame for where I ended up in life. I wish I could beleive that the future is bright for me, but that's too hard right now. I do know I can control the future for my children to a greater extent and that will be my focus. It's incredbily hard to imagine ever bringing another person into my children's life after this.

A lot of people had some really harsh things to say. I can't say I really agree with everything but it was a nice, wake up call. It hit me how close I was too pushing my wife too far. 

After about an hour of comments I decided to go and talk to her. I really apologized for her and admitted that I was being stupid with the shit with my ex. I deleted my ex off everything in front of her and I promised her I would never, ever do anything like that again. I apologized again for complaining about getting caught and I told her I wanted to start being more honest. We both gave one another all of our passwords and I said I wasn't angry anymore over the keylogger. 

I did ask her if she wanted a divorce and she told me no, that she wasn't even thinking about one and she asked me if I want one. I told her no too. We are both going to try harder in our marriage and try to talk to one another. She told me she was hurt that I went to someone else when I was lonely and horny.

This morning we hooked up and he opened bedside table drawer to get the lube. 

As long as I've known him the drawer had a cooler bag with a few condoms in it.  The number of condoms have not changed over the past 2 years.

This morning there were about 20+ (a box worth?) of new condoms in the cooler bag.

I politely asked him about this 10 minutes later, why he had all these new condoms in his drawer.

He responded:  He recently bought them to check and see if his Best Buy Credit Card would work in other stores.

I then asked him if he was planning on using the condoms.

He said no of course not.

I told him it was weird and he said he was just trying to buy something cheap to see if the card worked.

I see a lot of things wrong in this response.  But I left quietly trying to decide if I should believe him or not.

Am I over-thinking this or does his response not make any sense?   Also I don't think you can use a best buy card outside the store.

He is usually so trustworthy this is out of the ordinary for me to question something he says. I want to bring it up to him again and tell him I want to believe him but his response just does not make any sense.

Thank you everyone for your advice and input, even if I didn't agree with your advice or you don't agree with my actions. Since I updated when I had only just made my decision to try to believe, forgive, and forget, maybe I'll post another update a few weeks from now...? Either way, thanks. It definitely helps to have perspective.

You can read the [original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bxdbf/my_f26_boyfriend_m25_of_7_years_took_pictures_of/).

I feel like the comments were split into the ""dealbreaker"" ""not a big deal"" and ""big deal, but get over it"" crowds. Thanks for all your help, support, and advice about a situation I can't talk to my friends or family about due to embarrassment on my part and for him. It's still a little soon for me to form coherent thoughts, so please excuse my word wall as I update. Scroll down for the TL;DR.

So he came home from work and we talked about it. It was really difficult. I cried, he cried. He apologized, profusely. He said it's the only time this has ever happened, it was a complete lapse in judgement, he was disgusted with himself and his actions and thought he had deleted everything. He said as soon as he saw them in his email he felt sick and immediately deleted them. He seemed pretty horrified by his actions because of the whole invasion of privacy and general scumbagginess of what he did.

He admitted he was being purposefully deceitful and wanted them for later, but did not say he was going to masturbate to them or whatever. He tried to explain it as a sort of crime of opportunity thing--I didn't get that part. He has always claimed not to be a big masturbator or porn guy. Which is also why this, in my opinion, is so out of character and sickening. It's hard to believe some of this part.

Though I can't be sure he's telling me the truth or all of the truth, in the end I basically believe him. I've known him for a long time and I don't think I'm a terrible judge of character. He seems genuinely and deeply upset by what he did and how he made me feel. I think he made an awful decision in the moment, and realizes how terrible his actions were and how much they hurt everyone involved. It's hard to believe him, because obviously he violated the trust in our relationship and was deceitful. But even though it's hard, I really think I believe him.

Ultimately, I don't think I can throw away our relationship over this. It's going to take time for me to really move past it fully, but that's my goal. I want to actually forgive him and try to forget this ever happened. I wish I had never seen these photos because I don't think he does things like this regularly or ever, and I would have been blissfully unaware that he finds my friend's ass attractive. It would have been better if it was a stranger, I'm not gonna lie. It hurts more because it's my friend and I was there too. I just wish he didn't do such a creepy fucking thing.

It's not about finding other women attractive or looking at other women. It's also not about me putting my own insecurities about not being as attractive as someone else or not having the perfect body into our relationship or this situation. I know he loves me and my body and is attracted to me, but that other people are nice looking too. It doesn't mean he wants to be with those other people. Can I honestly say I don't find other people attractive? No. But I don't take sneaky scumbag pictures of them on my phone either... I mean, nothing will change the fact that he did a disgusting thing, I just believe it was a one-time mistake. I sort of have to if I want to move forward.

I don't really think this is the end of this issue/fight/problem in our relationship. I think good people do bad things, but it doesn't make them a bad person. I also think good partners sometimes make mistakes and do things that hurt us, but it doesn't make them a bad partner. And I love him, more than anything in the world, and I believe that he loves me the same way. So to me it's worth it to try to work past this.

**TL;DR I forgive him, even if it's still too soon to forget. He knows he did a creepy, horrible thing. Ultimately, I won't throw away an otherwise amazing relationship with the love of my life because he made a mistake, no matter how scummy and awful that mistake was.

1365431511.0,144,self.relationships,1bx33b,My fiance (23m) and I (23f) are fighting constantly about cleaning,seer_of_things,189,45,209,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bx33b/my_fiance_23m_and_i_23f_are_fighting_constantly/,"We have been together for five years now and engaged for two. We started dating straight after high school and have lived together from week 1. 

We get along great most of the time, however cleaning has always been a big source of arguments for us and now it's just getting ridiculous. 
I am nowhere near a neat freak, but I don't want to live like a slob. I don't demand constant cleaning, or even every day- just once a week! Because we both work and I go to school, we usually try to clean one day a week and spend 1-3 hours doing it depending on how dirty the house is. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats and friends come over and we don't clean during the week so it's usually decently dirty by then and it definitely needs to be done. We don't go crazy over the top, we just clean what we have to. (We have tried more frequent cleaning with less time spent, but it doesn't happen because we're so busy.) 
So, about once a week we try to spend what usually ends up being an average two hours cleaning together. This usually ends up in an argument because he half-ass cleans something or goes painfully slow and gets half as much work done as he could or he gets 'distracted' and starts playing with whatever he finds while he's supposed to be cleaning. 
I feel like his mom because I constantly have to remind him to do his share and I even have to make sure he actually cleaned what was his pre-agreed to part of the cleaning that day. As in, (we have had the conversation a million times about what cleaning the bathroom should include), and he will tell me it's done when he has only wiped the seat of the toilet and taken out the trash, completely disregarding the sink, toilet bowl, and under the seat which gets pretty dirty in a week. All I ask is he wipes it with a lysol wipe. It really drives me crazy that he can't put the effort in to do something so simple. There are countless other examples that I can't be bothered to type. 

It's not the cleaning that bothers me, it's the fact that he is so lazy about it. We constantly have very open and direct conversations about how this makes me feel like he doesn't care and like he expects me to be his mother/maid and clean it for him. I have made it clear that if this doesn't change, our relationship could end over it. I can't live with it forever. He constantly promises he will do things/improve buy only does it half-way. I have moved 10 hours away from my home and uprooted my entire life for him. If he can't do something so simple as putting some effort into helping to clean his own house, it makes me wonder what can I expect from the future?

Am I crazy that this bothers me so much? Or does he really just need to learn to grow up and clean a damn toilet, among other things, without me holding his hand, and do it right! As much as I hate to admit, it really makes me lose respect for him. 
It's been a big issue for about three years. I continuously lower my expectations for cleaning in an effort to compromise, but I feel like if I lower them any further we will be living in a disgusting house. If it was up to him, he would never clean. 

How can I get him to truly work on this instead of just saying he will? How could we better handle cleaning?
We have tried short frequent bursts of cleaning, longer once a week bursts, divided chores, working together, working at the same time but on separate things, cleaning while the other is out of the house, lists... Everything I can think of. 

TL;DR: Everything else in our relationship is perfect, but this attitude of half assing things, mostly cleaning, is causing now-constant fighting and is threatening to break us up. How can we make this better? 




edit/update: Thanks so much for all of the advice, guys! There have been some really helpful and eye opening posts. I will let you know how this works out, but I have a good feeling that things will improve. Our last argument before I wrote this post seems to have changed his attitude a bit, and he actually came home last night with the idea of having three tasks (can be anything, big or small) that we decide to complete throughout the day! So we will definitely try that, see about getting a maid, and I will definitely lay off a little and pick my battles more wisely. He has also agreed to doing the mowing, cooking a few times a week, and keeping the entire kitchen clean and I will do everything else.

I figured as some people wanted to be updated. She told me she loved me and wanted to work on our relationship a few days ago. She stopped being confused.

She is coming to visit me in 1 week, so that we can talk and work things out. 2 weeks ago when I wrote the original thread, she was my everything. I could not imagine a life without her. But now I can.

I still care about her very much. But it feels like I love her less for everyday that passes. I am tired of being hurt. I don't know how to react once she comes. 

I guess I will update one last time to you guys once I see her.

TLDR: Fiance [26F] Has a crush on another guy. Me [26M] hanging on a thread.


EDIT: She never dumped me. We have been contact daily on skype since she went away. She said she had a crush on a guy. Just to clarify.

1353273630.0,150,self.relationships,13exix,[[UPDATE]] -- I (F/26) just found out my SO (M/28) cheated. He doesn't know that I know. How do I proceed?,brokenheartedgf,187,37,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13exix/update_i_f26_just_found_out_my_so_m28_cheated_he/,"Original Post - http://redd.it/12g9jm

First I want to thank everyone for their contributions to the original thread. You all helped me immensely in my time of need - thank you.

The days following this post I kept trying to get my SO (M/28) to go on video chat so I could confront him about the cheating. He kept refusing - saying he didn't feel like it, didn't look good, was busy, etc. So we'd make small talk on chat or through text and then I'd make myself unavailable. He seemed to be fine with not talking to me which was so frusturating. 

The first week on my own was very tough. I desperately wanted someone to talk to about this, but the situation felt too humiliating to bring up with friends or family. I'd be at work, or in our apartment, and I'd think of him and just break down crying. My emotions were getting the better of me, I was swinging from one end of the spectrum to the other - from wanting to tell him it's okay, he's forgiven, we all make mistakes, to cleaning all my stuff out of the apartment and cutting him out of my life, or even doing something crazy like sleeping with another guy to make my SO feel the pain I'm feeling. Thankfully these were just fleeting, irrational thoughts.

After a week or so I decided enough was enough - I texted my SO and told him we needed to talk on Skype NOW. He reluctantly accepted and logged on. Even with the grainy resolution of his webcam you could just see guilt / grief written all over his face.

I wanted to give him a chance to confess on his own. I asked him what was wrong a few times, saying he looked troubled, let's talk it out, etc. It didn't take long for him to crack - through quivering lips he said ""You're going to fucking hate me..."" and then told me the whole story, nearly verbatim to what he told his friend. He added that he'd been avoiding talking to me these last few days because he's ""a chickenshit"".

I just let him keep talking and apologizing. He told me he's been miserable since he left, hates his job and he's ""halfway to a serious drinking problem"". He said all he's wanted to do since he got there is come back home. 

I was fighting back tears throughout most of it but I think I did well to keep my composure. I told him how disappointed I was, how betrayed I felt. He kept asking ""are you done with me?"" and ""do you want to see other people?"" and I honestly couldn't give him an answer. I told him that I'd take the next 3 weeks to think things through, he needed to STOP with the alcohol, and we'd talk when he gets back.

He's sent me a lot of texts in the days following our Skype video chat... more apologizing, ""I love you and don't want to lose you"" type stuff. Frankly I'm kind of numb to it all - it's just words on a cellphone screen to me. I have been intentionally short with my responses, mostly variations of ""we'll talk about it when you're back"", and he seems to have gotten the hint. 

I'm still very unsure about what I'm going to do. Right now I am leaning toward leaving him.  He was sincerely apologetic, and I know in my heart he'd never do it again, but even knowing that doesn't stop the pain and betrayal I'm feeling. Our relationship always felt like a match made in heaven, and now it feels tainted, like the whole dynamic of our relationship will be different if we stay together. 

This could all change when we finally talk in person though - he's due back on November 30th, I'll try to provide an update shortly after we talk and I've made my decision.

**TL;DR - After a week of avoiding me, I finally got my SO on Skype video chat, where he admitted his infidelity. We agreed on 3 weeks of limited contact until he returns from his trip.

Please help me save my marriage.,atlastontheground,187,41,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11yqvi/my_wife_recently_revealed_to_me_she_is_no_longer/,"Both in our mid twenties and have a young daughter together. Married 2 years together for 5.

A few weeks ago my wife confessed that she loves me but is no longer 'in love with me.'  This confession was coupled with the revelation that she had cheated on me a few months before we got married. She's been very absent lately, never wants to be home, and is self-admittedly lying even about mundane things. She took up smoking a few months back and hid it from me until recently; she's on about 3 packs a week. About the same time as she started smoking she had a mental breakdown and left work to go to intensive therapy for a month.

My wife clearly has deep personal demons that she's working through, and has come to the conclusion that ending her marriage and being alone is more worthwhile than fixing it. She isn't convinced that we can ever be happy again.

We had our first day of counseling, we're talking, she even tells me she loves me, but when it comes down to asking her ""do you want to work on our marriage?"" she says she doesn't know.

My wife has made some serious mistakes in our relationships; repeated acts of infidelity (excluding actual sex) as well as lying. However, I married her for life. I didn't think it was going to be easy, if anything I was nervous I might slip some day. Instead it was her and it is absolutely devastating. I'm still here though. I want the opportunity to work things out with my wife and let all these grievous wounds to our marriage heal and learn to resolve the strong level of mistrust I have of her, but I can't seem to get her on board.

This is also my fault as well. I've been a stay at home parent for 2 years and have not held a steady job for the duration of our marriage. I was in and out of college due to finances and was not prepared at all when we found out she was pregnant. We were in love and agreed to stay together and have our daughter. However, it became clear my wife wasn't happy with me watching our daughter full-time so she could continue her career (~45k/year). This grew into resentment. And while I was once and outgoing charismatic guy that people loved to be around, I grew reclusive and complacent in my marriage. I was content with the friends we had and hanging out. In short, I'm a fool.

However, I start a job this week (~50k/year). My life is starting to come together just as my wife has started to come apart. I realize my faults in this marriage and I want to be the person my wife fell in love with, but I can't even get her to commit to the most basic mental contributions to saving our marriage--wanting to save our marriage.

How can I make my wife fall in love with me again? 

Hitting lawyers, deleting gyms, and getting facebook need not apply.

**tl;dr: How do I convince my wife that our marriage is worth saving, that I am here to work through all of our/her problems, and that I can be the person she fell in love with years ago? What are some romantic/personal gestures I can make to show that I'm still a worthwhile and interesting person that loves her and that I am not complacent any longer in our marriage?**",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1351093934.0,,,True,t3_11yqvi,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11yqvi/my_wife_recently_revealed_to_me_she_is_no_longer/,

(He also spent time in Pattaya.)  He called me drunk out of his mind.  He lied to me for months.  I knew what he'd done; so I researched the area, the prices of everything from food &amp; drinks to massages, strippers &amp; sex.  I hit him with the facts that I'd uncovered a month before he was to come home.  He finally admitted that he'd ""only"" gotten 1 massage with a blow job at the end...

I know that he's lying.  I know he did more than he'll admit.  However, for various reasons I have tried to forgive - but I'm having serious difficulties forgiving/forgetting.  

I asked him to go to counseling with me - &amp; he did, for a little while.  Then we had to move with his ship to another state &amp; despite my urging we have yet to see another therapist.

We no longer go on ""dates"" just he &amp; I.  However he will go out to the movies on his own once a week.  I must admit that i wonder if he's really taking in the movie alone or if he's meeting up with someone.  (This not only stems from the trust broken in Thailand.  Upon his homecoming I uncovered more lies that date back prior to that incident.)  I rarely leave the apartment as we only have the one car.  (I had to leave my car behind as we couldn't afford to bring it with us.)  I love my toddler &amp; I'm so grateful that I haven't missed one milestone(!) - but I feel horribly isolated.

My husband &amp; I fight (verbally).  Once upon a time I was able to stand my ground &amp; keep my head but now I've noticed that whenever an argument comes up I just collapse into tears.  I hate the way I feel inside...  but more than this, I hate that these arguments frequently take place in front of our toddler.    

Before we married I had 2 jobs, a close circle of friends, a decent amount of self-confidence, lots of hobbies &amp; a nice figure.  Now I'm a stay at home mother, with only 2 friends from home that remain in contact with me, virtually no self-esteem, no creative outlet &amp; I'm still getting used to my post-pregnancy body... these are stressors that are just adding to the problem.

My questions are: have any Redditors been able to regain the trust that was broken in their relationship?  How did you turn your relationship around?  And finally, for those who couldn't fix the problems in your marriage/relationship, what made you finally realize it was time to let go? 

Sorry for the babbling rant.  

TL;DR: My husband cheated on me with prostitutes/lied to me &amp; our relationship is suffering.  I want to fix it, but I'm not sure how.

I was his first sexual partner, but he was not mine.

I told my boyfriend that I can't really come from intercourse, but that I love having it with him. I have told him things that he can do to increase the chances that I will orgasm (talking to me, waiting as long as possible before penetration, spanking, roughness, etc.) and he doesn't really do any of these things. I have told him that I will have a much better chance of orgasm via mouth and fingers, and he won't do this either.

Before we actually became sexually active, he used to tell me how much he wanted to eat me out. But since we began actually having sex together, he's told me that he's ""not really attracted"" to genitals, and thinks that penises and vaginas are weird. After we finish intercourse, he looks at the wetness on his dick and goes ""uggh."" One time I asked him to use his hand on me, and he looked so miserable and uncomfortable that I asked him to stop. Usually after sex (only 1-2 minutes long, but I'm thinking that may get better as time goes on) he rolls over and falls asleep. If he sees that I'm still (clearly) unsatisfied, he'll say, ""It's okay if you want to finish,"" as in, go ahead and masturbate.

We have had a lot of sexual issues since the beginning (almost a year ago)- he has had issues with anxiety leading to an inability to keep an erection, and problems with expectations vs. reality. He thought my vagina was ""too loose"" because he wasn't feeling as much as he thought he was going to. I told him that, according to my OB/GYN, I actually have a pretty small vagina, and that perhaps it's because he's used to the vice grip of his hand for all these years. It seems like every time we resolve an issue, something else comes up.

I don't mind if a guy has difficulty getting me to orgasm, it's just that he seems unwilling to step out of his comfort zone to do so. Am I being unreasonable?

No, he's not gay, I promise, nor is he not attracted to me. I also have very good hygiene, and have even begun shaving my pussy (I used to just trim it short) per his request. I think he's just very sexually inexperienced and sexually immature-- the squishy-wet-work-hard reality of sex is a lot different than what porn and fantasy had lead him to believe. Is this something he can overcome? How can I help him?

TL;DR: My boyfriend won't give me oral sex or use his hands because he's grossed out by vaginas. What can I do, if anything?

edit: I realize I should have clarified... he has said he's ""willing"" to go down on me, but that he's not into it. That, to me, does not sound like an option.

I just wanted to drop in a quick update about the situation in this thread.

I was in the office early today and decided to figure out exactly what the organizational situation is between her and me. It turns out I'm at the seniority level of her manager, so I went straight to her today (after all her boss is pretty much my colleague).

I discussed the situation with her and told her exactly what had transpired. Based on drama that had happened with her sooner we both agreed I would stop working out with her alone, but would continue to work out with her with other colleagues, or my wife, present. 

After the talk I informed my boss and HR of the situation and all agreed that the aforementioned action would be the right one, and that I would talk to her.

After discussing with higher management, HR, and her boss I went to have a  chat with her in private. I asked her out for lunch outside the company in order to contain any drama outside the office. A female employee of mine offered to lunch in the same restaurant in order to be a witness in case something went to shit.

We drove to the restaurant in our own car (I had a meeting outside the office before lunch) and I basically told her the situation. Upon realizing what I was saying she started crying and sobbing, and pretty much confessing that she loved me and that she didn't want to be without me and that she was miserable without me.

I clearly told her that A: I'm married (she knew this already). B: I was definitely not interested in infidelity. C: She was absolutely not my type (perhaps irrelevant, but I still felt like shutting down all her options).

She was still making a scene and I decided the best thing was to signal the waiter to put the lunch on the company account and just leave and head back to work. I talked to her manager and she will get a few days paid leave on my expense account, I didn't think it would be a smart thing to have her in the office with this drama.

In the end I made myself clear, my boss, HR, and her boss are happy with this solution, my wife is still a bit red faced, but strangely flattered.

The backlash of this entire event will be interesting though, I doubt the last word on this has been spoken. 

Anyway, thanks.

ps: Last time the automod failed so I will just say : 

**tl;dr 26f 27m 2 months of drama waiting to happen, all is sort of good now.**

edit: Thank you all for your comments. I promise to update somewhere next week in case something develops that we can all take a lesson from. The previous thread has given me wonderful advice. I will be on this subreddit more and try to offer advice on marriage issues. My wife and I are very different, but rock solid and very rational souls. Hence no marriage drama in a situation that could have driven partners apart in a situation that I was in.

Thanks for everyone asking if I was ok. 

I told her we were done, once she realised what I was doing she told me I was the problem. But she admitted we were done. 

We decided what we were/weren't keeping. I maintained my civility, told her I wasn't going to yell but that we were over. 

She asked if I checked her phone and I admitted it. She was angry but I put it in perspective and she realised that was unreasonable. 

We are over but we are still living together as long as I am studying for exams. Once Uni is out of the way I will move out but we also need to worry about maintaining rent on our old place until we get someone else to take over our lease.

I was just wondering if it was normal to every now and again, though very rarely, feel slightly nostalgic for single life?

I love my SO with everything I have - he means the world to me - and I would in no way EVER want to trade being with him for the single life, but I guess after 18 years of single life I'm taking a little time to adjust. I don't miss anything like wanting going out drinking and hooking up with randoms or anything, it's just little stuff, such as having heaps of time to myself (I'm a huge introvert/homebody) or not having to consult/think of anybody else's feelings when changing things about myself (""Will I be less attractive to him if I...?"").

So yes. In no way do I want to be single again - I want to spend the rest of my life with this man - but just sometimes miss some aspects of how life was for me beforehand. Am I alone in this or does everybody get this once in a while?

I didn't think it'd be like this."" This was said right in front of our sons (1,3). 

Our oldest son has cerebral palsy and I feel/have felt that my husband feels cheated or wronged somehow by this. Nate is not intellectually challenged in anyway and is extremely bright (he can even read a little!), the doctors also think he will be able to walk with crutches or a cane when he is older. I feel so lucky, when I see other moms at therapy with children so much worse off. Yes, he will walk with a cane but he will walk and he will be able to go to college and get married and have children of his own.

But when Nate makes progress, Daniel seems to almost brush it off as insignificant, or not enough. He has this image of a son in his head that isn't fair. He is very stressed out by it. He favors our youngest son Owen but is stressed out by him to, he cries too much/he's too picky about food/he's too loud,etc.

But I keep telling myself this will all pass. That it's a phase, that small children aren't his forte. He loves them, that's a lot to build on. When he walked out last week. 

I understandably freaked out. I'm a SAHM with two kids. He took the only car and left. Other than a handful of text messages, that's all I heard from him. 

Then he came back. He was very apologetic, had flowers and toys. He was ""stressed"" but he ""missed us, even the problems"". I took him back. If only because I was so relieved..it's sad to say but I was scared. I didn't know how I was going to get by.. If I got a job (Can I get a job?) how would I take care of my kids? Who would watch Owen, he's so small for daycare. and If Nate doesn't get to his rigorous, frequent therapy, he may not reach his potential.

So I took him back. But all I can think is, I'll never trust him again. He just walked out, because life is hard. And I had no idea. He could do it again. Is life suddenly going to get easier? Will I respect myself if I stay with someone who leaves?

tl;dr My husband(23f,31m) of four years left me last week because it was 'too hard'. Hard being our two children, particularly our one with cerebral palsy- even though we are lucky and it's not a severe case.  I don't know if I trust him enough to take him back.. should I be understanding?

1356479058.0,148,self.relationships,15fw66,"My SO's family has pushed me to the breaking point.  I love my SO, but I am almost ready to leave.  Can I have some perspective? (M/F both 28)",xmasthrowawa,201,53,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15fw66/my_sos_family_has_pushed_me_to_the_breaking_point/,"I don't even want to write this, but I am at a loss and I am not sure what to do.  My SO and I are both 28 and we have been dating over 2.5 years.  Living together for one year.

My SO's family (according to him) has been disappointed/mad with him since he started college.  Every decision was the wrong one (his major, his gf, his choices, etc).  They still loved and supported him, but they went anywhere from picking at him about stuff (kind of innocently) to being extremely pissed at him for some decision he made.  No matter what, he was always the one who messed up (while his sister was considered perfect).  

Now, several years after college and grad school, he and I are both professionals and relatively successful.  We afford things we like, international travel, our dog, etc.  We do not do drugs, we rarely drink, we are pretty happy and funny people.  Honestly, from an objective view, I'd say we both turned out well.  But ever since we met, I have not been around them where they did not criticize him, me, or our decisions.  They have said some incredibly mean and hurtful things.  I think about some of the things they said and I cringe, because I don't know how someone could be so ugly and pretend that it is because they care about us.

On Saturday, he went out for a few hours and his parents stopped by.  I didn't even know they knew where we lived, because he talks to them sometimes and occasionally we visit, but we don't entertain them at our apartment.  We don't see them often, because they upset us so much with their words and they upset me and he hates it.  So anyway, they stop by and see that he isn't there and they sit me down and say things....to just hurt me, I guess.

They say:

-He hasn't been happy or well mannered since he started dating me.

-He should have proposed by now (implying that if he hasn't then he doesn't want to).

-His hobbies are stupid, childish, and a waste of time, and I'm stupid for putting up with them (he plays mtg, has played on the pro tour, and has a business related to it - it doesn't bother me, I'm proud of him); oh god...and they also said that playing too many ""fantasy"" games is what leads to school shootings (Did I mention my SO is a well adjusted, 28 year old professional and nice man?).

-When they disapproved of one of his last gfs (which they felt entitled to do) he just shut off from them and started acting the same way he is acting with me) implying that he does this when he ""has something to hide.""

-They told me he lies to me about everything and I shouldn't believe him. (wtf? this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable)

-They told me that it ""wasn't my fault"" that he didn't talk to them very much, but that it needs to change - again implying that he would be better off without me.  (I tried to tell them I have a pretty good relationship with my family and I talk to/email/call them often, but they didn't care - I'm still a bad influence, apparently)

-They said they won't be happy for us when we get engaged, but in the same conversation went on and on about his and my future *when* we get married and have kids (as if they were completely comfortable with it)

-They straight up lied about a situation where he interacted with his sister.  She does whatever they say and will make him look bad for fun, so they accused him for being ugly to her about something ludicrous.  I'm too ashamed to type it out - basically she lied about him, said he did something rude, and they told me that he is incredibly rude to his family (since dating me) and that its unacceptable.

-I can't even remember all the things they blamed me for, but interspersed with all of this, they also called my dog their ""granddog,""  invited me over to their house even if he didn't want to come, talked about their future grandkids (from me), told me they just wanted us to be happy and for him to stop acting this way, etc.  They put me through a complete emotional rollercoaster of ugly insults, to familial invitations.

My SO has already told me that he doesn't respect these people.  While they have supported him plenty, they have also pulled this shit too many times.  They have been bad people too many times, and he is ready to never talk to them again...because when he tries to communicate things with them, they just pretend they can't hear, and somehow turn it around on him.  Its exhausting.  Also, if it is important, their actions within the last 10 years are bad and insulting, but they were also physically and emotionally abusive parents when he was younger.  I would rather not go into that. 

So thats it.  I can either choose to keep trying with these people (which is a lose situation, because nothing we have ever tried has worked - being very nice, visiting, involving them in our life) or I can tell him that I'm OK with him cutting them off completely (something he is more than happy to do).  But I feel like those are both losing situations.  

They have beaten me down so much with all the things they have piled on me. I'm so tired and I'm seriously considering not being involved anymore.  

Is breaking up a terribly selfish thing to do when my actual relationship with my SO is good?  I love him and care for him very much.  He is on my side, and I think he would do whatever I asked, but there is something holding me back.  I cannot ask him to stop speaking to his family, but at the same time, I cannot deal with them anymore.  I know the general consensus in threads like these is that ""your SO needs to be on your side and tell his parents that their behavior is unacceptable.""  But that is easier said than done.  He is on my side.  He has told them he is happy with me, and he has told them the reasons he does not want to talk to them and it has nothing to do with me, but they literally refuse to believe it.  The refuse to believe they have ever done anything wrong and the more he tried to convince them that I haven't done anything wrong, the more they believe that it is me who is at fault, and I'm the reason he doesn't want their company.

I have tried speaking on my own behalf.  I have tried telling them that I love him, care for him, and I do not think he is lying to me and he is an adult and needs to handle his relationship with his family on his own, since that is a personal thing. They do not accept ANYTHING I say. Talking to them has proven fruitless.

I'm so tired reddit.  I don't know how to be supportive and sane anymore and I'm extremely wary of telling my SO that it is time to cut them off.  I'm afraid that is a drastic step, one which cannot easily be undone.  And because he also has a little sister, its not just cutting off from his parents, but his sister too, and that is harder.

Any insight would be appreciated.  

**TLDR: My SO's family goes back and forth between liking me and hating me, so much so that they are making my life miserable and I feel like the only options available to me are too extreme.

I work during the day and go to school two nights a week, she stays home with the kids (one is 3 years, the other 6 months old). My wife is very sweet, and very affectionate and I love her very deeply but...

My typical day goes something like this: Wake up, sleep deprived (~5-6 hours of sleep), iron some dirty clothes, get dressed, and go to work while the family sleeps, skipping breakfast. At work: Put out fires, handle complaints, solve complex problems, help employees through personal issues, survive on coffee and whatever I can grab for lunch. Get home, enjoy a hastily prepared dinner, change diapers and put on a puppet show for the kids. Be thwarted by attempts to go to bed at a reasonable hour. Collapse around 10:30.

My wife's typical day goes something like this: Wake up naturally, rested and ready for the day. Enjoy alone time while the kids sleep for another 30 minutes. Take kids to the local breakfast place and enjoy some pancakes. Shop until it's time to meet another stay-at-home-mom for lunch at a cafe. Drop the kids at day care, attend aerobics class and read a book. Pick up kids, get home to messy house, email maid service coupon to husband. Watch TV for several hours until exhausted husband gets home. Hand-over kids to husband while telling him the harrowing tale of how the eggs were too runny at breakfast, etc. Serve husband dinner of soggy lunch leftovers. Watch TV as husband halfheartedly plays with kids. At bed time, remind husband that oldest kid has just had three cookies and some juice, then beg him to stay up a little later for ""quality time"" together in front of the TV, not talking. Giggle at husband for falling asleep on the couch, yet again.

Any time I ask my wife to do more, e.g. laundry, house cleaning, cooking, interacting with the kids (instead of TV), etc, she goes from her usual sweet-and-loving disposition to nagging-and-complaining. She doesn't have the time! The kids keep her too busy! It's all just too much, how can anyone handle all this! We need a maid! We need a sitter! Why can't AnnoyedHusband do more! Sometimes she'll even cry.

I work really hard. I bring home good money, but it's not as if we can afford a maid or baby sitter on a regular basis. I spend a lot of time with the kids and with my wife. I do most of the cooking and cleaning on weekends. But I'm totally sick of not having clothes to wear, good food to eat, or a clean house to come home to. I'm sick of being nagged to do more to help out at the end of a long day and I know my wife has been shopping, eating at restaurants, and hanging out with friends all day. I'm afraid of the resentment that's building inside of me.

So... what do I do? :(

I am recently divorced. I met a (well I thought) wonderful woman in college and married her last year. She was from a really conservative home, so didn't have sex until our wedding night. I had always thought things were good, and she was great.

Early last year I became depressed. Not about our marriage, but about school (I was in graduate school studying to be a therapist), and being an adequate husband. I was not as talkative, or sexual ( went about from sex every 2 days to every week). While my wife tried to be supportive, she became distant, was very rude when she spoke to me, and avoided and shrugged off any affection I offered. 

After starting counseling, I find out less than a month later my wife had an affair on me, meeting another man at a hotel that she ""just kissed."" I was devastated, as I discovered this on Christmas Eve. 

So in a span of a month, I become depressed, start counseling, and she cheats. I confronted her and asked for a divorce. After a few days we reconcile and her family offers supports and tries to help us. After about a month, she continues her affair, sexting the other man off and on for a few months. The last time we had sex was a few days after they ended their contact; I felt like a consolation prize. She continue to blame my depression for her behavior, claiming I made her do it (total bullshit). She also called me socially awkward and claimed my foot fetish was weird (that one hurt a lot). About a month later we begin divorce proceedings. The divorce will be final later this month.

I wanted to tell my story for a few reasons. 

First, seeing such a positive view of sex and relationships by the community and the support of the community is wonderful, and something I want to be a part of. To see great stories of working out problems, successful relationships and sexual experiences, and overcoming hard times, it is really encouraging to read. 

Second, no matter how bad something seems and something hurts, it gets better. I can say I am on my way to being in the best place of my life in terms of confidence, happiness, and acceptance of my relational and sexual self. Divorce and break ups hurt like hell, but it can teach us to never settle, treat ourselves with dignity, and how to make yourself happy when you need to. Finding some purpose or meaning behind this has been crucial to me becoming who I am now.

TL;DR: My wife cheated on me due to depression, blamed me, but now I don't buy a damn word of it and am encouraged by this community in life in relationships. ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_xqg09,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xqg09/my_story_hopefully_can_help_others/,

We've been together for about three months. About a month ago, she went to a party and had something to drink from a previously unaccounted for cup. She thinks the drink had something else in it, because it made her collapse on the floor of the venue. The next thing she remembered, she was waking up in a bed inside of a warehouse with a few of her friends in other beds in the same warehouse.

The next week, she started hearing rumors that some guy was claiming to have gotten with her at the party. Keep in mind, this guy was near 40 years old. She freaked, and then when she started to feel sick, she went to the doctor to see if she was pregnant. Sure enough, the doctor told her to start taking prenatals. She's going back for an STD test later this week.

She is so scared right now. She feels like she is having her life ripped away from her. She refuses to have an abortion (it's against her conscience) and she is reluctant to consider adoption because her mother desperately wants to be a grandmother and she doesn't know how many other opportunities she'll have to have kids in the future because of certain medical problems her family has.

No man in her life has ever treated her like she mattered. Her dad doesn't talk to her, her sted-dad tried to sleep with her, and previous boyfriends have cheated on her repeatedly. For this reason, she has difficulty trusting me, which makes helping her through this even more difficult.

I told her I would support her in whatever she decides to do. Everyone around me tried to talk me out of that, but I knew it was the right thing, so I kept with it. Part of the current problem is that I let it slip that the people I've told didn't think I should believe her story. Now, I feel like she thinks I don't believe her, at least, not fully.

It also doesn't help that the people around her are accusing her of getting pregnant on purpose, calling her a whore, and saying all-around rude things about her family being incapable of raising a child. These people are making her a victim all over again, and I don't know how much longer she can take it. She already suffered from depression before this, but now it's escalating. I'm more worried about her now than I've ever been.

I'm at a loss, people of reddit. I've been able to keep my cool through most of this, but seeing her cry last night broke me. I don't know what to do. I need your help. How can I help her through this?

TL;DR
My girlfriend was date-raped and became pregnant as a result of it. She is having an extremely tough time dealing with the pregnancy. All of the men in her life have let her down, and I refuse to be added to that list. How can I help her through this?

Update: I appreciate what all of you have had to say. I am a little disappointed that many of you didn't even attempt to answer my question, but I understand the reasoning behind that. My first plan of action is to get a paternity test, because if the kid is mine, the choice of what I'm going to do becomes much more clear. I'm off to work for now though. Have a pleasant day, everyone.

Update 2: I feel like a lot of people are putting too much weight on the warehouse. I've put this in a few comments already, but just to clarify, her friends took her to the warehouse.

I'm in a state of shock right now and not thinking clearly.

I am (female) 27, my bf ""Sean"" is 24 and his friend ""Tyler"" is 24. I've been dating Sean for 2 years and we moved in together 4 months ago.

I am head over heels in love with Sean. We rarely argue, we have fun adventures, and we screw like bunnies. I never questioned his attraction to me. He gets a boner when we hug. He worships my body when we have sex. He has never expressed any same sex desires, never asked to be pegged, and is not overly interested in anal, even when I offer. I have seen his porn history before and it was always M/F or F/F/M threesome when I looked. There was nothing to prepare me for this.

This weekend, Saturday, we are at a mutual friend's party (in a really big house where Sean's bff Tyler also lives). Everyone is smashed. I lose track of Sean at some point. Not a big deal, but at 3am I am ready to go. I don't immediately find him and he is not picking up his phone. Searched the main areas of the house, no luck. Then I think to check Tyler's room. The door was not shut tight. I pushed it open further and see Sean and Tyler making out. Like sitting upright on Tyler's bed, but kissing with their arms around each other. It did not look like a joke.

Neither of them saw me. I was mortified and turned around and went downstairs. After a moment of panic I went upstairs again calling Sean's name and he came out of the room, drunk and stumbling, and we went home. I started silently crying in the taxi and he asked me what was wrong but I was too humiliated and sad to say anything. At home, he passed out and I stayed up all night crying on the computer.

I could not bring this up with him yesterday. I was just moody and distant all day and told him I was hungover. I'm at a loss for words. Actually I am panicking right now. I had such an amazing relationship with him and now it's ruined. Not only has he been wonderfully sweet and supportive thus far, but on a superficial level Sean is the most beautiful man I've known and I feel like every guy is going to be a step down from him. I didn't ever want to break up with him. I wanted to marry him...and then I caught him cheating on me with a man.

What the fuck do I do now? Do I just end this? Can I give him another chance? Is he gay/bi? Do bisexual men cheat on their girlfriends because they are dissatisfied with just one gender?

*edit* As for Sean and Tyler's background, they are college friends and have known each other 5 years. Tyler is not someone I ever suspected as gay either; I know he has hooked up with girls. They seemed close but not attracted to each other close.

It seems to have worked. He no longer messages me constantly on FB. He has only talked to me briefly in class about a project, which is inevitable since he signed me up to be in his group while I was out of town. Thankfully, it's an easy group project that we won't have to meet up for.

The only point where I felt bad and thought that I may have gone too far was when he posted a pretty bleak FB status, a couple days after I sent the message, that wondered why he should even keep on living. I couldn't help but wonder (and dread) that my message was the cause of this. However, thinking it through I realised it's presumptuous of me to assume that I can affect anyone, especially an acquaintance, like that. Also, it seems like he has a lot of supportive friends judging from the comments. He told me he has social anxiety and can't drink due to his meds, so clearly there's more to the story than I will ever know.

This experience hasn't been all bad, though - my discomfort with talking to him overrode my shyness and I have started talking to my fellow classmates a lot more than I ever did. And I appreciate my friends, family and boyfriend a lot more. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice. The range of opinions let me see the situation in a new light.

Her family had backed off, but she started spending 2 or 3 days a week over there.  Things haven't been good either.  We didn't really fight, but it was like she was mad at me all the time.

The 19 year old sister admitted to trying to get me in trouble at work.  She told Autumn that she just wanted me to get yelled at and Autumn said that since she's heard that I could have gotten fired she's been really upset.  Ok, she really isn't the brightest person, I could buy it and even forgive it. I found a place that's about a 25 minute drive from where we are now...and it's actually really fucking nice.  Autumn didn't go for it.

We talked a little about it, but from the get go I stuck to I'm going to move here and she stuck to trying to get me to stay.  So I moved out.  Tonight is actually my first night here.  We did end up breaking up, but her attitude through out it makes me think she's not taking it seriously.  She was really fucking sarcastic about it.

Lots of info to put out there. Ryan(29), my(24) SO, obviously has had other women in past. Yesterday he got a bunch of texts from his ex(25) saying that he's the father of her daughter... He has not seen her or anything since she cheated on him. When she had gotten pregnant, she told him that it was definitely not his and she had been cheating on him for a while now. She packed up her bags, left the state and got married to the father of the baby. He calculated her due date and had determined that there was no way the baby could be his. He was out of town around the time of the baby being conceived. 

Now she's texting him and emailing him telling him he needs to step up and be a father... I'm sitting in the background like WTF?! We've been together for a year and a half and I knew about this situation when the baby was born. He showed me her picture and questioned if she looked like him.

Anyways, Ryan has just started a very successful business and I think she might just be after his money (child support). 

Huge ninja edit: Ryan called her dad and her dad told him that her marriage wasn't working out and just wants a way out, and apparently her way out is having another dad for the baby... I don't get it. 

What can we do to protect ourselves from this whole situation? We live in Michigan btw.

1347735426.0,145,self.relationships,zxq7r,GAD husband celebrated my miscarriage and I can't get over it. Divorce inevitable? ,mcthrower,182,37,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zxq7r/gad_husband_celebrated_my_miscarriage_and_i_cant/,"I've posted before of a similar issue under a different throwaway, but I'm still seeking advice. Sorry this is so long.

Husband (early 30s) and I (late 20s female) have been married for five+ years, together for eight+. He developed a severe anxiety disorder and depression at the beginning of his PhD program that has resulted in numerous panic attacks and nervous breakdowns.

Three years ago, I got pregnant on accident. Husband made it clear (before marriage) that he did not want biological children - we decided on adoption after his program was finished. Our “what if” scenario was rarely talked about, but I told him we would either keep the baby or give it up for adoption - he knew I was personally against abortion at the time, so we were extremely careful. 

Before I get raked over the coals for tricking him into fatherhood, I was on a vaginal medication and didn't realize that it was oil based. We used condoms and the condom apparently tore. Though I was very shocked when I discovered I was pregnant, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t excited. I immediately went in ""mom"" mode and I felt attached to the baby. I really didn't think the pregnancy was that a big of a deal, sort of like a minor inconvenience since it wasn't planned. Though I was happy, I wanted to discuss adoption with my husband, as I knew he was against having bio kids. 

My husband, however, felt differently. Instead of having a rational discussion about the pregnancy, my husband basically had a nervous breakdown: he became ill (shaking to the point of dry heaving), screaming, weeping, threatening to kill himself, threatening to drop from the PhD program, screaming at me to get an abortion, throwing our stuff around, blaming me for ""tricking"" him, etc., etc.. This lasted for hours until, in a fit of tears, I agreed to have an abortion. 

I hated him for convincing me to agree to something I was so personally against. The next day, though, I began to bleed and cramp and had a pretty bad miscarriage. As I was going through severe cramps and bleeding what seemed like pints of blood, he was outside of the door thanking god and weeping for joy.

Though this was three years ago, I have not forgiven him and have not gotten over what he did. Immediately after the miscarriage, I told him to get help or I was leaving and, though he did see a (really shitty) therapist, it didn't help and he continued to have anxiety and panic attacks over the course of the last three years. I even switched jobs and moved 2000 miles away to help his anxiety (so he could be closer to his family), but he ended up having another severe panic attack/breakdown that basically lasted three months after the move.

His anxiety has worn me down to a point where I am not even trying in our marriage anymore. I just constantly expect him to overreact and have completely pulled away from him in preparation of his anxiety. In July, I told him I am filled with resentment and I was considering separation. He began seeing a therapist and has been exercising about fourteen hours a week, both of which seem to be helping him, but I don't see how him getting better is helping me because: 

a) We can't afford two therapists, so it's either him or me (even on a sliding scale, we're at $80/session with therapy on a single income in an expensive city).

b) We never see each other or talk. He leaves to exercise as soon as I get home from work, so that leaves about 40 minutes a day with each other.

c) I don't trust him with my emotions. Every time I convince myself to fall back in love with him, he has another breakdown. I've worked so hard to make him happy, but I have finally realized I can't and have made myself miserable in the process.

Though he is trying, I am not and really don't want to. He has never apologized for his reaction to the miscarriage. When I bring it up, he says ""I was in a bad place"" and changes the subject. I know he knows what he did was wrong, but he's not sorry for it. I have tried to forget what he did and be proud that he is learning how to better cope, but the expectation that he could have another attack like that really bothers me. I can't go through it again. I just can't.

Yes, I should have talked to him sooner. Yes, I shouldn't have coddled him and tried to make him happy. I know that. I know that what we are going through is not solely his fault. I take responsibility for being silent when I should have been more vocal with him about my feelings. And, I was sick with anorexia and a hormone disorder for a long time, too, so that I'm sure partially contributed to his anxiety so, yes, my fault. I take that responsibility.

Other than the GAD and depression, we get along fine. We rarely fight (except during high anxiety times), have the same interests, and used to be able to talk about anything. He's a nice guy that just refused for so long to get help, but I don't know if it's just too late. For sixty percent of our marriage, we are best friends. The other forty percent of the time, I hate him.

When do you decide a marriage is over? I don’t think I can mentally last through another anxiety attack with him and the fear of that attack is a burden. Is it time to call it quits?

TL;DR: Husband with severe anxiety celebrated my miscarriage. I can’t get over it. Should I divorce him? 

**Edit**: Wow, I honestly didn't think I would get this many (really good and empathetic) responses. I basically suppressed my resentment and anger for the last few years and, just the last few months, it's really gotten to me. For one reason, his defense (of dissertation) has been pushed back four times without regard to my very tight schedule (it was supposed to be finished in June and now I have to use sick days to take time off work for it). Secondly, he's finishing his degree this semester and has refused to find a job for next semester. Thirdly, I've pushed off two degree programs and he basically told me to push it off for yet another year until he's settled with a job (though, now I have doubts that he will be able to hold a job with so much anxiety).

I think I do know it's over. I don't want to hurt him because, despite what it sounds like, we are really good friends and I do care for him - I just no longer feel like his wife. Also, I'm absolutely terrified of starting over. I'm so so so so scared of making the wrong choice, but it's gotten to the point where I'm in such fear of the ""bad times"" I can't enjoy our ""good times."" Thank you for your advice. I'm going to wait to talk about a separation until after his defense - it's only another two months away. I can last.

I had always found her incredibly attractive and a great girlfriend. She could be assertive at times, but nothing too much crazier than your average girlfriend.

Well about 8 months ago she started to gain a little weight. Not really a big deal. Well from then to today she has probably put on 40 pounds. She eats the worst things, drinks all the time, and has totally stopped exercising altogether. Still, I'm not seeing her for her body, so that's not what I'm upset about.

She makes me work out constantly. I don't know if it is a cooping mechanism or what but she is incredibly assertive about this. She has me go on the treadmill all the time when I'm home. If she finds out I skipped a day working out at the gym, she berates me until I go, no matter how inconvenient. She makes me do situps in front of her while she just watches tv before she lets me into bed and a million other things.

On the weekends, when we are all drinking with our friends, we often want to get or order some greasy disgusting fat food (as most drunken people do). Well she gets mad if I order any for myself now. Even something slightly healthy, even though she's ordering 2 double cheeseburgers with everyone else.

So I just want to know.  I've talked about this with her a twice now and both times she says nothing is wrong, she just wouldn't wan't me to lose my nice body.  Why would a woman in her mid-twenties be putting on weight like she is in her mid-fourties? Why is she becoming so aggressive over my own life? Why is it so important I workout all the time while she relaxes.  Is this sexist of me to be thinking about.

I still love her, I don't care that she put on a little weight.  But it's everything. She only wears sweats, stopped putting on makeup, air is always a mess.  Meanwhile I am held to such a high standard by her, it is often hard to please.  I can deal with a change in physical appearance; it's the aggressive and dominant behavior toward me that's getting me upset.

Also, there have no big life changes with her. I am with her constantly, and also I asked about this, and she said flat out.

TL;DR: At the start of the relationship we were both avid gym goers, and in good shape. Now she has totally stopped caring and is sort of ""chubby and saggy"".  She gets mad at me if I don't workout constantly. Why is she letting herself go so young, and why is it SO important I do the opposite?

But when he was 20 he had the love of his life (19f) die in his arms of a drug overdose. Obviously he was very traumatized by this and its going to effect him for the rest of his life. In his words, she was the one, the love of his life, but hes accepted that he cant be with her.
He talks about her a lot, which Im okay with. He has a tattoo representing her on his shoulder, and he never takes off a necklace she gave him. I dont want him to, thats not fair of me to ask him to put that all away because its what made him who he is today and he doesn't want to forget her.
This may sound incredibly selfish, but how do you deal with the fact that your SO is only with you because a girl is dead? Ill never be his ""one"" and hell probably never be mine, and if she were here he would drop everything i a second to be with her. But his life shouldnt end because his girlfriends did.. Im the first semi serious relationship hes been in since her so I dont think he really knows what to do either.
I dont have anyone to talk to thats been through something similar, or has had an SO die or had their SOs previous so die. If anyone has been through something similar I would really love to hear how they dealt with it and got through it, or didnt get through it.

TL;DR
Boyfriend's old girlfriend died in his arms, how do I be in a relationship with someone who will always rather be with someone he can't?

EDIT: I should've included that I've never had ""the one"" and I've definitely never lost anyone like he has.

I just got done reading the first thread. After I realized I wasn't going to get help on Reddit (you all really did help; but I gave up after like an hour of no comments), I called my mother. She normally gives really bad advice, but she has really helped so far.

There are a few things I need to point out. I probably should have mentioned this in my original post, but my fiancee's brother has mental problems and does not take any medication for it. This is something I've known for a while. Also, as some people wondered, he's on probation for something else (non-violent crime).

Some people wondered if he has ever hit (my fiancee). I am not totally sure about this, and he is 6 years older than her. She has never mentioned or suggested this, however.

A lot of people thought that she grew up in an abusive family. As far as I know the answer is no, as she's never said anything about it, but it is a possibility. Her father used to be an alcoholic before going sober one day out of the blue, so there might be a chance, but it really seems like she would have told me if he was.

I'm not sure who knew about her brother's abuse. I certainly never knew about it. I think my fiancee had reason to believe her brother was abusing his wife, but never knew it, but I'm not sure about that. If she definitely knew about it, there is no way I'm staying with her. I think her parents knew, but I'm even less sure about this.

This morning, my fiancee's mother called me (she was at the hospital when everything at the house went down). My fiancee explained to her what happened (I don't know what she told her had happened, but it probably wasn't the truth) and wanted to talk to me. She starts yelling obscenities at me and telling me how I'm going to tear their family apart and I better not marry her daughter. I hung up on her and turned my phone off.

I had texted my fiancee and told her where I was staying, and told her  we need to talk. Today she texted back saying that we do need to talk about what happened, but that she wasn't ready yet.

After thinking about everything with a better mind (obviously emotions were high when I made my post yesterday), I'm not so sure what's going to happen. I'm going to give her some amount of time to gather herself and her emotions, and then see what's going to happen from there. I'm still appalled by her actions, but she has never acted like that before, so I hope it's just emotions that she's able to work through. I don't know how long yet, I guess whenever she's ready. I realize there is still a good chance we may break up, but if she agrees to go to counseling and reacts well next time we talk, I hope we can salvage this. Even if we do salvage everything, I'm definitely going to put the wedding on indefinite hiatus.

I know a lot of people are worried about his wife, but I'm not going to get into any specifics about that. I'm going to help her in whatever way I can. It'll certainly piss her family off more, but I don't care. If she still supports her brother after collecting herself, then we're through anyway.

My wife [27] hate my guts [m 27],random31415,177,33,313,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dejv8/has_anyone_come_back_from_the_brink_my_wife_27/,"My wife an I are high school sweethearts and got married after college at 22. During college I would drive 900 miles round trip to visit her every 2 weeks and we talked every night on the phone. We were really, really close. When we moved in together, however, up until about 3 years ago, my wife was a very loving person while I was just nice. She made me food almost every night and was essentially the perfect wife. Looking back, she put everything she had, an unbelievable amount, into our marriage. 

I, however, forgot to date my wife. I didn't take her anywhere or do anything, and our days would pass just surfing the internet together on the couch. She had to ask me to do everything, from cleaning to going out on the weekends, and I was always happy to do anything, except to think of it myself. My wife is a very passionate person and my apathy was tantamount to abuse that eventually boiled over 3 years ago. There are two big examples I can think of: 

1 - I was going on a 10 day trip and she was really sad that I was leaving. Conversely, I was looking forward to the trip because it was a conference in a cool location. I never talked to her about how I would miss her, or how I was going to call her, or arranging times to talk, nothing. I didn't talk to her about it because I didn't care about how it might affect her, and it didn't affect me.

2 - We moved to a small(er) city for her surgical residency program. At the time, I started looking for jobs. I was having a hard time finding good jobs locally, so I started looking at consulting jobs and other jobs in big cities, where there were plenty. I was ready to fly out for 5 days a week and I never really considered taking a ""lesser"" job so that I could stay to be with my wife. :( (she didn't have a choice where she was matched into residency, they tell you where you're going to go)

Anyways, after all these things, it was like a switch was flipped and she went from a happy (at least on the surface) to an angry wife. Being an ignoramus, I didn't really understand wtf was going on, and real strides in me being a caring individual didn't really happen until the past 1.5 years or so. I never was a really caring person. When I was a kid I was content to lie on a couch playing with a pen for hours. When my relationship with my father became strained, it never really bothered me. True empathy, where I feel what the other person is feeling, completely eluded me. During the past 3 years I had to learn all this shit.

Meanwhile our life has been a living hell. I've been called every name in the book and things have gotten physical. I've lost count of the number of times she's told me that she wishes that I would just step in front of a bus and die so she could move on with her life. I've tried to leave several times, thinking that she was honestly better off finding someone else, but she drags me back, telling me that I had made things even worse because I was abandoning her, which I was. 

So here I am, 3 years into this, and I've gripped harder than ever. She decides to throw some shit my way, fuck that noise, I'm taking us to a happier place. When she blows her lid over stupid stuff, I pause to realize why, so I can apologize for the real reason. For example, I was slow in helping her cook about a week ago, and I knew that she wasn't pissed because I was slow, but because I had never helped her before, and had I, I would have known the steps by now. 

Things are getting better, a lot better than before. I wish I had taken her on a bunch of dates before because they are a lot of fun now. She does recognize that things are different now, and when things go wrong, I'm able to shut things down where before it could last for days until she just ran out of energy. Sometimes she still asks if I love her. But the lows are frequent and deep, and honestly I can see it effecting me, now. I'm more angry - I'll swear a storm if I drop shit on the floor. If she throws a fit and then goes to work, I'll break some trivial shit like a chopstick or slam shit around. One day she was angry and I was doing my best to manage it, telling her that I loved her. She said something mean, to the effect of, no, I don't, because I never have, and I flipped and yelled in her face that I did. She hit me, I went for a drive, and when I got back she had a knife next to her and told me that if I ever scared her again like that, she would stab my eyes out. I dragged us out of that hole.

I'm afraid that the positive in my life will be the absence of pain. I'm afraid that she will never come around and be unhappy for the rest of our life. I'm afraid that I'll sink in to the same hole I put her into and then we'll be two bitter people together. I hate this. I hate where I put her. If I had been half the man I am today when we met this never would have happened. I'll do anything, I just want to know that it will be ok. I really miss my wife. She was really, really good person, and I'm scared that I won't be able to find her again.

Somebody tell me it's going to be ok because my wife was my only friend in the world and she won't tell me anymore.

My kids (f15 and m13) really seem to like Suzy. She was my daughter's favorite teacher before we started dating (I didn't ask her out until summer, when I happened to run into her walking her dog, so it was completely unplanned and on the up and up). We do things as a ""family"" all the time--the four of us just got back from Xmas at my parents, for example. Suzy does not stay overnight when the kids are with me (50% custody), as we've decided to be a bit cautious and didn't want the kids to feel weird. And since she's a teacher in the school district (small town) it might be a bit too gossipy. And that's all fine. We eat dinner together several nights a week with the kids, go to movies, Suzy takes my daughter to get pedicures together, clothes shopping, etc., etc. My daughter has even suggested to me that we get married! The kids ask every night--""is Suzy coming over?"" and if she's not they are disappointed. She adds so much fun and life to the house. (My daughter also gets help on her Spanish and English homework from Suzy, so she has an ulterior motive!) Unless I chicken out, I plan to ask her to marry me New Year's Eve. 

I've been divorced for 3 years. The divorce was traumatic for my son, then almost 10, and he benefited from counseling. I was going through cancer treatment at the same time, and hospitalized for over a month. So it was a double whammy for the kids--divorce and dad almost died. (They don't know that my ex was cheating on me, I found that out right before I was diagnosed with cancer, and she left me for the cheater after my first cancer surgery, and before my second and chemo. Bah. Like a bad soap opera or something.)

After recovery, I dated around for about a year, then this relationship started, and it's terrific. I guess what I'm wondering about is whether:
1. I should tell my kids before I go away with Suzy for New Year's Eve (kids will be with their mother for a few days) or after I get back. 
2. And then whether I should tell the kids separately, or whether Suzy should be there. 

Do any of you have any experiences to share, lessons learned? 

I lean towards telling them by myself, after I get back and I have asked Suzy, and then having Suzy come over right afterwards. (Well, assuming she says yes, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't think she would. I'm not that much of an idiot. Shit. I hope.) My son is still a bit sad about the divorce. I think I might want the slight gap there for him to adjust to the news, and be a bit sad if necessary. But I truly think he'll be fine, he likes to goof off with Suzy, and sees her every day at school (she is not his teacher, but they see each other in the hallways). 

Suzy would be absolutely fine with such an approach--she has no kids of her own (was never able to conceive during her previous marriage) but is such a super teacher and camp counselor etc., she puts kids first no matter what. 

I'm reaching out to y'all here because I don't have anyone else I feel comfortable asking, really. To add to my soap opera life (BTW, I'm actually a pretty happy and funny guy) my best friend died in a car accident last year--he was the guy who could have talked me through this. Sigh. He would have been my best man. 

And now the bonus question--I feel like I should tell my ex-wife pretty quickly after I tell my kids, as I don't want them to feel like they have to hide anything from her. In fact, maybe the best case scenario would be for me to pick up my kids from my ex's house next week, drive them home (only a mile) and drive back right away and tell the ex FIRST, then go back and tell my kids second.  (NOT worried about my ex's reaction--heck, she had a new guy before she even told me she was done with me!!)

Oy. Am I over-thinking things? I now kind of feel like by typing this out I am thinking through to a good solution--but please, please, chime in if you see anything I'm missing, and even the benefit of your experience would help. Thanks so much.

I love my kids dearly, and I love Suzy too, and I think we are going to all enjoy our new family....

tl;dr--Need advice on how/when to tell my early teen kids that I want to marry my girlfriend. They like her a lot, but it's still a big step, and my son is a bit sensitive.

We live together, share all our belongings and have mostly combined finances. We've been talking about getting married in the next year or two (we're students so we have to plan far ahead). 

Lately we've been fighting a lot. Some is stress-related from our recent move to a new town, jobs, school, etc. Some is related to our problematic sex life (we both want it but aren't giving each other the right things.) But we've always made up afterwards, and I thought things were going to be worked out and get better. It seemed hopeful.

Last night he randomly says he's going out, which is unusual (we hardly drink and his one new friend here doesn't go out at night to clubs or bars). But I smile and say okay, be safe and have fun. He left at around 5-6pm, texts around 8:30pm asking how I am. I say great but I'm bored and want to enjoy the weekend a little, too.. maybe I could join him? He doesn't respond. A couple hours later he texts me saying he's in the next city over, walking into random bars. I was feeling uneasy, but I say Okay, have fun! 

At close to 1am, I get a text saying he's very drunk and he's going to get a hotel room. He says ""I'll be okay, heading to hotel now"". I respond with a sad face because I'd been up waiting for him, then say ""Call me from the hotel room when you get there, please"" just for peace of mind that he made it there safely. I was also starting to feel suspicious and thought if he called, it would help ease my mind a little. He doesn't respond. I call him after about 15 minutes and his phone sends me straight to voicemail. 

After a couple hours laying in bed unable to sleep, I decide to check our bank accounts online to see if he charged a room to the card. He didn't. The only thing I can think of is he's at some other girl's place that he met at the bars.

TL;DR: So, I know he's in the next city over where he doesn't have any friends, got trashed, told me he was getting a hotel room for himself but I know he didn't from our credit card statements online, and his phone is off. All this after we've had a rough couple weeks fighting about all manner of things. What can I take from this (cheating?) and how should I approach him when he comes home today? 

P.S. Anon account here since he's a redditor.

EDIT: So, general consensus is that I should not assume anything about the hotel/bank statements yet. I will just have to wait until he gets home and confront him. I will let you guys know how that goes! Advice on how to do that still welcome...

EDIT 2: He just called me. First from a Blocked number which he left a voicemail. I couldn't call him back on that number, so I called his cell. He didn't pick up, so I left a text saying, ""I can't return your call when the number is Blocked."" Then he called on his cellphone, and said it was his hotel room, he didn't know why it was blocked. 

He then told me he had stayed at a Marriott where he didn't have to pay because he had these points racked up from an old business account (isn't that great?!). I said, ""I remember you telling me about these points before, but we tried using them once and you had lost the account info or something and couldn't use them anymore."" He then replied that he was able to walk into the lobby and figure it out on the spot. I admitted I felt like his story was strange. He went into this sweet voice about how I was feeling let down because he drank too much. I said, ""No, that's your business. I couldn't care less about the drinking, but I feel suspicious like you're hiding something from me."" He then said he was catching a bus and had to go. WHAT. 

EDIT 3: Okay, folks. He came home very briefly earlier this morning, gave me a hug and acted very sweet. I remained very neutral and just smiled and let him have space. He went to work only a few minutes later, then sent me a bunch of texts talking about how happy he is with me, etc. I replied saying, ""That is so nice to hear, babe. I think we have some issues to discuss tonight when you get home, though. I love you"" So right now, I am sensing that he's going above and beyond to make me feel like everything is okay when we both know it isn't. I'll let you know what happens tonight.

A bunch of you asked for an update, so here it is! 

I brought up the whole ""my birthday was two weeks ago"" thing with my mom, she immediately felt terrible, apologized profusely, said that it was just because of everything that's been happening around the house lately (like I figured)

When my dad got home from work, they brought out the birthday present they had purchased for me over the summer (a pair of moccasins made by some Native Canadians on a reserve up north, they are way nicer/warmer than the cheapo made-in-China ones I bought for myself a few weeks ago), so it's nice to see that my birthday was on their mind at some point, and it really was just the fact that life is crazy that made them forget.

Then my mom brought out tickets for the horse show that comes through town every year (I really love horses) that we've been trying to make it out to for the last couple of years. Unfortunately I already had plans (and train tickets purchased) to be out of town that weekend to celebrate my childhood best friend's birthday at Niagara Falls, which is sort of shitty. 

I'm trying not to be bitter about the fact that if my mom had remembered my birthday on the actual date, I would've known that the horse show tickets existed, and not made plans/bought tickets to be out of town that weekend (I really feel like I can't back out on my friend at this point, she's already booked us all a hotel room, etc... plus after realizing how shitty it feels to have your own birthday overlooked, I don't want to miss out on hers) so my mom is taking my grandma to the horse show instead, and maybe next year we'll finally manage to make it (and it is nice to know that she really did want to do something special to celebrate my birthday, and I really do wish there was a way to make it happen. Oh well. So it goes... although you'd think that when I mentioned that I'd be out of town that weekend for my friend's birthday, she'd be like ""Oh wait! Don't commit to that! We have plans! Also, it was your birthday two weeks ago! I'm sorry I forgot!"" but whatever, things have been busy, she has been scatterbrained, dates are hard, etc) (I know that I might sound a bit bratty/whiny about this whole horse show business, but I am legitimately bummed the fuck out that I'm missing it). 

So basically everything was fine, my parents were very apologetic, I got a sweet pair of moccasins, and yeah. I'm glad I brought it up and cleared the air, etc. because now I can stop feeling weird mentioning birthdays around the house.

She ended up disappearing for hours, and when she returned she admitted that she freaked out because as a teenager her stepfather raped her for years. I'm trying to be as supportive a boyfriend as possible.

Yes, it hasn't been very long, but luckily we as a couple are doing very well. She's in therapy, as she promised. I have been trying my best to follow her lead and read her signals. We've continued being intimate, at her enthusiastic consent.

While she seems to be doing better (just recognizing it and getting it off her chest and getting to therapy seems to have made worlds of difference), I have to admit that I am not. I am also going to therapy. I'm able to remain cool-headed and keep my composure most of the time. However, when we do have sex, I've been having erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm.

We kiss and do foreplay and everything is great. I have no problem getting hard. It isn't until we've already started having sex that I start having problems cumming and start going soft. And I know that it's all in my head. I'm enjoying myself and then I start becoming hyperaware of her moans- I keep double-taking to make sure they're actually moans and she's not crying or in pain. When she moves against me I get worried that she's struggling.

If she moves in a certain way or makes a certain noise I think I'm hurting her and start to go soft. Then I start to wonder how he could feel her struggle, cry, and scream, and still do what he did. And then I go really soft.

So far, she doesn't know about my ED. If I focus really hard I can achieve orgasm, but sometimes my boner just goes. When that happens I go down on her until I manage to get hard again.

I know that bringing this up in therapy is a must, but I feel like there must be people out there who understand what I'm going through. I don't think I could ever tell her this, but I have never ever hated someone before, and I hate this guy with every fiber of my being. I've had more than one violent fantasy about killing or castrating him (or both). I just don't know how anyone could do that to another person, or how anyone could do that to her. How do I get over this? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend was raped for years as a teenager. I'm trying my best to be supportive and help her heal, and we're both in therapy. However, knowing about her rape is causing me to have erectile dysfunction. I don't want her to think it's her fault or that something is wrong.

When I confronted her, she confessed and I was completely devastated, it was a huge surprise and a terrible shock. She had been cheating with a colleague of ours (we work for the same company), they rented hotel rooms during lunch time for sex. 

We have been married for 10 years and know each other for 12 years. We have 2 young children who I love. 

I was completely surprised and confused by the news. It is difficult to describe the extreme emotions I went through but it was like I was taken in an abyss, fell in a black hole and feel empty and totally betrayed, lost and alone and incapable of thinking rationnaly.

Yet I did not want to the one to break up. I felt very bad because I wondered what I did to deserve that. Had I been a bad husband? A bad lover? A bad father? She never blamed me for anything of this (on the contrary) and I tried to remember what I could have done so wrong to be considered so bad she could cheat on me and don't care about the consequences. I felt guilty but I did not know of what. I asked her but only got vague, sometimes confused and inconsistent answers which kept on worrying me even more. I begged her for the truth, no matter how it could hurt me. She told me she lacked tenderness, and that I was depressed. I have now the impression that either she does not want to say (but why?), or that there is no clear reason at all and I will never figure it out.

I still feel a lot of pain and anger today, even if she consistently told me she loves me and still want to live with me and she just made a huge mistake that will never happen again. I just do not understand why she did that. Why she chose to cheat instead of talking of problems and try to fix them. Even if she hated me for some reason, why she didn't talk about divorce and deal with that as adults. It's difficult to accept pain without any reason.

I considered divorce, but it's a terrible decision to divorce knowing that your children and yourself will suffer from it. It's really the last and painful option.

Reddit, do you think you could stay with your SO knowing (s)he cheated on you ? How do you cope with it? Do you think it is important to understand why he or she did it? Would you divorce?

TL;DR We have been married for 10 years, have two children, she cheated on me but I don't understand why.

1329439805.0,145,self.relationships,pt59c,Friend zoned by my wife,mehmories,184,39,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pt59c/friend_zoned_by_my_wife/,"Hi r/relationships,

My (33yo) wife of 5 years has recently told (38 yo) me ""You are a great dad and a great person, my best friend, but I feel like you are more of a roommate or father figure to me and I am not attracted sexually to you anymore"". This hit me like a ton of bricks. We have been together for 10 years, have a son together and our other kids from a previous marriage have pretty much grown up together as a family. I don't want a divorce but I am so confused and scared. I know it isn't always sparkles and rainbows in a marriage, sometimes it is work but I can never just not be attracted to or love my wife that way.

Some background. **The bad:** I am very sexual and kinda kinky, so is she. At about year 2 in she asked if I would be interested in a threesome with another woman. It sounded great but I felt odd about it and declined. Fast forward 3 years. **The ugly:** She brought it up again and by this time we were married and I felt more secure in our relationship. So I said yes. That year we had sex with about 4 different women, it was pretty fun. It wasn't as awesome as I thought it would be but... Also, she was always an exhibitionist of sorts and since it turned her on showing off, it turned me on as well. She started to do webcam modeling and seemed to enjoy that, made good money, we had great sex. I would often watch and we would have sex during her break between cam modeling. Then one day she changed. She said she wanted to quit modeling and having sex with other women together. I agreed, I didn't want it to ruin our relationship and if she didn't want to then it was over. Looking back I think this did a lot of damage to her emotionally. I don't think we understood the consequences.

It has been 2 years since we stopped. Since that time I started noticing changes in our sexual relationship. First we stopped having sex while facing each other (her choice, spoon style). I figured maybe she was tired, having a toddler can do that. I also started noticing she wouldn't kiss me very long and those soft caring kisses became cold. I would talk to her about it and ask if things were ok and why we don't do that anymore. All I would get is arguments, or ""what are you talking about?"" responses. 

This last year we bought a new house, I got a great paying job, our kids go to good schools now. Things seemed to be going good for us. We argued a lot less, stopped yelling at each other when we got into arguments. This is also the year she started drinking though. At first it was a glass of wine once or twice a day. Then it became a bottle a day. I also noticed we wouldn't have sex unless she was drinking. We had a few arguments about it, I knew bringing it up would just cause her to drink more. A couple of months ago she decides to quit. I was so glad, she just decided to stop and she did. Things seemed to be going great. Sex wasn't as often as I wanted but she has also been a bit sick and would use that as an excuse.

2 weeks ago she drops the bomb on me. I noticed around Xmas she was edgy and I could feel her pushing me away. She apologized for being distant and things were ok for a few weeks. She started being distant again then I got the friend zone talk.

I am so confused. She said she is not interested in sex anymore. I asked if it was someone else, or she likes women now. She said no to both, she does not know what it is. I asked if she still masturbates or fantasizes about anything she said no. She sort of said ""Hey it isn't you, it's me, I just have no interest in sex"". She says she still loves me. She is also still somewhat affectionate to me. She hugs me, holds my hands sometimes. Then sometimes she is cold, distant and non affectionate (which confuses me even more). I don't remember the last time she said I love you. I try talking with her, she just says ""I don't know, or I don't know what is wrong"". Then she pretends nothing is wrong, or starts to be distant with me. She said the last time we had sex, she did not enjoy it whatsoever. I have been giving her space. I scheduled an appointment with a marriage counselor. She said she wants to work on our marriage. I am just not sure it is sincere. I am willing to wait and work it out. I don't want our son to be in a divorced family. I still love her.

At first I thought it was me. I have gained a bit of weight over the years. I actually weigh a lot less than I did 3 years ago when our sex life was AOK, so I don't see how that could be it. I have been going to the gym a lot recently and have been losing even more. She said I am still handsome but once again not attracted that way to me. I do everything I can for our family, I thought our relationship was getting better. The vibe around here is so awkward. Do I lawyer up (already going to the gym) or just wait it out? I am so confused and scared.

**TLDR;** Wife and I had threesomes with other women (her idea), I think it hurt her emotionally, she recently friend zoned me, doesn't feel sexual at all towards me. I don't want a divorce. Confused, scared.


**EDIT:** Thank you everyone who has been helpful. I appreciate the different perspectives given which is why I did this in addition to seeking counseling. It is incredibly personal and was difficult for me to write but I think people are generally good and well meaning and many of you have proven to be. Seeing a counselor next week. She has also agreed to do counseling on her own. I have hope.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_pt59c,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pt59c/friend_zoned_by_my_wife/,

We live together and talk about marriage and children frequently.  

This morning, he left for a mini road trip with his guy friend to pick up some equipment they left at a campground last weekend.  I expect him to be gone until later tonight.  

After he left, I got a phone call from him.  I answered ""hi baby!"" but quickly discovered he had pocket dialed me because it just sounded like he was walking.  I hung up and went back to what I was doing.  About 5 minutes later, he calls again.  I hoped he was calling me for real this time, so again I answered ""hey baby!"".  He had pocket dialed me again.  I was about to hang up when I heard him say ""turn around and let me see your asshole"".  WTF??  I kept listening...  He said ""yep..I wanna fuck you in the ass"".  Then I could hear his guy friend laughing, along with another man's voice who I didn't know.  I listened more and heard my boyfriend telling his friends personal things about our sex life.  And then he started to essentially compare me to his ex girlfriends.  He talked about one girl who 'used to get wet as fuck but never came' and another who 'was pretty indifferent about the whole thing...she would let you fuck her..like you could do whatever you wanted to her..."" and then finally ""and then there was my other ex...you could only fuck her for like, 10 seconds"".  

I heard all of this.  I am hurt and mortified and disgusted.  Firstly - my boyfriend and I have discussed and agreed that we don't give details about our sex lives to our friends.  I am a very private person and we have both agreed to keep intimate details private.  I understand that everyone shares stories with their friends every now and then.  I get it.  But there's a way to do so with tact while respecting the boundaries of your relationship and respecting ME as his life partner.  

This man wants me to be his wife.  Yet he sat there today telling his buddy and a random guy about our sexual encounters as well as previous girls he used to fuck??  He's almost 40 years old and he was speaking like a teenager.  I can't get his voice out of my head!!!  I cant unhear what I heard.  I feel sick to my stomach.  

He doesn't know that I know.  He will be very embarrassed when he realizes what I heard him say.  He has ALWAYS led me to believe that he is a gentleman who talks about women with kindness and respect.  After what I heard today....  fuck.  He's not respectful at all.  I have had no contact with him since this pocket dial.  I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Boyfriend pocket dialed me while talking to his friends about private details of our sex life as well as graphic details about other women he's been with.  I can't 'unhear' it.  I feel sick.

***TL;DR of original post: Over the past few years, my uncle [M40ish] has inappropriately touched me [F17] and made numerous sexual comments. It makes me really uncomfortable. I know I should have said something to him before, but I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I don’t say anything. I just try to forget it happened. If anything inappropriate happens again, I plan on telling him to stop. Should I do anything else?***

***••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••***

*Note: I am now F18.

I told my mom within a week of posting my original thread. I printed out my original post and had her read it. She felt terrible and cried. Apparently, she had felt before that something was not right. Looks like motherly instincts were right. Her opinion of Uncle Asshole has plummeted.

In the beginning, my mom was against telling my dad about it. She asked me what good would come out of it. Of course, she was quick to point out that no good would come, only bad, when my dad found out that his younger brother was behaving inappropriately around his daughter. But, I was adamant on at least informing my dad. He should know.

So about two months pass; I turn 18. My mom waited until I felt it was time to tell him. So within a week after my 18th birthday, the three of us sit down to talk. Well, talking was what I was hoping for.

Before I joined my mom and dad for the talk, my mom was telling my dad about the situation. In the middle, my dad said to stop and got up. Went outside to smoke a cigarette. When he comes back, I'm sitting in the room with my mom. I give him the print-out of my original post. He reads it.

Then, like a douche, he brings his gaze to the television without ever looking at me. I guess the basketball game was more important. After a few minutes of silence, he says (with a smirk on his face) ""So that bothers you, eh?"" in such a sarcastic, condescending way. I left to lock myself in my room before I lost it.

He doesn't believe me. Hasn't said a word since. Almost a month has gone by.

So I feel pretty shitty about that. I think I'm always going to hold this against my dad. Not only for not doing anything about the situation, but for not believing me. *I don't even.*

I'm just trying to stay away from Uncle Asshole as much as possible. Besides that, there really isn't much else I can do.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post and offered advice. (And thank you, [Caterinka](http://www.reddit.com/user/Caterinka), for dubbing the nickname ""Uncle Asshole."") I wish things turned out better. I will make updates if anything else happens.

It didn't go as well as I would like it to be. I've been busy working last week and was only able to squeezed 1 night to talk to her. I had it all plan out in my head while driving up to her place. I was going to casually take her out to eat so I could tell her about it outside her own  home (later on, a female coworker told me that's quite a shitty move for a break up). In my head, I didn't want her home to remind her of the break up so I took her out to go eat. We went to this shitty looking mexican food restaurant with great reviews on yelp. The food was amazing, but she was feeling nauseated (most likely pregnancy-related symptoms). We just went on like usual dinner.

I didn't want to do break up while she feeling sick so we just went back to her place and I ended up staying the night at her place. We got hungry around 3 am and she suggested going to denny's for early breakfast before going back to sleep (she work night shift and I work in the afternoon). She said she feeling a lot better, so I was going to break the news at denny's but I couldn't bring myself to it. 

So we went back to her place again after denny's and we both went to sleep. I left her place in the afternoon to work. When I got to work, I received text message from her saying thank you for spending the time with her last night. She also asked me if I can meet up with her for ""late lunch special"". My shift usually ended around her lunch time and in the past we used to fuck like rabbits on her lunch break in my wagon. I replied to her by saying ""I would like to do the late lunch special, but I think we need to talk about us.""

She knew it then and there what's the ""talk"" is all about and text me that she was upset and she rather have this talk at her place last night. I apologize if I making her upset right before going to work, but I told her I have to be honest to her and myself. I told her that if I could just wait till after the weekend to discuss this matter since we both will be working all weekend long.

Fast forward to tonight. I text her again and asked how she's doing. She said she was doing okay. We then starting discussing about the text from last week. She was still upset about it. She wished it could have happen in person. She told me she had many things to say to me and none of it was bad or mean. She said she wanted to close this chapter with me by saying all the nice things about me, but the text from last week left her with a sour note and she couldn't say those nice things anymore. She said she enjoy my companionship and she said she did not expect anything from me since she found out about the pregnancy. Then she told me we should go snowboarding next year.

I told her that I also enjoy the companionship and agreed on the future snowboarding plan. I told that I wish her and the baby the best and asked her to say hi to her dog for me. (I really gonna miss that fluffy, cuddly bastard...:(..). She said she will and ended the reply with a smiley.

I'm relieved that it's over but also feel a bummed out for several reasons. First, I really really love her dog. I always wanted my own dog but my current life arrangement making it difficult for me to have one. Second, text messages don't convey any form of emotion and feeling unless it was explicitly stated on the message. I'm not sure if she's really okay of just saying it because it already happened.

Third, this so-called relationship/companionship was the most civilized and peaceful relationship I ever had. My previous relationship before this one lasted for 6 years but was emotionally taxing and ended on very bad term. I learned a lot from it and I think that's one of the reasons why this last one seems so much smoother up until the break up via text message. We never had real argument or fight. 

As good as it sounds, the relationship felt quite superficial for me and that's another reason why I feel quite relieved with this break up. I'll add this experience to my book of life and use them as my life lesson to become a better person when it comes to relationship, and this wrap it before I hit it....no matter what.

She got a mediocre job and kept the baby. Since at the time when the baby was born I could not work, it made sense for me to watch the baby while she's at work.

Situation now:
The baby is 5 months old, I've watched her every weekday since she was 5 weeks old. The mother is not really as invested as she could be, granted, she works and tries to provide for them, but she has made a few stupid decisions that makes it harder. My husband put a word in for her for a better paying job with better hours, but she got lazy and never turned her resume in. The baby is at our place for an unknown amount of hours every day (I'm not sure whether it is just the job or whether she goes and does other things while the baby is here too), which makes it hard for me to plan anything and getting anything done outside the house.

This might be a little different if it wasn't winter or if she would pack enough warm clothing for the baby, so we can go out with the stroller. But despite me having asked many times it never happens. Sometimes even the stroller doesn't make it here, when I have asked several times. It has caused me to miss several important errands.

The baby also often arrives with not enough formula or not enough diapers. Sometimes the bottle doesn't make it here. I have developed a secret stash of supplies for emergencies, but I always make a point to let her know that something got forgotten. It has been 5 months now and at this point she really ought to know to check the diaper bag before the baby gets here. Eventually she found out that I have some extras lying around and since then this has gotten a lot worse. She pretty much depends on the fact that I will have stuff for the baby. Today she is clearly upset with me, because she didn't pack a bottle and I actually don't have an extra, so she is forced to go back and get one.

I want to make a point of the fact that her situation is very little like that of a typical single mother. She lives with parents, all her food, laundry, phone bill and other everyday costs are taken care of. All she has to do is go to work, other than that she's not really busy in any way. And while her parents insist that she pays me at least some money for watching the baby, she very rarely does. I mean, once in three weeks or so, she hands be a hundred bucks. 

The reason why this annoys me is because at this point I can work again. When I mentioned going back to work, she looked genuinely surprised and said ""but who's going to watch the baby??"". And I was completely taken back. For the whole time I have basically watched the baby out of my good will, I have bought formula and diapers and other stuff to make sure that the baby isn't mistreated while at my place. And now I just feel like I am being taken advantage of. 

But because my husband and I can get by without me working, people don't really expect me working anymore, even though I'd like to. And to some degree resentment has built up to a point where I just don't want to have to worry about this anymore. I don't want to watch the baby no matter whether I work or not. From my point of view, yes, I have a lot of free time so why not. But at the same time, I didn't run around and get knocked up, this is not my responsibility. It's not my child, I didn't choose to have it. And I shouldn't be guilt tripped into watching her for 40 hours a week without getting paid (and with spending money on supplies) just because I have time to do it. 

I feel like she is using the fact that I am available and it wouldn't be polite of me to say no.. 

Does this makes sense at all? Or I am just being a brat? Would I be a horrible person to say - hey, I don't want to watch your baby even though I am not working yet..?


TL:DR - sister in law got knocked up and had a baby. since I couldn't work when she gave birth, I ended up watching the baby while she works. It has grown to be a huge responsibility and my care is expected of me, and taken advantage of. I can work now, but I am not just yet, but out of resentment I don't want to watch the baby anymore. Would I be a horrible person to tell her I don't want to do it even though I still have time for it?

The only complicated part is that she lives in my house and I'm afraid that when I break up with her, she'll break my stuff.  She has threatened to damage my car and electronics in the past which is mainly why I'm worried.    

I see the only truly safe way to do this is take work off, pack up her stuff, change the locks, and give her the news.  Not the nicest thing in the world, but ... hmm, I don't know.  I'm expecting some comments like: ""hey you guys are both adults just break up with her and trust her enough to not do anything crazy"", but I'm really worried about how she will react.

UPDATE: Holy shit, sometime after the text was sent yesterday during the night, someone has caught my cat and removed her collar. My cat never goes up to anyone she doesn't know and my ex knows how much I couldn't bare to lose my cat. I have asked my entire family if anyone took the collar from her and tied it around the balustrade around the front entry of my house (in a way the cat could not have done herself). No one has touched the cat, either some weirdo has caught her or my ex has used the collar as a warning.

We (M18 and F19) were together for about 2 years as friends with benefits, I recently said I wanted it to stop because I didn't like how our sex life was. He was too rough during sex and didn't seem to care if I said ""ow!"". He is also a compulsive lier and has a strong tendency to be maniupulative so I wanted out. 

Before things went bad I reluctantly agreed to give some naked pictures of myself, I realise I shouldn't have done this but it's too late now. I did ask him to delete them shortly after and he said that he had done so. Now that I have told him I don't want anything to do with him anymore he has sent me a text saying ""just wondering what would be a good website to post those pictures on"".

I'm wondering if I should even answer at all, I think he just wants a reaction, If I wasn't training to be a teacher I wouldn't be so worried because I'm not fully naked in any of the pictures but this could be damaging to my reputation.

I've never had to deal with anything like this and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.

TL:DR ex FWB texted me saying he was going to post naked pictures of me on the internet, help?

I wanted to let you guys know how things are going!

At the beginning of July, things came to a head. Neither my boyfriend (22M) or I (22F) was happy. It was a continuous cycle of him being distant, me feeling hurt, him trying to repair things, him feeling like his actions were forced, me sensing that he was forcing himself to try to be happy with me, rinse and repeat. He attempted to break up with me. I convinced him that things could change and that he should give us another shot. He agreed. 

That was two months ago. Since then, I've been working on not overreacting so much and not taking things so personally. I had to realize that sometimes he didn't talk, and that didn't have anything to do with me, that's just who he was. He started feeling more understood and appreciated after I stopped pushing him so hard, and little by little he became more affectionate and dedicated to us. I became happier because he was more affectionate, and was more loving towards him. He felt more loved, and reciprocated by texting me cute things and picking me up a little dog-shaped chocolate from our favorite candy shop one day before I came over.

The improvements show in the little things. Kissing my nose when we're lying in bed chatting. Coming up from behind me and hugging me while I'm baking brownies. Playfully leaving a post-it note on my forehead while I was asleep, letting me know that he'd gone to the store for breakfast food and that he'd be back soon. Facebook messaging me a cute video of baby owls during work, just to cheer me up. All the things I'd wanted in the first place he is now doing, without pushing or nagging from me, because he feels loved and appreciated and not pressured to be more expressive. 

I'm really happy, reddit. We just celebrated a year together yesterday, and he told me that over the last couple months he has slowly been coming back to me, and that he really cares about me and is happy with me again. He has been behaving as enamored with me as he was at the beginning of our relationship, and I am so thrilled. Things are wonderful.

Thank you for the help. I couldn't have done this without a good hard reality check from some of you guys. We are on the up and up. :)

I have yet to see her in person.

This is what my weekend has consisted of thus far:

The 31st, I asked her if she made an appointment (abortion).  She said she called and had either Wed or Friday available but needed to know what was best for me.  I said wed.  I have sent her 6 more text messages after, with 0 replies.  I have not heard from her at all.  Until last night, the 2nd.  At around 10:30 PM, she called me to tell me she was sorry for being selfish and how she was acting.  Then she said she was keeping the baby and wanted to see me Tuesday, as she was too busy today (the 3rd).  This is when I told her that I'm having serious doubts about her claims and that she needs to come over and prove it to me.  She refused to come over last night, but said she would come over today (the 3rd).  She called me some names, to which I told her to stop and I tried explaining why I had my doubts.  She called me some more names, said it was a low blow, and hung up.  Right before hanging up, she told me she wasn't going to cancel the appointment now.  She didn't answer my call back.  I have asked her twice, through text message, when she'll be coming over today.  She has not responded.

The other things she accused me of on the phone was not talking to her more.  I told her that was stupid since she has been ignoring me completely.

I also explained to her that even if she is pregnant, I will not be assuming that I'm the father due to her actions.  She will have to be proving that to me as well.  She did not take kindly to that, which I'm not surprised by.

I'm seriously hoping this shit gets over with soon and I know for sure one way or another.  She's been acting completely unreasonable, still seeing her boyfriend, and been leaving me completely in the dark.  This is obviously not a person I want to father a child with so I'm pretty much still freaking out.

**tl;dr As a recap, she has gone from wanting to have a kid, to not, to wanting, to not so far.  She has been ignoring my attempts to set a meet up.**

Quick addition:

When I first brought up the pregnancy test, she didn't really have an objection to it.  She sounded pissed, but initially agreed to it.

I have multiple auto-immune diseases that have resulted in significant hair loss, as a result I wear a wig.  I still have some hair, but it is very thin and there are many patches of skin showing.  The wig is very expensive and well-made and, thus, extremely convincing.  I am not comfortable with not wearing a wig when in public, as I feel very humiliated and ashamed to be a woman with such significant hair loss, I have admittedly not accepted it.  There are times when my hair tends to grow back, but other times where it falls out in clumps.

I have been with a man for about a month's time who is wonderful and very kind.  He knows I have these conditions (he has celiac and issues with stomach ulcers, so he relates), and is extremely nice.  However, when he calls me beautiful, I can't help but feel like I'm lying to him, I feel like I should tell him that I wear this wig, but I am so afraid of how he will react, and how I will react as well.  I am extremely sensitive about my hair loss and talking about it makes me cry.  

I feel like I have to tell him eventually (obviously) but I don't know when the right time is.  I don't want him to be repulsed, and I'm even wondering if I SHOULD say anything or just keep quiet about it.

Any advice?  I am planning on staying with him for a long time and am not sure how to approach this.

""Sexual orientation aside, he cheated on you.

""...regardless of sexuality, cheating is cheating. ""

""Cheating is different than closeted bisexuality, the latter of which could easily be brought out for a little spin by serious alcohol intake.""

""I think it's because sexual exploration is a different issue than just wanting to get with other people."" ""...the exploration is a contributing factor, it's not only greed. Reddit is too black and white""

""It doesn't necessarily mean the end of your relationship. It just means figuring out what to do -- does he want to explore his sexuality? Was it a fluke? An ongoing thing?""

-----

Several of you pointed out that his lack of interest in pegging or anal doesn't mean anything. I know you are right. When I said that, my mind was scrambling to build up some evidence that he was not truly gay. I read over it today and realized how desperate and insecure it all sounded.

OK on to the outcome:

I cried most of the evening and was puffy and sniffling when he came home, which he noticed. He kissed me and told me he was going to take a shower and be right back. My stomach was in knots.

Turns out I didn't have to say anything, because he came out of the shower and made a full confession. 

He said he loved me and our life together and was extremely sorry for hurting me. He told me he wanted to discuss it after it happened, but both of us were so wasted that he didn't want it to become a fight fueled by drunken emotions. When I think back to that night, he was trying to hold me and comfort me but I kept pushing him off.

He said he tried again on Sunday, but every time he approached me, I rebuffed him (which is true, I ignored his attempts or said I had a splitting headache, and then went to my sister's place for the rest of the day). 

According to him, this was an isolated incident since we began dating, which hadn't happened in some months before we started dating, but had happened a few times in his past history with Tyler. 

The night it happened, they were listening to music and chatting (he swears nothing else happened), and Tyler asked if he thought anything was still there and leaned in to kiss him. He said it was a moment of being drunk and getting caught up in the past, and wouldn't have gone any further than what happened. He said he was completely wrong for choosing to do it, but that alcohol removed rational judgment from the process. If he was sober, he would have said ""sorry, I can't"" and left.

He says he is ""somewhat bisexual"" in that he's had passing attraction to some men but is predominantly sexually and romantically attracted to women. The last guy he felt any attraction towards was, guess who, Tyler. At various points in their friendship they have gotten drunk together and made out and gone as far as blow-jobs. 

He says that even though he has enjoyed hooking up with Tyler in the past, he doesn't have a consuming need to be with a man, and can be happy with a life of monogamy. He thinks I am the perfect woman for him and he loves the idea that someday we could be married. He insisted this was a stupid slip up and wouldn't happen again.

To all this, I pointed out that he's kept a person in his life who is a snake in the grass. I asked how this was any different from having an ex-girlfriend as a friend, never mentioning that she was an ex-girlfriend, me stupidly assuming things are platonic between them, while she harbors attraction towards him and then when he gets drunk and she pushes just a little, he gives in. I can't just forgive this as a drunken mistake. It was dishonest not to tell me they had history and stupid to hang out in intimate situations.  It was totally fucked up to kiss him with so little prompting. If he can do this so easily, what's to say they haven't done this on other occasions? Or won't again?

He agreed and said it was wrong to keep it from me, but that male/male sex is such a taboo subject he didn't feel he could tell me about their history due to possible prejudice. Also he said it wasn't like an ex-girlfriend, more like a seldom occurring FWB situation that seemed to be over by the time we started dating. But for the same reason, prejudice, he didn't tell me. He feared I would never date him if I knew.

After a lot of emotional yelling and him trying to calm me down, we both agreed it was completely wrong of him to keep a former FWB in his life without telling me, and that telling me was a risk he needed to take in a relationship that's become as serious as ours. We agreed he has destroyed my trust in him and that I have no assurance that he will not betray me again. He told me he will cut off all contact with Tyler and completely accept any other terms I want. 

When I asked, he agreed to go to therapy with me on Thursday (I regularly see a therapist for anxiety problems).

I just don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I believe that they haven't hooked up at other points during our relationship. I have no way of ever knowing that. I think ""is there still anything there"" is a pretty flimsy pre-text to throw away your obligations to be faithful and get carried away by kissing someone. Alcohol may have made that easier, but there was still something inside that person that wanted it to happen. I also don't know if I can trust him that he doesn't need to explore his bisexual side more. He could just be saying all this because he's terrified to lose me.

I haven't made any firm decision yet. I'm still processing everything, but leaning towards breaking up. I would appreciate your feedback on what transpired. Sorry for the length, and if you made it this far, thank you.

She's 25 and I'm 21. We've been dating for three years, living together for six months, and the longer we live together the worse our situation at home is.

We have no physical contact. We barely speak. She frequently yells at me, often says everything in her life sucks, and occasionally tells me she hates me. Yesterday she woke up to her cat peeing on her and her response was to yell at me for about an hour. It's to the point I feel uncomfortable being in the same room as her.

To avoid her I've taken to staying up throughout the night and sleeping during the day. I spend about three hours a day cleaning up spills, picking up trash, and trying to make the place look livable. When I wake up the place looks just as bad as before and she complains that the house isn't clean enough. Worse, she'll complain that she's a maid and I make her do all the cleaning while I sleep.

""Sex"" for us is her laying still on her back while I try to pleasure her and turn her on more. She's very into BDSM and complains that I don't bruise her; I'm afraid of going to jail if I do! Typically she'll ask me to rub her first before I go in then decides she is ready for bed without us having sex. I'm so frustrated by it I've lost the ability to orgasm even when browsing porn while she sleeps. She'll offer ""sex"" as a reward or lack of it as a punishment; our ""sex"" has become irrelevant to me and the only reason I am willing to do it is to keep her at yelling at me when I'm not in the mood. We started out having actual intercourse about once a week and now haven't even had ""sex"" in a month. Now that my mother is coming to stay with us for a week she's wanting to have nightly sex just to make my Mom feel uncomfortable and less likely to come visit.

She's taken to frequently hitting me. I'm a heavy set 6' 2'' male, she's a small framed 5' 4''. She isn't doing any real damage, but it really bothers me. She especially likes hitting me upside the back of my head which she knows is an extremely sensitive area ever since I got hit with a base ball there.

Obviously this isn't a situation I can continue to live in. I'm a laid back guy and I know I shouldn't have let it get this far, but I feel extremely sorry for her. I've never so much as raised my voice to her until this week where I've yelled at her twice; I felt really guilty watching her cry and apologetic profusely, but I am having a really hard time holding in my emotions from her.

I don't know what to do. Just talking about the situation to anonymous people online is enough to make me cry. I've become a depressed emotional wreck lately. I've even stopped feeling hungry; I haven't been able to make myself eat in three days. When I try to eat I just feel queasy and sad.

I'm afraid if I do break up with her she'll kill herself. I don't think she enjoys living together, but anytime I hint at us splitting up she gets angry and sad. Since money isn't an issue (I'm very good at my job) I had my mother offer to put her in an apartment for a year all expenses paid; I thought she wouldn't get emotional if it came from my mother. I'm pretty sure now she hates us both.

Before I get off of work, go home and deal with this. I have no idea what to do, I'm stumped.

In the beginning of my relationship with my AMAZING boyfriend, I was a loud mouth. I talked about EVERYTHING from my past. My sex, nipple piercings, anal, stalker, ex, the drugs I used to do. Everything. I even lied about things because I thought he would find me more interesting and what not. The complete opposite of what I am used to in a ""man"". I had just gotten out of a relationship and for some reason I thought he would be attracted to me if he knew all this.

Obviously I was wrong, and I'm not actually like that. I found out last night that he is at his wits end with these thoughts eating him alive. Now this was quite a while ago. I try to make things better and ""explain"" and give ""reasons"" but that's not what he is looking for. He just wants me to comfort him and make him feel better about everything. He is 100% determined to make this work, as am I. Im not good with this, lately Ive been getting snappy and giving attitude which obviously isn't helping my case either. I get so defensive because in MY mind, its like ""get over it"" but if roles were reversed, Id be the same way as him. I know Im wrong but I cant seem to actually COMFORT. Ive never been that person and I need to be. Want to be. HAVE to be.

Can you guys PLEASE help me, show me, tell me your secrets, give advice on how to correct the damage Ive done, comfort him. Put his mind to ease. He is honestly THE best man I have ever met in my life. A dream come true. And I dont want what I used to be like to fuck up what we have now.

We have been dating for four years and are in a very serious, committed, monogamous relationship. 

We have each other's passwords but we never check up on one another, its just for emergencies or convenience. I was trying to figure out when exactly he had booked our flight to see his family so I logged in to his email to pull up the confirmation receipt. The third email down was a thread with 50+ responses to one his close friends. They both work together and they were just talking about guy things I guess. I gathered from the emails that his friend was cheating on his wife (of only a year, who he has a baby with). I expected my boyfriend to tell him to wise up and instead he was covering for his friend and just being all around supportive. We are friends with his wife who is just a sweet heart. She doesn't deserve this. 

So after I read this, I did snoop through older emails. Just a lot of misogynistic language about everyone - which is surprising because it is so not like my boyfriend. What bothered me most though was they went to strip clubs on at least two occasions. I found chat logs from when they were talking and matched the chats with when the emails were going back and forth about the strip clubs. My boyfriend went back for private dances (as did his POS friend) and they both were shirtless and they were feelings all over the girls. I don't have a ton of detail beyond that but his friend said the stripper touched his dick so I assume same goes with my boyfriend. 

I'm pretty freaking mad. The encouraging his friend to cheat is fucked up but the strip clubs too. He never mentioned it and he spent money that we should have been saving. We are trying to save for a house and we are being really frugal and he went and dropped a lot of cash on other women. WTF. And not to mention that he was getting lap dances and feeling on some other girl's tits. Its pretty damn close to cheating in my eyes. 

Its so unlike him. He is the best guy I have EVER been with. He is so sweet and caring and goes out of his way to do loving things for me, even after 4 years. We have the perfect relationship and this shit is so not him. I'm amazed he could do this. I don't know what to make of it and I don't know what I should do. I don't want to break up with him over this but its not okay either. I'm planning on confronting him when he gets home tonight but I'm not sure what to do exactly. I'd love some advice.

Following the guideline, I'm a 25 male lucky to be in a relationship with a beautiful 25 female for the past 2 years.

Right so it all started with a box of Ferrero Rocher and my complete lack of self control. After vowing to eat no more than 2, I got a bit of the 3rd one stuck behind my teeth. After trying and failing to remove it for the better half of 10 minutes, I called to my girlfriend.

""AMBER CAN YOU GET ME A TOOTHPICK PLEASE?"".

Ladies and gentlemen, Amber is not my girlfriends name but is in fact my ex's. It took about a second for the sheer gut wrenching panic to set in and shortly thereafter I jumped in to action. Unfortunately I wasn't quick minded enough to play it off as a joke and began to profusely apologize, only to be met by ""DON'T F*ING TOUCH ME"" and the obligatory door slam.

Now I feel it is important to stress that I am in no way in contact with my ex nor do I have any feelings whatsoever for her. And I can confidently say that because it's been that way for the last 4 bloody years! I can only assume it to be the actions of troll brain to ruin what was shaping up to be a very comfortable evening (Read: brain lapse). However try as I might, I cannot get this across to my girlfriend.

For the remainder of last night I thought it best to just let her be; which in hindsight mightn't have helped. Naturally I slept on the couch and woke up today with the sound of her leaving for work. (Forgive my naivety but I'm not entirely sure if her finding me sound asleep would have just fuelled the fire...ladies?) I returned from work this evening and tried to reach out to her then but I got the silent treatment. Told her I was making dinner and in turn got a deathly stare. But she did eat it so that's a good sign..right?! Since then she's gone to bed and I am typing this on my laptop on the couch.

Forgive the light heartedness with which I've written my dilemma; an approach I usually use in these situations. But I do love my girlfriend very dearly and I do miss her even though she's 30 feet away! We don't fight very often and I've certainly never been blanked before so I'm beginning to get a little worried. This is THE girl. The last thing I want to do is fuck things up but I'm not sure what to do. I'd very much appreciate it if anyone has any advice on how best to handle the situation. Thanks.


tl;dr Next time you go to ask your gf for toothpicks. Don't.

**[07:07 GMT] Edit: Thank you, sincerely, for all the replies! I'm really glad to have found /relationships, it's been very useful. My girlfriend will be up soon so I'll make some breakfast and try to put your advice to use. I'll post an update later if anyone is interested.**

**[23:44 GMT] Edit 2: My apologies for the late update. Well in the morning she was behaving fairly normally but there was no mention of the incident. I thought it better at the time not to bring it up so we had breakfast and went to work. When I arrived home this evening I dropped myself next to her and the dam broke. She was visibly very upset and apologized for her reaction. As you suggested I did ask her if there was maybe something more to it but she didn’t know why she reacted so strongly. Although she did say my initial reaction didn’t help; which a few of you pointed out.**

**At that point I figured it would be best to get her out of the flat so I took her out to dinner. On the way there it dawned on me that we’d come across at least 2 name tags at the restaurant and “Oh god no...I couldn’t be that unlucky could I?!”. Luckily no one named Amber served us but I did learn that wasabi is actually rather hot. Afterwards she wanted to go to the cinema so I held my breath through a few more name tags and we saw The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (really good movie actually).  We’re back at home now and unbeknown to her I’ve been up for about 36 hours so I’m about to crash harder than a parachuteless skydiver. On the bed this time though. Thank you again for all your advice, I got some great insight and hopefully I won’t have to call upon you guys ever again! :)**

**Now I better go to bed and wish ~~Amber~~ the girlfriend goodnight!**

He has spent 7 years, give or take, in prison for grand theft. When he got out of prison he lived with his sister. She kicked him out after a month, knowing I would take him in. And I did. 

He refused to get a job during the first two months because he had no car, and so I told him he had to work with me in order to help me pay the bills. I could not afford to pay all of our bills, plus pay for an employee, plus support him while he stayed home all day. So he begrudgingly started working for/with me. I own my own business, and have been running it alone for two years before he moved in with me. 

Working together was very bittersweet, because it was great to be together all of the time (we were each other's best friend) but he had an incredibly hard time taking orders from me. He didn't like doing things my way and always thought he had a better way of doing things. He tried to change many parts of my business, and although I did take things into consideration and even adopted some of his ideas, I had been going through a trial and error for TWO YEARS, having tried many ways of doing things before deciding which ways were more efficient and cost effective. He was also very picky with what tasks he wanted to do, so in the end I would be left doing 60-70% of all of the work, while he did the remainder, and I have always been the one to pick up the slack, to do the numbers, to manage the money, to pay the bills, and being the glue that held my business and our personal lives together. 

On a personal level, he has a HUGE temper and every little fight at work would lead to him walking out on me and leaving me to finish all of the work. For months, this is how every single work day ended. Our place of work belongs to my parents, and he had a very hard time following their rules which in turn caused huge issues between my parents and I. 

At home, we would fight all of the time. I am not a fighter, so at first I was not used to the bickering. Random things would set him off and cause him to blow up on me, taking out all of his anger at me. He would break things, punch holes in the walls/doors, throw things, slam doors, yell very loudly, block me from trying to get away from him, etc. Once I tried to drive away to get away from his crazy rage and he sat on top of my car and punched my windshield until I stopped and came back home. We have had the cops called on us because he was yelling at me so loudly while parked in a neighborhood by our house. 

To make things worse, we rent a house and have both names on the lease. We have many many animals, and everything I have spent the last 6 years building my life into is in that house. The furniture that I slowly purchased for myself, the belongings that I have slowly accumulated. The life I have built for myself is in that house. I can no longer be with him, and I know that breaking up with him will be a trigger for him to go NUTS. When he gets mad, he enters a point of no return with blind rage where he doesn't care about anything or anyone. He will break anything or anyone without thinking twice. Also, he is very strong.... I don't know anyone that would win a physical fight against him. He also loves guns, and can get a gun from the streets with a single phone call and have it delivered within a half an hour. 

He knows where my parents live. He has a key to my business van, my car, and my place of business. The person he hates most in this world is my mother, a very matriarchal figure, who is very supportive and wouldn't hesitate to save me with her life. I am absolutely petrified that if I tell him I am leaving him and I am going to stay with my mom, she will become his target. He is with me for life (wants children with me and everything) and has no idea that I am planning on leaving him. 

If he goes to prison, he is the type that will wait until he gets out to carry out his revenge because he feels justified. He has had a problem with abandonment his entire life with his dad disappearing at 5, mom putting a restraining order on him at 12, and therefore having to fend for himself. Then, every girlfriend he has had has cheated on him. 

Right now he has no car, no job, and no income. I am his everything and have provided him everything. The funny thing is that he sees our home as his. Our furniture as his. Our life as his. So nothing is mine... according to him, I am just a sheep that cannot stand up for herself. 

I am out of the area right now and haven't talked to him in days. I am thinking that I will have to tell him that while I was away, I came to seek psychological help. I will need to fabricate a story about being depressed (which isn't far from the truth, and he has seen me change from a very happy and bubbly person, to a very somber person who doesn't even smile anymore). Weeks ago, I told him that I am not well and I think I'm depressed. He just... shrugged it off. I'm thinking of telling him that I am suicidal and that I am being put on meds which will need to be heavily moderated by my parents. That my doctor told me I have to live with my parents for a few months, and that I can not have any contact with the outside world (outside of my job). My parents said I should leave him in the house with everything, pay all of the bills for a couple of months, and then tell him he will have to assume the responsibility of the cost of living in that house. They said I should say I will have to then start paying for my very expensive treatment and will not be able to support him. 

My parents told me that I should just leave him everything because my life is more important than my belongings... but now I am heartbroken because the hard work of my last six years is in there. All of my babies are in there. All of my keepsakes and memories are in there. 

How do I get out my personal belongings without him realizing that I'm never coming back? How do I play this game without him putting himself as martyr as he has done his whole life and continues to do? (He LOVES playing martyr and takes no responsibility for his actions). How do I get my cats out without him seeing it as alarming? Would it be believable if I took the things I want most and tell him that the doctor said I should have things that comfort me most around me? 

Where should I tell him? If I tell him at home, I fear he will start breaking things... and we have over 14 glass aquariums/vivariums with various animals. We have two cats and two dogs which he knows mean more to me than life itself. If I tell him in a public place, could he get arrested if he blows up on me? If he doesn't get arrested, then are we supposed to ride in my car together on our way home? What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to handle this? 
(For the record, infidelity is a non-issue in our relationship, but he is extremely possessive and jealous. He has accused me of cheating even though I have never done any such thing. I have no idea if he has, but seeing as we have spent every second together since we got together, it is highly unlikely.)

Somebody had copied my facebook profile pretty much word for word and had taken my photos and was adding all my friends. I reported it and Facebook deleted the account.

I'm not really understanding what is going on here, so maybe /r/Relationships can help me out.

We've been together for just about a year, and this behavior just started when I came home from university for break about two weeks ago. Eventually she'll slowly come out of whatever you want to call this ""mood"" and act like nothing happened. She'll occasionally make little snide comments about ""your other girlfriends"", so I guess she just assumes I'm texting other girls.

TL;DR: GF is hypocritical about phone usage around each other, usually culminating in her pretending I don't exist.

EDIT:   She has just informed me that she has a New Years resolution of ""no sex anymore because I don't feel good about it since we aren't married and I only did it before to keep you from cheating."" What in holy hell is this crap?

UPDATE:  I have just gotten home from her house. We didn't talk about this, but I did conduct an experiment. I decided that my phone would stay in my pocket the whole time. For some reason, hers never came out except when I helped her set up an Apple Store appointment. When she took it out, I didn't see any message notifications, and she didn't get any messages while we were both looking at her phone. 

Tonight was great. We talked, laughed, and cuddled. She even ended up getting rid of her silly ""resolution."" We had fantastic sex, as it always is. I'm hanging out with her family all day tomorrow.

I followed the advice (some of the advice) and told her how I stumbled across it and all that jazz. She was upset I read her ""work"" emails, but understood why I wasn't happy with what I saw. She explained that her boss is more than a boss, he's also a friend and collectively they've been through a lot together. That in the three years they've worked together they've each lost a parent (her father was estranged from her family and none of her siblings would go with her to the funeral, but he volunteered and helped her handle it) and have climbed the corporate ladder together.

She explained that it was private- the same as me asking my friend on fb what they thought of her and her reading it. So, I'm a little uncomfortable with it and their closeness in general.

I also told her it irritated me that she didn't specify business casual meant in her world. She said that a button-up would have been fine, but I wore a plaid one (a nice plaid button up, not lumber jack) and that was too casual. She also told me she was mad at me for being late, that it's important to Rob that when he hosts she is early, and on time is late, and late is very late.

We didn't deal with the big issues- babies and marriage because it's just too damned soon and went on our way being happy this week. 

Until last night, around 2 am, boss calls and says he's sick, she needs to check up on him, blah, blah. She is about to leave, I express my discomfort and she reluctantly invites me. Tells me to keep clear of him and just wait, it shouldn't be long, and she'll use my presence to avoid staying long.

We get there and he's in the front room, can't avoid him seeing me. He's in his underwear (Which I'm not happy about) and is obviously fairly sick and furious about being sick. Gf is ridiculously tender with him. rubbing his hair and telling him how they can readjust most of his meetings.

Except for one and they'll make it a phone meeting. They'll work from home tomorrow, she'll go get everything in the morning and just bring it to his place. Blah, blah. 

He makes eye contact, I'm hovering as close to the door as I can feeling for all the fucking world like I'm the interloper and almost looks smug at me. I swear to god he did.

Then he asks if they can have wonton soup for lunch and fortune cookies ""like usual"". She says of course, and then brings him to his room and fucking tucks him in (I assume) after giving him some medicine.

We leave and get into it. That's just too close for me. She needs to draw lines if she wants to keep dating me. She accuses me of just being jealous and uncomfortable. Says Rob has never made a pass at her and never will.

1319211291.0,140,self.relationships,lk04f,Husband turned into a Cross-Dresser and I love him a LOT less.  Is it cruel or kinder to be honest?,thesparksagoner,156,16,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lk04f/husband_turned_into_a_crossdresser_and_i_love_him/,"Married nearly 4 years, together close to ten.  We're 29 and 30.

I always knew he had a kinky side and we bought a lot of sex toys together.  Shortly before we got married he revealed that (sorry if too much detail!) he liked to tie himself up when I was out of the house and he would use my vibrators anally.  I kind of got past that and didn't think too much about it.  

Last year he started heavily using drugs, 4 times a week or so, and in that period he started dressing up to act out his solo fantasies.  I was a bit uncomfortable with how frequent it was getting, and that he was buying himself sexy spike heeled boots off eBay and women's clothing all the time.  In ten years, he's never once bought ME sexy lingerie!  I asked him to tone it down, or just not do it while I was in the house, as I found it weird and uncomfortable being around him dressed like that.  You can't take a man seriously as a lover when you've seen him tottering around in stripper heels, wearing fake boobs that are ridiculously oversized and make him look like a clown with balloons stuck up its sweater, and he thinks he's HAWT.

Anyway, he was unwilling or unable to keep it out of my way, and there was one day I walked in as he was putting his costume away after a masturbation session.  I backed off, but then came back a little later and he was trying on another outfit.  I guess that was the point where I realised that he can't help himself, and it's not just a masturbation prop.  He is what he is.  And I lost all desire for him from that moment.  He's stopped doing drugs but the outfits and patent leather stripper heels are here to stay.  He keeps them out of my way, mostly, but... too late, the lust vanished in an instant.  I still can't believe how fast it went.

That was nearly nine months ago.  I spent the first three months very angry, because I remember very strongly what it was like to be in a relationship with someone I worshipped and desperately wanted to shag all the time.  The loss of that element was (and is) very bitter and sometimes I couldn't stop myself lashing out; I'd snap and bitch when I found his dress-up clothes in the washing, or that he'd stolen and used some of my clothing or accessories.  By April I got over it, and I spent the summer grieving for my old passion.  Every time I heard an Adele song on the radio, or saw an old photo of him as a younger guy, it would be really hard to hold back the tears and I pretty much cried all the time I was on my own, or wrote endless Reddit posts and never submitted them.  Then I went away for a few weeks, and when I realised I never thought of him sexually at all - and when I did, had a brief mental 'ew' reaction because I will always, ALWAYS picture him in ballet boots and a pencil skirt - I realised, it's dead and gone.  Now I feel nothing.  It's not personal.  I'm just really not attracted to cross dressers, and it was a massive turn off.

Thing is, I'm still here.  He's my best friend and 10 years on, I still adore him.  When we met up after me going away he had obviously had a hard time being by himself and really, really missed me.  And to be selfish and honest, I really missed sex.  My sex drive is as high as ever, and physically, you know, it still feels good.  He just doesn't give me the spark anymore, and the part of sex that is mental and comes from being with someone you are really attracted to, rather than just the physical sensation, is flat.  So I almost never come any more, but that just makes me want sex more because I am now never satisfied.  And I'm getting it less, because he knows something is up, and he feels intense pressure to perform because I'm never satisfied!  Damn downward spiral :(

Everything else is great.  We're good friends, we bought a house a year ago and it's finally taking shape, we own three cats and have a lot of fun together.  I really don't want to bring it all crashing down, I desperately don't.  But at the same time, for myself, I'm done being upset about it and now I really want some romance and to have sex again with somebody I desire.  It's left a giant hole in my life and I miss it.

Think I should have that talk with him?  Or leave it til after Christmas?  I'm concerned that if it goes on much longer, it may all come out in alcohol one day and I won't be able to control the delivery.  Telling the love of your life that you are put off by them sexually isn't an easy conversation to have at any point.

We've been together for nearly 3 years.

Lately, she has begun to buy [pickles in jars](http://i.imgur.com/RqM6U8Q.jpg) from the supermarket. I don't mind this because I like pickles myself. But the problem is the noise she makes while eating. I understand  that pickles are crunchy, and wet and therefore sound loud when eaten...

But I suppose the problem is how I react, and how she reacts in response.

When she begins to eat them I like to leave the room. The sound really irks me; I have a problem with the sounds of eating. I do it politely, I don't say anything or do anything aggressive; I just quietly leave the room to wait until she's finished. 

But she will always yell out: ""Is my pickle-eating annoying you?""

In the past when I've said ""yes"" and explained how I will be in the other room for a few minutes, she has become angry, saying that I am rude for leaving the room.

So now I just say ""no"", because I really don't mind that she eats them (in fact I think it is kind of cute, like Snooki from Jersey Shore), it's just the sound that bothers me - I have always disliked the sounds of eating since I was a child... so saying ""no"" avoids an argument. 

We have talked about my 'sound of eating' problem. I've tried to get rid of this; but I can't. It is just that sometimes I can't stand it and I just need to leave the room. Am I being rude? Is this normal? And how can I fix this?

Lately, things were not going well. Lots of fighting, nonsensical stories, and second thoughts peppered by the good times. 

I have long had the suspicion he was cheating but being long distance all I could really do is trust what he said. I don't really believe in snooping and I don't have the funds for a PI. I recently found out, by anonymous email (seems to be a trend) that he was actually cheating with multiple people including one I had suspected in the past. No idea who the email was from, grilled all mutual friends, they swear they have no part of this and have no clue who may be responsible. 

I am heartbroken. I confront. He denies cheating but when asked specific questions such as ""So you're not even talking to other women?"", he goes radio silent. Now he has resorted to flat out ignoring me for 4 days now instead of explaining anything to me. This is triggering some weird, crazy, codependant streak in me and driving me absolutely bonkers. For some reason, I feel I NEED an explanation or apology SOMETHING! I don't understand what the hell is going on. How the hell does someone I have been so close to for 3 years do this, and then turn on me instead of even denying it? 

Further complicating things, I have a flight booked to his town next week and my 30 year old adult self is actually considering confronting him at home. I just don't know how to handle this, and I'm failing at that whole maturity thing. I am so hurt, soooo hurt. I know at my age the answers and the path should be clear, but its not. I feel powerless and betrayed and it's causing me to act in ways I don't like, but also am having a hard time controlling.

1366838674.0,142,self.relationships,1d1cnk,My mom [50] is threatening to disown me [f23] if I go on a trip that she thinks is unsafe.,guebjnjnlnppg,172,30,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d1cnk/my_mom_50_is_threatening_to_disown_me_f23_if_i_go/,"Let me start by saying that I am financially independent of my parents (working ~70 miles away from their house, living in my own apartment, paying off my student loans and car loan by myself, etc.), although I still go to them for life advice and value their opinions.

I have a very close relationship with my parents. I love them, respect them, am grateful for everything they've done for me, and recognize how lucky I am, but as I get older, it's getting harder and harder to put up with their overprotective tendencies and their emotionally manipulative ways.

Here's the situation:

My friend invited me to go to SF with her and some friends for a couple of days, just to explore and hang out. We'd be driving from LA, and we wouldn't be able to leave LA until the afternoon, which puts us in SF pretty late at night. 

Now I've never been on a multi-day road trip with my friends before because my parents have never let me, giving reasons like: young drivers are not safe drivers, the drive is too far, a group of girls shouldn't be traveling alone unless there are at least 8 of them, etc.

When I first told them about the trip, my parents seemed to think I was asking for permission. They said it's not safe for us to be driving at night for so long, so I'm not allowed to go. I had anticipated that my parents would try to pull this and had resolved that this was it: I was going to draw a line in the sand and establish that it's not up to them to make decisions for me anymore. So I told them I was going to go on the trip anyway, reassuring them that I would be careful and that I would text them periodically to let them know where I am and what I'm doing.

And then, as expected, things did not go well. My mom, who is incredibly stubborn and quick to anger, started screaming at me. She said that if I really loved her, I wouldn't be making her worry. She said that if I were a good daughter, I would have told my friend that I wouldn't go in the first place because I knew my parents wouldn't feel comfortable with the night drive. She said that she's doing this for my own benefit, for my own safety. 

I explained that I'm not *trying* to hurt her or make her worry; I just think that she's overly concerned and really, it's not her place to give permission anymore. And that's when she said it: ""If you go, don't come home! Don't call me Mom; you're not my daughter anymore! Do you understand?!""

My dad was a lot calmer during this conversation. Although I'm sure he doesn't feel the same degree of concern that my mom does about the night drive, he kept reiterating that since the trip isn't that important to me, and my mom is so concerned about it, I shouldn't go. There will be plenty of other trips in the future that I could go on. Throughout the conversation, my dad kept saying that he and my mom aren't trying to control me; gradually, as I get older and have more experience, my opinions will weigh more than their concerns.

I pointed out that this process still has to happen on their terms, and his response was, ""Yes, of course it does. You have to keep in mind that we're your parents, and it's not easy for us to just let you go to do whatever. It has to be gradual. You may look at your friends and envy their independence, but you have to remember that every family is different. There are some things that they have that we don't have, and some things that we have that they don't have.""

I don't know how to get through to them. They can't keep using their concerns as a reason to get to be behave. And when I try to go against their wishes, they can't keep screaming and making me feel guilty and small until I agree with them. Every time we have a conversation like this, I end up caving in, and I hate myself for it. I feel pathetic and embarrassed and weak, and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this self-flagellation for not being to stand up for what I want. 

This is the first time my mom has ever threatened to disown me, and it hurts so much. I know she feels like I'm the one who's doing all the hurting, but how do I make her see that? And since she's so stubborn, I feel like she would make good on her threat, never giving in until I come around begging for forgiveness.

I can't live a life without my parents; it would tear me apart inside every day. But I don't think it's right for me to keep living my life on their terms. I don't want to be unfair to them; my parents didn't pick my major, school, boyfriend, etc., although I know that they didn't 100% agree with my choices in those areas. But even for small things like going on a vacation with friends, I don't think it's up to them to decide, and they can't seem to understand that.

I otherwise have a great relationship with my parents, and that's what's at stake here. Do I want to throw it all away to prove a point? The trip itself isn't important to me; the independence is.

I guess I'm just looking for some perspective. Have any of your parents disowned or threatened to disown you because they didn't like a decision you made? How did you handle it? Did you parents come around? I hate that I have to play Chicken with my mom, and I don't know if it's worth it... I'm feeling so hurt and upset and unsure about what to do, so any input would be really appreciated. Thanks so much.

I'm not sure how much more context this will provide, but I am Asian American and grew up learning that a good, loving, grateful daughter is an obedient daughter. I recognize how ridiculous this is, but it's still really difficult to shake the mindset.

She's started her Masters' degree in September, and is very busy with school, and it pretty stressed. We live in the same city as my parents, which I'm very close with.

Her relationship with my family has always been a sore spot for us. She isn't that close with her folks, and we disagree about how much involvement they (*edit- my family) should have. I thought we'd reached a good place, but this recent fight has unnerved me.

With school, she has not been able to come out to family events. She's seen them once in the last 6 months, and missed some important milestones (grandmother's 90th, mother's birthday). I talked to her about this a few weeks ago, saying that I understood she was busy, but that I was worried about how little we've been seeing them. My folks have been asking to see her, and trying to be inclusive.

My wife mentioned she would like to spend Canadian Thanksgiving (October 8) with our mutual friends, possibly at a cottage for the weekend.  However my uncle from away, and grandmother, as well as the usual parents and cousins are all coming together for Thanksgiving this year. I feel that the family would be very hurt if we didn't go. 

We talked about it tonight. I explained I thought that not going would really hurt me and the family. She replied that Thanksgiving should be 'ours' because we spend Christmas with 'my' family. I said that we don't have to spend every Thanksgiving with them, but because we've seen them so little this year, we should. We fought for ~2 hours, and have no resolution.

I'm trying to understand her position, but I'm coming up short. Has anyone felt similarly? Does anyone have any advice?

**TL;DR Wife wants to spend Thanksgiving with friends instead of family, and it's causing a rift.**

**UPDATE:** Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to give me some advice. I was anxious and stressed out, but after reading these it has helped me understand some of the reasons for why she may be feeling this way. I'm in a much better head-space to discuss it with her tonight. Thanks reddit!

**UPDATE 2:** over 200 comments, that's much more a response than I expected! I had not idea it would be this divided, but at least it makes me feel good that I'm stressing about a complicated issue, for what that's worth. My plan is to try and approach this in a calm and supportive way, and suggest we compromise. Go to the cottage on Saturday, and come back Sunday or Monday morning (depending on out of towner's flights). Going forward, I'll propose we draw up a schedule for major holidays to try and minimize conflict. 

And for those that have been hard on my wife - she's really an amazing person. Every couple has issues that are sore spots between them. She's neither selfish nor controlling. If it seems that way it's because of the limited amount of info I've provided. 

Thanks all!

Wow. Where to start... It has been about six weeks since all of this began, and the evolution of the situation has been perplexing. About two weeks ago, we'd spoken on the phone a few times, each time with him being OVERLY nice, telling me he was going to do anything he could to help my daughter and me. Each time also resulted in the conversation ending with him in tears; I haven't been intentionally horrid to him, but I have a lot of anger and I don't try to hide it. He called again a day or two later and told me he wanted to explain his frame of mind when I had gone out to Oklahoma.

He said he doesn't know why he said or did any of the things he had done. He didn't understand it, he didn't mean any of them, and he apologized. He said that he wouldn't ask me to take him back, although at this point, his little revelation had me baffled and confused. I have moved on. I let this die, let it go and found contentment and focus in my life without him. I'm actually starting to get out there a bit again (although I must say, after being with the same man for so long, all the attention is a little overwhelming, when its not inflating my ego). 

I asked him if he wanted us to be a family. He said yes and no, which helped me to feel a little less guilty about telling him that this divorce was going to happen. I said that, thinking I needed to not let him do this to me, anything like this, ever again. He also admitted that this was about his deployment, but that he wouldn't be seeking any kind of help outside of talking to the chaplain, which helped solidify my personal justifications for going through with the divorce. I can't make him get help, and if he's refusing to do it, I will not be dragged down with him, and I certainly won't let him do it to our daughter. 

He still denies he cheated, but its kind of moot now anyway. 

I moved out of his parent's house and into my friend's place with her kids, who are like brother and sister to my daughter. Its complicated, but we're trying to make it work. I really need my own space through all of this, but I just can't afford that yet; at least I'm out of his parent's house.

When he had said all those horrible things to me in Oklahoma, every part of me was crushed. I had lost my identity, my self worth, my self image... Now that he's admitted this was an episode, and that the shit he pulled was just symptomatic, I've gained myself back. I knew he hadn't meant those things, but hearing him finally say it himself really helped me heal. 

We are trying to be amicable now. I don't really talk to him anymore, although he says he still wants to be friends. I'm trying, but I find myself chewing on my lips nearly anytime we speak, or anyone mentions the situation or asks how he's doing because I have this insatiable urge to say something passive aggressive. I don't, but I really want to.


I have a lot going on that I'm trying to keep busy with, but I find myself feeling pretty lonely at times.

Despite everything, I'm positive, optimistic and forward moving :)


**Edit** I forgot to mention that he's infuriated that I don't trust him. I tried explaining it to him (that he acted like a lunatic and had irrational behavior and lied, and that led to my trust for him being shattered), but he just doesn't get it.

And here's the follow-up: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d0782/update_my_husband_36_walked_out_on_me_33_on/

I went to the doctor and apparently I've been suffering from depression for years. Because I never knew and never got help, it's just been getting worse and worse. I've started taking anti-depressants and I'm now aware of when I'm getting angry or worked up, so I can calm myself down before it gets too bad. On the down side, I've had 3 panic attacks in the past 2 weeks, I've never had one in my life before now, and it's a new and highly unpleasant experience. The thing is, my husband came with me to the doctor, and I've been back on my own since, and she wants to see him alone because she thinks he's suffering from depression too, but he won't go. He thinks he's just unhappy.
It's been two weeks and he's rented an apartment in the village, just a few minutes walk away. He's only been in there one day now.  He came over last night and said he's not even willing to try to fix our relationship. After some discussion, though, he admitted that he does like me better the last couple of weeks, but he's not sure if I'm behaving differently because of the drugs or what. well, the medicine will apparently take about 4 weeks to work and it's just been 9 days so it's me that's changing. I've convinced him to wait before we try again, but right now I'm pretty angry with him. After 13 years I'm not willing to give up without trying, and I never thought he'd be willing to either. I've done everything in my power to make things right, and I think he's rushing into decisions, just like he rushed into moving out. 

He's been here for the kids and we're doing a lot of stuff together still (we went to Iron Man 3-it was excellent!), and he came over and entertained the kids for a couple of hours on Friday evening so I could finish my university assignment. He even proof read it for me, as usual, and he's coming over today to play Settlers of Catan, we got him the seafarers expansion pack for his birthday. We talk everyday, and text each other about everything, last night we were talking about Game of Thrones. I suppose my question is, why on earth doesn't he want to try? Is he rushing into making decisions, or trying to take the easy way out? We're still best friends so I'm just feeling very confused right now.

My wife passed away last June, and I was completely blindsided and destroyed. She was a young woman when she died and her death was not through natural causes, so it was really hard to accept. My mother moved in with me to help me take care of my babies, and she has been such a help. 

I'm embarrassed to say this looking back, but I started dating very quickly. In September, I (28m) met a young woman (24f) at a party at a friends and we had a fun conversation and exchanged numbers. That girl would become my girlfriend within 2 weeks, and we jumped into basically a serious relationship within the month. She was spending a lot of time with me and my kids, and it was kind of amazing. I don't have anything negative to say about my girlfriend, she is a saint. She is a smart, sexy, caring woman and I love her. She is an elementary school teacher and loves kids, and she has taken really well to my kids. They think she is awesome and we both have very long term out look to our relationship. 

She wants children and I knew that pretty early into our relationship. She was pretty clear that she didn't want to date for fun, and I had already had my period of banging anything that moves, so I wanted a LTR too. And she has been nothing but a great girlfriend to me so I don't want to complain or be unsupportive.

So to get to where we are now, two days ago she told me she thought she might be pregnant and she took a pregnancy test in front of me, and sure enough she is. We weren't using condoms reliably, and she wasn't on birth control so its not a complete surprise this happened. She was going to see her doctor about getting on some form of BC, but this happened. Her first reaction was a smile, and I know she wants the baby. She tried to act poker-faced in front of me, but I know how she feels. She is excited. 

I want to be excited too, but it feels like too much too soon. I'm not even a year from having my wife taken away from me and I have two very young children. I feel like I should focus on them now, before having any more children. Maybe its unfair, but I worry about her treating our baby different than my babies. I just don't feel like right now, keeping this baby is a great idea. But I also know her, and I don't think she could have an abortion. She loves kids, and has shown my children such love, and I don't think for a second she could forgive herself if she had an abortion. So we are stuck. I'm too scared to hurt her and tell her I'm not sure. She is confused by my lack of reaction, and I want to be supportive to her, but I also want to protect my kids.

1341818881.0,140,self.relationships,w9evo,My husband of almost three years cheated while I was pregnant and keeps asking me to move out... I don't know what to do.,hurtingandconfused,173,33,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w9evo/my_husband_of_almost_three_years_cheated_while_i/,"This is a throaway account, and I just really need to tell someone my story and hear your perspectives.

I am a F (24) married to a male (25) for nearly three years. We have a seven month old son and a three year old.

Here is the issue;

The hubs was deployed very shortly after we got married. He insisted on getting married before he was deployed because he said he wanted to have his wife waiting for him when he got back. About four months later, he told me that he wasn't happy with how the relationship was going and that he had made a mistake in marrying me and that he wanted a divorce. We were very stressed out by being apart so soon after being married, but he served me divorce papers shortly after that. He then called me and told me not to pay attention, that he missed me and that he felt very badly for doing that to me.
Fast forward to a year later, he was gone again after being home for R&amp;R. He ended up hurting his back and he was sent home in sick leave. He insisted on getting pregnant saying that he dreamed of having a big family. I told him I wasn't sure since we had a three year old already and our marriage wasn't really doing very well... I ended up getting pregnant by accident. At that time, he decides to move to another city that was almost two hours away from where I was living, going to college and working full time while being pregnant and taking care of a toddler. He refused to move in together, saying that I was a lazy woman and that I didn't have the same goals and visions as he did.
During that time, when I was about six months pregnant, he ended up sleeping with someone else. He told me right before we had our baby, said that he was sorry, and that it would never happen again. Our baby was born with issues that kept him in the NICU for nearly six weeks. During those six weeks, my husband rented an apartment and we moved in together with our oldest son while our baby recovered.
I was still going to school full time, but I quit my job and told him that I refused to work and go to school full time while I had two small children to care for. He got immediately pissed telling me that I was lazy, that all I wanted was to be supported by him for not doing shit. When I tried to explain how forced I was going, he flipped out, interrupted me and never even let me talk or express myself.
Recently, I found some texts and some chat conversations that he has been maintaining with several other women. It doesn't seem like he has slept with anyone again, but he did admit to making out with a couple of them. I told him that if we were to make our marriage work, we would need to seek counselling. He told me that he didn't even know if he wanted to work things out with me anymore.
He wants the house impeccably clean when he gets home from work, food in the oven, the kids clean and asleep (at 5:30), and he still expects me to work at least part time now and go to school full time. He doesn't want to spend any time with our sons. He gets pissed off when our baby cries and can't spend five minutes with him or his freaks out.
He constantly tells me that he wishes I dressed differently, did my makeup, wore lingerie... I went out and got a makeover (my friend did it for me for free), started wearing my nice clothes and went to a lingerie party and got some stuff. I wore the sexy stuff one night and while we were having sex he told me that he couldn't even get off because he was so pissed at me for being a lazy ass.
I took a break from school just for the summer so I could spend some much needed time with my boys, and he told me to move out because he wasn't going to live with someone like me that wanted nothing for her life.
He constantly puts me down, and I don't know what to do anymore. Part of me thinks that we will be able to work it out if we both go to counselling, but he keeps saying how he will go but how he hates the idea of spending the rest of his life with me. I asked for a divorce the other day, and he freaked, saying that all I wanted was to leave him and wasn't thinking of the welfare of our kids. I am so confused and so hurt.

tl;dr: husband wants me to work and go to school full time while we also have two children. I recently took a break from school for the summer and he asked me to move out. I asked for a divorce and he freaked telling me that I didn't want what was best for our kids. Cheated while I was six months pregnant.


EDIT: I've seen some comments talking about how this is a fake post, so I just wanted to clarify some things. While he was deployed, I was living with my mom because she was helping me with my oldest boy while I worked and went to school. When he came back after he got hurt, I was still with my mom, and instead of moving in together, he moved about two hours away from where I was living with my mom. We never lived on-base.

Edit 2: Before we got married he was a sweetheart. He never spoke to me in a bad way, he was always caring and understanding. We agreed that when we had kids I wanted to be a stay at home mom because I don't believe in day care. I know a lot of people opt for it, but it's not for me and my kids. Then we got married, he left like three days later and things kind of unraveled from there. 
I just am very confused about everything. I have talked to one friend about it, but my family is very close to us and I haven't talked to them about it.

EDIT 3: I should also mention, since this sounds very one sided that his dad was a total ass-hat while he was growing up. His dad cheated and did horrible things to his family, then left them. Now he makes a half a million dollars a year and doesn't help with the support of his younger siblings at all. He has some trauma because of it,and I think he's acting a lot like his dad, he just doesn't realize it. He hates his dad.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1341856978.0,,,True,t3_w9evo,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w9evo/my_husband_of_almost_three_years_cheated_while_i/,

After I confronted her, she said she felt terrible and was going to tell me eventually. Now she isn't sure she can stay in our relationship because she feels so guilty.

The thing is, and I have told her this, I am not hugely bothered. I would have preferred it if she was upfront about not being satisfied and wanting other men, but I just want her to be happy. I really care about her and I thought we could be together forever (and maybe still can). She can't seem to accept this, however, and thinks we need to break up. I suggested that we just have a more open relationship with her being completely allowed to have other men if she wants, but she didn't accept that either.

I realise it sounds like I'm just being naive and she's just using this as an excuse to leave me without feeling bad about it, but that's really not the impression I have at all. I guess maybe you have to know her, but that's not the kind of person she is at all.

-He makes her drive them everywhere
-Since she has to drive him, when he goes to hang out with his bros, she has to sit there and keep to herself until he's ready to leave.
-He is unemployed and lives with his parents
-She is not allowed to have any nights with her girlfriends.  If she doesn't want him to go out with her and her friends, it must be because she wants to cheat.
-Anytime she wants to talk about the way she is treated he brushes it off and says, ""we're fine, we dont need to talk""
-Whenever he is unsatisfied with her he openly cusses her out wherever they are, even if they're in public.

My dad went to prison a few years ago leaving my mother in a very depressed and confused state. He was the provider for the family so everything went down-hill very quickly. We lost our house and ended up moving into my aunts basement. My mother, brother, sister, and i all shared a room. 

My mom has mental issues (panic attacks, bi-polar) and is very depressed and suicidal, always. She isn't in the best physical shape either but that doesn't affect this much. 
 
7~ months ago my mom left my brother, my sister, and i on my aunt. She had met another man and didn't want to be with my father anymore. This all happened on my birthday. She leaves and won't answer the phone for anyone for 3 days. My aunt, siblings, and I all think she had committed suicide because everyone was so hurt that she cheated on my father and lied about it. We filed a missing persons report, just so if the cops did find her we would at least know she is alive. 

She finally comes home on the 4th day. She cries, says she is sorry but ends up leaving in a day or two without telling anyone a word. She wasn't living with us, her kids, for at least 3 months, she was living with her new boyfriend who cussed my brother and father and was on a lot of hardcore drugs. And when we did talk she cursed me and called me every name in the book and I sometimes cursed at her (trust me, i regret it to this day and she still throws it in my face). I got tired of living off of my aunt who already had two kids of her own, so I attempted to try and be emancipated. I had a job and was going to get a lawyer and take her and my aunt to court about it, but as soon as I mentioned it to her she would get all sad and she moved in about a month after I mentioned taking her to court over my emancipation. 

She moves in, everything is going great (so i thought). I wake up for school and I can't call my sister. I try calling my brother it doesn't work. I tell him to call my sister and it works fine. My mom had shut my phone off and not his or my sisters. Okay. I waited for her to wake up and we went at it. We almost fist fought because I was so sick of her belittling me and thinking she can run over me just because I'm her child/a minor. 

I tell her I CANNOT live with her anymore. I call my grandmother and ask her if she can come get me (she lives far away), she was at a funeral and she couldn't come get me. My dad didn't want me living with her anymore either. She had taken my laptop, which I'd bought, and threatened to take anything else if I didn't give her my phone. I wasn't going. 

We later moved on past all of this &amp; she realized she was in the wrong. 

Now, last weekend she told me she wanted to kill herself and I was the reason why. We were at my 10 year old cousins birthday party. I just sat in the car and cried for about 30 minutes. She didn't even care how bad it had hurt me. 

My mom, sister and I recently moved in with our uncle. My mom uses my sister now to buy her whatever her heart desires even though my sister is struggling with money. I recently lost my job and am stressing how I am going to pay for my half of the bills. (My mom refuses to get a job because she's ""mentally disabled"".) She gets a disability check for $754 and has at least $8,000 in credit card debt and wants me to pay majority of it. 

She gets mad if I leave the house but when I offer to take her out she says, ""no I would rather just sit at home"". She has told me that sitting at home makes her depressed because it is lonely.

She is always saying fucked up shit to my sister and I. I just don't know if I can take it anymore. 

I could find someone to live with, I am inheriting a car soon and I will have a job within two weeks. My sister goes to college in a month. I don't think I can live with just my mom and uncle.

At 23 she's already a regional sales manager at a huge company, making great money, receiving all kinds of accolades and sales awards. We've lived together for 3 years in an apartment, and recently started looking at buying a place together.


In the last 8 months or so, I've become depressed. Maybe not ""clinically depressed"", but my zest for life is gone. I am self-employed, and in my field there is an absurd amount of money to be made, but I have been doing the bare minimum (under 10hrs a week) and barely making ends meet lately. I stopped going to the gym and grew a bit of a belly. Life has been a giant bore, and I'm just going through the motions.


I have been blessed with a profession that only requires a laptop and internet to make money. Before I met my girlfriend, I wanted to travel the world and even live abroad. With her work schedule travel hasn't been an option lately, and because she works so hard she only ever wants to go to all-inclusive resorts. Somewhere she can kick up her feet, relax and not worry about anything for a week. For me, all-inclusive resorts are hell on earth. It's been 5 years since I last went on an enjoyable trip.


There are a bunch of smaller issues that come to mind too - I've always wanted to live in a highrise condo, she wants to buy an old home in an old neighborhood and fix it up. (so far I've looked at 20+ houses with her, but she refuses to look at even 1 condo) I go to weekly social events with her and her friends, and while I act friendly and cordial, I despise every minute of it. Her taste in TV shows and movies make me want to bash my brain in - honey boo boo, kardashians, etc - yet I'm usually watching them with her nightly. And on and on...


But travel is the BIG issue. I don't see her schedule freeing up anytime soon, and I can't see her supporting me traveling alone or living in another country when I could be staying put and saving for our house down-payment. 


The prospect of booking a ticket to anywhere tomorrow and setting out on my own... while I realize it's just a idealized fantasy right now, it gives me a sense of happiness that I haven't felt in a looooooong time.


...and so I'm here, asking for guidance or relevant stories / feelings to help me.

I'm currently in a 3 month relationship with a guy who's been separated for 1 year from a woman he'd been with for a total 6 years (she wanted the separation). They're very close - he considers her his best friend, they see one another regularly, and he still supports her financially (pays for outings, lunches/dinners, car insurance, helps her with rent), etc. 

Other than the wife situation, he and I get along great, we're really compatible, etc. I tried to be open minded about his relationship with his wife, but now that I realize the extent of it all, I've begun to see him as 'damaged goods' in a way - he has way too much baggage for a guy his age, and I'm too young to even think about dealing with someone who's this close to his ex.

**There are two specific scenarios that illustrate my discomfort with the relationship:**


1) We were naked and enjoying some post-coital cuddling one night while he was over my place, and  she called him crying after a fight she had with her ex boyfriend (who she's still living with/mooching off of), and asked him where he was and if he could pick her up. He offered to pick her up right away, but she brushed it off and said 'nevermind'. The fact that he would prioritize her over me shows that he's still not over her.


2) While he, his wife, his male friend, and I were at a festival this weekend, I wanted to follow him home so we could have sex afterward (I had been looking forward to sexing him up all day). He said that it'd have to be a raincheck, because his wife was sleeping over on the top bunk of his bed.

...

So, thinking the relationship was going to last a while (he said he loved me a couple months in, and I returned the sentiment), I invited him to come along to the Sundance film festival with one of my film writer friends (along with several other people). I'm really looking forward to the trip - it's usually a blast, and my friend brings me along to some really cool interviews with moviestars and such. It would suck to have relationship issues put a damper on the whole thing.

My boyfriend sunk a decent amount of money into the trip ($1000, airfare + rooming, non-refundable). We're supposed to be sharing a bed in the house. Awkward, considering that I'm thinking about breaking up with him.

I was thinking about breaking up with him tonight. For the past couple days, I've naturally been detaching/spending more time with my own friends/communicating less than normal, so he probably knows something's up.

**My question**: should I just suck it up for the next two weeks and break up with him after the vacation, or do it tonight?

**Another question**: do you think this relationship is salvageable, or can be resolved with proper communication?

**EDIT:** Is FWB is a terrible idea in this situation?

**EDIT2: I've decided to show this to him tonight** -- I'll be meeting up with him for trivia, and we'll likely hang out afterwards. You guys gave great advice, and I think he should read it.

When I told my boyfriend of almost 2 years and questioned his sexual history, he said he'd only slept with 4 women and none of them had it to his knowledge. He told me multiple times that I probably got it from someone else because I've had a lot more sexual partners than him.  I was offended by this but we worked through it.  I had to get a biopsy on my cervix, and $600 later everything seemed fine.

Fast forward to this past week. I noticed he was talking to his ex-fiancee over Facebook, and I got suspicious even though our relationship has been amazing. Tonight I was using his tablet and it happened to be logged onto his Facebook so I checked the message between him and his ex.

It was completely harmless conversation, but when I tried to exit his account I accidentally touched a different part of the screen.  This brought me to a message dated from the beginning of 2010, and the word ""HPV"" caught my eye. She send him a very lengthy message about how she was diagnosed and how horrible she felt because they had unprotected sex several times before, and he send her back a message about how it's ok and he still loves her.

Tonight I confronted him about it.  He was understandably very upset that I went through his messages, but I'm upset because not only did he know the whole time that he had HPV, he failed to tell me and made me feel like a slut by continuing to mention how I've had more partners than him.  Even tonight, he said ""You've had like 3 times as many sexual partners as me, so you could have got it from anyone.""  

It is possible that I contracted it from someone else, but even if I didn't I still would have contracted it from him.  We got in a huge fight about it, and at one point he said he blocked the information of the HPV out of his head and that's why he didn't tell me.  I told him that was complete bullshit and he agreed and said ""I'm really sorry.  That's all I can say.  I should have told you.""  Then left the room.  He is sleeping downstairs and I am currently in his room.  I guess what I'm saying is I have no idea what to do at this point because we now have trust issues with each other.

**tl;dr:  Got diagnosed with HPV last spring, boyfriend said I probably got it from someone else, I went through his Facebook messages and found out his ex-fiancee had it and he was well aware.**

EDIT: So we talked about it again yesterday. I'm so confused by the whole situation. He apologized again and told me how much he loves me and how he's afraid to lose me, and I thought everything was going to be ok. Today I woke up still confused and unsure of what to think of him.  

I'm well aware that there are multiple types of HPV and there's really no way to tell who got it from who.  The reason why I'm so upset is because he knew he had come into contact with it, and then not only failed to tell me when I was diagnosed, but made me feel like a slut. 

I guess I was acting standoffish this morning because before I was about to leave his house, he asked me what was wrong and I told him I was still upset.  He was like ""OK.  Have a good day.  Drive safe"" and rolled over to go back to sleep.

I've been obsessing over what to do for the last couple of hours, and I've decided it's not worth the stress. Even though I snooped through his Facebook, I believe I am genuinely a good person and I deserve better.

We've been dating almost a year and this has been happening during the entirety of our relationship.

In fact, one of them told him that the number she gave him is for a phone that ""her husband doesn't answer."" What the fuck? We laughed about it when he got home from work, but it does bother me because these ladies know he's in a committed relationship and he's told them so, yet they obviously don't care. It's kind of ridiculous how they're behaving.

Besides the obvious fact that my boyfriend is attractive, why do other women do this? Especially while we're out together.

We're a pretty great couple. We make each other laugh, we're attracted to each other, see is good, blah blah blah. 

We hardly argue, except for when it comes to his pet rabbit. Not too long ago, boyfriend asked me to move in with him and his roommate. I thought about it and was really liking the idea and I would love to do it when their lease is up. Right now I live with my dad and while that's okay, I'm kind of ready to do my own thing. 

I did tell him that if I were to move in, there would need to be one major change. Right now, the rabbit is allowed to hop freely around the house. He poops and pees all over. They insist that he mostly goesin his own little corner and while most of his nastiness is contained there, he inevitably gets it on the floor in the rest of the apartment as well (except for boyfriend's room because he has it blocked off). So you can't walk around in bare feet without worrying about stepping in something. 

Now, I could almost deal with poop (Ok I'm probably lying to myself there) but I can't deal with the chewing. Rabbit chews whatever the hell he wants with no consequences. I'm talking everything. Tables, chairs, shoes, wires, heating vents, blinds, couches. You name it, this mother fucker has ruined it. So basically, they can't have nice things because this stupid animal will chew it. He already almost completely went to town on my very expensive hair straightener. Now, I'm not well off by any means and can very rarely buy myself anything nice. So when one of those things is almost ruined, I get angry when boyfriend could give two shits and basically blames me. Now I have to keep everything in his room when I stay over because if rabbit chews something of mine, it's my fault for leaving it out. Yep. 

So all of this is annoying, but it is their apartment so I obviously have no say and just put up with it. However, if I'm on the the lease, I'm within my right not to have my things gets chewed and pooped on. I also will not give a dime towards a security deposit if the rabbit is just going to chew everything anyway. Not happening. I may as well take my paycheck and use it to clean the rabbit shit off of my shoes. 

Well, boyfriend says I really hurt him by basically giving him an ultimatum. I don't think there's even a question of whether or not I'm right. I'm not moving my belongings in until the rabbit either dies or is contained. Period. I just hope this doesn't put a strain on the relationship. 

I don't really have a question. Some input and general advice would be lovely.

We have had a wonderful relationship.

Last night his family hosted a party at his house for our graduation (we're both seniors graduating from college today), and all of our friends and their families were there.  It was a wonderful time, and I stayed with him afterward for some post-party sexytimes.  We both fell asleep immediately afterward.  I had to wake up extra early this morning to return to my place to shower and get ready for the ceremony today, and so I remembered that he fell asleep last night without setting an alarm.  Without wanting to wake him up, I grabbed his phone to set some alarms for him.  When I opened up his phone, I saw a picture of a girl's ass, and recognized it to be his roommate's sister (who was at the party last night).  I flipped to the next picture, and found another of another girl's ass in yoga pants, this time it was a girl I didn't know.  I started to shake violently, which consequently woke him up.  I didn't wanna say anything at first, but he kept asking me what was wrong, and I told him what I saw.  We didn't have time to talk because I had to leave to go home, so I told him this wasn't the time for this and left.

What really hurts me about this is that this isn't the first time this has happened.  I was hanging out with my boyfriend about a year ago flipping through his phone pictures with him in the room (was not snooping, he takes pics of the food he makes and I was looking at them and asking him about them) when I found similar pics of a girl in yoga pants that he took while on campus.  These were all secret photos, he didn't know the girls (apart from his roommate's sister), and he took them without them knowing.  The first time it totally broke me, I was so sad and I told him how disrespectful I felt those photos were, both to me and the other girl.  It messed up my own self-image and self-respect, and I felt conscious of my body and not good enough.  I forgave him.  But this just crosses the line for me.  I'm okay with watching porn, we watch it together sometimes.  But this second incident is too much, and it has left me more angry than sad.

What's worse, we graduate today, and our families are here.  We will be seeing each other all day, interacting and taking pictures with each other, and we might even all go to dinner together.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want to let this ruin my graduation.

I also don't know what to do when I talk to him about this.  I love him with all my heart, and I saw myself marrying him.  But if he's going to continue to break my trust like this I can't be with him.  Please, I need some help, and I don't know where else to turn.

TL;DR: found secret pics of several girls' asses (including his roommate's sister) for the second time, we both graduate today, unsure of what to do

Edit: thank you all for the responses, I'm sorry I haven't gotten around to responding to all of you. It's been a very busy and emotional day, but I am now a college graduate :) I did my best not to let this ruin my day, I spent most of my time with my lovely family. I saw my boyfriend briefly after the main ceremony, he and his family wanted to tell me congrats, but we went separate ways for the day. I told him that we needed to talk tonight, and we're going to meet up after we part from our families. While I don't plan on ending the relationship tonight (I've personally invested too much into it to end it so quickly), I do plan on telling him that he may never regain my full trust ever again, and it's going to take me some more time to decide if I still want to continue our relationship or not.

So my girlfriend and I are together since 4 years, and she is experiencing a crisis.

She told me that she didn't know what she wanted anymore, that she kinda lost herself in the way. She said that she found some sort of explanations on the internet relating ""the end of the fusion era in the couple"", meanings that we both needs to take some air and rebuild ourself in order to make the relation to work again.

For example, some of our friends just had babies, and we went to visit them, and started to talk about having one in a year or two (it was about 1/2 month ago). A couple of days ago, she said that maybe we should wait, put everything on hold, etc...

I obviously have a lot of questions in my head, but as she's lost, her favorite answer right now is ""I don't know"". I don't blame her, she is lost, but it's really frightening.

The thing is I am not in this state of mind right now. I think that time will help and it will all be ok if I let here time to think about all this, but this is really hard has it seems like she just doesn't need me right now.

First I felt like she didn't love me as much as before, but she says that it's just like she can't see the good part of our relationship/her life right now and it's all about constraint.

I think that our communication is pretty good, but I'm hella afraid of losing her, or losing the relationship we used to have. I guess relationships are to evolve, but I'm afraid of what it could become.

Some feedback from anyone who already experienced such a thing are very welcome.

I posted a while back about my brother, unsure of how to help him. I just wanted to give you guys an update. He got out of jail about two weeks after he turned himself in, and was on ankle monitor. He was doing really well, living with our grandparents. He went back to jail a few weeks later because he didn't go straight home as he was told to do so after court. My mom bailed him out of jail, and he's living with my grandparents again. He still comes over a couple times a week for coffee, and is working full time now. I make him food when he comes over and we watch Doctor Who together. I've also gathered a collection of household things for him to have when he's over at my apartment(so he can shower and shave before work when he comes to have coffee with me).

I just wanted to provide a final update and thank everyone who gave me advice and support. I'm very proud of him and the steps he is taking to improve his life. Thanks Reddit, you're awesome.

Edit: Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/WUvugIC.jpg) of my siblings and myself. First picture of the three of us for five years. So happy to be a family again.

She was the kindest, sweetest woman you will ever meet and he is the strong but protective and caring man. They were married for 36 years until she died last summer. My mom was my role model and I miss her so so much still. She was the type of woman I wanted to be and the wife I want to be someday. She told me just two years ago how she never once imagined being with anyone else and how her marriage with my dad was perfect and that I would know when its right. My parents had 6 kids of which I'm the baby. 

Since my mom passed I've become really close with my father. We were kind of distant growing up but since she died we've reconnected and its been just great. He has really stepped up and we started to have this amazing, amazing bond. We've been talking so much for the past year and he is basically one of my best friends, weird as that may be. We all were talking over Thanksgiving about our memories and with a few too many drinks in him my dad said something that was shocking. He told us (it was just me and him and one of my brothers there) that he nearly lost my mom because he had an affair and how she never forgave him. He didn't mention it again that night until I confronted him when he sobered up and he was hesitant to talk about it but eventually he told me that he had a 4.5 year affair starting about 8 years ago.... right around the time of my mom's first breast cancer diagnosis. Its gross. And he has two kids with this woman. A 7 year old and a 5 year old girls. He stopped seeing them once my mom found out about everything but now that she passed he sees those girls and that woman all the time. He wants me to meet them and meet my little half-sisters and help him tell my brothers. 

I just feel like it is too much. I'm shaking in anger and disgust. How could he? To my mother of all people. It wasn't a one time deal. He created another family. It is so fucked up :/ I have no clue what to think of him and all of this. Has anyone by any chance been through anything similar. I know its pretty unlikely but the internet is a big place and maybe, just maybe someone has some advice.... because I am LOST.

His Free Beer Club after work is destroying our marriage and I am throwing out my husband today to get in treatment or get a divorce, and will have to quit my job.",gattack,165,29,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xibyx/our_mutual_boss_married_us_sent_us_on_honeymoon/,"My husband and I have been married just over 1 year, with no kids but we just decided to start trying.  We're both in our early 30s.  Our mutual boss took a personal interest in us shortly after my husband introduced me to his co-workers when we were first dating.  I was the only 'gal pal' of the guys there who would occasionally sit and drink a beer and shoot the shit with the guys after work (this was well before I worked there).  The boss got ordained to be able to personally marry us, and fronted us $5,000 for an all-inclusive honeymoon in Jamaica.  He hands out regular cash bonuses to all the employees and puts $500 towards each employee's monthly health insurance premiums (his is a small business, he is not even required to offer health insurance in the first place), and even helped the warehouse manager buy a house.  

The boss offered me a better-paying job about 8 months into our (already rocky) marriage, which I turned down 3 times because I didn't want to work with a spouse.  I ended up accepting his offer because my former job wouldn't let me take the time off to accompany my husband for the week-long corporate convention in California (which was paid for by the boss), so I kind of felt my hand was forced. Who turns down a free vacation when there's already a better job offer on the table?? We work in different parts of the building though, so it's not really like we're working together.

In the beginning, the boss' Free Beer Club meant just having a couple and being home an hour after work was done.  We work in a wholesale warehouse and the place is full of beer drinkers, who appreciate their boss' generosity.  I had no problem with this, initially. One more reason the boss was awesome!!  Not everyone would stay either.  Once I started working there I would stay maybe once every week or two, but they smoke in the warehouse after hours and I can't tolerate indoor smoke. 

Then, the boss' marriage of 12 years must have hit a rocky place, because suddenly he never wanted to go home.  Free Beer Club turned into a 3-5 hour free-for-all, with the guys in back able to stay and drink on the boss' dime for as long as they wanted, with the boss constantly pushing 'just one more' down their throats.  And this happens *every night of the week.*

Now all the warehouse employees (my husband included) drive home well over the legal alcohol limit every night.  My husband comes from a heavily alcoholic family and had problems even before his boss entered the picture.  I never see my husband sober, and he is a douchebag when he is drunk.  We haven't had dinner together in months.  The last time I asked him to come home and have dinner with me (I love to cook and he loves my cooking) he copped an attitude and told me he could come home any time he wanted to and I couldn't tell him what to do and then called me a fucking bitch.  We were in a public restaurant at the time.

All of this is on top of us already being separated last fall for 3 months, 4 months after we married.  After we were married he started pulling all sorts of macho controlling bullshit that he had never pulled before (classic My-Spouse-Didn't-Go-Crazy-Until-After-The-Wedding syndrome), and started succumbing to drunken paranoid rages that would last for days.  I stayed at a women's shelter for 2 months, and got my own room in a house for another month before he calmed down and we worked things out.  He submitted to an alcoholic assessment while I was at the shelter and was told he should do out-patient treatment for alcoholism.  Everyone I know who has sobered up has said that out-patient programs are worthless if you really want to sober up - and they were right.  My husband tried it for a week and quit because ""it was too expensive.""  He went right back to drinking after work.  

As an alcoholic, he simply doesn't have the willpower to turn down free beer, especially from an authority figure (the boss) who has quickly become a real father figure for him.  As much as this man has and is doing for us, he is destroying the marriage he helped put together.  He is a traditional, conservative Republican (my husband had to hide from the company that he voted for Obama), and supports his Russian wife, who has never worked a day in her life and puts up with any bullshit from him because he is rich.  I feel this example creeping into my husband's idea of how marriage and being a husband is supposed to work, and it terrifies me.  The boss is never home, ignores his wife, his 8-year-old daughter, and pushes the idea that the women are just trying to take their beer away, dammit!

Fast forward to last night.  My husband didn't come home until 8:30pm, shitfaced of course.  This has become normal for him, for a long time actually.  Months ago he gave me his word he would be home by 7pm every night, but it's been a long time since he bothered. Most nights he doesn't even bother apologizing or excusing his lateness.  He picked a fight and put down my choices for how I want to give birth, refusing to read the info on the birthing center I've been looking at for a year, saying it was dumb.  Then he passed out on the couch after not even being home an hour, without helping me clean up the apartment for a friend who's staying tonight, as he promised he would.  Because he is a drunk.  Drunks cannot accomplish things even they want to accomplish.

I hit the breaking point.  I told him while he was passed out that it was officially a mistake for me to have come back to him.  I packed him a bag, leaving enough clothes to make it look normal when he woke up and put the bag in my car (I leave for work before he does, and obviously we can't carpool because he stays for hours after I do). He was already planning on staying at his co-worker buddy's house tonight (whose fiance has already left him for similar reasons), so he can crash there indefinitely as far as I'm concerned. 

I'm at work right now writing this, and at some point I am going take his keys to our apartment off he keychain somehow, leave his packed bag in his truck, and text him after I leave to check his email.  My ultimatum:  30-day inpatient treatment or your marriage.  Don't call me until you're sober.

Obviously, working at the same place makes this an awful decision.  There is only one other woman at the company, and she will fully support my decision and has the ear of the boss and can relay any message for me.  But, what should the message be?  I can't in good conscience continue to work for a company whose policies are actively eroding my marriage, especially when I am about to toss my husband out.  I may have a work-from-home option temporarily, because I handle their eBay sales and most of that I can do off-site.  But not permanently, and there is no way any of this is going to go down nicely.

I'm calm but frantic.  This is a huge decision and I need your support Reddit.  (BTW my husband, nor his whole alcoholic family, is on Reddit. He is the only member of his family who even owns books).  Should I lawyer up?  We have 1 joint account for bills which we each direct deposit half our paychecks into, which I manage completely as he is godawful with money.  I can't really afford a lawyer, and honestly I think if he were to sober up we would have a real chance at making our marriage work.  Big IF though.

**TL;DR - The title sums it up.  Otherwise awesome boss is ruining my marriage by manipulating my already alcoholic husband with free beer so he can have drinking buddies, and his conservative Republican stance on marriage is beginning to rub off on my gullible husband.**

**EDIT #1** - My idea to slip his house keys off his chain before I leave work is questionably legal and I am looking for a different way to prevent him from returning to the apartment, possibly an Order For Protection.

**EDIT #2** - I talked to an advocate at the women's shelter I stayed at, and I am now waiting to see if the Order for Protection will be granted.  I will wait until then to have any words or notices to him that he is being given the boot.  Thanks again Reddit, I'm very grateful for the support.

Some feminists may say prostitution is empowering and that I'm over reacting. A few months back my girlfriend said she wanted to bring a second girl into the relationship. When I told her I was okay with that she got extremely jealous before finally backing out saying she couldn't handle it if she came home one day to find me fucking our girlfriend. Worse, multiple times since she's said she worries I'll cheat on her since I wanted to have sex with somebody other than her. Now she's wanting to have sex with many strangers.

Girlfriend: 26, HighQualityHoney: 22, Relationship Length: 3 years;

**tl;dr: Fiancee got jealous of the girl she wanted to bring into the relationship yet now wants to be a prostitute.**

Edit 1:
Thank you all for your replies. Unless I overlooked a post not a single person has thought I should continue dating her. She promises that she won't whore herself out and swears she was just stressed out afraid of losing her job. I believe her.

What continues to bother me is that this morning it took us another hour of arguing before she apologized for last night. Instead of apologizing for arguing that she should be allowed to disrespect the sanctity of our relationship she repeatedly side-stepped the apology. She kept either changing the subject to a different part of the argument, attempting to setup a strawman argument against me, or ""apologizing"" for excuses: ""I'm sorry my job is so stressful."" I love this girl, knew she had problems going into the relationship, and she is seeing a therapist so I would feel rather amoral abandoning her. I know breaking up with her seems like such an obvious answer, but she obviously has emotional problems. Doesn't that mean she should be allowed some slack?

**e1;tl;dr: She promises she won't whore herself out yet refuses to apologize.**

Edit 2:
I guess in the end I have to decide which is greater: the pain of breaking up with my girlfriend or the probability I'd find out multiplied by the pain I'd feel if she prostituted herself plus the probability I'd catch an STD from her multiplied by the pain I'd feel if I caught an STD.

**e2;tl;dr: [Breakup Pain] vs [(probability I find out)(pain of finding out)+(probability of catching an STD *from her*)(pain of catching an STD)]**

Edit Final:
It appears *everybody* who commented was unanimously in favor of my breaking up with her. I'm not blindly following anybody's advice, but take everything people said into consideration and adjust my own views accordingly. This is far too big of a decision for me to see a few anonymous people saying ""break up with her!"" and hop on the bandwagon. Yes, it sounds like a good idea, but so did the Bay of Pigs beach invasion. The only things left to do are a lot of heavy thinking and talking things over with her then we'll see if the relationship can continue.

Relationship length: 6 months

I am an emotional person and I'd say he's more logical. He says it's for his memory since he doesn't remember things well, when I asked why he'd want to remember arguments and that they need to be let go of he said its not to remember the arguments, just the things that are said.

This morning I got mad and called him an asshole for being passive agressive (this was in person, then I left the room and we were texting a little). I realized this was wrong and I really shouldn't have said it and it's not a healthy way to fight and I apologized for it.

Just now I was looking for a picture on his phone and found screenshots of that argument. He says if I say something then clearly I mean it, when I asked if he's never said something he didn't mean when he's been mad he said he has, but he apologized right away. I explained that I apologized when I was ready, if I were to apologize right after I said if, while I was still feeling that, it would have meant nothing. I needed time to think on it and apologize when I meant it.

There were also screenshots from other little arguments we've had as well, I just don't see why you'd want to remember something bad, it almost feels like a betrayal of trust or purposely trying to get back at me for later. Sometimes he'll dwell on arguments instead of letting them go or bring up past arguments or things I've said or done that I thought we'd already worked out when another little problem comes up.

Another thing is I'm always the one to apologize. I realize a lot of times it actually is my fault, but times when its something he did too the conversation will go like

me: ""I'm sorry I said/did that""

him: ""....okay. I'm sorry you didn't like the way I responded to that""
Somehow it always comes back to being my fault.

As many of you may know, I [21F] originally wrote about the issue I had with my boyfriend [31M] of two months in the previous post. You can find that whole thing above. 

Well, while I did explain how I felt about the issue of the funeral, he said that he didn't want to subject me to the situation. So after that, I left him be about it and didn't bring it up again. I understand that he wanted to deal with this privately, especially after coming here and talking to some people. 

He went to the funeral, and he came to me afterward. We went to his apartment, and I took care of him for the rest of  the evening. He was pretty broken up, but he didn't say anything about it at first. And I didn't bring it up. But, he did on his own intermittently throughout the evening. He told me things about his friend, the things they liked to do together, and a few details about the funeral.

Pretty much, I let him talk when he wanted to and didn't pressure him into it. It seemed to make it easier for him to talk about. Mostly, I tried to keep his mind off of it with TV and movies, and a little light hearted conversation. Hopefully, it helped. I think it did at least. 

Anyway, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice and explained his mindset to me. It helped me respond to him better and comfort him far more easily.

I found an email from them that linked to his profile. I was not snooping, he was in the room with me and knew I was going in to his email to check for a confirmation. I wanted to believe it was spam, but no such luck. I asked him if he made an account, he said no, then turned so I couldn't see his face. This is his tell tale ""I'm lying"" move, so I asked him to look me in the eyes and say it again. He confessed he had, but that it was after a big fight and he was drunk and angry, and ""testing the waters"". 

At first I thought that sounded almost reasonable- we *had* had a fight the weekend he made it, though nothing big or serious, I thought. I could imagine his drunk ass making a profile as a form of mental masturbation. The problem was going to Ashley Madison and toying with cheating specifically instead of going to a regular dating site looking for attention. I couldn't shake the feeling this was very bad news, and I started to cry. He told me I was thinking too much in to it and I should just get over it. This made it worse, because he was basically expressing no remorse and starting to become very defensive. 

I cried and he talked, and everything he said made it sound worse. He said he was mad at me at the time and he was getting mad at me now because I wasn't being empathetic enough. Then he said he thought I wasn't even capable of empathy. He said it wasn't serious, he would have to pay to be able to talk to any of the women anyways. Then he said he was testing the waters- that if he cheated and didn't feel guilty, then the marriage was over, but if he did feel guilty, then we could work it out. He said he didn't want to throw our relationship out and looking to cheat would be a way for him to figure out whether he wanted to stay with me or not. 

I was blown away that he thought cheating was a viable option, blown away that he was trying to defend himself instead of simply apologizing and saying it was a mistake (he specifically said he wasn't sorry), and blown away that he just kept digging himself a deeper hole. I asked him to stop talking, that it was too raw and we both needed to organize our thoughts before discussing it, but he kept digging and digging. 

It's so hard to distill this problem- weed out the most hurtful things- I feel like I could write a novel about all of this. I guess I just want to know if it is as bad as it looks.

i.e. she thinks all truck drivers are incompetent and fears they never see her and do what they want regardless of other road users because they are large and the ""bullies of the road"" so she will get angry with me when i drive next to them... and she rules my point invalid when i say ""no babe that driver is transporting thousands, if not millions, of dollars of company property, also had to obtain a special license to drive that truck, and that is also his livelyhood, so it is in neither the companies best interest nor the truck-drivers to be irresponsible or incompetent"" but this is met with ""no i feel uncomfortable so you just need to move!!!""

though that specific scenario seems trivial it is this logic that is applied to other more serious debates/conversations and then becomes a rift between us because logic and emotion simply do not mix.

how do I work out this issue? has anyone dealt with this before? am i just a dick for using logic when she's emotional and not spewing the soft mushy bile that she simply wants to hear to feel better?

We have a great relationship, good communication, we're best friends, and we love each other deeply. We're a very happy family. My SO loves our son more than he loves me and would do anything for him.

However, we know that our son is not biologically my SO's. I dated my ex on and off since mid-2010. It was kind of a toxic relationship. He was eight years older than I was, and was verbally and emotionally hurtful. I stayed with him despite these things because I was young and stupid, and I didn't know how to get out without feeling guilty and placing all of the blame on myself.

I found out that I was pregnant in December 2011. I was completely shocked. I told my ex, and he asked me to get an abortion. I knew that I would not get an abortion. I also didn't want to raise the child with him because I didn't think he would be a very good father or partner... so we broke up. And almost a week later, I found out that he had killed himself.

I did not go to the memorial and I have not spoken to his family since before he died.

He is kind of a dick to his wife. We've heard him yell at her and scream and call her names in the background and his wife has told my wife some pretty insane stories. Obviously two sides to every story but his wife's version of events make him seem really controlling and borderline abusive.

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a5c5u/update_being_sued_by_my_f30_cheating_exbf_m30_i/)

Some of you asked for an update on this post I made about a month ago regarding an ex boyfriend who forced me to sign a contract under duress for his debts accrued and gifts given whist co-habiting, following:

1) Him being unemployed and my paying for his existence (rent, food, cash) for months and months.
2) Him walking out after I found him cheating and
3) Not paying a penny towards the remainder of the lease

The final hearing was today. I prepared substantial proof as to why the contract was signed under duress but the judge said it was just contention due to the end of the relationship. I logically argued my case for two hours but the judge wasn't really interested in anything I had to say, really. She cut me short pretty much everytime I drew breath. She said it was quite simple: I signed it and I have to suck it up. I wasn't able to even query the arbatary amount, she just decided that because the contact was ""valid"", that was the end of the matter.

The final amount is £3749 to be paid within 14 days. The judge was just impossible. I was very explicit about mental health difficulties and was armed with medical reports but I think she thought that depression and anxiety are a made up condition.

I am cross and hurt, not so much on the on the finances (although fucking ouch, I have to max out my credit card) but more on the ethical positioning. The bully won and he gets to gloat to his friends and continue to do this and believe it is ok to treat people like this.

I was so generous to this guy, I gave him so much money and he was treated me disgustingly.

I do have the right to appeal but to be honest I don't think I have the heart or energy. This has taken the wind out of my sails and I never want to see him again. I think I want to suck up the cost of my mistake. I have learned a valuable lesson about generosity, trust and signing contracts. Never ever again.

My SO (who is the most wonderful guy ever and has stuck by me and been a rock throughout) asked me this morning if now people had stopped suing me, did I fancy going engagement ring shopping over the weekend :)

I have had my hair cut, spring cleaned our house and trying to feel proud that I least I stood up to him.

Thanks for all your help reddit. If anyone knows any lawful and humorous  petty revenge tactics, inbox me :P

It is out in the open that there are issues with our sex life- he knows I don't give him enough... and I admit it. We have sex pretty much once or twice a week. The longest in our entire relationship we have gone without sex has been 2 weeks but this is not enough for him.

 I am a full-time university student and work 20 hours a week on top of my studying. I am often very busy, stressed and tired... all of which drain me of my libido.

I could just give him more sex and not be into it.. but I tried that before and it just made it so I was never horny myself, I could never build up my desire long enough to initiate. I was never enjoying sex at all and it was beginning to hurt me and I am sure him as well.

What makes it harder is that for some reason he cannot reach orgasm in a ""normal"" time frame. I know every time we start fooling around I am committing to a good hour (maybe more) of sex. Our ""quickies"", which I feel I cant ask for anymore due to the fact that I would just ask for them every single time, last upward of 45 minutes.
I get bored or tired or sore after a good hour of sex and I ultimately have to resort to role playing out his fantasies in order to end it. This happens every time. I used to love indulging him in these, even though I didn't particularly share them, but now I am beginning to resent them. It is starting to feel like all the sex we have is about him.

I love him. So much. We have an excellent rapport and we get along so great. We have been talking about marriage and children. I want to keep him. I want to make him happy.

I justify it in my head initially as being fine because technically I don't have a girlfriend and we never had a talk about being exclusive, save for her friend telling me that there were no other guys.  However as the week goes by I start to feel worse and worse and decide I should tell her, especially because I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend next month. I realize at that point that it *is* odd that we've hung out so long (4 months) and haven't really discussed where this thing was going. 

So following a Friday night date, I start talking about the future in a very pressure free way and she buries her head in her pillow and tells me she's not sure that she buys into monogamy and that her friend was wrong about there not being other guys. She assured me I was the only one she's sleeping with because she's not a slut but she had been on other dates while we've been hanging out.  She said she typically only keeps guys around for 7 months and then does the slow fade. She said she does like me and didn't want to tell me because she knows that it'll mean I won't want to hang out as much as we have been (we've been on a date or hung out literally every week since meeting), especially if I'm a believer in monogamy.  

She said If I want, she'd like to keep hanging out, going on dates and sleeping together as long as I realize that it's never going any where beyond that and we both should keep our options open. The only stipulation was that we have to be sexually exclusive. 

I pretended like it didn't bother me, agreed and acted extremely rational and shrugged it off...I mentioned that I did think we weren't dating other people but that I was actually happy to have my options open. I was lying through my teeth. To break the tension, I made a joke and she laughed, we had sex again that morning and I left. On my way home, I kind of cried a little. I know it's not manly but it kind of sucks because I started to get excited about a potential future with her. I forgot to say anything about my one night stand and now I don't even see a point in saying anything. 

We're most likely getting together this week and hanging out like normal but I'm not really sure how I feel. The whole thing is confusing. Why would someone sleep with you after being celibate for over a year, go on dates with you weekly, do little cute things for you, compliment you and basically act like they are really into you when at the end of the day they have no plans for an actual future? 

It makes me sad to think about because I had been telling all my friends about this girl and how much I liked her and now it feels foolish.  Part of me looks at this as a challenge and another part looks at it as self destruction because I know I'm going to keep hanging out with her until she decides she's done.  I normally ask her on dates each Tuesday but I don't know if I should proceed as normal or take a week off to clear my head. 

**TL;DR:**  Girl I've been seeing just broke it to me that she doesn't believe in monogamy, however she still wants to exclusively sleep with me and continue going on dates. I'm the first guy she's had sex with in 13 months, despite her going on other dates while we've been hanging out...it confuses me as to why she'd do this and many girlfriend type things and still not want a future.

[19f],momissuesthrowaway,159,28,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bt9og/my_mother_is_draining_my_finances_and_i_dont_know/,"Okay, a little background: my parents were happily married, but when my mother was 4 months pregnant with me, my father died in a construction accident. I was the first and only child for both of them. My mom never remarried, but has been in two relationships since, both ended due to emotional mistreatment of my mom. The last ended when I was 12. My father's death was ruled wrongful and the company he worked for awarded my family a very significant sum of money, when I was 8. This took a toll on my mom, and after losing at least half of the money in the stock market somewhere between 2001-2003, she fell into depression and alcoholism. She's 51 now. The rest of the money that was awarded was put away for me to access when I turned 18. 

Ever since, we have lived on social security, and when I was 16 we moved into a small mobile home owned by her brother. Two weeks before my 18th birthday, on Thanksgiving, she flipped her SUV while driving drunk. She was unhurt but the car was totaled. That day she quit drinking, and to my knowledge, hasn't drank since. She still chain-smokes, though. 

When I turned 18, the social security ended. When I turned 19, our medicaid and SNAP also went away. I'm not sure if it was renewable and she just neglected to do so, or if she was from then on unqualified without me as a minor dependent. Starting when I was 18, mom started pulling from my inheritance (meant to be used for my college tuition and cushion living expenses for me, while working) to pay bills. I bought her a used vehicle from her brother, as well.  

Today, every expense for both her and myself is paid through my inheritance money. I will begin attending a local private college in the fall, and want to move out, if my boyfriend [20, been together 4 years] and I both have steady jobs. At this point, we're still looking. We both got laid off in the winter when our retail company's branch shut down. We both have promising interviews (his is for a management position) this month, though, and are keeping an eye on our options. 

Thing is, my mom hasn't worked since 1999. She's depressed and socially anxious, and my family has done nearly all we could to help her, but it's a horse-to-water situation. She won't help herself by going to therapy, which was free, or seeing any doctors. She talks about finding a job, and has connections through friends, but won't even fill out an application. She has nothing medical holding her back from working, which I noticed when she did community service following her drunk driving accident. 

I love my mom so, so, much. It's always been the two of us. We argue terribly, especially lately, but when we have a good day, it's great, and I feel terrible for wanting to leave her. She uses this to her advantage. 

I want to move closer into the town where I'll be working and going to school, which is 35 minutes away from where I live now. I want to start a life with my boyfriend, who wants to leave his abusive family as well, and learn to respect money and live within our means as much as we can. I want my mother to be independent again, and find happiness and normality. 

I feel terrible at the thought of abandoning her. I would be a horrible daughter and would probably just be dumping her on her brother, who has medical issues and a family of his own to worry about. He used to be my confidant, but since he developed a brain tumor he is unable to give me sound advice. I have no idea what to do. I don't want to be 25 living at home as my mother's enabler, but I refuse to move out and pay rent for two homes. I fear what my family will think of me if I leave, but I feel like the only way my mom will get on her feet is if I'm no longer there as her crutches. I don't know whether I'm being strong, or being a selfish, horrible person.  

**TL;DR: My mom is a financial leech and I don't know if I should stay and pay for her to live or move out and leave her on her own. Moral dilemma.**

He doesn't smoke pot (I know you were wondering). He's a super nice guy, but he has serious social and motivational issues.

He was raised by his parents and siblings (youngest of 5) in a Vietnamese household and he was coddled all his life, so now he just sits in his room at his parent's house or on the couch watching basketball all day, every day. He never matured socially past about 14 years of age. He does not want to go to school, and his last job (Blockbuster) ended over a year ago. He doesn't want to get a new one. 

His Father and Mother are great people, but they never give him the confidence or motivation to go out and make something of his life. They just make excuses and feed/house him. They don't push him to get a job or learn a skill. He once got a job from an Uncle in electronics manufacturing (assembly line), and lost it in about a week. 

He never even learned to ride a bike and, in stead of pushing him to learn so he can go on Sunday rides with the rest of us, his siblings are buying him an adult tricycle. 

This is really none of my business, being a person who married into the family. But my family will be directly impacted when the parents eventually pass and my Wife and her siblings are stuck with this ""kid"" living at the parent's house with no place to go and no prospects.

They just won't hear any concerns about this from me. Every time I bring it up, I always ease into the subject with great concern and care, but they always make excuses like ""he's just slow"", or ""he was never pushed, so he is past the point where he can learn new things"". They don't think he's retarded, per se, but they treat him like he is. 

He is also convinced of everything they are saying. I am convinced that he is a bright ""kid"", who could have a future if he just got a pair of balls and a push out the door. I think he'd be happier, too.

What can I do to help them see that this cannot end well, and to help him out? I tried to help a few years ago by giving him an old PC with some graphics apps on it so he could learn to use them, but it gathers dust.

These people are super kind and truly a great family. I just worry about my bro-in-law. He's a good guy and deserves more.

TLDR: Brother-in-law (youngest, 30, and a truly good guy) is convinced by his family that he is incapable of learning/progress and sits around the house all day for over a decade.

I've been offered a fantastic job. It's almost unreal.

1375720062.0,127,self.relationships,1jqxgl,My cousin's husband [37M] was drunk and flirting with me [26F] should I tell her?,throwaway100100101,184,57,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jqxgl/my_cousins_husband_37m_was_drunk_and_flirting/,"I'm seriously trying to keep this as short as possible while giving all the facts so I know any responses I get are as informed as possible. 

At a very recent family party where heavy drinking occurred (party of &lt;20 finished a keg and plenty of vodka bottles), I was flying solo without my boyfriend for the evening. This was the first time I was without a man with me as a ""chaperon"", which apparently has given me invisible protection from creepers. I believe that my family has a substance abuse problem, they're all enabling each other's drinking, and they have little to no communication skills. My parents' have been divorced for &gt;17 years because of the drinking; I've been estranged from this side of the family before, I don't see them all the time, usually at parties they throw for birthdays or holidays.

My cousin, Arielle --who I love so much, and feel the closest to, and has given me very honest and tough advice when I was breaking off an engagement-- came to the party at her brother, Mike's [30M] home, with her three kids [~8M,6F,4F], husband James and her mother (who lives in the other part of a mother-daughter style home). 

Here's a brief history of their relationship/his qualities: They have been through a lot (~15 years married, dating for ~17) No one in my family likes James for the most part. We all hate the way he treats Arielle by taking advantage, not supporting her or the kids financially nor emotionally. Mostly everyone who meets him thinks he's a brilliant man, is very nice and sociable (definitely has the gift of gab); He suffers from manic-depression (or so they say), self medicates, goes out almost every night to his friends' houses. He leaves to go out when Arielle gets home from work until 1-2 am, plays softball once or twice a week and self-medicates with weed, alcohol and probably more. He's prescribed anti-depressants or anti-psychotics but I'm not sure he takes them. She works full time and is basically supporting the entire household on a salary that really can't. He works on and off, here and there, and never high paying jobs and never for a long period of time. They pay his mother to come over and watch the kids, despite him being there at the same time as he doesn't interact with his own children. If he watches the kids it's him sitting on the couch, watching TV while they also sit or play in the house. A week or two ago Arielle was complaining that they had no food in the house, nothing but potatoes in the house one night, then the next night they had nothing but pasta in the house. She was so excited to be getting paid and reported the kids said how they couldn't wait to go food shopping. This is unacceptable. James brings nothing to the table. Literally. 

In their past: ~9 years ago James cheated on her with a young woman who was a friend of his friend, who even met my cousin prior to sleeping with James. My cousin asked James to let her know: if he ever wanted to cheat on her, to let her know beforehand. Which he followed through with and told my cousin, and to which she responded by kicking him out and going through a hard break-up/separation period. James went ahead, slept with the young woman and Arielle was devastated and heartbroken. Fast forward: During a reconciliation period shortly after, she found out she was pregnant with his child. She brought him back into her home, but she has never been the same. She tells me that he killed her innocence and made her into a different person because of that affair. In total they have three kids together. She may have forgiven him but she doesn't forget. 

At this family party: I overheard James giving marital advice telling another member of my family who is recently engaged ""Marriage is so hard, we've been through the fire and back. I love Arielle more today than I ever have"". Which was so nice to hear. But a bunch of BS. 
In the late afternoon: Arielle left James at the party (which happens at almost every party), bringing her kids and mother back home. He claimed ""She begged me to stay here, can you believe that?"" No, no i can't you dick. 

By the end of the night I was one of the last 6 people there. I had previously agreed to drive James home after my cousin left, never thinking there was going to be a problem. I've known James since I was ~11 years old. I grew up around this man. I trusted him, confided in him over the years, and more or less saw him as a guy who, despite said problems, would be working hard to change his life and turn things around for himself and his family. I gave him the benefit of the doubt for all this time, thinking that if Arielle wanted to stay with him, that's her choice and she knows him better than I do. If they were staying together, that she would have good reason. Like I said, my whole family was drinking, and he was the worst. Hammered. Sloshed. A wreck. But honestly, I don't think that's an excuse. 

During the night's last beer pong match he stumbled backward into the pool, ruining his cigarettes (which he was most concerned about), his wallet and his cell phone. He didn't give a crap about the cell phone, but why would he--seeing as its my cousin who will pay for a new one, not him. He was so drunk and immediately wanted to lie about it to Arielle, claiming someone pushed him and ""That's the story I'm going with"". 

During the evening as the drunkenness progressed James began saying creeeeepy things to me. I got choked up, couldn't get it together to tell him off; I was stunned, skeeved, revolted and so shocked that he'd ever think it was okay to say inappropriate things to me, his wife's cousin. I did nothing to provoke this behavior, I assure you I was not being flirtatious in anyway. I have never seen him that way, and never will. I trusted him. He was almost an uncle-figure. Here's what he said: Followed by my response.

- ""Stop being so cute"": I didn't respond, I ignored the statement. I wasn't being cute.

- In the middle of a conversation I was having with him and two other men (My male cousin, Mike, aka HIS bro-in-law aka my cousins f*ing brother! and my cousin's friend, Carlos), he smacked my ass. The 2 other guys didn't react, so I didn't either. Tried to ignore it.

- ""My wife wants me to live my life however I wish"": I didn't respond.

- ""You've always been trouble, haven't you? You've always been too much to handle, haven't you?"" : No, I haven't. I don't know what you're talking about.

- ""There was that one time....We had our moment."" : There was no moment, I don't agree with that statement

- ""You've always been chasing after me, you've chased after me your whole life"" : No, I haven't. I don't agree with that.

- ""Where were you when I was growing up?"" : Not born yet.

- ""There's something I want to tell you, but you'd look at me differently"" (He said that about 4 times and Carlos heard it): Don't.

I approached Mike alone to tell him James was saying the most disgusting things to me and I'm incredibly uncomfortable. I'd never back out of being a DD for someone but that I don't feel comfortable being alone with him. 
Mike told me ""This is how he gets, he does it all the time. He gets drunk and hits on girls. He did it with your father's wife, Harriet, one time and was kicked out of their home. He accused Harriet of making out with him"". I told Mike that I don't want to be in that situation where accusations can be made or behavior like that will happen.
I asked if I could take Carlos with me, drop James off at home, and then bring Carlos back. To which Mike said of course, we briefed Carlos on what was going on and told James that Carlos had to go to 711 and I was bringing him. 

When we left James sat in the passenger seat and for the entire car ride James was trying every way possible to convince me to go to the closest 711, and bring Carlos right back. I repeatedly told him I was bringing him home first, then 711, then back. I claimed to be making a big circle around and that he was getting dropped off first. James didn't buy it and was none too happy, he said ""This is not how it was supposed to be"" to which I didn't respond. The remainder of the car ride was in silence. We got to his house, I didn't say goodbye as Carlos opened the door to help James out. I pretended to be busy in my purse to avoid any further contact with James and didn't notice as he came around to the driver side, knocked on my window then walked away. I brought Carlos back to Mike's house and vented the entire time. Carlos also corroborated the stories of James flirting and hitting on women and his creepiness when drinking. I've never seen James like this, I had no idea anything like this had already happened, let alone there was a strong track record of this behavior.

In my hurry to leave Mike's house I forgot my bathing suit and dishes so the next morning I went back to pick them up, and also vent about the situation and get his advice as I feel I should make Arielle aware of James' actions. Well, I asked Mike whether or not Arielle knows this goes on and he responded ""No! She doesn't know! No one wants to hurt Arielle. Its not like she's going to divorce him over this incident. She knows he's a piece of shit. They have three kids together, he lives there, they have a long history. You telling her isn't going to make anything better, just cause unnecessary drama. She will just look at him like a bigger asshole. I can only tell you I support you entirely,and understand your feelings but you're an adult and can do what you want. It will make you feel better getting it off your chest, but it won't help her any. And it's not like he would have done anything."" 
I rebutted ""I've been around creeps before, and I'm telling you, if I gave him the go-ahead, and said it would be between us, he would have taken it. And furthermore, no matter how drunk I ever got, I know I would never, ever hit on my cousin. Never. And James crossed those lines."" We left the conversation in disagreement but I thanked him for his opinion.

Obviously its harder to tell Arielle than it is to sweep it all under the rug, and pretend it's not an issue. It's what my family has apparently been doing for god knows how long. I'm upset that James has put my in this situation, and I'm devastated that I have this knowledge now. I'm sure James doesn't even care. I want to look out for my cousin first and foremost, this is why it's so upsetting. I've been hit on before, but not by a family member, and never asked to keep it a secret. 

This is all going on, for a long time, and no one in my family will tell Arielle. I think she has the right to know how her husband acts when she's not around. She should be able to make her own decision after getting the information. I don't feel like we're doing her any good keeping his secrets, my family is basically protecting him and making an environment conducive to this, how is this looking out for her? Mike advised me to confront him about what happened, give him a chance to apologize but only when Arielle isn't around. I don't wish to ever speak to him again, and being alone with him is out of the question. I will never trust him again.

Drunk or otherwise, I don't think you can use alcohol as the reason or an excuse to behave in a disgusting way. And I'm sure he'd use his drunken state as the sole reason. He'll probably even claim not to remember. Those feelings exist below the surface and I feel he's using it as a way to defend his actions. So when you're drunk you feel comfortable to say the things you think when you're sober? I can't believe he'd even consider looking at me in a sexual way. That's unacceptable to me. He's a sexual predator in my eyes now. He has shown little respect for my cousin in general, but now I see he has ZERO respect for her, our family, any social or familial boundaries and I will NEVER look at him the same. I would want to know if my husband acted like this, I wouldn't want to be in the dark with the wool pulled over my eyes. I would want and expect my family to have my back and show me that by being honest, no matter how difficult it may be for them.  I love my cousin Arielle so much, and she's given me plenty of tough advice others could not. I believe we've always had an honesty policy between us and by not telling her I'm going back on that. Am I the only one who feels this way? Would you want to know your husband acts like this on the regular? Should I tell Arielle? 

**tl;dr**: My cousin's POS husband was drunk and flirted with me, making me incredibly uncomfortable to the point that I'll never be around him again for what he said. Should I tell her so she knows the level of shithead he is?

Her husband is nice enough , and seems to get along with my husband just fine, so far so good right?, well I’ve always had my doubts about them, I always asked my husband about her and he’s sworn to me that they’ve never had anything, my husband is a good looking guy  and so is she, whenever we meet and go out the four of us there comes a moment when they will completely ignore us and it will be the two of them having a conversation, every time we meet they will go out alone at least once, to have lunch or to hang out or the movies but most of the time its drinking, at first I was angry but somehow I’ve gotten used to it, one time we were having a couple of drinks at her house and I spoke to her husband , he basically told me not to fight it and  the fact was that what ever they had we had to accept it and learn to live with it, I pressed on the issue insinuating that it wasn’t a common thing and he told me that if they had to pick between us and each other we would probably lose, I don’t know if it was the booze speaking but those words always stayed with me. 
I met my husband because he was dating some one i knew, years latter i was dating him, before I got married she told me that the reason they broke up was because she couldn't handle the relationship with his ¨best friend¨and that she asked him to choose, he didn't choose her.

Its mostly the little things that bother me, for example they have this stupid ritual that they will only watch a Quentin Tarantino movie if they’re together, recently I wanted to go see Django unchained with him and he didn’t go, when she came to town they saw it together. 

I check his phone (he doesn’t mind because he usually deletes the messages)  they  always text, most of the time its stupid things, like daily things , several times it gets personal, like she tells him when she’s having her period and stuff like that,  they always say they miss each other or that they are listening to a song which reminds them of each other ,now here´s the  part that makes me jealous whenever she’s drunk she texts him and tells him she loves him, it happens a lot, a couple of years ago when were dating we had a huge fight because she called him drunk crying, several times, let me remind you she was already married and with a kid,  a couple of nights ago we were out with my sister and her husband,  my husband left the phone on the table, so the guys could get us some drinks I knew  he was texting with her, so my curiosity took over and I checked his phone, she told him that no one could ever love him like she did, he told her that he loved her as well and missed her, I showed it to my sister and she freaked, i love him very much but i would hate it if i found out that all these years they have been involved and have been lying to everyone about it,  we´ve been married for about 5 years and dated for about 2, I’ve had male friends but nothing like this, almost all the people I have told about tell me something is going on.

tl;dr am i being paranoid? should i confront him and tell him to stop talking to her, maybe call her and talk about it?, Love is a very deep emotion, maybe they are more then friends?, this has been going on for years, and everyone knows its weird.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1360152825.0,,,True,t3_17zsya,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17zsya/im_a_34f_is_my_husband_33m_involved_with_his_best/,

Its been driving me crazy for a while now and I'm at the point that I'm feeling depressed and hopeless. I believe in honesty and being open towards each other. Cheating is one of the worst things you can do to someone.

My sister (27/f) has been in a relationship with her boyfriend (29/m) for about 5.5 years now. They've always seemed incredibly happy, aside of a little quarrel now and then. From what I could tell and what I've heard, there has never been a major issue between them for me to think they might even be close to breaking up. Her relationship with her boyfriend wasn't necessarily doing bad (no big fights or obvious wrongs) but a little spark was starting to vanish in between them.

It all started about 4 months ago when she met someone at a party and starting chatting with him online.  She started talking to me about it because I had once fallen in love with someone I started talking to online. I noticed that she kept insisting that it was nothing serious because it was 'just an online thing'. In my experience though, falling in love with someone online is as much emotionally cheating as it is falling in love with someone in real life.

Fast forward a few weeks later and they're secretly meeting up. She kept on telling me that it was a mere fling and no real emotions were attached, but her daily texting him and asking me for advice led me to believe otherwise. Eventually he ditched her (leaving her in a total emotional mess) because she didn't want to sleep with him. I had hoped that she learned from this mistake, and she went back to her boyfriend. I didn't think it was right but I was at least glad she stopped seeing the other guy. 

A few weeks later though, she's already seeing someone else. Almost the same kind of story, but this time she actually felt emotionally connected to him. BUT, this time she wasn't telling me personally, she was telling my other sister all the details, who then told me. After the first guy I had rather explicitly shown my disapproval of her actions and I assume thats the reason why she's not longer telling me anything. So my sister tells me she's been seeing this guy pretty often, and each time she said she was meeting up with her girlfriend, it was in fact this guy. 

Everyone in my family knows about this. The other day my other sister called to confirm that a friend of a friend had seen my sister with this new fling at a party, grinding each other and being very sensual towards each other. I've been wanting to confront my sister, but then I'll get my other sisters in trouble. I also feel horrible towards my sisters boyfriend for *not* telling him, but at the same time I could not, ever, betray my sister in any way. I know that I'm not doing anyone a favor by just shutting up and sitting around feeling miserable, but I feel that whatever I choose to do will end up very shitty. The thought of my sister breaking down makes me extremely upset too, even though I'm very well aware of the fact that she's been doing this to herself, and to all of us as well indirectly. We're all lying to her boyfriend, we're all pretending we don't know even though we do. BUT, we're also not telling our sister we know. 

My head is kind of in a haze now, and I have the feeling the story is very incoherent, but I'm just to the point that I don't know what to do anymore. I'm also afraid that one of the people in this story might be reading this as some of them browse Reddit on occasion, so I'm terrified of giving away too much information. However, as a frequent r/relationships visitor I know how important it is to give a good view on whats been going on in order to receive some advice.

I'll try to sum it up in a tldr.

TL;DR: Sister is cheating on boyfriend, everybody knows but nobody's saying it. I'm afraid of screwing other people over who told me whats been going on if I confront my sister, but this endless silence is killing me and I'm to the point that I don't know what to do anymore and feeling miserable about it all. 


EDIT: To everyone saying its none of my business: I agree entirely. However, due to certain living arrangements it has been impossible for me to not see and know whats going on. I am being dragged in to every little and big lie by my sister, making it feel impossible for me to ignore the obvious. 


EDIT 2: Thank you r/relationships for all the replies. I just texted my sister asking if she wants to have dinner tonight, and she replied she's free. I'm kind of nervous, I only told one of my sisters that I was going to talk to her, I didn't really ask her for permission. But its obvious, as many of you have pointed out, that waiting even longer is definitely not going to help anyone. I'm also afraid my sister will react very upset and might deny things or even blame me for her actions, I have no clue. But I don't care anymore, I'll make a small list with things to point out that I know if she throws me off guard. Thanks again for all your help and (mostly) kind words.

Alright, here goes: 
I was in an abusive relationship (physically, emotionally, sexually) for about two years.  Since then, I've received counseling (still am) and I've gotten much self worth back... Life is good.
Now, I am dating the greatest man ever, we live together, have been together 9 months, and love each other very much.  However, I still do things that make him feel like he's not being a good boyfriend, which he totally is.  I cry over little things, flinch when he goes to hug me, and obsessively worry about being cheated on even though since the day we met, he has done nothing but show me how much he values and loves me.  I feel horrible, and sometimes we talk about it and he's completely supportive and understanding of these habits.  But I know it makes him feel bad and worry.
Sorry for the vagueness but...what can I do to show him that I DO trust him and love him, despite a little bit of PTSD that comes through in my habits sometimes?

Here's my updated story after taking in your advices. 

------

I'll be honest and say I didn't want to break up with him despite that was the general consensus. Unfortunately it worked out that way regardless. I'm extremely sad right now, but I'm heading home this weekend to be with family. Hopefully it'll take my mind off of things. 

I brought the issues up in the previous thread with him and we finally talked to the bottom of it. I guess in retrospect, this was a long overdue talk. I always convinced myself, our relationship was okay but as you all told me, it wasn't. 

It came down to our relationship being too serious for him. He just wants to go out there and have his fun, after all we're in college. I told him, I wasn't going to wait around and have him come back when he needs emotional support. I'd say we ended it amiably at the time (last night). But I can slowly feel myself resenting him for dragging me along all these months. 

I just wanted to thank reddit for pushing me to have this overdue talk. As sad and resentful as I am right now, I know when I look back in a month or so it'd be for the best. It's just so bitter sweet. 

Thank you to those who shared their advice.

There's been very little contact between me and her.  It took A LOT of convincing on my part but she finally agreed to making an appointment and telling me when.  I still haven't seen her in person.  She's told me a day but hasn't confirmed the time or location.  Last I heard, she wants to go through with an abortion.  She tried to guilt me on the decision as if I was forcing it on her although I've only mentioned it as an option and have never ""forced"" it on her.  Right now, I figure there's 3 outcomes to this.  1) I go with her, the doctor says she's not pregnant and doesn't give her the abortion pill.  2) She doesn't contact me other than to say that it's been taken care of.  3) She actually is pregnant and decides to keep it at the last minute.**

**UPDATE 3: Still no word back from her (2:51 PM, 3 hours).  I'm insanely tired and am going to lie down for a little bit.  I'll check back later to see if there's any more comments.  If there's any big updates, I'll make a new post.  Thank you everyone for the advice and opinions.  I needed it.**

**UPDATE: I added a small transcript of the most recent texts between me and her.  [You can read them here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2w54/i_23m_was_told_by_fwb_18f_that_shes_pregnant_not/c6113pr)**

Quick backstory: I'm a 23 year old male that recently went through a very tough breakup.  I did what most men my age would do: I rebounded with the first attractive girl to show interest in me.  I guess the length of this ""relationship"" has been about 3 or 4 weeks.

Now I'm in the dilemma of having to deal with a pregnancy with a girl I don't have romantic feelings with.  To make matters worse, I'm not certain if I believe her.  I feel miserable about myself for thinking that but some of the things she's said and done do not add up.

She told me at about 4:30 AM, through a text message, that simply said ""I'm pregnant.  Call me.""  There's a few reasons why I'm uncertain about believing her.  Part of it is how she told me she found out and the other part is she said she's only been with me.

She says she found out because she was feeling sick yesterday so she went to the doctor and they ran blood work.  This, to me, seems strange that she was able to see a doctor so quickly and get a blood test done.

What makes me distrust her most is she has a boyfriend and hasn't been honest with me about it.  I found out on her Facebook that she was seeing a guy and calling him her boyfriend and he was calling her his girlfriend.  When I asked her who he was, she said that he was just a guy she's talking to and it wasn't anything serious.  This was actually the last time we talked before she told me she was pregnant.

The other odd thing is that I immediately talked to my older sister about it.  I am currently living with my sister and she's been nothing but supportive of me during the past few (rough) months.  FWB was pissed that I told my sister.  My sister also thinks the situation and her reactions are strange.

The advice I'm looking for is how to approach this subject.  If she really is pregnant, the last thing she needs is accusations of being dishonest about a pregnancy for attention.  At the same time, if she is being dishonest, this is the position she would want me in.

Right now I'm telling her I want to attend her next doctor's appointment.  As soon as I told her this, she said ""Ha.  What you think I'm lying?""  And now, it's been about an hour since she's texted me back and hasn't set a time for me to talk to her in person about it.

She has also said things like ""Oh, so now you care?"" to me, which just seems off.

Most of this has taken place within the past 3 hours and is a lot for me to process.  I'm trying very hard to be rational about my thoughts and I'm certain that I'm not thinking this solely because I do not want a child.

Thank you for the time it takes to read this.  I know it's not 100% coherent so if you need clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.

**tl;dr** Girl I hooked up with is telling me she's pregnant.  I'm not 100% believing her.

Ninja edit: Something that might be important to add is that we've only hooked up 3 times.  Only two of those times we've had vaginal sex, both of which times I wore a condom.  The first time was early in August, ~~maybe even late July,~~ and the second time was on the 25th.

Everyone in this story is a senior in college (about to graduate). We all work in the same tight-knit artistic industry. This is a throwaway on the off chance someone is a redditor.

One of my best friends, D, is also one of my closest artistic collaborators. We've been working together for 4 years now. Three years ago, I developed feelings for him. I told him when it was convenient (we didn't have any major projects on deck, it was summer, I was leaving the city for the summer). I kissed him and waited. He doesn't return my feelings and, at this point, never will -- he's had plenty of excellent chances. I am in love with him, but am at an okay place with it. He's one of the most important people in my life and I know I mean a great deal to him. I was 90% at peace with this.

Enter my roommate, L. She is also one of my best friends. She's one of the only people in the world who knows about my feelings for D. She's watched it rip me apart and then watched me get to a place of peace with it. She's one of the kindest, most loving, and honest people I know. She used to be part of a separate group of friends but this year I introduced her to my friends, including D, and now we're all part of the same circle.

I've noticed L and D getting close recently but didn't really think much of it. L is awesome, I though innocently, and of course D wants to be friends with her. He has a million female friends.

At a party this past weekend, L and D were both trashed. (I was buzzed but okay.) They were dancing together, sitting together with D's arm around L, etc.... I heard that they did actually make out but only from other drunk people, so unconfirmed. The owner of the apartment is another friend of mine, and as the party ended he decided to let the trashed people sleep there. I helped him move everyone to sleeping surfaces. L and D were passed out together on a couch and I willingly put them in a bed together. Nothing happened -- they slept through the night.

When we got home the next day, I, truly honestly, told L that if she's interested in D, she should go for it. He will never love me like I love him. And I want him to be happy.

Her response: ""Oh, &lt;myname&gt;, I could never do that to you.""

I joked that it's going to happen on a trip a group of us are taking together this summer to my hometown. She didn't return the joke, and I agreed that it would be kind of shitty if it happened at my house.

She insists she'd never want to hurt me like that. But that's also kind of an admission of feelings for D (if she didn't have feelings for him, she would have told me!)

I love L and I love D as friends. If D won't be with me, I actually can't think of someone better for him than L. I want to see two of my best friends happy and I think they'd be great for each other. I want to be that brave and that strong.

But today, we all had lunch together, and then another friend -- who, like most of our friends, has NO IDEA of my feelings for D -- IMed me on Facebook asking how long L and D have been dating, and when I said ""hahahaha they aren't"" joked about them eyefucking each other.... and also mentioned that they'll probably hook up on that trip we're all taking. If it hadn't been over text, I wouldn't have been able to pretend everything was okay, and funny, and sweet.

How the fuck do I deal with this. I don't want to be a jerk and stop the nascent relationship. If there was any chance I could get with D, I would have already. And if L was any less of a truly wonderful human being, I would probably want to stop it. (edit: assuming that I could.)

But how do I deal? What can I tell them, if anything?

**TL;DR unrequited love of three years and roommate want to bone each other. are holding back out of respect to me. how do i give them the okay while minimizing hurt to me.**

Instead, without saying anything, he got up and picked me up from the couch. He carried me to the bed, laid next to me and just started cuddling me... I said ""umm.. So are we gonna fight?! Because I've been preparing myself all day for this shiznit"".

He just laughed and said ""I AM sorry. So sorry. I wanted to talk about this too, but I really didn't know how to bring it up or if I should"". Sooo my heart just melted at that moment.

1370986836.0,131,self.relationships,1g5gtr,Update 2 and another question: I'm (24f) about to take custody of a friend's (30f) three kids while she enters rehab.,marshmallowsbunny,174,43,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g5gtr/update_2_and_another_question_im_24f_about_to/,"Hello again. I really don't want to rehash everything so here is a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19ol29/im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends_30f/) to how I actually got in this situation and why I took the kids.

Also [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bpttx/update_im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends/) is my second update.

Basically my friend got caught drinking and driving with her kids. To get the child endangerment chargers dropped from a felony to a misdemeanor she when into rehab. Technically she went to voluntary rehab with the understanding from the court that if she left they would keep it a felony if she did not they would reconsider. It was not technically mandated so I thought I should clear that up so the timeline makes more sense to everyone.

She did well in her program and was able to leave two weeks ago with an understanding that she was in a transitional period. She had to get urine checks, show up for therapy/class everyday, and could be retained again at any time. The court dropped the charges to misdemeanors. 

I've been living in her house and taking care of her three kids, F10, M8, M6. Now we are both at the house. I still have custody of them until Friday and was told that if I contacted the judge with concerns he would extend it until August.

I'll be blunt. Both of us being there is hard. She wants to jump right back into mother role and gets upset that the kids come to me with questions or concerns. She has never said anything in front of them, but has had choice words with me in private. The kids have mentioned a few times to me that they are afraid she will leave again. I was very reassuring at first, but 5 days out of rehab she relapsed. She got drunk in the parking lot of her child abuse classes then tried to go to class. There have been no legal repercussions for this. The leader of the class called me and I picked her up. The court didn't get dragged in.

I had some very choice words with her. I told her she had to give this shit up. I threw it in her face that her kids were depending on me since they didn't feel they could depend on her. I got harsh and a little bitter. I never threatened to keep her kids but we both know I can. We had another conversation the next day and she made positive changes such as switching to an addiction therapist in addition to the program and cutting off all contact with her ex. She's been great for the last week and a half. The kids are very slowly starting to transition back to her. Social services is checking in once a week. She's getting tested every day...

But now I'm stuck and lost. I feel selfish. I took the kids for the 90 days and now I'm tired and drained. I'm a teacher who finished the school year with 3 children who are not mine. Most of my friends vanished after the novelty wore off and the one who did make a few offers I didn't really want to call since she is not a big kid person. I want my life back. I want to go see my family 7 hours away, my boyfriend, my brother and his new wife who live on the other side of the country. They are flying in to see my parents at the end of June. They will be seven hours away, and I want to be there...

But I made a commitment to these kids. I don't know if I feel comfortable giving them back on Friday. If I keep them I risk pissing off their mom. She could cut me out of their lives when she does get custody back. She will be furious if I don't sign the papers Friday. It would be so much easier for me to. I could have my life back, but I keep wondering if they will be safe. I tried to come up with a list of things for her that would make me feel more secure giving them back, but honestly, I really don't know if there is anything that could. I don't like the idea because she has already messed up. What do I do? Do I keep them until August? Give them up Friday? I'm torn between being selfish and making sure they are really safe. I'm more tired and broken down then I've ever been in my life, but at least I know I will not be drinking while I have them in my care. Please, give me something. I love them but I just don't know what the right answer is. Sorry this is fragmented. I'm too emotional right now.

tl;dr: I legally have my friend's three kids and I'm considering not giving them back. However, I'm selfish and I want this over. What do I do? Please help me

For those who havent read: TL:DR Girlfriend of almost 3 years spending alot of time with another guy who is known to want to be with her. Recently she has been growing distant from me.

Hey everyone, thanks for the advice on my previous post. I did say that I was going to wait until after my exams before pushing it but there has been a development.

I have never read anyone else's phone before without their express permission, until this morning.

Disgusted as I am with my breach of her privacy, I couldn't stand the time they were spending together and just wanted to know if they were still using the terms of endearment that I protested to months ago.

I found a message talking about how they wanted to fuck (very descriptive).

I found a message talking about how horny he was after seeing her.

I found a message talking about how good each of them were at kissing.

I found pictures sent between them of them hugging (him hugging her from behind, hands around her belly, this is exactly the way she has told me she loves to be).

I saw a picture of a ring that he gave to her (that I never found out about).

I saw a message she sent to another friend talking about how he wasnt yet ready for a full relationship, and she was going to stay with me until she decided.

So this has validated my fears and I wont be putting up with this anymore. If there is anyone who commented on my previous post chances are you have been validated completely and you were right.

My question now is when I bring it up (which will be as soon as she is up) do I mention that I read her texts?

So when he finally decided to talk to me we started out fine talking about how we felt about the situation. It quickly turned though. He started saying how he's sick of me (when besides this I haven't done anything else). 

So it turned into a screaming match with no winners. In tears I just told him it was over, I wasn't going to put up with this whole thing anymore. He quickly apologized and tried to make me change my mind.

But I stuck to my guns and I'm single now. I'm taking it fairly well. I learned a lot from this and all your comments. Now there's many more opportunities to learn from after this and i'll enjoy being young.

1355486053.0,134,self.relationships,14u7uo,My girlfriend (28f) REFUSES to give me (29m) space when we argue and follows me around like a yippy little dog until O get fed up and leave causing our fights to go nuclear. ,MyGFIsAYippyDog,181,47,263,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14u7uo/my_girlfriend_28f_refuses_to_give_me_29m_space/,"So, like many couples, my live-in girlfriend and I, together for two years, occasionally get into arguments. Occasionally we even get mad during those arguments. 

Now I'm not a yeller, but I do have a related flaw. When I get mad, I am pretty much incapable at looking at whatever is going on objectively--especially if I'm the one in the wrong. Nothing good ever comes of me trying to talk when I'm angry. I am just not one of those people that can have a rational conversation when they're pissed off and trying to talk at that point inevitably pisses me off more because I tend to see everything my way. I recognize this character flaw about myself completely. I would wave a magic wand and rid myself of it if I could, but I honestly can't. Maybe I have too much testosterone. I don't know. 

But because of this, once I get mad, I don't want to talk until I calm down. I just don't. I'll talk and talk once I've had a bit to cool down, and I like to think I'm as logical as a Vulcan when I'm not angry. But once I'm mad? Forget it. Not happening. It's pointless.  

My girlfriend, however, steadfastly REFUSES to give me space once an argument or disagreement has reached this level. She simply will not shut up. Telling her I want to talk later does no good. She will stand there and continue to argue and argue and eventually try to goad me into responding when she becomes frustrated at my lack of response. 

As I said in the title, even if I leave the room, she will simply follow me around the house yipping at me like a little dog. It's infuriating and exhausting. She wants to talk it out immediately, and I simply can't and won't try.

So I can't talk it out immediately like she wants and I can't get any space from her to calm down a little, which only leaves one other option: I leave and go somewhere else when I can't take her yipping at me any more.  

This, without fail, sends her into full-on histrionics. She feels abandoned, she accuses me of not giving a shit, tears, etc. It takes whatever stupid thing we were fighting about and turns it up to Level 10 every time. I end up with her screaming at me as I'm leaving because I won't stay and have an unconstructive fight with her.

I have communicated all this to her. She always agrees that this is unfair and that I'm not out of line when we're calm. But when we're fighting? It's the same shit. And it's wearing me down. 

How can I get her to stop yipping at me for ten minutes when we're fighting so I can calm down and talk to her constructively and so our fights don't go nuclear every time?

Because honestly, believe it or not, everything is wonderful except for this. We just seem to REALLY not be compatible when it comes to the way we handle fights. 

**tl;dr Girlfriend tries to force us to talk it out immediately when we fight, I can't do this, she yips at me for hours, I  get fed up and leave, she goes bonkers and fights go nuclear and stupid.**

Edit: Goddamn, reddit, I am disappoint. I know r/relationships is always harder on the guys around here, but I am seriously the bad guy here because I ask for ten minutes of space during an argument so I can talk like a mature adult? Seriously? A ten minute break from an argument is too much to ask? And I'm the asshole if I have to leave because I can't take being followed around and verbally abused for hours instead? Wow, you guys. Just wow. What the fuck, man. 

Edit 2: Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's some projection and major league bias going on here. I *seriously doubt* if I was a woman complaining that my boyfriend wouldn't give me a ten minute break from an argument and then verbally abuses me for hours when I won't fight back that you guys would be insinuating that it's my fault for not staying put and trying to soothe her when I'm angry too. Yet, somehow, because I'm a dude, it's my fault and I'm not doing enough. This is bullshit you guys.

Edit 3: I want you people browbeating me and jumping through mental hoops to make me the bad guy here to stop for a moment and ask yourselves this. If I were a woman, would you seriously be sitting here arguing that my boyfriend should be allowed to FORCE me to talk when I don't want to and to verbally abuse me afterwards if I don't want to until I have to leave? No, you wouldn't. And I didn't ask for that bullshit anyway. I asked specifically how to make her stop abusing and arguing with me when I ask for space, which OUGHT to be obvious to EVERYONE here as a reasonable thing to ask--regardless of gender. But apparently some of you just want to flex that chip on your shoulders and make me somehow wrong for that. Well, I'm not.

  I told him that I wouldn't sleep with another guy. Ever. I told him if he wants to fuck another chick so bad, then just do it.
He proceeded to tell me that a chick 'wants in his pants' and I'm sitting here at the moment  dumbstruck that he would say that to me. 

Now, backstory, I have some self-esteem issues. Don't think I'm good enough, good looking enough, etc. So I'm just kind of confused why he would tell me someone wants to sleep with him.

I don't really know what the heck to do or if this is a sign that he doesn't want this relationship anymore. (I can't really tell.) He's talked about marriage, went through all that crap. And now this. 

So. Is it wrong I told him to just go do whatever? Just to get him to stop talking about it?

We have discussed marriage and kids in the near future and I couldn't be happier. But I am now plagued with some information that I'm not sure if I should share with him. 

Last weekend I went to a mutual friend's wedding out of town; he couldn't come along as he had meetings he couldn't miss. Normally I would have skipped the wedding since he couldn't come, but I had recently gotten suckered into being a bridesmaid. So I reserved my own hotel room and was looking forward to a night in some luxurious surroundings. Fast forward through the open bar at the wedding and I completely blacked out, don't remember leaving the banquet or ending up in my hotel room. 

I woke up in my hotel room completely naked (which isn't unusual because I typically sleep in the nude). I was not alone though, but in bed with one of my bf's really good friends who was also naked. I freaked out when I saw him and he explained to me that he couldn't locate his key last night and I told him he could stay in my room. This still did not explain the bed sharing and mutual nakedness though. I immediately got dressed and packed my things and all the while his friend insisted that nothing happened and there would be no need to mention to my bf that we shared a bed.

I drove home confused and frantic not knowing what to do with the situation. My bf asked how boring the wedding was and I just responded that it was alright but I was glad to be home with him. 

Do I tell him the situation that I found myself in the other morning or do I just leave it alone and dismiss it as an innocent night of just sharing a be? I am feeling so guilty right now even when I don't know that anything happened. Please somebody tell me how to handle this situation without ruining my relationship. 

***Thanks for everyone's advice; it has made me see the situation from a different viewpoint and I have realized that I definitely need to tell my bf what I remember from the evening.

Some romantic; some strictly sexual. She is still *""friends""* with almost all, some even *""best friends.""* She insists that it was just a phase (albeit 5+ years long including a serious long-term relationship) and it is not a big deal *because they are girls.*
 
Logically, I do not see the difference. Perhaps I'm too egalitarian(?), but what difference would gender play? If instead her best friends were male sexual partners I would feel as equally discomforted. Conversely, she admits that if I were best friends with my former sexual partners (women), she would be uncomfortable. But again she insists that because her friends are female it is not the same thing.
 
My hypothetical concern: In the event of a shared argument or disagreement, she may run to (the arms of) her ""best friends,"" for consoling. She agrees that this may be true. She has a natural predisposition to being overly emotionally driven (override of logical/rational reasoning). She agrees that this is also true. Now, I've seen a lot of romantic comedies (perhaps not the best litmus test of reality), but my concern is her *""friends""* could easily take advantage of her vulnerability. Taking into full consideration their previous shared sexual intimacy: 1) it indicates a previous attraction/sexualized intent/motivation on their part (as well as hers). 2) They are not a neutral party 3) She's already had sex with them!

I understand this concern screams of my personal insecurities. I understand that it is not appropriate for me to ask her to stop speaking with her bestfriends. Nonetheless, is her justification sound? As she no longer self identifies as a lesbian I should not be concerned?

She turned him down years ago (before he knew me) but they still hang out in groups/keep in touch. I'm fine with that and he told me all that before we dated, so I trusted him. Nothing suspicious ever happened in our relationship, so I never even thought that anything between them would happen and I was totally fine with them being friends. I don't believe he ever cheated on me with her.

However, about 2 weeks ago, a mutual friend of ours told me that my boyfriend would break up with me if this other girl ever wanted to be with him (my boyfriend told our friend this in person). The guy who told me this is someone I trust very much and isn't the kind of guy to stir up drama, so I believed him completely. 

I asked my boyfriend later if he would actually leave me if this other girl wanted a relationship with him. He beat around the bush for an hour or so, but finally admitted that he still had feelings for this other girl. He said that he would consider breaking up with me if she ever did want a relationship. He assured me that she turned him down and that she would never want to be with him anyway, so there's nothing for me to worry about. 

I told my boyfriend that I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who was in love with another woman. So, I broke up with him that night and disappeared so I could think more about it. 

After sitting on this awhile, I believe I made the right call. Although I really don't think he ever cheated on me, I am very hurt that he loves someone else in addition to me and he loves her so much that he would leave me in a heartbeat if she asked him to. I don't want to talk it out or deal with this in any way. 

He has been calling and texting me non-stop. I haven't answered his calls or messages. All his texts and calls are him saying things like ""She wouldn't even get with me anyway, you're over reacting, you're doing this over nothing"" etc etc... 

I'm on the fence if I should talk to him again, but my feeling is that it will turn into an emotional shit show, and all I want to do is be rational about this and start moving on. 

**MY QUESTION FOR YOU** Should I respond to his messages? Was I unfair for leaving him? Was I too rash to leave the way I did? Do you think I am overreacting? Should I set up a date to talk and hear him out? Should I work through this and take him back?  

So far, all I've done is ignore him. I also don't think I want him back, but I'm interested to see if anyone has some opinions on this situation. THis is my first real relationship and breakup.  
---

**TL;DR**: My boyfriend (ex-boyfriend) is in love with another woman and would break up with me for her. This is not okay with me, so I left him. He thinks I acted unreasonably and that I'm overreacting. 

**EDIT** Well, I'm glad he admitted to all of this so I could get the hell out of there before wasting more time with him. Bullet dodged. 

This is all so fucking ridiculous... our relationship seemed so awesome until I found this out. I've been single all my life because I was mature enough to know that I needed time to be an individual before getting involved with someone... meanwhile, this guy that I'm fucking DATING is so pathetic because he hasn't even gotten over this girl he's been crushing on and is so insecure about being single that he makes ME his goddamn back up girl for 2 years. WHELP, I'm done. I will not be contacting him. I see no reason to. 

I'm still pissed, and I ran 10 miles today... and now I feel AWESOME. 

**Fuck dating for now. I'm going to go pop on an MST3K episode and drink lots of gin and tonics.**

My wife and I have been married for 15 years. We have three beautiful children that we love very much. I also love my wife very much, although according to her I don’t do a very good job of showing it. We rarely have nights out and sex is no more than weekly. That said, I would never cheat on her or do anything in the world to hurt her.

The problem is this: From 2005-2008, my wife had an online affair with a much younger man from Australia (we are in the U.S.). While they never actually met or touched each other, they forged a strong emotional bond and spent countless hours chatting and playing World of Warcraft together. Also, all manner of sexually explicit material was exchanged. This includes pictures, videos and phone sex. I tolerated it for so many years because I love my wife and children, but it slowly killed me inside every day it continued.

About six weeks ago, it started up again. She tells me that he is one of the best friends she’s ever had, and that she missed him terribly these past 5 years. Once again, her WoW playing is cutting into our family time. She has lied to him (just like before) and tells him we are divorced because the only way he’ll be friends with her is on cyber BF/GF terms. She tells me I am being ridiculous, and they will never meet, but I am unwilling to go through this all again.

Furthermore, I think what she is doing is horribly unfair to him, since he is clearly quite smitten with her. She is lying to him about almost everything in regards to her domestic reality. Last time, he actually BOUGHT A PLANE TICKET, before she finally told him “No, you can’t come here.” Needless to say, he was as devastated as I was elated. Now she’s just doing it all over again. She says she is lonely, and I believe her, but I honestly do not know how much longer I can go on like this.

Divorce is so final, and would be my last resort, but I find myself seriously contemplating it. It is devastating to my self-esteem. I work my ass off to support my wife and kids, and she’s living in fantasy land with some Australian who is 10 years her junior. 

Is it time for me to cut my losses and get out, or am I overreacting to an entirely non-physical fantasy relationship?

**tl;dr** - Wife of 15 years has restarted a cyber-affair. Now I am at a loss. 

**EDIT** -- Thank you all for your wonderful, heartfelt, and thoughtful feedback.  I have a lot of decisions to make going forward.  For starters, I had her read this thread.  She acknowledges that what she is doing is wrong, but is reluctant to give it up.  I have given her a week to come clean with him about the fact that she's still married (although it didn't stop this idiot before), or I will tell him myself.  I hope it doesn't come to that.  Furthermore, if she hasn't ceased all contact within a month and attended counseling with me, I WILL be leaving for good.  The choice is hers.  I am not optimistic based on her history, but it's the only shot we've got.  This would be much easier if I hated her guts, or if she was being overly deceptive about it.  However, I cannot allow things to continue this way.  I am not blameless in this, and I am willing to work on my part.  But she has to be willing too.

I've got 2 jobs - full time and part time; he doesn't work (he had an injury number of years ago, but has been cleared since and is able to work). He doesn't look for work because he will have to start pretty much from the start given a huge break between jobs (over 10 years). He spends his days playing computer games, going fishing, playing soccer, etc.

When I get home from work, I am expected to cook, clean, etc - because that is ""woman's job"".

We don't sleep together - he left our bedroom 4 years ago; this also means no sex - at least none for me (although, I don't think he is cheating on me).

On top of all of that, our daughter announced that she is coming back to live with us because she can't work out what she wants to do in life. She is 24, absolutely lovely young lady, but also very indecisive; she dropped out of 3 college courses so far and decided not to work either because she doesn’t know what she wants to do for the rest of her life.

I am struggling financially and looking to get some more work; at the same time, I would really like to have some time for myself – to study, do things that I like doing. I crave physical contact and cry myself to sleep most nights (the thought of cheating on him makes me physically ill). 

I have suggested a family therapy/counselling – he refused (“real men don’t need that”).

I keep thinking how my life would me better and simpler had I lived by myself but can’t bring myself to leave – I’m worried how will he survive and what would my children say.

tl;dr – feeling used by my family but have no strength to leave – any help/suggestion is welcome

We are each others best friends, and have been lovers since the day we met in high school. 



Most of our friends are queer, and I've always known that my wife: T, was bisexual. But it just has never been an issue in our lives. We have always had a great sex life and I have never held her back from exploring her full self in any way. After many years together she told me she wanted nothing more than to be my wife; and I never planned to be anything but her devoted husband.



About 8 months ago, a new friend came into our lives. A charismatic, beautiful, successful, intelligent, laid-back, young lady: J. T and J become fast friends. I encouraged their relationship, as I could see that J was a good person and had much to add to our lives. Over the course of a couple of months, they began spending every free moment together, completely excluding me from the friendship. And soon, as I expected, T came to me emotionally wrecked to tell me that they had kissed, but that they were just friends and they were high and it was really awkward. No big deal, hugs, love, smiles, laughing, totally cool. I am not threatened in anyway by this expression of your sexuality because I truly trust you and I *know* how you feel for me. I mean, we are husband and wife now, right? This is just cute, and exciting, and nothing to be upset about.



And then sex. And drinking. And more sex. And whispers of polyamory. And drugs. And sex. And then a slow decent into despair... because of course, I knew.



Now, several months later, they are happily living together and I by myself. As if she were not married, and never liked boyz at all. She has informed her family, our friends, and me, of her knew life. I haven't told a soul. She was literally, absolutely everything to me. I existed every single day for her well being first, and then my own. Always. Every single move I have made with my life was made with her happiness first and foremost in my thoughts. She was, I am now realizing in my utter solitude, my only friend.



I kept up a friendship with her for a little while, because, well, because I am pathetic and desperate and I want her back with everything that I am. She was still telling me that she needed me in her life and that she didn't want to get a divorce, but that she just wanted to be with her... now. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that? I found out one day that she was just using me, for a ride to the store of all the banal fucking things, rather than needing to still see me, or desiring of my company, or wanting to talk. After that I broke off all contact and started drinking.



So my question? I don't know... how do I not drive my car into a wall? What the fuck do people do all day long? How do people sleep alone at night? How do I get her back? Should I get her back? Is it not wrong for me to be so hurt that she has discovered her true self and is trying to be happy? Should I talk to her? How do I not talk to her? I literally do nothing but think about her or distract myself from thinking of her; how do I handle this constant ache and obsession? How does one just, bloop, not love someone anymore? Did she ever love me? Have I really wasted the last 8 years? Is this really actually happening right now? She'll come back, right guys?



Yeah, she'll come back.



tl;dr: She left me. I've never known anything but this relationship. What the hell am I supposed to do with myself?

My health is significantly better and I lost 80 pounds since last march. The thing is, my girlfriend is a hardcore vegan. Not for moral reasons though. She does it for health reasons. She read ""The China Study"" by Campbell and watched documentaries on the vegan diet and she's convinced it's the only healthy way to eat. She also wants her kids (in this case ours if I ever go vegan) to grow up as vegan, never touching meat, dairy or eggs.

I personally am not convinced that being vegan is the only way to go. My current lifestyle is proof enough for me. But even then it's not my biggest issue with that diet. My problem is that I'm always sick when I eat vegan. Sick as in my stomach hurts all day and I have explosive diarrhea. And if I make the mistake of eating grains or beans, it's even worse. Every joint in my body will hurt and I'll feel like I've been hit with a hammer on my head. I also will feel sluggish all day and won't be able to concentrate on anything.

I'm the kind of guy who's very rational and wouldn't make a choice about his diet without dissecting the science behind it and right now it doesn't look too good for the vegan diet. Sure it's healthier than the american standard diet, but it has it's problems too.

I don't know what I should do about this. I don't like being forced into a lifestyle that I did not choose out of my own free will and that I don't believe in, let alone one that will make me sick. On the other hand though, I love my girlfriend like I never loved anyone before and I would go through hell and back again for her. I don't know why we can't both have our diets. Her sister is a vegetarian (only because she eats cheese) and her boyfriend is lactose intolerant. Yet, they have no problems.

Has anyone else ever went through a similar situation? I could really use some advice on that matter...

**TL;DR** GF is forcing me to become vegan if I want to have a future with her.

**--EDIT--** Ok I do NOT want to spark a debate between vegans and non vegans. Unless you have some advice on my situation, I don't want to hear that a vegan diet is healthy and that I should adopt it or that we're herbivores by nature or some other shit.

[Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zg146/update_underattached_gf_30_wants_me_to_give_her/)
**
I talked to her. See update thread above please.
-----------------------------
Situation:

Me [M31] - Never married, no kids, no skeletons in the closet, good education, good job, etc.

She lives in a different country 1000 km apart, but we want to change that.
 
She [F30] - 8 year old son, abused by previous asshole boyfriends, no job, living off her ex-bf's (father of her son) money, emotionally unstable.



Ok, this is my first Reddit post, so I apologize in advance if I do not follow the right Reddit-protocol.

I searched /r/AskReddit, /r/Relationships and /r/relationship_advice for similar situations, but didn't get any relief there.

This post is hard for me to write and I do not easily turn to The Internet to advice me in such personal problems, but I feel I have noone else to turn to.


My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We met online and we have visited eachother 4 times, ranging from 1 week to 3 weeks per visit.
We keep daily contact through Skype and WhatsApp.



We do want a serious relationship, and even though it's indeed just 6 months, we want to live together in her country.

This will require both of us to get a job. She would work 50% and I would work 100%.
She is reluctant to comply because she wants financial reassurance first. I will take any job I can as long as it covers the bills, and want to use my lifesavings to support us until the paychecks roll in.
She requested me to transfer money to her first, before she would take any steps into getting financially detached from her ex. (Looking for a job)



I am reluctant to fork over money, pack my bags and go immediately because she is very emotional detached. She is using anti-depressants and blames the medicine for this behaviour.
She tells me ""her heart and mind do not communicate"" and that it's hard for her to feel, well, anything.



I accepted that she is not so affectionate towards me because of the medicine and her emotional scars/trust issues, but I still would expect her to show me some sort of emotional bonding.

FYI: the sex is awesome, but she doesn't want to cuddle much otherwise. I just expect her to (want to!) sometimes hold my hand, sit close to me on the couch, that sorta thing. 
Can the anti-depressants really be blamed for lack of that behaviour?


She also seems selfish at times. I know she got spoiled by her father and ex-boyfriend, and she used to get whatever she pointed at. (she reminds me a lot of this fact btw)
I told her I will not be able to do that. I make good money, I love her and I want her to be happy, but I do not just buy anything without thinking it through.


She doesn't seem to care much about my personal needs. Example: She wakes up very late (13:00-15:00) while I wake up 09:00-10:00.

This is due to the medicine and low iron-level in her blood she says. The rest of the day then proceeds to do whatever she plans/wants to do, but she doesn't really concern herself with what I would like.
In the hours she sleeps, I walk the dog, clean up, do groceries, play with her son, make his breakfast, that sorta stuff. 


She just seems to take everything for granted. I feel like doing all these things are a huge accomplishment for me, since I have never been in a serious relationship which didn't involve 20-ish year old college girls. 
I expect some excitement and/or praise from her, especially since she told me how she always had to do everything alone. Am I wrong to expect that despite her medicines? Or is she playing the victim-card too much?


When she wants something, (small things) she expects me to just pay for it. I would be fine with it if she would ask me rather then demand it, and show some humility.
When I try to put myself in her shoes, I would be so grateful and happy with every little thing my SO would do for me, after being deprived of love and attention for so long, like she said she was.
Again, can the medicine be blamed for complete lack of this?

I bring her gifts from my country, things with emotional value and things I know she loves, and when I arrive at the airport, she waits in the car outside and acts like I just came home from daily groceries when I give her a gift.
I want to be welcomed with open arms after not seeing eachother for a month, and her being excited about me bringing her a present. Am I expecting too much?


She always hides behind the medicines for being the cause of her giving me the cold shoulder and that her son's wellbeing is her #1 priority, which is why the money issue is so important to her.


She says she loves me, she says she wants a future together, a family, everything. But her actions tell me otherwise.

I know she had a very rough life so far, and I want to be there for her and show her I would do anything for her. But should I burn all my bridges while she doesn't seem to be so much into me?


Please tell me I'm a whiny bitch, Reddit. That I should just suck it up until she stops with the medicines (spring 2013) and that her affection and love for me will grow, as long as I give her space and be there for her.


**TL;DR - GF doesn't want to give up her easy life and refuses to show me affection until I show her a better life. Love first money later? Or money first, love later.**



*Edited for format, sorry - First Reddit post.*


**Edit2:** Thank you for your responses. It means a lot to me to see how other people view this situation. I try to comment/answer as much as I can. F5-ing all the way.

**Edit3:** Your responses are harsh to read, but maybe It's the wakeup call I need. I will talk to my girlfriend soon and tell her she needs to get her shit together first before I do more. I hope I can still save this relationship. I will keep you updated.

**Update:** Just now, She kinda demanded something small. (she wanted me to call her) With regained confidence supplied by Reddit, I texted I would call her when she was home again (she is in the car atm) and she got angry with me (""How can you not care about me, this is important to me"")


I then told her I wanted to get some counselling for myself (very calmly, I didn't yell or sounded angry or anything) to help me cope with the problems we are having. I didn't tell her I already received some right here, on Reddit. She hung up on me and texted me that we are over. That I was too cheap to even call her. (She did this before and doesn't really mean it.) 


I got rather angry and told her I wanted my money back. (I have build her a new computer and loaned her money for it.)


I do not want to give in more, until she starts taking control of her own life first. I still do not know if this situation can be salvaged though.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1346931635.0,,,True,t3_ze3jq,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ze3jq/underattached_gf_30_wants_me_to_give_her_money/,

He said, ""Wow, if I had known you then I would have wanted to have sex with you."" I laughed and thought nothing of this comment; I basically interpreted it as 14-year-old him would have been attracted to 14-year-old me.

Later that evening, we were in bed talking. He started talking about the picture of me again and how hot I had looked. He then made it clear that present-day-him wanted to have sex with the middle-school-me. He was talking quite graphically about how he would want to take my virginity. His dick got hard as he was saying this. He seemed to stress that it was young, virginal *me* that he was attracted to, not young, virginal girls in general.

I was thinking about this today and am wondering: Is it normal to want to have sex with a younger version of your SO? Is this a indication that he could be attracted to pubescent/post-pubescent girls in general?

I think she might actually gone psychotic.,pabloe168,183,53,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gevjy/me20m_with_my_wife_22f_my_life_became_a_nightmare/,"**since this is so long I advice reading TL;Dr and look up to the subtitles**  Thanks for your time. 

Hi. I'm just here feeling like shit not knowing what to do afraid of going in the bedroom to grab clothes and take a shower... Tl;dr at the bottom
edit. Gotta say I can't believe how supportive people have been here. Thank you

**1. The big picture and what I think set everything off**

Honestly, and I am serious talking from my heart I don't think I have done anything to aggravate her. I am not financially irresponsible, I don't neglect her (I always make sure there is everything at home like food etc)... **The one thing I know I did wrong was have less sex and be less interested on the romance department** because I've been busy with school and I am dealing with several other issues. But I try to tell her that is going to change at the end of this month when some of my responsibilities are relieved. (I am having anxiety and panic attacks almost everyday which is why I don't feel romantic).

she took this very seriously. She built a paranoia, she thought my webcam was spying on her even though my is always off so I get home and she blocked it. She thinks I am not even attracted, she snooped in my FB, she is always mindful of everything I do.


**2. The day by day**

She is angry ALL THE TIME. She didn't go to school this summer, she failed almost all her classes. She didn't get a job nor she works.  And I don't even force her to do it. What i do is occasionally remind her of  opportunities, I don't think is healthy to sit for months on Tumblr...

 At this point I think **she is not healthy. (She even is badly underweight)** There has to be something wrong with her. All she does is destructive, this morning I woke up and she had taken off all the pictures in our apartment which broke me inside. When we argue she challenges me to make choices rather than try to settle or repair our relationship.

She doesn't have a penny but what I've given her. Yet she says she is leaving. She doesn't have a car, she doesn't have a drivers license. And yet she says she is leaving at the end of the month when none of her family or friends live in our city and her mom kicked her out of her place...

**3. my greatest concern** 

My point is that never in my life I've seen that kind of decision making. Last night I got home at 3 frustrated because something didn't work out for me. she wanted to argue but I asked her for space, because I  wasn't feeling ok. She kept for hours trying to engage in a conversation but I kept my stance, she wanted to discuss about our spat of the other day. 

She was asking ""Are we getting divorced? Are we getting divorced?"". I sighted and looked away on my computer.
Finally she said "" I'm moving out at the end of the month"". I was baffled because it is very much impossible unless she does a backpack move out.
I just said "" if that is what you want, then just tell me what is that you need"". She kept being angry. It is only when I try infinitely hard to bring her up and motivate her that things are alright...


**tl;dr**: My wife seems completely insane. She is always angry, she never gets out of the bad mood. She always makes life decisions when she is upset... I honestly believe she has become psychotic. **The one issue I pressed hardly on her** was she seeing a therapist. Turns out she never revealed anything from her to the therapist and always sidetracked her sessions. She never talked about her suicidal tendencies, her extreme jealousy, and her extreme insecurity... It was impossible for me to make her see a psychotherapist rather than a counselor.

And she now told me she wants to move out. We live in a 1 bedroom apt. I don't know how to feel since we share and breath the tiny space, but I feel like shit. Paralyzed, afraid weak.... 
She told me she is moving out but in reality she has nothing so I worry about her. I honestly believe she is not making decisions on her right mind. She has become explosive intolerant irritable... I am afraid if her choices are actually voluntary or just compulsory so I am terrified and worried for her.

She's been through a lot of health problems, meaning we have had to start trying for kids early.  We get tense around each other sometimes, but otherwise have lots of awesome times together.  We're on a break now.  I think we need to break up.

-----

So anyway, this is pretty much the biggest decision of my entire life.  For 4 years we've been together, living together for 2 and a half.  In this time we've had so many great times and really valuable memories.  We've been to Berlin and danced in the snow at Christmas, we've been to Fiji, Thailand, etc.  I love her a lot.

About 2 years ago she injured her knee by tripping over a pavement brick and it has not recovered - as a result she has been able to play netball since which she dearly misses, and she can't go to the gym and do the same sorts of things she used to, nor play tennis.  Then, 6 months later she developed terrible stomach aches and had to have surgery to remove two giant cysts on her ovaries.  Then, they discovered she also has endometriosis.  Then, 6 months later they discovered that her ovaries have a low reserve count (fewer eggs left for a woman her age).  Then, 6 months later she is rushed to hospital with a heart problem.  She has atrial fibrillation, and it could return at any time and be life threatening (or, in all likelihood, it may never recur.  But now even 5 months later I'm regularly called in to ""listen to her heart, it may be doing something funny"").

For her entire life she has known for certain that she wants to have children, and this is her primary life goal.  She is wonderful around kids and would make an excellent mother.  When she discovered her endometriosis and low ovarian reserve she was desperate to start trying for kids very soon, and I very much appreciated the gravity of the situation - her chance to achieve her main life goal/desire was closing soon.  I delayed, since I didn't think I was ready to have kids.  Some compromises and some therapy later, I saw that I did indeed see myself with kids in the future, and that we should start trying soon, because it was so important.  This was further delayed when she suffered the aforementioned heart problem, which left her at home and on strong drugs for a few weeks.  But then we started trying.

I've known that she has seriously wanted to marry me since at least March of last year (10 months ago), and she probably felt this way a good deal before then.  Her friends and family also want me to marry her, and she's waiting patiently for a ring (with occasional reminders or hints).  I have nothing against marraige, and I do see myself getting married in the future, but I haven't so far done so with her because it hasn't yet ""felt right"".

We have a lot of love in our relationship and we're able to comfort each other fairly well most of the time.  We both love cuddles in bed.  We are generous to each other and I don't think she has a mean bone in her entire body.  We basically share our lives with each other.  Occasionally we do things that annoy each other.  Gradually last year, I began to realise that I was feeling cramped by not getting enough time to myself, as she likes to be interacting with me when the two of us are together, or at least most of the time.  I was staying up later after she went to bed most nights, which she was desperately unhappy with because it disturbs her sleep if I come to bed later than her.  This came up in last year's mini-crisis where we were at therapy, and we agreed that I come to bed with her early at least 2 nights a week, and before midnight each other night.  I felt this to be a good compromise at the time.

She is incredibly outgoing and fills her social calendar with engagements.  She has a large family and large groups of friends in various parts of the state and it is not unusual for us to be away 2 or 3 weekends a month, and going out 1 or 2 nights during the week as well.  It is probably quite a bit more than I would like to go away, and she often says that she should cut down, and learn to start saying ""no"" more.

My important life goals are in the form of the pursuits I like to do on my own - work on my photography, build websites, work on video and audio, etc.  Eventually I'd like to become very good and take these skills places, but at the moment I do it outside of work hours as a hobby, and then only every now and again.  I feel as if our social engagements, the bed time I agreed to, her desire to interact with me whenever we are both home (she protests that I get plenty of time to myself when she goes out, so when she comes home I should be able to be with her), and her being unwell and with injured knee, but mostly just needing significantly less time to herself than I do, all conspire to ensure I don't get the time to spend on my pursuits, or even leisure, as I'd like.  This has caused me to very slightly resent missing out on this time.

This resentment surfaces as a slight grumpiness or shortness with her when I am doing something (expecting to have an hour or two to myself) and she needs me for something, such as a talk.  We get into arguments about how just wanting to talk to me shouldn't be such a big deal, whereas for me it means I cannot start anything or concentrate on anything.  I wish to myself she'll go to bed early so that I'll get an unbroken hour or so to myself, but so frequently I can't, or it's a night I've agreed to come to bed with her.

We have been trying to get pregnant.  The sex has been decent, even though it, as to be expected, has been a bit utilitarian since it has to be timed precisely.  Sex hasn't been much of a factor in any of our problems and it's not like we've gone for really long times without it.

This is where we get to what absolutely frightens me.  Mid-year 2012 at the time we went to counselling, I was having some doubts about the relationship.  It was a stressful time, when she wanted children and I wasn't sure I could start before I was ready.  Also, I was already seriously worrying about the ""getting enough time to myself"" thing.  This may have been building up to a mild feeling of doubt about whether I wanted her as my life partner.  At the time, I did express this to her, and discussed it at length in therapy.  And one thing I kept repeating was that I didn't think I could commit until life was more back to ""normal"".  For homework I had to go and think what ""normal"" means.  And I described it as meaning, without major dramas causing stress.  She had had a bunch of health scares, we'd had a drama with having to move twice in quick succession due to health problems at one place, and all this stress was definitely dominating our headspaces all throughout 2012.

What frightens me is that that thought, that I was having doubts about the relationship and waiting and hoping for it to return to ""normal"", has not gone away, and seems to have snowballed.  Right now, I think I really want out, and I think that it hasn't anything to do with her health problems or certain events anymore.  I think it is a feeling inside me that I've just realised is growing real.  But I feel incredible guilty.  We're not pregnant yet, and with her rapidly dwindling fertility she is in quite a lot of trouble without me because her ability to have kids, the one thing she really wants most in all of the world, is threatened.

A week ago, we had a really lovely day trip to the country for new year's day, and really, really loved it.  The night before we played board games, just the two of us, all night for new year's eve.  It was the most awesome time I have had in ages.

Then, we had a fight.  After the trip to the country, she went to bed and I settled down for a little bit of time to myself, perhaps a couple of hours, before my agreed bed time of 12 midnight.  Fifteen minutes in, she had a major panic about her friend's hen's party, how she didn't want to go.  I stayed with her and comforted her for just under half an hour (I got in a lot of trouble for actually checking on my watch), and told her I was going to go off and go back to what I was doing.  This started a massive fight, because I was prioritizing my own time over her.  We argued at length and I made my case that I still needed more time to myself, and I mentioned a one to two hours a night, on most nights (doesn't have to be every night) would probably be what I'd be really happy with.  The next day, she declared that it wasn't working for her and she wanted a trial separation - that one of us would move out for a while and we'd have a break.  She'd spoken about it with a close friend and it's what she wanted to do.  I was shocked, but had a few issues of my own and went out for a long walk to consider it.  She then got upset at the thought of us being apart and she wanted me to stay that night and maybe start the separation later.  That was awkward, and resulted in her leaving to sleep on the couch for the rest of the night at one stage.  We discussed it, and despite her obviously regretting what she had asked for and not wanting me to go, I said that I needed some time, too, so we should indeed have a break, maybe just for a week or so.

So I stayed with parents, then my aunt.  She has sent me a few long emotional emails about how wrong she was to want a separation and how she desperately wants me in her life.  And we have both been to counselling again.  So here I am.  I am afraid, but I am thinking, with say 96% certainty, that I need to break up with her now.  It will pretty much ruin her life, at least for the forseeable future.  She would recover, some day, in a way.  But not in the same way as if we'd stay together, and perhaps with the added problem of not having any way to try for children for the forseeable future (which I am really dreading).

An objective, totally impassive observer may suggest that if I am having those feelings now, it's better to break up before the kids and the marraige (that would probably happen eventually if we stay together).  I'm quite distraught at the whole thought of throwing our future life together away though.

Last time we had a crisis last year, she got out our photo albums, which she has lovingly assembled over the years, of all our happiest times together.  She had tears streaming down my face, and I knew I wanted to be with her and make everything work.  This time, even though we're on a break, she's left them out on the coffee table for me to discover when I drop by our place.  Again, tears streaming down my face right now, but not with the same resolve that I want to be with her.  Maybe it's decreased my certainty that I want to leave by a little bit.

EDIT: So the burning question in my head is: work on these problems or walk out on the woman I truly love?  And if I stay and try, how?  Thank you so much for reading all of it!

**EDIT 2**: Thank you to *everyone* who has taken the time to read this and reply.  I have to be honest, I've been fairly indifferent about this up until now, but today I'm a wreck.  I'm even going back to the counsellor again today to re-discuss everything.  I missed her a lot last night, but also I'm beginning to feel that there are things about myself I want to change, and am scared that a lot of these problems are problems with me.  I think I have an unhealthy addiction to wasting time on the internet (and yeah, in my main account I *heavily* use Reddit and it does affect my personality).  And I've flip-flopped in how I feel about being alone and having a future without her.  It's a terrible time, and right now I want to be with her (and that's being honest).  And I have to work through some stuff to know what that feeling means.

**EDIT 3**: Wow, putting something like this on Reddit can really give you an emotional kick in the balls!  A kick that I probably really needed, though.  While many have gone with ""it looks like you've decided/you know what to do, some commenters have had the balls (and what looks like, experience) to tell me that crises like this don't have to be the end of a relationship if two people both want to change and are willing to work for it, that I need to take a long hard look at myself too, like my utter shambles of time-management skills and prioritising my time.  And maybe my ""everything must be perfect"" is a form of selfishness and totally unrealistic anyway.  Anyway, stuff to work through in due course and who knows what will come of it.  I've also discovered that a couple I know broke up twice, fixed themselves, got together, had kids, loved them, and are still in love now the kids are 18 and 21.  My life isn't ruined by thoughts of breaking up and it doesn't mean I should (necessarily) run, I should fight.  Not that this isn't a big warning sign, or the biggest most important time in my entire life.  That we'll stop trying for a baby until this is better sorted kind of goes without saying - I don't think there's doubt about that.  I'm off to get both professional help AND better communicate.

Had the daughter together and we all live in the house I paid for.  I also pay 100% of everything, including spending money when she needs it.  Any money she earns if she is working typically goes to gas, cigarettes and booze.. but not necessarily in that order.

My wife doesn't contribute much at home, hasn't for years now.  She can't hold a job, can't pass a drug test, has alcohol problems, abuses me verbally when drunk, doesn't do anything around the house unless I nag repeatedly and turns the tables almost every time I try to talk about it so I end up being the one who feels bad.  She was/is being treated for depression because her alcoholic father is dying.  She will end up taking care of his funeral and junk because the rest of her family is clueless and can't be bothered to help anyway.

I've been dealing with this situation as best I can, doing whatever is required to keep things together, while my wife just sits on the couch or hangs with her peer group drinking, frequently driving home drunk.  If she has our daughter it is common for me to go out of my way to pick her up, leaving wifey behind to drink until after 11pm.  Unfortunately I can't deal with or afford this emotionally or financially anymore.  I can't function at home even though I'm fine at work, I can smile and laugh there and mean it.  But by the time I get home my shoulders sag.  Instead I get angry because I feel alone, which makes her withdraw even more.  Alone with my daughter I do not get angry, except for a few times the last couple weeks.  I'm hoping it's because stress.

Then yesterday she had sex with my best friend.  She was acting even stranger than normal so I got curious.  They did it once that day for sure, but there was possibly more.  When I confronted her first she lied, then she cried and we argued all night.  There's more to that day, but I can sum it quickly: lies and pawning our daughter off on a relative (unbeknownst to me) so she can go get drunk.

This morning I called in to work and took my daughter to school.  Told the wife to go see her friend a couple hours away for a day or two so I can think.  I even gave her cash for the trip.

It's possible this relationship can be salvaged, but I do not know if it is worth the cost to my sanity and blood pressure.  I've put up with so much bad behavior for so long that I feel broken.

First question:  I want to be honest with my little girl, but how do I tell her mommy is gone for a few days when I pick her up from school?

My wife says that if I make her leave she is going to get on a bus and disappear, leaving me to raise my daughter alone.  I'm pretty sure this is just a threat, but it targets her own child.  Should I even care?  I'm more concerned what this would do to our daughter.  My wife said to tell her that she died.  My heart broke right there.

Second question:  If my wife abandons us, how do I tell my daughter that her mommy ran away without crushing her?  She's smart, but she's only 5.

Sorry for the length, normally my best friend would help with this sort of thing, but he's helped enough already.

**TL;DR: My soon-to-be ex-wife is a coward, how can I tell my daughter mommy just left and doesn't want to see her?**

**UPDATE:**
I told my daughter that mommy is sick and had to go away for a few days.  Only response was ""I hope she has a doctor helping her.""  We had a good night, even though I only slept 5 hours Monday night and 3 hours last night.  She didn't even throw her ""I-miss-mommy fit she does at bedtime when her mom is not home.

First, thanks for everything Reddit.
    
So, he came clean about everything tonight in order to ""clear the air."" More girls, more sex, even a co-worker. Then he said it was everything and he felt relieved. I asked if he was sure it was everyone, he said yes. I asked if there was ANYONE else, and he said no. Then about 10 minutes later, he confessed another girl, later on in our relationship.
  
Ultimately, I dumped him. 

  I started tonight with the idea that maybe therapy and honesty could work, but he seems incapable of just being honest with me, or not defaulting to a lie. I'm actually not feeling too bummed - hearing about the other girls was just too hard and I do deserve better than that.

right now you are fifteen years old, and you don’t understand the concept of love and loss beyond the scope of a saddle creek records band, so let me break this down for you.  you will meet a boy on campus, a boy with long limbs and pale skin and dirty brown hair that is always in his eyes.  and you will fall hard for him- really hard- and you barely even know why you’re secretly excited to intercept him at 8 am on his way to calculus class.  and he will drive you to the grocery store and watch 80’s movies with you, and you will find yourself laughing at all his jokes because you swear he is the coolest person you’ve ever met.  then you will find yourself in your first apartment, still only sixteen years old, as this boy wraps his hands around yours and kisses you on that tiny twin-sized bed.  then you will lose your virginities to each other on that bedroom floor, listening to that generation x song that still makes your hands tremble on the steering wheel whenever you hear it years later.  and the two of you will drive everywhere in that grey jeep cherokee, during cold winter nights that fog your passenger side window and blur every street lamp.  and you will tell him you love him, and it only takes two more months for him to say he loves you too.  and you will meet his parents, they become your family, and you are welcomed with warmth and holiday cheer that will always make you feel safe.  and the two of you will belong to one another for seven long years, and you tell yourself every day that he is the one.  

and it won't matter that he’s becoming distant, that you’re growing up, that your concept of true love is slowly unraveling at the seams.  you will move closer and fight hours of traffic to work so that the two of you can fall asleep holding each other.  and he will tour the country with his band and forget to text you and never call you back.  and your parents tell you to do better, and your friends tell you he’s selfish, and your instincts tell you you’re unhappy, but you keep trying and trying and trying.  and you will watch relationships bloom and burst all around you and you tell yourself that you will be the ones to really make it.  that the two of you will get married, and all your youthful disappointments can be discarded as growing pains and shoved aside to make room for better memories.  

and then he will sit down beside you one cold november night, and tell you that he’s leaving you.  and he will lie and say there is no other girl involved, that he will still visit, that the two of you can still hang out.  and this boy- your best friend, who held your hand through seven years- will say *you have no bearing on my life*.  and you will experience a crushing, dizzying wave of pain that makes it very difficult to breathe.  and he will ask you to stop crying because it’s making it difficult for him to fall asleep.

and the next day you go to work and move your limbs like they are hardwired and automated, smiling and nodding at all the right times.  and you stop in a parking lot on your way to dinner, and finally call your mother because this pain is clawing its way up your chest and you cannot fight it back.  and when she answers, you break like a dam and the sounds that come from your mouth are barely even human.  and you are sobbing *i loved him, i loved him, i loved him for so long and he left me* until words no longer make sense and your ragged voice just becomes an animalistic keening, pitched hard for pain.  and your mother, on the other end, she cries with you because she knows the heartbreak that is coming.

and you will lie against those bathroom tiles and count them for hours between your dry heaves.  you will see couples holding hands in the streets and struggle to fight back hot waves of tears.  you will start writing an angry, pointless letter you know you will never send.  and you will only see him one last time, when he drops off a bag of the things you left behind.  he will return your apartment key- you gave him six keys to six places through the years and he never even gave you one- by dropping it into your outstretched palm.  and then you will lean hard against your bedroom window afterwards and think about falling out.  and you will function through the next few months without pause or breakdown because you know you have to.  you will remove him from your phone, your photos, your internet- you will discover every possible browser extension to keep that pain at bay.  you will see friends and go on lukewarm dates and think about crawling into your bed and never coming back out.  you will dream about him constantly and wake up feeling like someone unloaded a shotgun into your chest.  and then you will realize that the only way through the pain is the path of self-improvement.
  
and then slowly but surely- your life will become a movie montage set to upbeat tempos as you work out furiously and see a counselor and reconnect with steadfast friends who never once tell you to shut up when you find his name again and again in your mouth like a hated speech defect.  and you will eventually stop updating that angry unsent letter, feeling more and more detached every time you revisit those words.  you will stand straighter, and walk taller, and feel happier with every single minute that divides you from those memories.  and then one day you will drive home after work and realize very suddenly that your shoulders and heart feel lighter- because for the first time in seven years you are not worrying about where a relationship is going.

and over time the mental image of his face will recede into faint recognition as you redistribute him into a forgotten pile of people you used to know, making room for new friends who change your life in every possible way.  and you will push hard for the things you never had the guts to do before- you will finish your master's degree, you will quit the job you hate.  you will create unforgettable new memories, your days will flood with opportunities, and then one night you will reconnect with an old friend who invites you to his company party.

and then the two of you will find yourselves drawn inexplicably like magnets, taking road trips on whims, staying up late reading books to each other, falling in love despite all your past fears and invisible bruises.  and you will move in together, build a happy life together, and and it will be better than anything you could have ever hoped for when you were fifteen years old.

Married 4 years, and we have a soon to be 2 y/o daughter. Our relationship went mostly the backwards way from worst to good. My honeymoon phase was 2 years after the relationship. Not arguing as much and all that stuff. 
My husband has a VERY colorful past. Some of which I wish I did not know. And he did some things while with me that messed up my trust in him. 
I used to be pretty laid back, my previous relationship was with someone who was lying constantly about everything then ended up cheating. I didn't even care. But then I didn't love that person either. But I disgress.

I love my husband he's very smart and is a wonderful father. We share a lot of things in common. Sometimes it's crazy and hard to believe. We're very comfortable with each other and I believe we communicate well overall. He's also the only one that gets my sense of humor. He is also the only person I have in my life with my daughter. My side of the family is gone. 

I'm not perfect. I suffer from depression, and I get jealous! Yeah it's a nasty trait but I do the best I can to not let it affect me too often. Even if sometime it's pretty tough. 
Where my husband work is full of female co-worker. He's been working there almost a year now. And in the beginning I'll admit he bugged the crap out of me but I've cooled off since then. And my husband always tells me: ""You have nothing to worry about!"", ""I don't shit where I work"", ""I wouldn't do anything to lose you or our daughter""
He also told me one day that if he did cheat that ""I would never find out about it"" you can believe that this one didn't sit well with me at all. And absolutely did not help my trust issues with him.

Anyways, today was some birthday party we were invited to. And he introduced me to his boss ( a woman ) and there was another woman. There they seemed pretty good at ignoring each other. I asked if he knew her. He say yes but not really and I asked him who she was, and acted like he couldn't remember clearly until he blurted out her name.
Anyways she never came to say hi to him and neither did he but caught him many times looking at her. 
I heard and saw her and his boss looking at me and talking. And and overheard her talking about my daughter saying that it's good my daughter looks like him.
Then when the birthday was about over and I was getting to get home, she comes and jump around his neck to hug him and say hi and talk about life, school, saying to him ""oh I already met your wife!"". Even though we did not talk. 

So you can believe that I was super pissed off right there and then. Because he basically lied to my face acting like he didn't know her. Now this? Also I found out she's taking classes to that one college my husband is actively trying to transfer himself to. That didn't sit right with me either.

So we go home and we argued as discretely as possible because his mom is here visiting, and I'm sure she could already feel the tension. And he tells me I'm crazy and I need to see a doctor.
Since I been diagnosed with depression he always pull that one on me to shut up. ""Go see a doctor! You're crazy!""
I tried to tell him that 2 people that OBVIOUSLY know each other don't ignore each other so hard at a birthday party where there is barely anyone. And that I was upset he acted like he didn't know her.
He say he didn't want to mention her because he'll know I'd be jealous but he sure didn't mind introducing me to his female boss.
I don't know I just think all this is really off. He makes me feel like I'm insane. I been feeling sick all day with headaches that won't go away. I want to scream and cry but nothing comes out. My body feel numb. 

I don't know reddit maybe I'm looking for validation that I am indeed crazy and looking too far into it. Maybe I need a reality check? 

TL;DR: Husband acting suspicious with coworker, confront him and calls me crazy, stupid, and need a Dr :(

I am previously married with 3 kids from that marriage F[15], F[12], F[11]. Current wife and I have a M[2]. Wife is from an abusive home where her grandparents raised her. Her father was a drug addict that couldn't/wouldn't take care of her and her sisters (she is the youngest of 3). Her mother committed suicide when my wife was 6. Wife grew up with some violence and emotional abuse. Wife has taken numerous martial arts classes and could probably kick my trash. Wife has commented several times, “ You are the only guy that I know that isn't afraid of me.”

I am the oldest of 5 children and don't feel that there was much special about my childhood. Both parents are still alive and I get along with them fine. Siblings and I get along fine.

My wife and I argue a few times a month and when I feel like she is trying to cow me or just push me around verbally or just don't understand why she is emotional. I get angry and try to avoid her until I calm down. I don't like fighting or arguing and when I get angry I leave the situation if I can. Usually I go to another room of the house and try to avoid her for a while. Sometimes she is right and sometimes I am. In then end, after we are no longer angry, we usually come to some kind of agreement or disagreement and it is over.

My wife seems like she is jealous of my eldest daughter. My daughter can see the strange behavior of my wife and has avoided coming to my house for about 8 months. She finally recently came to visit for a weekend and sure enough my wife started acting strange from the moment she knew my daughter was going to arrive until she left. (By 'strange' I mean my wife is short with me and speaks to me like she is angry with me. She avoided saying anything to my eldest daughter all weekend and treated her like she wasn't there. She was quick to find fault with my eldest and came to me privately demanding to know what I was going to do to correct said ,very minor/imagined behavior.)

My wife gets along great with my other two daughters and they are close. I like this and am happy about it. But my eldest daughter, she always finds fault with and is short and angry with her. I have had to defend my eldest numerous times from my wife. I think that she may identify with my younger daughters and replay/relive her past with them and defend them from her/their older sister. Wife does not like her oldest sister and often talks about all the terrible things her oldest sister did.

This last visit, just before I was to leave to return my daughters to their mom, she confronted me again about some minor thing my eldest daughter did or said (of which I was a witness, but was nothing at all). My wife blew it way out of proportion and was demanding to know what I was going to do about it. I told her that she was being ridiculous and that there was nothing to be done. Wife got more and more angry and belligerent until I left the room and went upstairs to avoid her.

Later she confronted me again and I ignored her for a bit until I was angry enough to get up from the chair in which I sat, push her elbow with one of my hands so she was out of the doorway, then close the door with the other hand.

I heard her say something about calling the police and I ignored it because she has said outlandish things before when she is angry that she never followed through with.

After the police showed up, I knew she was serious about calling them. Needless to say it was very embarrassing speaking with the police on my front lawn and having them ask if I assaulted my wife. I am quite angry with her blowing it out of proportion and getting the police involved. Of course the police treated me like I was some kind of wife-beating scum-bag and that didn't elevate my feelings in the least.

Let me reinforce that I have never hurt or had a desire to hurt my wife or anyone else for that matter. Violence just isn't in my nature and I don't look for it, desire it, or even think about it.

I told the police that I didn't push her or break anything else (not sure why they asked about anything being broken). And after a while the police left (while making sure I knew that I was lucky I wasn't being arrested).

As I was returning to the house to let my daughters know that we could now leave, my wife smugly says to me, ""Are you going to apologize now.""

I quietly said, ""Fuck you."" (Yes, I was angry and embarrassed)

I then took my daughters to meet their mom. After I returned home I told my wife that I could no longer trust her and that I didn't want to be married to her anymore. I felt that way at the time and I still feel some remnants of that now, but I am not sure that I want to truly end it.

I have not spoken to her in a few days (or even seen her, for I stay late at work and get up after she has left for work). I didn't ""assault"" her...I just wanted to avoid her until she calmed down about my daughter. I DO want her to know that her behavior is not acceptable and that getting law enforcement involved in an embellishment is not going to cow me into submission.

What does reddit think I should do in this situation? Get divorced? Advice on her attitude towards my daughter? Stay and work it out? Punish her in some way to let her know that her behavior won't work?

During that time, and much to her delight, I spend a lot of time down in her nethers making her happy.  The frequency is basically every time she comes over, whether she stays the night or not.  However, there has been no sex yet in the relationship, and her average with oral sex and other methods is pretty low...I think I've had two orgasms to a great number of hers.  

I have, and warned her that I have, a *very* high sex drive.  She told me that it would be a little while before sex, because she has ""intimacy issues"" from prior relationships.  I've been very patient, very understanding, and the intimacy issues seem to only involve actual intercourse...she seems fine with everything else I do for her.

Yesterday, she sent me a text saying she would like to make love.  She came over last night, we snuggled, watched some Tosh, and I then proceeded to head south to warm up the engine.  She came twice, put back on her panties, and promptly went to sleep, shutting me down completely.

I'm at a loss Reddit.  My libido is figuratively crawling out of my skin right now  She stays over quite often and I feel awkward masturbating when she's there.  I've expressed my deep desire to make love, and though she says she wants to, it never goes anywhere.  I don't want this to become detrimental to our relationship, but if this continues it might.  Any advice is appreciated.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend loves the orgasms I provide for her, but shuts me down every time the topic of sex comes up.  The frequent blue balls are causing me no end of frustration.  Need some help here.

**EDIT** To be fair, she has tried getting me off with oral (2 out of 6 times she's been successful) and we recently purchased a fleshlight for her to use on me.  It's not completely as if she isn't trying, but...

**EDIT 2** To further clarify, every other aspect of the relationship is great.  She's very emotionally warm, we enjoy spending time together, and when we go out everything is split pretty much down the middle.  She brings me lunch at my office four days a week, sometimes it's home made, sometimes its purchased, but she comes and spends an hour with me out of her day (most times driving across town to come to me).  Everything other than this one aspect of the relationship is literally the best I could ask for.

**EDIT 3**  So after a long discussion last night during which we stripped away each of the ""shoddy"" reasons, it would appear the real reason has come out, and it's not overly far from one of the originals.  Her issues with the ex caused her to basically despise actual intercourse because of the possible physical and emotional repercussions.  After talking, we agreed to try intercourse, and continue to try until we get it down.  We made an attempt last night, and even though we had to stop due to a full scale hyperventilating panic attack on her part, we at least made the attempt.  Thank you Reddit, for your counsel and compassion in this situation.

Names changed, all that good stuff.

Long story as short as I can make it: my sister ""Kathy"" was married for almost twenty years and the majority of that time her husband ""Loren"" carried on affair after affair. Yes, Kathy knew. Not always the specifics but she knew. The cycle went like this: they didn't talk about it so long as the ""family"" stayed together, but roughly once every four to five years there would be a BLOWUP followed by a few months of peace as Loren's guilt or shame or whatever took over and he played the part of the perfect family man and my sister played (let's be honest here) the part of the martyr. Their relationship was one of bad kid and scolding mother.

I will give them this, though - they kept their troubles from their boys and were always there for My nephews.  All the sports, school events, family trips and vacations - they showered their kiddos with time and attention.

The ""cycle"" finally broke about five years ago.  One of Loren's affairs turned into an actual relationship. Kathy for the first time couldn't guilt him back and BAM, all Hell broke loose. Divorce papers were filed and Kathy came undone - she dragged the kids into it, telling them their father was a sex addict and abuser, she followed his new girlfriend around, she called both their places of work repeatedly, tried to vandalize their cars/homes, and so on.

I sympathize, she's my sister for God's sake and has every right to be hurt and angry.  The problem is that after five years she still hasn't let this go. She still makes it a point to rip apart Loren to my nephews and makes them feel guilty when they talk about or see their dad.  When the boys see him they'll sometimes come home to her wailing uncontrollably because they ""picked him"" over her.  She still calls Loren randomly and screams at him or tells him the kids have been in an accident or makes up another traumatic event. She goes to Loren's house under the premise of dropping off food she's made for him or something of his she found at the house, then hits the roof when he isn't there or there's a trace of his girlfriend there. One time she ""caught"" the girlfriend at his place and tried to assault her. Thankfully the girlfriend did not press charges.

The fact is that Loren and this girl are serious, still together, and for whatever crazy reasons their relationship works. No amount of ripping on them is going to change that, all it does is stress out the kids and make the rest of us worry for Kathy's health. She refuses to date and can't stop going on about how men are so awful (she doesn't get why this is inappropriate to go on about in front of her SONS). She seems to think it's healthy for her boys to hear so they can ""avoid their father's path.""

She's in counseling, but what else can we do to help my sister heal? I don't agree with what her ex did, but Loren is otherwise a good dad to his kids and I think my nephews deserve to have as much of a chance at a healthy relationship with him as they can. I don't want them damaged by something that they didn't have anything to do with.

**TLDR:** my sister (F45) REFUSES to get over her divorce and still acts crazy toward her ex. It's affecting her sons (M21, M19) and I'm worried that she doesn't seem to be getting better.

I don't think so but I obviously cannot be certain). Granted these are the guys who helped me get into this situation. The other side is to confess it all to her and then break up with her. 

I'm sure we have to break-up. I've been cheated on before. Its the worst. Nothing is ever the same. What my question is does she deserve an explanation/confession of my cheating? A side question, Is there any way our relationship could survive my cheating?

Just an update I guess I owe to you guys out there who gave me sincere and really awesome advice. So firstly here's a big THANK YOU!

So we broke up officially today and I have no intent of revisiting this relationship, at least not in the foreseeable future. Went down to her place to officially bring everything to a proper conclusion. I actually went with my mind made up not to pursue this relationship any longer, *not* because I could not find it in me to let go and move on from what had happen but from her lack of ""willingness"" to earn back my trust.

Over the past week or so I have began to look at things from a new perspective - one with me being more aware of my own interests. I have come to realised that after what had happened, a betrayal of my trust, I deserve a little more effort on her part to well earn or help me to trust her once again. However, her decision to return back to the same holiday destination, where all that has had happened happened, kinda showed me how much (or in this case, little) she regretted and is willing to make it up.

She left on a 4-day Spa retreat with her mom and returned on Sunday. Before her retreat, she initiated a talk about us, asking if I was pretending to be happy as she could tell that something was bothering me. Was I pretending? Maybe, to an extent. I could be truly happy and love her during our recent dates, but at the end of everyday the realisation sets in and I find myself taking a step back, reluctant to put my whole heart again. So I told her everything that was on my mind, and requested that she would consider if she wanted me more than she wants her single life because I was not too convinced about that.

Today she told me that she hated me for ruining her retreat, especially one that she had been looking forward to relax and unwind, by telling her just before she left. I followed by telling her to put herself in my shoes, that she was not the only one hurting and feeling so anguished. She went on to tell me that I am too overprotective and was suffocating her, and that she was hurting about our ""communication"" problem. I did not see a point in arguing back since I did not have the intent of salvaging this relationship, though eventually we settled that maybe she just couldn't accept me for me. 

I'm gonna wrap up my ranting here. We have broken up and I am actually doing much better than expected. I feel that I am able to see more clearly now and that even though this relationship (that probably wasn't built to last right from the start) didn't work out, I have learned more about life, and more importantly so, more about myself. 

Once again, I would like to thank you awesome folks who had given me your sincere advice.

1339351128.0,128,self.relationships,uuttc,My bf told me that he was convicted of rape when he was 11.  Need help processing this.,throwaway2586,162,34,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uuttc/my_bf_told_me_that_he_was_convicted_of_rape_when/,"Throwaway because this is not my secret to tell, but I need to talk to SOMEONE about it.  Sorry this is so long.  Also, this probably needs a trigger warning.

I [f/25] have known my boyfriend [m/23] for a little over two years; he lived with me a while back when he was getting back on his feet, and we started dating about a year ago.  Up until he told me this, I had thought that his relationship with his siblings was spotless.  They all seem to adore him; for his brothers (he has three brothers total) it borders on hero worship. 

Possibly relevant background: we are from a very conservative rural area.  I am from a liberal, educated family; he is not, to say the least.  Some of his relatives are Amish.  When he was very young, his parents used to lock him in an attic and leave him there for so long he'd have to pee in a towel because he couldn't hold it any longer; not out of any active cruelty, just in the way some people put their dog out on a chain in the yard and forget about it.  Families are usually very isolated, and children spend the vast majority of their time with only their siblings for company.  Just to contextualize all this a bit.  Also, all sex ed is abstinence-only.

Anyway.  When he was around 10-11, he was trying to figure out this sex stuff on his own, with the only people he had around:  his younger sister and brother.  He didn't force them physically, though he worries that he was manipulative and inadvertently coerced them to experiment with him.  He and his younger sister (I think she would have been around 9 at the time?) ""played doctor"" a few times - he didn't give me the details, and it clearly still bothers him.  He and his younger brother (I think he would have been around 7) exchanged oral sex.  His mother found out, talked to her therapist about it, and the therapist reported it to the police.  He was convicted of raping his brother and lived in group homes and juvies for the remainder of his childhood.  He was not allowed back in his parents' house until he was 16; when his father died in a car accident when he was 12, he was let out to go to the funeral but was not allowed to be near his family.

At the group home, he was introduced to drugs for the first time.  When I met him, when he was 20, he had been addicted to heroin/opiates for about 2-3 years and he had a felony conviction for possession of LSD.  He started living with me at the tail end of that addiction; I told him that we could hang out whenever he wanted, except when he was fucked up, and I guess he liked hanging out with me more than spending all his money on junk, because pretty soon he was spending almost every night on my couch.  After he had been clean for about a year, he told me he was in love with me and we've been together ever since.  He is unfailingly kind, polite and doesn't display any of these manipulative traits that he is so worried about, at least that I can tell.  He now works with other at-risk kids, and he is currently reading an issue of *Science* and keeps interrupting me to tell me about carbon nanotubes or some shit.

I've really been struggling to decide what to feel about this whole thing.  I volunteer at the local women's shelter, and I am part of a response team that goes up to the local hospital whenever a patient reports s/he has been a victim of sexual assault.  Usually, I have much more sympathy for the survivor than for the perpetrator.  For me, though, his story is just sad; a story with no bad guys, where everyone is the victim.  He is unquestionably scarred from what happened - it defined his whole life from that point.  But I worry that by acknowledging that, I am somehow minimizing the pain that his siblings must have gone through.  And I can't get around the fact that I will of course be predisposed to be sympathetic to his version of the story and I can't trust myself to be objective.  (I should note that he is honest to a fault, and though it has occurred to me that he could be sugarcoating what happened, I personally believe that he is being truthful.)  

My gut feeling is that what happened was tragic for everyone involved, but that the justice system should have not inserted itself into the situation.  And I think it's fucking unforgivable that the same government that refuses to teach its children anything about sex is also willing to hold them criminally responsible when those children fuck it up (/minirant).  But I need some outside perspective on this one.  What do you guys think?

I'll get to the point- my girlfriend is a bigger girl and I am a smaller guy. She is not ""fat"" by most people's standards- but she is on the bigger side. I, on the other hand, am on the smaller side. We both know this- and it's something out in the open and we have discussed this before. 

However she thinks its okay to joke about my weight. For instance, once I was hanging out with her family and the mother jokingly mentions something about me having to go to the gym to get bigger- my gf goes along with this. 

Most recently, I met her old college friend for the first time. The girl was a very friendly person- but she too made a skinny joke. She lifted up my arms and felt my biceps- I have none. The friend too said something about having to go to the gym- and then my gf adds to the conversation that I stay so skinny because I walk every where. And they both laughed about this. 

This irked me the wrong way. Now I understand that it was meant to be lighthearted joking around- but I tried to reverse the roles in my head. If I was the one introducing my gf to an old friend- and I joked about her weight- saying something like ""oh this is my gf, I know she kind of has thunder-thighs but she just needs to get to the gym and hit the treadmills so she can get skinnier ha ha""- that would not go over so well. 

I just need an outsider's perspective on how to handle this delicate thing. I am more so interested in women's perspective (I am thinking about posting this on /r/AskWomen too). Any thoughts?

So, I couldn't respond to most of the comments in my last post because my router apparently wanted to crap out on me. After that I was staying with a friend, and I only got to troubleshoot the problem today. 

Long story short- he and I are done. There are tons of juicy details I would be happy to relate, but I don't want to make this post a novel. Ask and you'll get an answer. Basically, he isn't attracted to me any more and doesn't respect me enough to not cheat on me. I have gotten a new checking account and applied for housing. This way I can get away from him and start improving myself (and preventing arguments in front of the kids). I feel really strange, but not necessarily bad. I'm leaning on a friend who has had two divorces, and she has been very supportive with both her heart and her couch. I need documents proving we have filed for divorce before I can get housing, and apparently that's about $200, which is rough. I don't even think we can pawn our wedding rings for that much, but worst case scenario I hope a parent here or there might help. The biggest bummer is with my mother in law, who is a close friend and whom I love. Her seeing what's going on in our relationship reminds her of what happened in her ex husband's and her relationship. She's disappointed in her son right now, and it is rough for her. 

TL;DR: Posted to /r/relationships a few days ago- you guys helped me end my toxic relationship.

EDIT: I feel like I'm being sacrilegious with my upbeat attitude, but I feel so clearly like this is the right move. You guys are awesome, I love r/relationships, and my friends Jen and Vic, who have been amazing with me the past few days. Shortly after the discovery, while he was telling me how I was blowing things out of proportions, I told him I had posted to /r/relationships for advice. I told him I had gotten a lot of supportive comments, and that it wasn't as ""no big deal"" as he was trying to make it. He said he would make a post with his side to show how right he was, but of course never did. I'll see if he's still interested... 


EDIT 2: He told me I was butt ugly and he was never attracted to me, that our whole relationship was a lie. We fought. He put me in a headlock, then broke my phone and keys and stormed off.

",nomorenuggs25,144,19,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/162hil/bf_24_spending_too_much_money_on_weed_does_not/,"Okay, this is a question for general r/relationships but especially for anyone who is also an Ent. I have been in this relationship for 2 years. We are both working dead end jobs (he is a host at a restaurant, working full-time, I am working retail part-time and in the process of looking for a second job). We have been trying to manage our money better and I have been actively watching Dave Ramsey classes, etc., making up monthly budgets for each of us as he has agreed/requested -- this was a goal we made as a couple. However, when it comes to weed, my boyfriend cannot seem to stop buying the amounts he is used to! He has a $1000 debt to his university before he can go back to school and hasn't paid ANY of it, yet puts $50 a week (yes, $200 a month!) into buying WEED. 

Now, I have already gotten to a point where I am cutting back to almost smoking nothing, just so that I am not responsible for burning through something he puts his money towards. I had hoped that this would make his stash last longer, but he still burns through it in record time. Since our finances our separate, I only control my bank account, although I write up a monthly budget for each of us individually. This month, being the first of the year, I made it especially detailed. He gets paid twice a month and his paycheck left him with a $150 balance after paying all the bills this half of the month. He went out and immediately spent it on weed, and then has the audacity to ask me if I can pitch in to buy extra groceries, when he makes DOUBLE what I'm currently making per month. We are on food stamps and my goal has been to stay within the $200 a month that we get through that for our groceries. However, all the weed smoking costs us money in food because he gets the munchies. When I told him that we didn't have any extra food stamps for that, and I didn't have any money, and if he wanted to get some snacks he needed to pay the extra himself, he admitted that he had gone 'overboard' buying weed this week and spent about $100. This is after last week, when he did a favor for our dealer friend and was given a full week's weed FREE. He has already burned through it!

I don't know what to do. I don't like telling other people how to spend their money and he gets really angry when I bring up that he should cut back, saying that it is the only thing that relaxes him after his 'stressful' day at work. He doesn't spend money on anything else unnecessarily, really, although he does spend a lot of cash he makes in tips on caffeine drinks. I have approached it from the standpoint of dealing with someone who has an addiction, but frankly, reddit, I'm tired. I don't like finding resin all over everything, and I don't like not having a dresser because my boyfriend would rather spend $100 on smokeables instead of saving up with me to get us things we need for our apartment. 

**TLDR // Boyfriend spending all his 'extra' money on weed, not allowing us to save for things that we need. Girlfriend tired of trying to manage money and having a partner that won't stick to the plan.**

Things are going great, he's the best guy I've ever dated, we are very much in love, etc, etc. 

Recently, a new girl (26) has started at his work, and she has developed a crush on him. I totally understand why, he's a great guy, but I would rather that she does not. She will send him texts on a Tuesday night being like ""You should come over and help me finish this bottle of wine, I can't do it on my own"" and is very touchy-feely with him at work (grabbing his arm, hugging him, etc)

So far my boyfriend has not been responsive, frequently bringing up the fact that I exist, mentioning how great I am, texting me during their breaks, all that stuff. I know rationally that he wouldn't cheat on me, because he's just not that sort of guy, but then I start thinking and worrying and I get, I don't know, jealous, I guess when I think about the fact that she gets to be with him eight hours a day, five days a week, and then worry that she will win him over in that time. 

I was cheated on once before during a three-year relationship that ended about a year and a half ago (as a result of the cheating) and I'm desperately afraid of getting hurt like that again. He tells me not to worry whenever I voice my concerns, that he loves me, that this other girl is not as funny as I am, etc.... but I worry anyway. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these worries/jealousy/overall paranoia? I don't want to be this paranoid crazy person but I don't know how to stop, the irrational side of my brain won't shut up. Is this normal? I know that as I go through life people are going to be interested in my SO, whoever it may be at the time, and there's nothing I can do about that, so I would just like to know how I can not let worrying about that inevitable fact of life bother me. 

This feels so high school, I'm a little embarrassed about the fact that 
I'm posting about this at all.    

**tl;dr** my boyfriend's (24) (new) coworker (26) has a crush on him, and is inappropriately flirty. He shuts her down, and frequently mentions me at work, but she has yet to give up. The rational side of my brain knows that he will not cheat on me, but the irrational part of my brain does not (I was cheated on in the past). How do I cope with this/get the irrational part of my brain to give it a rest already? (My boyfriend and I have been together 8ish months, I'm 22)

I have been seeing this girl for about 5 months now and when we started seeing each other exclusively and everything was awesome, we saw each other every week no more than 3 days apart. Everything was exciting and fun. I never had a serious relationship and I was used to being single. I was never really attached to her until I realized, now. Its like roles have been swapped. When we were starting off, she was the one checking up on me and now I'm the one always initiating or creating plans all the time. I had all these hobbies, motorcycling, djing, music, trips, ect and now all this feels tasteless and bland when music and riding  was all I wanted to do. I asked her if I was giving her enough time alone, and she said yes but I still think I'm initiating too often. I'm just a hopeless romantic and I want to do all that sweet stuff like buy flowers and make dinner but I know I need to ease up a little.

Also, when I leave on Mondays for work after seeing her for the weekend, Its almost like,I have some,sort of anxiety. I don't know what it is, it feels weird, and I hate it since I have been independent for so long.

I just feel like my feelings are forcing myself onto her when I just want everything to flow and be anxiety-free just like they were when we started dating. At first it felt so great and now having her on my mind all the time is wearing me out emotionally. 

I also feel under-appreciated since I naturally do a bunch of nice stuff for her, I don't expect anything in return, but on the other side it feel nice to have something done to you that makes you feel appreciated.

1344621982.0,125,self.relationships,y0aj8,My SO [22M] says our relationship cannot continue unless I [22F] lose a lot of weight. Been dating for 4 years. ,flowersnpowers,163,38,297,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/y0aj8/my_so_22m_says_our_relationship_cannot_continue/,"When we first started dating, I was a student athlete at our college. I didn't make tryouts the next year, so I began to gain weight quickly. During the past 4 years, he has also gained weight. I am about 2 inches shorter than him and now weigh about 10 pounds more than him. I have tried to lose weight by exercising with him before, but it usually ends up that we both give up and go back to old habits. We decided to start another weight loss program together a month ago, and since I have lost about 6 pounds. 

Last night he tells me that one of his requirements for a wife is that she cannot weigh more than him, and must be striving to be the best person she can be, physical appearance included. He tells me that he knows my weight loss endeavors have not been successful in the past, and has considered giving me an ultimatum (lose weight or we're done), but decided not to.  

I don't understand why he would tell me this about my weight now, when I've been working to lose it recently, with some success. The words he said made me feel absolutely horrible about myself, and today I have no desire to see him or talk to him. It makes me want to starve myself, get skinny, and dump his ass when I'm back to the weight I was at when I was an athlete. 

I have always tried to love him unconditionally, and it hurts me to think that he does not also love me unconditionally. He has told me recently that he loves me just the way I am, and is very attracted to me, then tells me this last night. I honestly don't know what to think. 

I am considering breaking up with him, and losing the weight for myself at a healthy pace.  

TL;DR: Girl weighs more than her SO, couple starts working out together, SO says girl must lose a lot of weight for the relationship to ever become marriage. Should girl break up with him because he wants her to change?

Please try not to be too harsh, I'm already at a fragile emotional state right now. 

EDIT: I am 5'9, 199 pounds. He is 5'11, around 190, although he might have lost weight recently as well. 3 years ago at the most fit I was in my life, I was 167 with an athletic build. 

When he said this last night, he said so right after we had gone for a run. Which I think just made it more hurtful for me. Just for informational purposes, I have been working out around 5 days a week since June 3rd. Cardio and strength. 

ANOTHER EDIT: The frequency of sex has not gone down. We do not live together. He is my first boyfriend. He is still very cuddly and we have a good time when we are together. He tells me I look nice when I wear a dress or do my hair a special way. And I do try to dress up for him very often. I've decided not to break up with him, I can't just throw away 4 years. We have already been through a lot together. But I think a lot of talking still needs to happen. 

UPDATE: I had a very rough day. This morning I ate cereal and did not eat for the rest of the day. When I felt hungry, I drank tea to make it go away. Because I am not an emotional eater, I convinced myself that if I stayed sad, I wouldn't have an appetite anyway. I REALIZE THIS IS INCREDIBLY UNHEALTHY AND WILL NOT DO IT AGAIN.

SO and I just finished talking. I told him that it's not fair of him to make me compare myself to anyone else, including him. If I get down to a healthy attractive weight, and still weigh a few pounds more than him, so be it. It shouldn't be about the numbers on the scale. I told him that I agree that he deserves to be with someone who is healthy and who he is attracted to. He said that usually, females should weigh less than a male taller than him, and weight is often an indicator of health. I told him, what if i got down to 165, and you got down to 160, how is that fair? He said that I made a good point and would rather me be at a healthy weight rather than just ""weighing less than him"" from a numbers perspective.

I asked why he decided to tell me last night. He said that it had been on his mind for a very long time and just randomly picked last night to say it. I told him I needed him to understand why I did feel hurt by it. I thought I was doing a good job, and making progress. When he said those things it made me feel like he didn't think I was trying at all. He told me this wasn't his intention and that he was sorry. 
I also told him about me not eating today. He told me this is not what he wanted for me at all, and he's sorry if what he said made me feel like I had to do something so drastic. He said that we can start making healthy meals together. (so far during the past month he has not tried to eat healthier at all, just work out a lot more. He has still been eating junk food, just slightly less of it.)

I feel much better about the whole thing, and I know that all your comments have helped me think more rationally about it. When i posted, i was very upset and my ""threats"" of breaking up with him were drastic. I do love him very much and I know that he does want the best for me. Even if he's not very tactful and has horrible timing.

I have a very sweet though easily startled female cat I picked up as a stray. It's been four years now and it takes her a very long time to become comfortable with people. She also sheds a lot, despite my best efforts at brushing. My soon-to-be-wife and I are ending our long distance relationship and moving in together, but now she drops the bombshell that I have to find a new home for my cat.

I find this disturbing on several levels, namely it would be very hard to find a home for a cat like this. She's skittish, and not easily adoptable because of what I suspect was an abusive past. Plus, my wife has no medical reason to oppose living with my cat, since she's not allergic. Instead, she simply says my cat is ""boring and has no personality"" and she hates the fur that sticks to her clothes. And by hate I mean shrill, angry, almost to the point of yelling when she sees any fur sticking on her clothes. 

I am seeing an ugly side to her personality that has transcended the issue of cat vs. no cat altogether. I am at a loss.

TL;DR: fiance hates my cat, is acting like a beast about it

Wow lots of good input, thanks guys. You've helped me reevaluate the situation and have another discussion. I've begun to realize that among so many stressful elements that are involved with the move, that she is fixating on the cat issue and specifically the cat hair issue. It's become a bit of a placeholder for everything else. I do plan on keeping the cat. I told her the best I can promise is that if an ideal situation comes up where I can find a really nice home for her (unlikely in a world awash in kittens) that I will reconsider letting her go. And in the meantime I will be doing a lot more brushing, Roomba-ing (good tip) and washing.

Finally, just wanted to say a week later: I am keeping the cat, and that's final. :) So far so good. Thanks Reddit, y'all reminded me that sometimes you have to put your foot/paw down and stick to your principles.

1374159683.0,121,self.relationships,1ik8w7,Broke up with my [22M] girlfriend [21F]--then she asked for our sex toys because...,ANOWB,176,55,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ik8w7/broke_up_with_my_22m_girlfriend_21fthen_she_asked/,"**DISCLAIMER: I know I’m being silly and many of the things I say are unfair. For the most part, my ex has done nothing wrong.**

So my girlfriend broke up with me around a month ago. I loved her, but she didn’t love me anymore.

It came as a shock, because while we’d been struggling for a while with other, unrelated issues, I genuinely thought we’d worked them out. I was looking forward to a long summer together going places, doing things, and having fun, but when I went home for the weekend I got a text saying that she was sorry, but she no longer loved me.

It hurt, you know? But I knew she was doing the right thing. So I cried a bit, and dreamed about her, and told myself I needed to move on. I really love her. I saw a future with her. I don’t need to go on about how much she means to me, because I’m sure you’ve heard it all a hundred times before. But I felt as if my entire future had suddenly been taken from me (although I *didn’t* rant about this to her—it wouldn’t be fair for her or healthy to me).

She also *repeatedly* said that she hoped we could be friends. As in, every time we talked. I told her that if she wanted to be friends, she could start my not *saying that so goddamn often*.

So, on with moving on.

Two problems.

Firstly, we were meant to be living together next year. So we need someone to take my room in the flat, and I need to find somewhere to live. I don’t have a lot of free time and I need to work with her to find someone to move in, so we were still in contact (we’d ended it on a good note, so it wasn’t *too* awkward, but I still knew it wasn’t good for me).

Secondly, I felt that I needed to send her a letter. It basically explained that I felt because of the issues we’d be having lately, we hadn’t been having fun as a couple, and if we *hadn’t* broken up, we’d of had months of the summer to do things together. If this had happened, I told myself, then *maybe* she wouldn’t have decided she didn’t love me.

I spent a couple of weeks writing this letter. She knew it was on the way. When I sent it, I got a response telling me she’d 
read it, but that was it. Fair enough, I thought, I knew it was a stupid idea anyway.

So, onto the current issue. We were talking on the phone today and she asked me what I’d done with a couple of (mild) sex toys we’d had together. She asked me if she could have them.

I asked why. She gave some vague response. I asked “Do you have a new boyfriend?” and continued asking questions until she revealed all (I didn’t force her to answer or demand that she do so; while I take full responsibility for asking the questions in the first place, which was really stupid, she didn’t try and evade giving me answers).
She has a friend-with-benefits, someone I don’t know, who she met two days after we broke up. They’ve had sex once (I didn’t ask this question specifically). 

It’s probably at least 50% true. She has a history of lies to make things easier for herself (nothing amazingly major, as far as I know, but I’ve caught her lying to me and other people to save herself inconveniences before—e.g. once she told me she was on her period to avoid having sex with me for the next few days, when it goes without saying that a firm “I’m not in the mood,” would have been enough).

I also asked, “Did you cry when you broke up with me?” She initially claimed that she did, but I knew she was lying; no, she said, she was upset but didn’t cry. While unrelated, this still kind of hurt, but I’d known it was true for a while now.

*She hasn’t done anything wrong.* She broke up with me, and then found someone else, who she’s started a casual relationship with. If she’s lied, it’ll be something along the lines of that it *is* someone I know (I understand why she wouldn’t tell me this), the number of times she’s had sex, etc. And she has absolutely no duty to tell me the truth about damn near anything any more.

But I’m still in a bit of a state. It’s *mostly* jealousy, I freely admit that, but I do have a couple of issues.

Firstly, she met him in *two days?* That’s got to sting a bit. The long-term relationship we had together, all the times we talked about our future, all the times she told me she loved me, weren’t enough to upset her enough to stop her having sex with a guy she met within days of breaking up with me.

Secondly, at that point I was busy writing this letter. Not her fault, of course, but she knew I was writing this letter as a sort of postscript to our relationship when she met and had sex with this guy. Again, she hasn’t done anything *wrong* as such, but it still hurts.

Finally… the stuff she asked for me were (a) bought by me; (b) paid for by me; (c) barely used because *she* didn’t want to; 
(d) worth *£10*. Instead of just going out and spending £10 replacing them, she started a phone conversation which she knew would end in, “Oh yeah, I’m totally having sex with this guy.”

I sound like a whiny child. Our relationship is over; maybe in the future some time we might be able to salvage a friendship (which will take *far longer* that she thinks it will, because I’m still *deeply and madly in love with her*). Asking for the stuff was rude, but should hardly hurt as much as it does.

But it hurts, guys, and I needed to share it.

**tl;dr**: My ex asked for our sex toys back because she’s in a friends-with-benefits relationship and it’s reopening old (well, pretty recent actually) wounds.

The just of it was that my boyfriend and I decided to move in together (1500 km away), and I was worried about telling my Catholic mother.

First of all I want to thank everyone who responded to my original post. Some of you mentioned she might pleasantly surprise me and it might not be that bad. I have to admit that I thought these people didn't have an understanding of crazy Catholics. 

Well, I told her. I ended up telling her by text, which I know isn't the best way to do it but I was terrified of her reaction. She texted asking if there was anything new with the apartment and I said ""Actually yes, 'boyfriend' is moving up."" And she was happy for us! Excited even! At first I thought she must think he's getting another place but she knows we will be living together and is OK with it. She said she would rather we were married but she is stil offering her support. I am so relieved and happy, I just wish I had told her sooner.

Even my father is happy about it. He isn't as religious as mum but I thought he might be sternly disappointed. Turns out he's been worrying about my safety in a strange new city alone (cute) and is glad I'll have an advocate and says he won't worry as much!

I just wanted to share my story in case anyone is going through the same thing. I really thought she would be upset, as did everyone I talked to about it who knows her, so I wasn't just trying to make her seem awful. She has seemed more relaxed and less judgey lately so maybe this is a new stage in our relationship.

**Short recap: My boyfriend of two years and I had a child together, but his house was not an acceptable place for her to live.  I moved out and told him that we'd come back when he got a job and we could fix the place up together.** 

I've had a change of heart since my first post.  He's shown me his true colors since then, and I'm not having it.  He's made no effort to get his shit together.  He's mentioned a few places that are hiring mechanics, but when I ask if he wants a ride to talk to the owners, he turns me down, citing ridiculous reasons--""I don't like the owner's brother,"" ""They don't have air conditioning,"" ""They're only looking for someone part time,"" ""They're looking for someone to work round the clock,"" etc.  

Meanwhile, he's posting self-pitying and mean comments about me on Facebook, garnering sympathy from his friends.  One of them said that I was a **terrible mother** because I refused to let him see her.  Mind you, I take her to see him every time I go out there to give him a ride to the store, every other day or so, so he's obviously been lying to them about what's going on.  

And, the straw that broke the camel's back, he put her crib and clothes up for sale on Craigslist.  I shit you not, r/relationships, the motherfucker had the nerve to say we should come back and live with him when he's **selling her things** to buy himself cigarettes.  **Cigarettes!**  Not formula.  Not bug spray.  Not new carpet.  Cigarettes.  

So I basically told him to fuck off.  She doesn't need that kind of parent in her life, and I certainly don't need that kind of co-parent.  I paid his bills for this month so that he couldn't blame me for being homeless, took the crib back (along with everything else that belonged to her that he could sell), and blocked him from being able to contact me.  I realize that's probably only temporary, since we still have a child linking us together, but I think if I talked to him right now I'd end up killing him.  

I really regret everything that's happened.  I never thought I'd be the kind of idiot who would put herself in this situation, but here I am.  But, unlike him, I'm going to take some responsibility for the child that I brought into this world, get over my own problems, and be a good parent.  No matter what it takes.  

Thank you to everyone who told me he was an asshole before.  I should have taken your words to heart more.  

**TL;DR:  He's a dick, I'm an idiot, but I'm not going to let my child suffer for it.**

I [21F] am on the verge of breaking up with my bf [27M] even though I still am deeply in love with him. UPDATE",thissuckshey,160,36,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19bygj/166_i_21f_am_on_the_verge_of_breaking_up_with_my/,"Referring to: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/199ejr/i_21f_am_on_the_verge_of_breaking_up_with_my_bf/

I just wanted to start this by saying thank you to everyone who replied, your advice and insight was amazing and helped me more than I ever expected. 

I talked to him last night after he was done showering and all that stuff. He asked why I seemed so upset today and that threw me off because I thought he would have known because of what happened the night before. Prior to his homecoming I had written a list of things I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it so that I didn't miss anything or say things in a blaming tone. 

I said something along the lines of: 

""I know part of the reason you don't want to have sex as much any more is because I've been putting a lot of stress &amp; pressure on it and I just wanted you to know that I really don't mean to do that to you, or to us. I believe you feel reluctant to have sex or anything is because I've never had an orgasm. That honestly does not matter to me, it is not your fault I've never had one and you are not doing anything wrong at all. I LOOVE sleeping with you, so much. Even if I don't get off it is still always amazing. ""

""The reason I can't cum has extremely little to do with you. The only way you're affecting it at all is just because I always feel like you're just doing it because you have too and that you're never really into it. I want you to enjoy it as much as I do so I get distracted and worried and can't focus on how well you are pleasing me like I should be. We need to learn together what works for us, and in order to do that we need to learn to communicate much better because I believe that's our main problem.""

""I miss how we were in the beginning of our relationship. When I would easily be able to turn you on and when we used to cuddle all the time on the couch and make out. I think mainly I miss the affection I used to get  and I know the honey moon stage is just a stage but I would really just love to make out on the couch or cuddle like we used too.""

""I want you to know that i love you so fucking much and I don't mean to stress you out or ruin sex for you by pestering you into it. But even though I love you to death I can't stay in a relationship like this forever. I need to feel loved, desired and sexy again. I really don't want to break up but i have to do what I have to do to make myself happy in the long run. i have expressed my feelings, opinions as well as suggestions that could possibly help make this work and it has all been one way. It has been nearly a year and nothing has really changed and I don't feel like you are putting in much effort and I have been trying SOOOO fucking hard to not pester you, or nag, or to be a bitch, but I still feel undesired by you and lonely in our relationship. And I know i said it last time but this is honestly my last attempt because this has been mentally exhausting for me ""

I also suggested that maybe we see a couples therapist as well as not having any sexual contact for thirty days to rebuilt the mental intimacy before the physical intimacy. 

He didn't really say anything. After my little speel we just kind of sat silently for ten minutes. (Other than my sobs cause I'm a cry baby). Finally he said ""so how much time do I have"" i was pretty upset that that is all he got out of my whole speel but I told him that I refuse to put a time limit on it for obvious reasons. After that he was silent again for a while and eventually said that he was really sorry and that he didn't mean to be like that and that he knows he is hurting me and that he does not want to lose me. Same things he has said for the past year or so... I just said that is okay I know he doesn't mean to do this and that sometimes people just don't match no matter how bad they want too. 

He was silent again for about half an hour, I made him dinner and then we ate. After we finished eating he said that he has been thinking about what i said and that he has a really hard time with opening up and talking about his feelings. Then i said if you can't open up with me and communicate your feelings it will never work out because there are always problems to be solved/compromised in relationships. 

He said I was right and then told me that he thinks the reason that he hasn't been as horny lately is because he isn't pleased with how he looks and since he isn't attracted to himself he finds it difficult to become horny at all. I told him that I completely understood and that I've been there myself. Now he is promising that he will stop cheating on our eating healthy diet while he is at work and that he is going to start running every day again.. I was a little upset that he waited almost a year to tell me that, even though he was watched me suffer and cry and hate myself over it but I'm trying not to be selfish by thinking only of that. He also promised that he would never shove my hand away from his cock or turn me down. I promised him I wouldn't pressure him or come on to him too much. I probably won't come on to him at all, actually. He asked me if I think it will work out between us. I said I hope so but right now I doubt it because most of the things you said tonight you have said before.

So I am going to give him another chance, again. But if in a month he hasn't been making any efforts to change his life style and to become more healthy then I will take that as a sign he doesn't care enough about us or himself to change.

Edit: Phrasing 

Sorry for the novel! 

**TLDR: Talked to BF about everything again, this time he actually opened up and told me the reason he isn't horny anymore is because he has gained weight over the past year and doesn't feel attracted to himself and then finds it hard to get attracted to anyone. He promised to not turn me down anymore, and promised to start taking better care of himself to get in shape. I told him I understood and that I'd give him another chance.**",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1361990163.0,,,True,t3_19bygj,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19bygj/166_i_21f_am_on_the_verge_of_breaking_up_with_my/,

We go for walks every night around our neighborhood and through a park, and since she knows it coming sometime soon I figured it would be most surprising if its during something romantic that we do fairly often. My plan is to (obviously) be romantic during the walk without being transparent and then ask her when we reach the middle of the park by the bandstand. The park will be dark at this time (6:30 or so) but the sidewalks have lightposts and the center is pretty bright so I'm not too worried about her not being able to see me or the ring. I was then going to cram in whatever I could to the rest of the night, so I have reservations at the restaurant we went on our first date at over three years ago and I was going to carve our name and the date into a tree near the spot (shh.. don't tell the police).

Is this too boring or rushed to propose in just the evening after work? I really wanted to ask her before thanksgiving so we could tell her family in person but I was only able to ask her dad for his blessing this past weekend.  Has anyone had a similar proposal that they regret/love?

tl;dr Proposing on walk through park followed by dinner, too simple?

I'm sorry if I'm leaving ""plot holes"" or if this seems disjointed, I'm kind of frazzled and distraught right now.

Background: My mom is insanely overprotective and controlling. (My dad, though he lives with us, is pretty out of the picture when it comes to things. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't get involved.) I still don't have a driver's license because she refused to teach me and for awhile didn't think I should be allowed to have one. When I was applying and in the interview process for my new job, she made my life a living hell because it wasn't ""good enough"" for me because I have a BA in acting, and it was ""too far"" and I would ""get stuck""  there. (For the record, it's $17 an hour, full time, benefits, and reasonable deals on insurance, among other things.) She even went so far as to scream at me before I went to my interview, trying to make me late and cry as well. She has to know where I am at every second of the day, and she calls me every few hours to ""check up"" on me if I'm out of the house. All of this has really made it necessary for me to leave. I've also been struggling with depression, and even though I came to her for help, she said there was nothing wrong with me. (I saw a counselor when I was still in college, and when my mom would drive me to my appointments, she constantly demeaned me about it and insisted that I was ""mandated by the school"" to go because I ""must have done something"". I saw the counselor of my own accord because I didn't know what else to do.) I just can't live like this anymore.


Last night, my long-term boyfriend [also 22] and I came to my mom and told her that we are moving out together in January. We've done all of our research on the costs, different places, etc, and the two of us have a really solid plan. We spend every weekend and nearly every weekday with one another, and we are very happy, mesh very well, and moving in together just feels like the next step for us. Well, she wasn't interested in conversation. She continuously told us we were being stupid, then when she would ask us questions about bills, etc, and we actually had a good answer for her, she would say extremely snidely ""Well, I guess you two just have it ALL figured out then."" We left for the night, and I came back around midnight when she was asleep.


Today is hell. I knew she was going to be bitchy when I got out of my room, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. Right when I went into the living room she wouldn't stop about how stupid I was being and how my boyfriend and I should just live together with my family (which we really, REALLY don't fucking want to do for multiple reasons), then when I said no she started saying how I'm just going to be living paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life (which I won't be) and will never have time to act again. (Which I won't - part of the reason why I took this job was because I have every night and Sunday off, which works great for rehearsal and show schedules. I told her that and she blew me off.) Then she went on to say how my boyfriend is only using me for sex and rent so he can live somewhere else, and how he's putting me in danger because apparently she thinks the apartment we chose is ""a shithole"". (It isn't. I think it's quite nice and cute. She apparently went there last night, even though I didn't tell her the address, and ""checked it all out"".) She wouldn't stop berating me, saying how I'm ""settling"" and how I'm ""surrounding myself with idiots"". She's extremely upset that I ""made this decision without involving the family"". But honestly, it's my decision. I'm moving out, not them. I can't even go to my room to be alone because she continuously is coming in periodically to berate me more, and when I tell her that I'd like to be alone she says that it's her house and she can do and treat me however she wants.

I'm just completely at a loss and don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard not to cry because I know it's not worth it. I'm just so exasperated with this situation and living environment. 

tl;dr: Overprotective, overbearing mother is making my life hell because she doesn't want me to move out. She is acting crazy and unreasonable, and won't leave me alone. I don't know how to deal with this.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the replies, I'd love to respond to all of them, but there just isn't enough time! I guess I'll just have to tough it out til January.

GF; 18, me (m); 18
been together 8 months.

She has been the victim of rape and sexual abuse and a lot of verbal abuse by family/ex bofriend. It has pretty evidently affected her self esteem and self worth overall. Recently she confided in me that she wants to engage in some dom/sub and light (pretty much mainstream) bondage. She really likes verbal degradation and being hit/slapped around, very rough sexytimes.

 I do not think this is a good idea, I think she wants this because its her comfort zone and she is so used to being treated that way in a sexual context, so i don't really agree to participate. This upsets her so i agree to get a little bit rough, like biting her tits, taking control just a bit during sexytimes. We haven't had intercourse more than  6-10  times because of the lack of oppurtunities but the times we do sometimes she almost burst in to tears for no reason. I would try and stop and give her the attention she needed but she always just takes a second to recompose herself and encourages me to continue. 


One time, before we had a safeword, we were having sex (probably only the second time we had sex) and she said ""hey can we stop for a minute"" and be being the fucking idiot that i am instead pushed her down more and started fucking her harder. I thought she was just saying it playfully, and she choked up and began crying and tried to push me off her and as soon as i realised she was serious i stopped. 
Point being; i really do not think engaging in verbal degradation/bdsm/bondage will do her mental health any good. At the same time, i do not want to leave her sexually unsatisfied. **I'm lost on what to do. Any advice would be wonderful**

tl;dr- gf has been abused and raped a while ago and now wants me to treat her like a sex toy basically in the bedroom, hit her and verbally degrade her etc. I don't know if its okay to participate in such things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR: My husband rarely follows through on promises, doesn't listen when I talk to him, and is constantly disappointing me. Blames it on ADHD but refuses to do anything about it. I'm at my breaking point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Husband is a redditor, hence the throwaway. My husband and I have been together for 8 years, married for 7. We have two young kids.

Throughout our relationship, my husband has been kind of ""flaky"". We'll make plans, and he usually forgets about them. He asks me questions and completely disregards my answers. This ranges from small issues (for example, he'll ask me if I want onions on a burger and I'll say very clearly 'NO' - I've always hated onions - and he puts extra onions on. I'll say 'I said I don't want onions' and he will respond 'yeah, but burgers are better with onions') to large issues (he is on a business trip and asked if I would like to fly alone with the kids to meet up with him at the end of his trip. I told him 'I appreciate the offer, but I'm really not comfortable flying with the kids on my own.' Also, there is a small possibility that his schedule will change and he won't be there to meet us. I don't want to take that risk so I said 'I really don't like the idea. It makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to do it.' The next day, I received confirmation emails for non-refundable plane tickets.)

I also can't trust him to follow through with his responsibilities. I have to handle everything financial, or else bills don't get paid. He owns a car in another country that we are supposed to be selling. We have the money in our account to pay off the car loan, we have a buyer, but need to pay off the loan before the new owner can register it. The car is solely in his name, so he needs to be the one to contact the bank about paying it off. He keeps putting off the phone call, even though it will be a simple call to make and it will remove a lot of inconvenience for everyone involved.

He blames all of our relationship problems on him having ADHD. Apparently, he was diagnosed as a child but has never received treatment for it. Any time I get upset with him for not listening to me or following through with things, he basically says 'it's not my fault, it's my ADHD'. I've asked him to go to a doctor and look into options to treat it, whether that be medication or Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and he won't. He says that having an official diagnosis of ADHD will harm his career. The only option he will consider is marijuana. He says it makes him think more clearly and works better than anything else would. His employer does random drug tests and he would lose his job if he was found with pot in his system, but apparently that would be less detrimental to his career than CBT???

I don't know what to do anymore. Any time I look at him I feel angry, because all of the responsibility in our lives falls on my shoulders; any time I ask him to do something (eg. pay off the car loan) he can't be bothered to follow through. I don't want to have sex with him anymore, or even be touched by him, because it feels like he doesn't respect me. His refusal to deal with his ADHD makes me furious; I feel like he is using it as an excuse to ignore everything in life. Like it's a get out of jail free card.

I've tried to talk to him about this numerous times, and nothing has changed. If anything, it seems to be getting worse. I never give vague answers - if he asks a question, I will tell him the answer in the most straightforward way possible, but he still doesn't listen. 

I don't want to leave him (especially since there are kids involved), but I'm so unhappy that it is starting to feel like the only option. Our problems are probably miniscule compared to some people's, but I just can't handle living like this anymore and don't know what to do to fix it.",Personal issues,False,,t5_2qjvn,1376410998.0,m-io personal,,True,t3_1k9xti,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k9xti/me29f_with_my_husband_33m_of_8_years_i_cant/,

The first thread was kind of a train-wreck, so I'm hoping to avoid that this time around. And I'm sorry for saying Jen was 17, when she was actually 16 and 358 days old. That seemed to be like an ongoing thing, and there wasn't any sort of ulterior motive. Onto the update.... 

If anyone stuck around and read the thread, I did admit that I was wrong, and after I guess becoming more aware of some of the risks, I realized it wasn't a good idea to keep the relationship up. **I broke up with Jen.**  Friday morning, on skype (which is as stupid an idea as it sounds like for future reference). I kinda just went through the steps, and told her I loved her, but I didn't think our relationship could last with the age difference... something I've worried about before. That I was kind of concerned and scared about us (more me) being in trouble legally, if something was to go awry. And that we should both be single, and enjoy ourselves, and if its meant to be that it'll happen. 

She.did.not.take.it.well. 

I can't exactly describe things, or do it justice, but it was one of the more painful, uncomfortable conversations I've had. She accused me of everything... from cheating (for the record, never cheated on her) to being a coward, and she tried to say we weren't broken up, even though I just broke up with her. I'm usually a pushover with Jen, but I held firm, and the break-up is final though. 

She has been texting me on/off since then, but I've been good about staying no contact. I told her that we shouldn't talk until we can get over one another, and that I couldn't handle talking to her and not being with her. Its been hard, not that I expect anyone to sympathize with me lol, to not respond. I'm hoping kind of that she moves on, and we can put this behind us. The whole breakup kind of showed me that yeah, she wasn't maybe as mature as I thought. And I like the idea of being single more than I realized. And the idea of not flirting with police issues. So this breakup was probably a very, good idea.

I've always ignored it because in general I don't like physical contact.

Last week me and my parents were on vacation with my boyfriend, we usually play cards in the evening, but we didn't have a table in the hotel room and were forced to play on their double bed instead.

I ended up sitting next to my dad on the bed and he started stroking my legs with his feet, not for long periods of time but often enough to freak me out, and it went on like this for a couple of nights. This lead to me asking my boyfriend to take that spot on the bed so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable, but I went in there before him to use their bathroom and told them I'd like to sit next to my mom, which my dad didn't approve of because ""myboyfriendsname wants to sit there and will be disappointed"".

My boyfriend then shows up and takes my old seat, and I hear my dad tell him to sit next to my mom because ""throwaway47312 wants to sit there"". I thought it was weird of him to give excuses and that he wanted to sit next to me so bad, but I let it go.

Next time I decided to just be blunt and told him that I would be sitting next to my mom, which resulted in him getting upset and telling me that I need to sit there because he will get bad luck if i sit with my mom, and giving some grumpy comments on it before we started.

I should probably also mention that he took this creepy picture of me as a naked child, where I'm laying down with my legs spread and my girl part is the focus of the picture. I'm probably around 5 on this picture.

Now I don't know if I'm overreacting with the feet stroking and all that, or if I actually got a reason to be creeped out. I can't shake this feeling off and that's why I'm here, to either get some relief or confirmation.

Back in July, I see his Mom get tagged in a Facebook post by one of John's old 'crazy girlfriends.' A picture of John and a little boy titled 'Daddy and *kids name* playing.' I freak out, thinking this is his child. He assures me that he isn't his father, but that this woman wanted him to be, so while he dated her he was 'daddy' -- said she does that with all of her boyfriends. They didn't work out because she was 'nuts.' I accept this at face value.

John moved to my city (2 hours from where he was previously stationed) to live with me after getting out of the Army. He strongly dislikes the midwest, but stayed to make me happy. Our bargain was that if he attended school here, I would move with him when he graduated college. After that point we would move out of the midwest so he would be able to live close to one of his children (in GA). He also has another child, located in California. No relationship with that one. 

Initially it was great. As my first experience living with a SO, it was a relatively smooth transition. But in March, I caught John talking to another girl. No physical cheating, but heavy sexting - a boundary we both knew was cheating. After finding out, I was obviously devastated. Cancelled the wedding (which was paid for already). He begged, pleaded for another chance. After I took some time, I decide that I loved him enough to try my best to overcome this. Wedding was still off, but in a relationship.

**Fast forward to now.** Things have been getting better, slowly but surely. We've worked on our communication &amp; our relationship is really showing some real signs of progress. He's begun pulling his weight.

But because of the cheating, I still look through his social media stuff (good or bad, I know). Last night I go into his archived Facebook messages, and find one from prior to meeting me... talking about his son that I never knew existed. I knew about two of his children (who he doesn't have a relationship with but wants to with GA baby), but not a third. Turns out he slept with a married woman, she got pregnant. His name is not on the birth certificate, but admits his fatherhood via the messages I saw.

Through these messages, I also find that John has a particular tendency to cheat. As I mentioned, he cheated on me in March. I also see he cheated numerous times on baby-ma-GA while she was pregnant, as well as multiple times on other relationships.

I talk to him about it. Non confrontational. Say I feel like I was lied to, as messages indicate his paternity. He freaks out, flips on the snooping (understandably - but I told him I would be post-cheating). Says the kid isn't his as far as he knows, as they never did full paternity tests. Said she doesn't want him in her life anyway (bc he cheated, go figure), so the kid is not his. Being raised by her husband. Said that I needed to drop it, isn't wasn't any of my business because it pre-dates our relationship.

I tell him that this directly affects our relationship. As we were going to get married, it would have been important to share his paternity, as she could have come after him with a paternity suit / looking for child support. That would have directly affected me. Plus, he lied when I asked him about the kid back in July. He also says the cheating is from a past life. But this only dates back to 2011.

I'm 50/50 on ending things....But he has nowhere to go. He is stuck in a Army Reserves contract in this state for another 2 years and is now enrolled in school. I own his vehicle (he was in a bad spot financially during our engagement, so I helped). He has no money for a down payment for a place and no real income. And he's in this state because of me, with no close family or friends for support.

Am I out of line in that I feel this lie is HUGE and merits an end? I feel like we're in a soap opera. How can you have 3 kids with 3 different women, a tendency to cheat, and still be ready for a functional relationship? (Let alone trying to get married.)

- note, this story may seem familiar - I've posted before. But I ended up sticking it out with him, which is when things got better. Just don't have access to that throwaway anymore.

---

**TL;DR:** Denied a kid was his. He cheated, we decided to work things out. Things start getting so much better. Turns out kid is (likely) his. Says it's none of my business. Am I out of line?

Edit. Thank you everyone for your responses. I'm honestly numb at this point. Terrified to kick him out. Shocked I've let it get this far. But I need to grow the balls &amp; stick up for myself. I am planning to end things when he gets home tonight.

---

**Edit 2:** I broke it off with him, but it's turning into a process. He is saying that he is going to 'fight tooth and nail' to keep trying to make us work. Refuses to move out. I'm holding strong and have threatened to go the legal route, but emphasized I would like to keep it civil.

A few months ago my neighbor asked for my Wifi password when his cable modem was on the fritz.  I gave it to him and quickly forgot about it.  About two weeks ago I plugged an external HDD into my router so I could watch a movie on my TV; HDD had music, videos, and porn on it.

For the last week my neighbor has been cold to me, hasn't said hello when we see each other outside, won't let his kids play with my dogs.  So I ask him, ""What's up?""

He went off on me.  Tells me it's because I'm a pervert, he thinks I'm a child molester, and he doesn't want me near his family.  I live next to this guy, we had great rapport before... mowed each other's lawns, his kids would take my dogs for walks when I had to work late, and I had dinner with his family either at my house or theirs 2-3x a month.

We live in Texas, and my neighbor is Catholic.  He goes to church every week, and has 3 daughters between the ages of 8 and 13.  I can only imagine how much stress it would be to have 3 daughters to look after.  I have a much younger sister, I get that he wants to look out for his family, but... porn is just porn.  While I wouldn't want my sister doing it, it's still fun to watch.

I don't consider the porn that was on there to be anything extreme.  I basically downloaded a bunch of Amateur Allure videos, and some generic main-stream porn videos where the girls are 18-20ish -- Jenna Haze's early stuff, Tori Black, Sensi Pearl...  There was one video, ironically downloaded by my ex-girlfriend, that was a little light bondage... basically just a girl getting fucked while she was tied to a bed.  I'm not sure what all he saw.

I also had a handfull of pictures from an ex-girlfriend (who was in her late 20s) on there, I wasn't in the pictures, and her face wasn't really in any of them.  The pictures were tame, no action shots... just her topless and a few shots of her on all fours.  We recently broke up, but I'm not sure she was around the neighborhood enough for him to recognize the pictures of her.

Any suggestions for ways to fix this?  I gotta live next to the guy... not willing to sell my house over this.  I'm a single guy in a neighborhood full of families, it would suck if his family started spreading rumors.  I'm more worried about people who don't say anything; we're a close cul-de-sac -- happy hours and BBQs with a bunch of families are common.  I know a lot of the stay-at-home moms gossip like school girls.

**TL;DR: Neighbor saw my porn drive, now he's acting really weird.  Looking for advice on how to fix things, or at least insulate myself from hurtful rumors.**

EDIT: His kids only have iPhones and iPads, the only way they would have seen the drive is if they were using his office computer.

1371484181.0,124,self.relationships,1giroh,My ex (32M) and I (29F) just ended a two year relationship. I feel like I have been led on.,tokengingerkid,158,34,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1giroh/my_ex_32m_and_i_29f_just_ended_a_two_year/,"Hey, long time lurker, unfortunately first time poster.


My ex ended things yesterday morning, right after we woke up (for the record, he's 32 and I'm 29 - together since April of 2011). He said that we were nothing more than a glorified friendship, he was no longer attracted to me, didn't love me, and he had felt this way for about 6 months. I asked if there was someone else, and he said yes. While I had been out of town this week, he had been hanging out with a girl from our neighborhood whom he met at his job (a local bar).


I understand his point, and that we had been losing a passion, a spark, whatever you want to call it. I had tried to talk to him about it a few times over the past few months, but he always said things were fine, he was just tired, etc. He told me he's been lying to me because he didn't want to have the conversation. That he feels passion for this new girl and that was the catalyst, not the reason for our breakup. I'm not upset it's over, just angry. I'm angry that he had to wait to replace me before he could talk to me. I'm angry because he's not the person I thought he was. I'm angry that I'm hurting and he's off with her, starting a new relationship. I'm angry that I live across the street from him and have to see them together.


I'm trying to take this opportunity to do what's best for me and get myself back on track, but I was not the most understanding person when he broke up with me yesterday. I called him a coward, I told him he led me on, and I may have said some hurtful things like telling him to go fuck himself. He wanted a hug before he left, and I said no. He said he wanted to be friends and hang out in a couple of weeks, but still no. It's not that I don't want to be friends at some point, but I was taken off guard and this was so easy for him.


The worst part for me was that he told me I was never more to him than a companion. I never impacted his life at all.


I feel so lost. I thought I was going to marry him. We talked about moving in together and our future children. He now says that I forced the conversation. I'm upset that I've been lead on.


Not sure where to go from here, just needed to vent. Thanks, Reddit.

Let's call her ""Kate"". Things have been great with Kate so far, but tonight I saw a side of her that gave me a negative impression. Our school held a small awards show for finalists of an arts competition. Kate and I were finalists. We sat with her family and one of her close friends. This also happened to be the first time I had met her mother so I felt inhibited by having to make a good impression. 

About 15 minutes into the program, Kate begins being a bit too interactive. I had a bad feeling about it the moment that it started because my own mother tends to do the same thing in certain situations and usually ends up embarrassing me. And that's exactly what Kate did. She began shouting really random or slightly offensive comments at the hosts and other finalists as they were receiving awards. I feel that in general, that kind of behavior is a bit ignorant. The first few comments just made me uncomfortable. But when this carried on throughout the show, I felt beyond embarrassed because a fair amount of the audience would give us dirty looks.I also felt a bit helpless because I felt that I couldn't just tell her to stfu because I was trying to retain a positive rapport with her mother. 

All I could think was ""OMG SHUT UP!"" I mean, who does this at an awards show; much less in front of their mother? And though it was a small school sponsored event with mostly classmates and their families, I felt like more respect should have been given, and that drawing attention was the worst thing to do.

About an hour in, I realized that I had began subconsciously trying to detach myself from the situation by looking, and acting as though I wasn't with them and just happened to be seated with them. I even scooted away to the edge of my chair and watched the ceremony more intently (maybe a dick move? I don't think Kate noticed).

After the show was over, her mother and I spoke and she seemed to approve of me. I briefly talked to Kate but didn't really get far into the convo before one of her friends interrupted and basically carried her off. I felt like what happened made it a less than desirable experience and in turn, I felt less attracted to Kate because of this instance of her behavior. Should I talk to her about it? Or am I just being petty?

**TL;DR.**
My gf embarrassed me at a school awards show and I felt helpless to say anything about it because it was also the first time meeting her mother (who we sat with). Interest was lost. Am I being petty or should I talk to her about it?

**UPDATE:**

I had a conversation with Kate about what happened. Unfortunately it wasn't a one on one conversation because her cousin had chosen to come to school with her, but I figured I'd say something anyway. I prefaced by asking her what she thought of the ceremony. She said that enjoyed herself but didn't make much further comment. I went on to say that it was okay but some things could have been better. She asked what could have been better, and I said something along the lines of ""It would have been better if it wasn't as awkward. I had to deal with death glares because of how you were acting."" Her face said it all. She looked like she wanted to go hide under a rock.

I almost felt bad about saying that because of her reaction, but I needed to. I didn't want to make her feel like total crap though so I followed up with ""You should have seen this one woman, she had the gave me the ugliest look, she was all-(then I demonstrated an exaggerated/funny look of disapproval). She nervously laughed. Her cousin then butted in and said ""I think what he's trying to say is that he's not mad at you, but you need to calm your ass down. It's okay to have fun, but you were embarrassing him, and you've done the same to me before."" I said ""I didn't want to be as blunt, and I don't want to seem like I'm coming down on you, but he's right."" Again she gave a kind of defeated expression, so rather than drill the point further, I said ""but it's whatever, the show was okay, it's just that was just really awkward for me."" and then transitioned into a new subject. Shortly after, she left for a class or something. 

About an hour later, while I was speaking with a few friends, she appears and is being a bit animated and acted as though she was competing for my attention. I wasn't really sure how to gauge that. Shortly after that ordeal I left. About 4 hours later I gave her a call to make sure that I didn't hurt her feelings and that she understood where I was coming from. I also made it a point to tell her that though I made it clear where I stood, I also acknowledge that maybe I should lighten up a bit and not get as bent out of shape. She replied by telling me that after thinking about it, she realized how rude she was being and gave a round-about apology. 

After she said what she had to say, I wasn't sure if I was still over-analyzing, but I thought that she may have been more embarrassed that I didn't approve of her behavior, rather than the behavior itself (I also acknowlege that I could be wrong). I left it at that and then continued talking to her for about 30 minutes then ended the call. Now that it's all said and done, I think what may be best at this point is to forgive her actions but to make a note of them and be cautious for repeated/similar behavior, and go from there.

We just moved in together after being together for about 3 years. We kind of work opposite hours for most of the week so finding time for sex can be difficult. It's been about two weeks since we've had sex. 

So this morning i partook in some internet porn surfing. I go to work and she comes home and uses my computer. I didn't clear my history because i felt i had nothing to hide. Well i go to work and my SO texts me saying she found the porn and that she couldn't trust me anymore and she is going to move back to her parents house and she doesn't want to be with someone like me. She said she felt hurt that i wouldn't wait for her. 

I tried explaining that it has nothing to do with her. That just because i watch porn, i still love her and find her attractive. I think she feels as if ive been cheating on her, which i would never do. I've been trying to talk some sense in to her all night but nothing is working. She says she is moving out tomorrow. I know most people are going to say "" she sounds crazy, its for the best"" but i can't just accept that. I love her too much. I just want her to understand that its normal (or at least i assume it is, she has me questioning myself). I don't know how to explain it to her. I'm feeling like the biggest piece of shit right now though and i just want her to stay.

 Other than this we never fight, she is hot, we play video games together all the time and she is good at them. She is perfect for me and the past 3 years have been the best of my life. I can't let it end because of this. She is my best friend. I need help reddit. What should i do? sorry for the wall of text. I just feel i can't tell this my normal friends without it sounding like ""my porn addiction ruined our relationship"". 

**TL;DR: My girlfriend of 3 years is breaking up with me because she found porn on my computer. help.**

UPDATE 2/04 1:58pm. So i talked to her a little bit this morning and tried explaining that the viewing of porn was no way a substitution for her. She said something along the lines of ""its so insulting that i'm not good enough for you and you couldn't wait for me even though i always wait for you and I don't feel special, you make me feel worthless."" She also said she was going to tell her parents the truth about what happened which I think is kind of crossing the line a bit.

Can our issue be resolved, or is this the end?",WWJayZD,169,43,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16kw38/girlfriend26f_surprised_me36m_with_an_ultimatum/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating now for 9 months, but have been friends for at least 2 years before that, and have known each other for even longer.  She lives in a small Midwestern college town in a state that I lived in for 6 years, but hated when I was there.  She has lived there most of her adult life, and the majority of her family also lives there.

About 5 years ago, I moved to a beautiful beach community in a very large city about 2,000 miles away and just absolutely love living there.  Throughout the time we’ve been dating, I’ve expressed my unwillingness to live back in the Midwest – particularly the state where she currently lives.  She also expressed frustration and boredom with living there and living with her parents and “wanted out.”  We’ve spent the last few months having hypothetical discussions of places we should visit and possible places where we could live together and be happy.  We’ve discussed such places as Charlotte, St. Petersburg, Tampa, Charleston, and other major cities where we could both find employment and cities we’d both love living in.


About 3 months into our relationship, my girlfriend’s mother came down with a very serious form of cancer.  She has been helping her mother on a weekly basis with her chemo treatment and other things.  I fully understood – and she made clear – that she couldn’t move anywhere for now, at least until her mother’s treatment ended.  I had no problem with that and was definitely willing to wait.


Over Thanksgiving, I flew out to visit my family, and invited her and her family to come down and have Thanksgiving dinner with us.  I point this out, because I want everyone to know how serious our relationship had gotten just in the few months we were officially dating.  The night after Thanksgiving, we went out on a date.  That night – she dropped the bombshell – She’s not willing to move away any time soon, and if I wasn’t willing to move to where she’s at, then this relationship isn’t going to work.  This was the 1st time she ever expressed to me her desire to have me move there.  I told her at that time that she is asking me to do the one thing that I specifically told her that I wasn’t willing to do, but that I cared enough about her that I was willing to mull it over.  I told her at that time that she should understand that I would not be happy to be moving there, and would only agree to it on a short term basis.  She agreed to give me time to think about it.  


Since then, our relationship has continued happily, and there has been only limited discussion about moving.  We’ve even begun planning our next visit together in early March.


On Friday afternoon, after a day of sending lovey-dovey texts to each other, she calls me to talk.  She basically tells me that something I told her over Thanksgiving has been bothering her, and she wanted to talk to me about it.  She repeated what I said back to her confirming that each item is correct before moving on – 1. I’m still thinking about moving to where she lives and haven’t made the decision to move definitively (CORRECT); 2. Even if I agree to move to her, I wouldn’t be moving happily, and I’d only be willing to move short term (CORRECT); I’m not willing to move there long term, and believe that I would be miserable living there more than a few months or a year (CORRECT).  She said that if that was the case, she sees no future in our relationship, and that I shouldn’t bother visiting her in March.  I ended the conversation with “well, give me a call if you change your mind.”  


After several months of literally talking and texting every single day, I now have not heard from her since Friday.  Is there any way to resolve this, or is this relationship over?

TL;DR: Girlfriend gave me an ultimatum: move to the one state you’ve specifically told me you don’t want to live in again, or it’s over.  Any way to resolve this, or should I move on?

EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of questions as to why I wouldn't want to live where she lives.  Here's the answer I gave below:  My dislike of living there has nothing to do with her.  My career almost requires me to live in a heavy populated area.  It's not the type of employment that is easily transferable.  I hear about nurses who can pick up and move to any major city and can always find employment at a local hospital.  I can't do that - moving to where she lives would likely mean 12 to 18 months of unemployment, or possibly a career change.  During the Spring and Fall, my allergies got so bad while living there that I was in need of 2 different daily prescription medications just to function. During the winter, it gets so cold forcing me indoors the entire time. I'm an outdoors person, and if I can't be out in the sun and enjoying it, I get miserably depressed. The culture, politics, social life, and entertainment options are not to my liking. I found very few people that I had anything in common with, though I spent a great deal of time trying to mix into different social circles. I disliked the homogenous population, and the ""small city"" vibe that even the big cities in the state seem to have. Most important - I didn't like myself or the way I felt when I lived there. I spent my days dreaming of living near a beach or in an interesting city, and when I finally got the chance and moved, my first thoughts were ""Why did it take me so long??""

We've been dating for about a month, and its been really good. He's smart and handsome and nice and everything I want in a boyfriend.

I brought up the topic of exclusivity last night and he said that before we talked about that he had to tell me something. He told me that 7 years ago he spent time in prison for raping a girl. He's 28 and I'm 26.

He told me he didn't have to tell me. He says that he really likes me and that he felt I deserved to know if we're going to try and have a relationship.

He told me he would understand if I walked away and that I was entirely entitled to do that. But he asked that I try to understand that he is not the same person he was then, that he's changed and feels immense guilt about who he used to be.

I was pretty much in shock the whole time he was talking. I tried to ask about what exactly he did and he said he didn't want to talk about it that night. He said that if I would see him again and still wanted to know, he'd tell me all about it, if I was sure thats what I wanted.

He did say however, that:

""You hear a lot about misunderstandings, guys who don't know that what their doing is wrong, false accusations, and ridiculous age of consent traps. This was not my position. I deliberately took advantage of another person. I will not pretend that I am a victim of the system and if imagining that is the only way you can cope with this knowledge it will not work. If we are to have a relationship, you need to try to understand the truth; that I was wrong. That am improving and have improved my self.""

I was having over to my apartment for dinner when this happened. I told him he should leave, and not to call, that I would call him. Now I've spent day in emotional turmoil.

I really like this one.

but she can't do that. no 'contract' she could write up would stand up in court. the only way she can let him off the hook is to claim she does not know who the father is (leave him off the birth certificate) and she's not willing to do that. she's outright refused to do that.**


NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A BIRTH CERITFICATE. This commentor is completely making it up. Never mentioned it ever. Actually, since I didn’t mention it at all, let me clarify that I am not putting his name on anything. Ever. Never planned on it.   
Did he know you didn’t want kids? Yes! Repeatedly told him. Even told him when he proposed that I would never get an abortion. Just like I knew his stance, he knew mine.


 Why does his stance matter more than mine? 


Did you purposely not take your birth control? No. He went with me to every single appointment for my BC shot. Every single one. He saw me get the shot. I can’t fake that. And we used a condom every time. 
So how did you get pregnant? Nothing is 100%. Every time you have sex you run a risk. We took the precautions that we could, but on the packages and leaflets on our methods there are listed fail rates. The shot runs the risk of failing because some people don’t take to hormonal methods of birth control. My doctor confirmed this. My fiancé never had any doubt that I wasn’t taking precautions.


Someone wrote..

 **They used birth control even though she was seemingly sterile and at this point entering menopause. There is absolutely no way you can blame him for not expecting this.**


Entering menopause or about to enter menopause doesn’t automatically make me sterile. I had numerous pregnancies in the past. Obviously I was far from sterile. 
Then why was she using birth control? For the hell of it? He asked me to. I thought it wasn’t an issue because of the menopause thing and the BC. I figured it wouldn’t do any harm. 


Someone wrote…


**Then she'll have to be a single mum and raise a kid who will most likely get screwed up with deep daddy issues. What a selfish bitch, cares more about her own urges than raising a kid in a healthy environment.**


So all kids raised by single parents have deep daddy issues? Were you raised by a single parent? Do you have deep daddy issues? Why am I a selfish bitch for wanting to bring a kid into this world and love it. I have the money, I have the support, I have the good, stable, job, I have the time, I have the effort. I am much more prepared for this than any one else ever.


Someone wrote…


 **I read elsewhere in the thread she may still hit him up for money.
I never wrote that. Someone else assumed that and wrote down that they thought I would. I never said that ever. That actually runs completely contradictory to what I said.** 


**But you are saddling him with a kid that he doesn’t want to exist?** 

So, what is you alternative? Have an abortion? Because that is the only compromise here. Either he gets his way or I keep the baby. In the same way, why would he ask me to get rid of a kid he knows I have been trying to have forever? He knows I want kids. Why does he get what he wants? Why do his needs matter above mine? 

Someone wrote..


**He trusted someone who was apparently onboard with this.
I made it repeatedly clear to him that I wasn’t on board and would never get an abortion. He never trusted I would. We discussed it at length. He knew I wouldn’t ever.** 


**Why don’t you sign away his rights?** 

Because that is not how the law works. At least not in my state. I can’t just draft a paper and have him sign away that. I couldn’t even get a lawyer to do it because it wouldn’t be legal in my state. For the courts to recognize his right to terminate his parental rights I would have to remarry and have that person adopt the baby. 

**So then remarry and do that?** Yeah. Ok. I will just head right out and marry the first guy I see and have him take over the rights to the kid. It’ll be no problem. Come on. You are adults. You know it doesn’t work like that. 


Someone wrote…

 **you've said repeatedly in this thread, whenever anyone mentions that if you really wanted to absolve him of his responsibility you could only do it by not putting him down as the father, that you will not do that and that you feel he should have to deal with the consequences becuse he 'stuck his dick in you for 2 years'. and i agree, and so does the law, he IS legally responsible. but i wish you would stop portraying yourself as the poor put-upon victim while claiming to be doing nothing that will alter his life in any way.**


Never did I play the victim. It took two people to make this kid. One isn’t in it. Fine. I got this myself. I had a tough history of pregnancy. I think I have a right to be mad at him for asking me to abort it. Just as he has a right to be mad that I would not get an abortion. You made the villain. I never once portrayed myself as a victim here. 


Someone wrote..

**To be fair we only have one side of the story in which she is not going to put herself in a negative light. From what she said the guy is handling it poorly but she hasn't exactly been upfront with him either with something that whether he likes it or not will change his life.**

I actually will provide his side in the comments. Although I suspect people will then call me liar. You have no reason to believe me, but you have no reason to doubt either. Read his side below or not. I honestly don’t care. 

**Someone wrote about him not wanting a kid out there ever.** Again, you are assuming. I never said anything. He said he didn’t want kids because they were hard, not that he didn’t want anyone out their with his DNA ever. He has donated sperm before so that probably already happened.    


So, to clarify again. He doesn’t have to do anything. I never requested him anything but a parting of ways. I never said  I claim him as the father. I never said I would force him to do anything. Other people said that to further their agendas, their points. It is so easy to create what you want to see out of any situation. I know he is scared and confused and it is tough on him. I know this. It sucks for both us. 


We both made ridiculously bad choices in this, but they are choices we knowingly made together. 


I never asked anybody their opinion on the abortion. I wanted to know how to deal with a break and make it easier for my fiancé. So he could find peace and be happy with whatever choice he made. How does that make me a selfish bitch? How does that make me a bad person? 
I got a lot of supportive responses and those were nice. Thank you to everyone how offered real advice and constructive criticism without assuming and filling in the gaps with their own agenda. 

Now for the update..

He called again. This time I confronted him about his constant calls about the abortion. He admitted that was a bit mean and unnecessary. We met up. We talked. Really talked. He is confused and scared and so am I. We talked about why he didn’t want a child. We talked about why I did. We talked about why I didn’t tell him. We talked about our relationship. We talked about what we wanted in the future. We had talked about this all before but never in this context. 

He accepted I would never get an abortion. He was fine with that. After the smoke cleared and with the feelings back to calm he was able to see my reasoning. And I understood his. This man isn’t an ass or villain. Neither am I. We are just too people who now have a situation where a big decision has to be made, and we are trying to handle that as best that we can. 

He came home that night (last night). To clarify, we had this discussion last evening. Things are going to be tough for us to both adjust to for a time. He wants in my life. He loves me. He isn’t going to leave when things get tough because, “ that isn’t the man I am.” We made a few concessions/compromises. I am not getting an abortion because that wouldn’t be a compromise. We are having the baby. We are still getting married in March. I am giving him a bit more space and patience for adjusting to the baby. It will take him time. Hell, it’ll take me time. We are waiting until 20 weeks to tell his family so that we don’t get anyone too hopeful. If we miscarry, we won’t try again. We can try adoption later (before I turn 45) If this baby comes to term, they will have the most loving parents ever who will raise it together.     

Things worked out. And I am happy with the results. I am happy that he has found peace and that I don’t have to choose between my future husband and my baby. Until then we both move forward to looking towards a hopeful future. He has actually gotten a little bit excited. Said the kid had to go to his university so he could start a tradition. Although, I would rather they got to mine ( Smith!). 

And more importantly, this kid is going to be so wanted and loved by his parents, and some many other people.   

Again, thanks for all the support! Some people sent me some amazing and lovely private messages that I plan to answer very soon because it means a lot to me that you took the time to care and read about my situation. Even if you couldn’t offer advice, you made my day and helped me remain calm until he and I could sort the situation out. People make ridiculously choices and say ridiculous things when under pressure. I know he shouldn’t have pressured me into an abortion. He admits is wrong there. I should have told him immediately. I was wrong for that. We understand we should have really, really taken into account each other’s stance. We messed up. We are human. But it happened and now we are making the best of it. 

I plan to update again near the end of the pregnancy to let everyone know how it went. Also, I am already bumping! I have a very thin and short so I am already showing. YAY! Keep your fingers crossed that this one is my lucky one. Thank you! 

On a side note: Does anyone know a good place in Washington to get any of those wonderfully amazing pregnancy pants? I want to try them on first. I remember those being so comfy.

1354539122.0,119,self.relationships,1474vl,Mom(f??) accuses me(M21) of being same perverted kid who spied on her in the shower half a lifertime ago.,throwthrowgogomo,192,73,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1474vl/momf_accuses_mem21_of_being_same_perverted_kid/,"I got into an argument today with my folks over something another family member did. From there my family started to branch off into the old wounds that we've caused each other, when my mother starts absolving herself of all her wrong-doings and pawns them off on our father. I remind her that he's fucked up a lot in his life, but that doesn't erase her own mistakes and it won't do anyone any good if she didn't acknowledge things. I guess that was enough to set her off to reminding me that she's never mentioned any of my ""peculiarities"" in the past (her word choice). She did this in front of my other family members. They looked around rather confused for a few moments and then continue on with the argument. All while I'm reeling from her betrayal and mounting rage. What are my peculiarities, you ask?

That's a story that stretches far back. But it boils down to me having poor impulse control as a child (10 or 11) and groping my mother's bottom on a few occasions. Honestly, it was big and I was stupid. I realized then what I did was wrong, but then set about being good and had no problems until around 13, when she caught me spying on her in the shower. My older sister got involved and together they helped set me right and life was peachy until then. Well, there was an incident where one sibling accused me of spying on my sister while she changed as a joke (I honestly didn't do that, and they had no way of knowing that had been an issue in the past) which set off my mother and infuriated me at life's cruel cosmic irony.

But, there are more layers to our little perverted onion of a story. You see, I can't explain the groping thing other than me just being weird. In other words, if there was a reason, I don't know what it is.

But the other thing, I understand quite well. I've always been blessed with self-awareness. Or maybe I mean cursed. My mother was very physically abusive. The kind where I look back and it seems almost comical how often I was hit. But that's not all. No, she was also emotionally abusive. Punishments were not based on proportion of offense but on how she felt that day. I would often stand in the corner for hours on end. She was also tell me how evil and shitty I was and how I would ""end up just like my father"" (more on him later). I even remember being stripped down to my underoos because she thought I was being ungrateful for what I had. I realize now that she perceived any amount of personal agency and independence on my part as some kind of personal insult to her. (Additional Fun Facts!: We were also part of a cult. My emotionally absent father (he was still in the house, just a drunken non-presence for much of my life, and then a ball-less presence after that) was a survival nut who boarded up the windows and was afraid the government was watching him and that the NWO would start any day.)

Anyway, I hated her so much. I hated feeling weak and powerless. Getting hit often, punished arbitrarily, and told how awful you were makes you feel very powerless. So, I don't remember why, but it occurred to me that if I saw her naked, it would change the dynamic. I wouldn't be powerless. So, I spied on her in the shower. When I was caught, she thought it was just a sex thing, and I went along with it because I knew that the power angle I was coming from was so much worse. I think I was ashamed of how weak I felt.

I've always carried so much shame and guilt about this. I mean, I know that I'm fucked up and scarred because of my origin story. I attribute my strong BDSM leanings, and fascinations with power and sex as probably having stemmed from my past. But I don't worry about that so much now. I've read alot on r/Sex that's help me come to terms with things.

So, she reminds me of my ""peculiarities"" and then glares at me for the duration of the conversation. I should point out that I'm furious at this point. Partly, because I had put this behind me and refused to address it (I was afraid I of what I'd see in myself, I guess). Secondly, that she brought up what she must know is an awful, shame-ridden part of my life so easily. She should know better too. She was molested as a child (I'm aware that my antics couldn't have been received well, considering this fact. I felt even more shame when I learned about that) and my father would just casually remind her that she was ""no saint"" and shit like that. She has never forgiven my father for that treatment. Eventually, the argument breaks and after I tell her that I'm furious, and that she's shit and no better than my dad. She counters that I'm the shitty person, and that I'm no different than what I was then I'm manipulative and pretty much proto-Voldemort. I'm even angrier, but I've had enough. I tell her not to come by later and apologize for her horseshit once she's pulled herself together (her favorite tactic: Say awful things and then take them back while making sure you take blame for participating in the argument).

I've been thinking about this all day. I don't think I'm a bad person. I'm aware this is a throwback to the way she would treat me as a child by trying to convince me I'm worthless, but I can't shake it so easily. I'm proud of who I am, and love my life. I've overcome many problems. I was able to piece together my self-confidence. And I overcame depression and suicidal urges (I came close a couple of times. Really close. Side note, if you ever watch ""A Single Man"" you'll see a Colin Firth-version of my problems with suicide: so messy!) but I didn't kill myself. That was something I suffered alone because I wouldn't share that with my family (and yeah, like I chump I thought about how awful it would be for them if I died) and none of them seemed to notice or care what I was going through. As a matter of fact, they did notice, but just called me an asshole for the was I behaving.

I'm a good person, or at least I try to be, I'm respectful of others. And I try to do the right thing. I was even able to create a somewhat stable and pleasant relationship with her and my dad until this point.

But, I see no right action here. Just an endless mire of broken people and misery. Any thoughts people? Any advice or points of view I may have missed would be appreciated. I'm going to get some sleep right now. It's been a long day.

**TL;DR Mother accuses me of being same perverted kid who spied on her in the shower nearly half my life later. I'm feeling a bit shaken and sad by this.**

EDIT: Thank you for all your support everyone. You've helped me work through the feeling of guilt. Knowing that I wasn't alone in my actions, also helped. I also realize that the guilt I've been carrying all these years is disproportional to what I did as I child.

Clarifying a few things: I'm currently living at home. I committed to moving out and getting my shit together a few years back, actually as soon as I felt I could make it on my own, but I was injured and had a long convalescence (like, a year and a half in total) which completely set me back. So, moving out in the immediate to near future is not possible for me. However, it is a priority. I think I'll have to make what space I can in my life while I'm here and I'll be civil with my parents. But I know it's different. My mother last any last vestiges of respect from me yesterday. But, maybe I'm weird, I can still be civil (actually, more civil) with people I don't respect/feel close to.

I want to go into therapy. I was convinced that after I only had a very weak (like the notion ""hey, offing yourself is a way out of this) suicidal urge every few months (usually in response to stress) that didn't last very long, that I didn't need therapy. But I realize I would benefit from it. I'm starting to get more money coming in, and I'm going to travel more out of my shitty small town, so It's something I'm going to make a priority. Once again, thank you all.

EDIT 2: I'm not going to seek therapy with her, or my father, or anyone else. I don't think it will help the situation all that much, and if I get to the point where I completely understand and forgive all that they've done, I don't think I'll want to spend much time with them then either.

And for those that expressed the sentiment that you don't want to see me wind up a bitter asshole (I'm paraphrasing) thanks.

I was with my ex for 9 months. It ended 3 years ago followed by another 8ish months of contact after she cheated on my and strung me along. I cut her out of my life completely. My fiancee and I met over 5 years ago and started dating a few months after I quit contacting the ex. Out relationship is fantastic and I have no worries about it. We've been engaged for a few months now and living together for almost a year.

Here's where things get tricky. At the beginning of June, my ex sent me an email out of the blue. She was looking to reconnect. I showed my fiancee and did not respond. However, fiancee was curious and asked if I minded her contacting my ex on fb. They chatted back and forth for several messages. None of that was a big deal. Apparently, my ex recently found out we were engaged. She sent a LONG rambling letter talking about how ""emotionally unstable"" I am and how big of a mistake it would be for my fiancee to marry me. Wtf? It was a long diatribe of the most self serving, arrogant bullshit I've ever had the displeasure of reading. In the letter she made up a lot of things. Such as during our relationship I said I bought an engagement ring...no.

My fiancee and I spoke about the letter of course. She knows that it's bullshit and trusts me(rightfully so) and blocked the ex on fb. Ex went on to hang out with my friend who introduced us out of the blue and tried to stir up more shit.

I don't give a shit about my ex. She's a despicable indiviual who warrants absolutely no respect from me. However, it pisses me off that her letter upset my fiancee. Granted, she got over it the next day, but it makes me boil that this girl is trying to cause me more trouble after all the shit she put me through.

I guess my question is, anyone been through something similar? I'm wondering if it's worth telling the ex in no uncertain terms to get the hell out of my life, or if it's best to let sleeping demons lie.

Writing this has helped me to sort out what I'm feeling into a more orderly fashion, and I've tried to arrange it in a readable, easy to digest way; it would mean a lot if you read it and gave me your 2 cents!

OUR RELATIONSHIP:
My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 4 months, and everything has been wonderful. He is a very sweet, gentle, open and generous person. We communicate effectively and haven't fought; any time an issue (only very small things so far) has come up it has been dealt with in a positive, constructive manner. He has demonstrated his commitment to our (still fairly new) relationship, and I haven't experienced any jealousy due to his friendship with other girls. In short, I feel strongly that I can trust him, and our relationship has been very positive and fulfilling thus far.



THEIR HISTORY:
My boyfriend dated his ex for about 2 years, from when he was 19 to 21. They had a very amicable breakup; he describes it as a transition from a romantic relationship to a friendship, or one where he views her more as a sister than anything else. They are in regular contact, and she remains one of his closest friends. In my last relationship, many fights (and my jealousy issues) were propagated from my boyfriend's friendship with his ex, but my experience with my current one has been very different. I haven't felt threatened by their friendship, probably because he is open about it, yet doesn't talk about her too often; it seems that he treats her the same way he would treat any other platonic friend, which I can't find fault in.



THE CURRENT SITUATION:
My boyfriend's ex lives quite far from where we do, and soon she will be visiting for about a week. For the first 3 days she will be staying at my boyfriend's property. For the rest of the week I assume she'll be around here and there, but she also has other business to attend to in our area. My boyfriend told me he wants me to meet her, and to spend time with the two of us together.

At first I wasn't opposed to the idea, but then he told me about a recent conversation they'd had. While he feels 100% past their relationship, and genuinely views her as a friend now and nothing more (and I believe he's being honest when he says this, we've had conversations about it and I can go in to further detail if necessary), he told me she said she still feels that she has ""doors to close"" because the past year has been difficult and she hasn't found ""anything close to what they had"". I imagine this feeling for her is also intensified given the fact that he is now involved with me, yet she still hasn't found a new love interest. The way my boyfriend put it, is that he thinks she needs to see him in the life he's living now in order to impress the present upon her, and to help her to stop idealizing the past and find closure. She also told him she is genuinely happy for our relationship and doesn't want to cause any awkwardness or resentment due to her visit.



MY PROBLEM:
The more I think about this situation, the bigger the knot in my stomach grows. There are about 5 things that keep reoccurring in my mind as I mull it over:

1. While I fully trust my boyfriend, I think it would still be difficult for me to be around a past lover of his, especially one who he is still close to and has so much history with. I don't have a problem with the two of them being friends, but I feel that it may be overwhelming for me to meet her in person and see them together. Especially because I strongly suspect she doesn't view him the same way he views her; perhaps she wants to move on, and is making an effort to continue a normal platonic friendship with him, but I keep getting the feeling that a lot of romantic feelings are still present on her end. While I don't perceive her as a threat to my relationship, or feel that she would try to undermine it, I simply don't wish to see or experience another person having those feelings for my boyfriend.

2. My boyfriend practically said that he encouraged her to come visit so that she could get realize the past is the past, and she could achieve closure and move on. I think my boyfriend believes meeting me would help her to gain perspective by cementing the fact that he has a new serious girlfriend. I don't feel comfortable with my presence being used as a sort of aid to help her achieve closure; I feel like it isn't really my business, and it puts me in a strange position. It almost makes me feel like I'd only be there to ""stake my claim"" so to speak, which I feel shouldn't be necessary if I trust my boyfriend to be firm and not cross any boundaries. On top of that I think it would probably make the visit that much less enjoyable for her, to see her ex with another girl, and I don't want to make her sad. If she is going to get closure, can't she do that without having to see me in the flesh?

3. There is always the other option that this visit won't bring her closure at all, and will instead only make her want to be with him again even more. My boyfriend's whole idealistic plan that this stay will help her to realize she needs to move on could totally backfire. I don't really like to think about this option.

3. The age difference makes this situation even harder navigate. My boyfriend is the median between us. I still consider myself a girl, while his ex is a grown woman. We are on completely different levels and in different stages in our lives; I just don't really know how I'd even go about interacting with her. It's just such a strange and intrinsically uncomfortable situation any way you look at it. All I see happening is both of us experiencing very intense emotions during these 3 days, none of them hostile necessarily, just hard to handle. And both of us will be reaching out to my boyfriend for support. Doesn't he owe that support to me in this event?

4. If I don't meet her, I feel like it will be on my mind all day while she's there. I don't want to feel like I'm running away from something, yet I don't see how meeting her would be beneficial to anyone involved.

Also, should I ask my boyfriend if she could stay the night somewhere else for the first 3 days of her visit, instead of on his property? He asked me in the beginning if this made me uncomfortable, and said he would gladly make other arrangements if that was the case. At first I didn't think I had a problem with it but now I'm unsure. I do trust him to be faithful and that he doesn't want to be involved with her in that way any longer, but perhaps it would help me to feel more comfortable, and would probably be better for her anyways so that she may sort out her thoughts in a removed environment.



IN CLOSING:
I really just am not sure what to do. It doesn't help that my boyfriend can get along with just about anyone in just about any situation, and perhaps he forgets that isn't how it works for everyone. I think he sees this as two parts of his life coming together and she and I will hit it off and everything will be dandy, but I really don't think he's being realistic. Even though I think both his ex and I want to be positive and don't wish to hurt anyone, emotions will be heightened no matter what, there's no way around it. So what do I do? Is this too much for my boyfriend to ask of me, in the early stages of a relationship? Do I suck it up and try my best? Am I over thinking all of this? Any advice is welcome, I've never really been in a position like this before.

ALSO I haven't had a chance to express all this to him yet, because he told me about this 2 days ago and I haven't had the opportunity to see him. I want to have this conversation with him in person, not over the phone. He's supposed to be coming over tomorrow.

TL;DR Boyfriend of 4 months wants me to meet his ex who he had a 2 year relationship with and is 10 years my senior. They had an amicable breakup and maintain a close friendship; he sees her like a sister. Soon she will be visiting for a week. She needs closure, and I'm afraid she'll only want him more after this visit. The age difference makes me feel even unsure of how interactions would go. I'm nervous and uncomfortable about the whole situation, and I feel I'd rather not meet her, but I have no idea what to do. Help?

**EDIT: I have read all of your comments, and I truly appreciate all of the input. I haven't made a concrete decision as to what action I will take regarding the actual visit, but I will take your advice and clearly lay all of this out on the table when I talk to my boyfriend. The comments seem to be advocating for one of two things; either not meeting her, as it could create problems and be more heartache than it's worth, or for meeting her since it would demonstrate my maturity and commitment to the relationship, and she is a part of his life which I need to accept. I continue to find validity and sound advice in both of these kinds of comments; I'm still leaning towards not meeting her, but these comments have given me the idea of possibly meeting her for a very short amount of time, simply to make my presence known and have met her so I don't have to awkwardly avoid her all week and possibly do it later on down the line. I'm still not sure about this idea though.

( we all live together in his parents home) everyone but myself was drinking and we were all having a good time. About an hour ago we all said goodnight and went to our separate rooms. 

When myself and my bf (S) got to our room he immediately went to bed. I browsed the Internet for a little while and then decided to go to bed too. Once I got in bed S decided to roll over and cuddle with me but I hold him to stop because he smelled like alcohol and I don't like the smell.
 
He then proceeded to literally push me off the bed and tell me to leave because "" you don't live here. This is my bed. You're just a guest. Get out. I don't love you."" I don't have a car or anywhere else to go. At the moment I am just curled on the couch in the living room trying to decide what to do.


**tldr; bf got drunk and pushed me out of bed and told me to get out of his parents house**

**update** he just came out to pee and asked why I was on the couch. When I told him I was out here because he kicked me out he got upset. I asked why he kicked me out and be told me that we should talk in our room about it. We walked back and i asked him again. He told me that he said all of it because 

* I don't touch him enough

* I never want sex when he does 

* I didn't drink earlier after he tried multiple times to get me to and I still said no

* I act ""too uptight and all his friends complain about me ""

* I don't find the same things fun as he does 

I started to cry again and he got up in a huff and went to play a game online with his friends . I'm back in the living room. Once it gets earlier I'm going to call a friend to get me.

[New Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cixq7/22f_and_other_friends_who_are_trying_to_save_a/)
Thank you all for the advice. It really helped put it in perspective. 

So we told him.  We had to do it online because he doesn't really like meeting up without it being planned.  We managed to get her to give our fake profile guy her skype name.  We decided it would be good to get a screenshot of her to prove to James* that it was her we were speaking to.  
We compiled everything into a folder and added him to our group conversation.  He was on skype already, which means James was speaking to her while she was talking to us.  

What we said:  Hi James. We are sorry but we have betrayed your trust in a most horrendous way. We have found some things we think you should see.  We are here if you need to talk and we are truly, truly sorry. 

We also sent the folder.  He never replied to us. 

We assume he is now confronting her. We wait patiently, more and more. Still nothing.  Then we notice that he was deleted his facebook.  Also, his 'girlfriend' has deleted her dating site account. His phone is off and he signed out of skype. 

Basically, It appears he has chosen. He chose her.  It looks like they are going to work it out.  He'll most likely get into contact in a few days.  I'll update again when we eventually hear from him.  

TL;DR:  Friend isn't talking to us. His girlfriend deleted her dating site page. For now, we are taking that to mean He chose her over his friends of 10 years.

First, I really want to thank everyone who replied to my post.  I appreciated every word, even the not-so-kind ones, and your replies may very well have saved my SO's life, and saved our baby from losing her father.  

It's been about a month since I posted, but it feels like it's been years.  I did end up moving out of his house a few hours after my edit.  I didn't say anything to warn him beforehand--just called up my brother and father to help me move all of my things out, and I've been staying with my parents since.  It was a coward's way of dealing with the situation, but given how many times I'd tried to leave before, I felt it was the best thing I could do.  

My SO called me as soon as he found out I was gone.  I think it goes without saying that he was livid pissed.  I had to convince him not to come to my parents' house and drag me back home, which was no easy task.  After having a very long conversation over the course of a few days, I managed to get him to go to a doctor.  

It turns out that he has Type II Diabetes, and has been having mini-strokes for a while--we don't know exactly how long.  I didn't know, but apparently the two go together like peanut butter and milk.  Most likely he developed the diabetes years ago, and it eventually led to the strokes.  Looking back, it probably should have been the first thing that occurred to me.  He has a strong family history of strokes on his father's side of the family, and diabetes on his mother's.  I knew this for a long time, but it just didn't click that it could be the cause of his dramatic change in behavior.  I feel like shit that I let it go on for so long without urging him to get to a doctor sooner.  

Since we found out, he's started treatment for the diabetes, and has taken preventative measures against the strokes as well.  He's stopped smoking, changed his diet significantly, started exercising, and is taking insulin and medication for high blood pressure.  He's also going to therapy sessions for people who have been victims of strokes--from what I understand, it's something similar to rehab.  It seems to be helping with his moods, but the jury is still out on whether it's because of the medical treatments or because he wants me to come home--maybe it's both.   

I'm about a month from my due date now, and strongly considering moving back if things keep moving in a positive direction.  It'd be really great to be able to have him drive me to the hospital whenever I go into labor.  I'm not sure yet, though.  It's only been a month, and I'm scared that if I move back too soon, he'll lose his motivation to keep working to get better.  I guess we'll see in the next couple weeks.

**TL;DR:  My SO was having severe mood swings, which ended up being caused by a combination of high blood sugar and strokes.  He has since sought medical assistance, and seems to be doing much better.  I'm hoping to be able to move back home with him if things continue to improve.**",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_19so26,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19so26/update_my_so_has_completely_lost_his_shit_since_i/,
1359117553.0,121,self.relationships,1793i0,I [25m] just realized I am a controlling boyfriend to a wonderful girl [25f].  I need help.,controllingboyfriend,149,28,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1793i0/i_25m_just_realized_i_am_a_controlling_boyfriend/,"Like the title says, I realized from a recent reddit post (can't find it right now) that I am a controlling boyfriend.  We've been together for about a year, but have known each other for almost a decade. 

Things I do:
- I check her phone/email
- I constantly look at her facebook
- I try to find out where she is and what she's doing at ALL times
- I live down the street from her, and when she says she'll be home, sometimes, I go down the street to see if she really is home.

I always rationalized this by telling myself that it's because of how our relationship first started and a few things that's going on that's making me question her.

- When we first began dating, there was a guy that was really into her.  He often invited her out to hang out, and she went.  They hooked up once, while her and I began courting (do people still use that word?) but I thought that once we got together, it would stop.  We started dating, and she one day told me she was hanging out with a few friends, turns out she and the guy and his friends went out, where they talked about her feelings for him.  When he asked if she was dating anyone, by reflex, she told him no (her words).  I figured it was a knee jerk reflex not to hurt his feelings, but didn't make me feel any better.  They don't talk/hang out anymore, but the weird feeling lingers with me.  They do, however, work in the same bldg, and those ""what ifs"" stay with me as well.

- Her old crush.  She had a crush on this guy almost a year ago, and he on her, but nothing ever happened.  Still, to this day, however, they talk regularly.  This is all on me, however, because nothing is going on between them, but still, I can't shake it whenever he calls or she calls him.

- Coworker/boss.  This guy was interested in her when she first started working there, and we had some weird issues where he invited her out to lunch, then breakfast, then coffee, etc. etc.  I told her that something felt off about this guy, and it took her a while, but she, too realized, that he didn't invite anyone else out for lunch/breakfast, so I guess it worked out.  But again, weird suspicious feelings linger whenever he calls/texts/emails for work.

- Her best guy friend.  She had a best guy friend, and I knew this, and was ok with it.  They talk almost daily, text regularly, call regularly, and at times, video chat with one another.  I was ok with all of it until she told me, a few weeks into the relationship, that they had hooked up a few times.  He is still and has been in a relationship for the past 5 - 6 years, so it means that she ""helped him cheat.""  To her, it means nothing, but it aggravates me.  

Whew.  So with all that said, she is a wonderful girl.  I am genuinely happy with her, and her with me.  The trouble is, however, I'm at this weird lukewarm place where some days, I look at myself and think, ""She's too awesome to hurt me.  She would never,"" and I move on, but there are days where I think back on those issues and it puts me in a weird dark place. 

So...help?

TL;DR - [25f] girlfriend and I [25m] have had a few hiccups in the relationship from the start that made me start question her and have very little trust in her.

He only just got back to the states last month, and we've been sexually active for about that long.

When he wants sex, he touches me or kisses me until I want it, too. (Even if I'm driving, and repeatedly tell him to cut it out or we'll die in a fiery crash.) 

If I want sex and he doesn't, he just kind of shrugs it off and doesn't really care. I can't do anything to get him interested in it... Even if he does get aroused, he holds back, just to tease me. Not the fun teasing that ends in sex. The horrible teasing that ends in a cold shower.

He heckles me and asks me for anal sex and blowjobs consistently. I usually comply with his requests.

But, if I want to be fingered, given oral, or otherwise played with, he refuses. He says that he doesn't want to go down on me because ""That's disgusting."" He usually has no interest in fingering me or playing with me. 

He doesn't care at all if I have an orgasm, which is disappointing to me. Sexy times basically consist of him kissing me a few times, then thrusting into me (usually dry.) and continuing to thrust until he has an orgasm. At which point he just stands up and goes to play video games.

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend is really only interested in his orgasms. Doesn't care if I get off, or if I'm even aroused.**

We are both in our late twenties.  

I love most things about my girlfriend except one thing, she appears to have no real life friends.  What I mean by that is, she never goes to hang out with or talk with friends, and she doesn't publicly pursue activities or hobbies with friends.  

Her ""best friend"" she told me lives in another state, and they have not seen each other in over four years, and barely spoken on the phone.  So sorry, but that doesn't count for the purposes I'm discussing.

Most of her socializing takes place via Facebook, or coming with me to hang out with my friends, or at her job.  But she appears to have no personal close friends that she can go hang out with and talk to.  I don't expect her to be a social butterfly, however I feel that everyone should have these kinds of closer friends, and I'm worried about her not having that outlet in her life.  

This situation puts a lot of pressure on me.  I am always the one who has to be her outlet all the time.  She never gets outside opinions from other friends, and she has no one to talk to about me.  If her and I ever have an argument or some tension, she has no one to talk to about it.  

At this point in our relationship, no major problems have occurred because of this.  But I feel like it's only a matter of time.

I'd like to hear from others, male or female, whose significant others didn't seem to have any close personal friends.  How did it affect your relationship?  What came of it?  Do you think it contributed to the relationship ending (if it did)?

1371706859.0,121,self.relationships,1gplvi,UPDATE My gf (24f) broke up with me and my (24m) suspicions were confirmed,HeartbrokenInCollege,153,32,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gplvi/update_my_gf_24f_broke_up_with_me_and_my_24m/,"[Read or skim before continuing](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f4ej3/i_24m_was_recently_told_by_my_girlfriend_24f_that/)

A few days after her ""I don't know"" text, I decided to start texting her casually and see where it goes. It was nice to talk to her and hear that she still had interest in what was going on in my life. I unfortunately mistook her willingness to talk to me as a reason to be hopeful. However, deep down I could tell she was being distant. After a few weeks of casually texting, I gave her a call and asked her to go to lunch. I was sick of wondering about everything and figured lunch would give us an opportunity to see each other and talk things out.

We met at a half way point and ate lunch. While things seemed somewhat normal, it was pretty obvious it wasn't completely the same. After we ate I took her to my car and spoke to her from the heart, telling her that I wanted to be with her and if she needed more time, I'd give her more time. Then she dropped the bombshell of ""I still love you and want you in my life, but I'm not sure if I'm still IN love with you."" While it hurt, I believe that feelings like that are normal in a long relationship and can be worked on. We continued to talk for a few minutes and then she said that she had to leave to meet one of her girlfriends that lived close by. She told me to call her the next day and we would continue to talk things out and figure out what to do next. At this point, I knew what was going to happen, but I wanted the closure that talking may bring. 

The next day, I decided that I wouldn't have that conversation over the phone. After three years, I felt like i deserved to be broken up with in person. I thought it was cowardly for her to want to do it over the phone. I called her and told her this. She told me to drive down in a week and we would discuss things. I didn't like the thought of waiting a week, but I agreed. I wanted some answers. 

During that week, I really started to think she was seeing someone else. While it didn't seem like something she'd do, and telling someone to wait a month or so for them and then seeing someone else is pretty shitty, I saw some signs. She was secretive about her phone at lunch, vague about plans that she had, and had some mysterious new guy friends that she never had mentioned before. I decided that I had to find out about that when we talked, too. 

So the day arrived and I drove the hour to go see her. I got in her apartment and noticed pictures of us and pictures that she had drawn for me were taken off of her fridge. I already knew I was going to get dumped, but that hurt for some reason. She then asked where I wanted to eat. Of course I didn't want to eat at all, I was too nervous and I didn't want to prolong it. But we went out anyway and she was very chatty the whole time. That confused me but I tried my best to not get any sort of hope. When we got back to her apartment, we sat down and talked. She mentioned reasons that she wasn't happy with our relationship that she had never verbalized before, yet wasn't willing to try to work on things and give it another shot. I found this to be frustrating but eventually I got the point and put my shoes on to leave. Then I decided I had to ask if there was someone else. 

When she didn't immediately answer, I knew the truth. She nodded her head and started to cry. Immediately my mood went from sad to angry. However, I think I did a very good job at concealing that anger. She said that they were ""talking"" and only since the break started. I didn't want any details, but it was apparent that they were doing more than just holding hands or kissing at a bar and I also could tell that they had been talking for longer than she was saying. She said she wanted the break because she was scared she would cheat if she hadn't. In my opinion, she should have broken it off completely instead of the ""break"" bullshit. It also hurts to know that she's throwing away a three year relationship for someone she met a few months ago. She said that she saw things in him that she wasn't getting from me, but she never even communicated those things to me. She also admitted that he was the real reason she wasn't willing to give it a second shot with me, even though she had previously claimed that she wanted to be single for a while. It hurts that she wasn't going to tell me about him until I asked. 

So I gave her a hug, a kiss on the forehead and held her while she cried for a minute. I told her that I wouldn't be talking to her for sometime. I thought that if she knew that, she would also not talk to me. Then I left. The very next day she texted me, but I did not respond. I have decided no contact is the best way to go for a couple of reasons. First, it will not prolong my pain and drag things out. Second, (and you may see that I am still in a little bit of denial with this one) if I keep talking to her it could push her more towards the new guy as well as make me seem needy, and no one likes that. From my experience, whatever she has with this new guy is likely to not last and by not talking to her it may make her realize what she misses. I am holding out no hope for her to crawl back, however. Lastly, no contact will prevent me from expressing any sort of anger or resentment. There is no need for that. 

I was pretty broken up about it at first, but lately I've been positive. If we are meant to be together, maybe someday we will be, but now is not the time and I must focus on myself, not her. At the very least, I know that this woman will be in my life at some point as a friend, it will just require me to get completely over her first. This will also give me time to focus on improving myself. 

Overall, I would say the break up was actually quite civil. It is also nice that now I do not have to worry as much and have some closure. There really only is one thing to do and thats just to move on and avoid contact. If anyone has any more advice or suggestions, that would be awesome.

**LAST EDIT: Seriously, thanks for all of the support and wake up calls. I've got to actually do work now, so I won't be responding, but I already feel lighter.  Time to put this whole ordeal behind me and focus on my future with someone better.**

I'm honestly at the end of my rope... apologies if this is disjointed, rambling and incoherent, but I need to vent and ask advice!!

Quick background.

My GF and I started dating in high school.  We took each other's virginities, we were each other's first real relationship.  We were as serious as a HS relationship could be, but I broke it off when we went to college, unwilling to do long distance. 

During college, we both messed around, but her much more than me.  I suppose it did bother me a little bit, but I was doing the same thing.  After 2 years of this, we reconnected over the summer and started dating exclusively again until today. 

So on to the problems...

Over these past 3 or so years she's cheated multiple times.  A couple of times she was drinking with friends and ""blacked out"" and ended up waking up in some guys bed (I do believe this is what actually happened).  Okay, I didn't fault her for that, I honestly consider that rape and I blame the dudes for taking advantage of her.  I've caught her sending dirty IM's, texts, and even found reference to a skype call that she made to an old hookup buddy. It's gotten to the point where I actually don't remember the amount of times she's cheated.  

The worst part is, I'm always the one to find out.  She told me willingly about the blackout episodes, but I've taken to checking her phone periodically (I know a great deal more about technology than her, so no matter if she thinks she deleted something if I hunt around long enough I can tell what she's been up to).  

After the first time I told her that as long as she was honest with me, there would be a chance to work through it. But time and time again I trust her.  

For the past week or so I get a bad feeling and decide to check her phone while she's sleeping.  Usually, nothing's there, but this morning I found yet another chain of deleted text messages about an STD scare from a guy like 3 weeks ago. 

So why don't I just dump her on her ass?  We've been together for so long, we're so comfortable with each other, frankly I really do (or did...) plan on marrying this girl someday.  We are perfect matches personality-wise, she's cuter than heck, and her family is amazing.  I have always believed we were as close as someone could get to a ""soulmate"".

Also, I'm not a perfect saint either.  While we started talking again back in college I ran around a bit and I guess I consider that cheating as well, but for the past 2.5 years I've only had eyes for her. 

Every time I catch her she's extremely remorseful and promises to stop.  I wish I hadn't believed her. 
She can never give me an answer as to why she does it.  She just says ""I don't know, I'm sorry, I was stupid.  I don't know why I did it, I want to be with you""  

Reddit, I just don't know what to do.  I'm not a dumpy guy, I take care of myself, and I think I'm reasonably attractive.  I've got a great job, I'm driven to be financially successful.  I treat her like a princess.  Every time we're together, she spoils me rotten, we have a ton of fun and are totally fine with just cuddling for hours.  She basically appears to be the perfect girlfriend.  We openly talk about engagement, and make plans for the future.

But I can't trust her anymore.  I considered not telling her I found the messages and installing an SMS tracker on her phone to see how extensive this really is.  But she could be sending emails, gchat, fb messages, I can't possibly track them all, plus I don't have regular access to her laptop.  

Of course, that isn't really a relationship.  It's a jealous, suspicious spiral. 

And I have no way of knowing if this guy I just found out about was the only one recently.  Could have been more.  I found the messages and left her place in a rage while she was still sleeping.  Left her a really long nasty text, too. 

I'm at work, distraught, emotionally exhausted, and I haven't talked to her yet.  I told her last time this happened (it was dirty fb messages with old FWB last time), that if I ever found something I'd leave her right then and there.  Deep down I know I need to break up with her, but I can't figure out if I'm afraid I'll never find someone I click with as well as her.  I'm desperately clinging on to something that's normally bliss, punctuated by these hellish episodes.

Maybe I'm just chickenshit.

If you got through the whole thing, thanks for taking the time...

I caught him on /r/seduction, which I thought was odd, but I've always trusted him, so I didn't worry too much, but he left his computer on and I wanted to see if there were other clues about his behaviour. I found his photo bucket account and there was his former coworker (he was a cook, she was a waitress). Two of them she was fully clothed, but one was just her naked body. I did not look very hard to find these, but I feel bad for snooping. Anyway he says that the pics were unsolicited, that they had flirted for two weeks, but he ended it, and that now they are just friends. The real betrayal was that they've been hanging out for two months on a regular basis and he's been lying to me, saying he was out with a guy. He's lied so much, my real question is, I guess, should I trust him again? He swears they never got physical, but he's lied about everything else, I don't know what to believe.

Tl;dr: my husband's new friend ""Peter"" turns out to be a lithe young lady who he has naked pictures of. Should I believe him when he says they never hooked up?

We (and the third roommate, also [m]) developed a close friendship really fast. 
No. 3 then moved out (after a year; finished university), which left me and C., whom I already loved at this point. As the new third roommate wasn't as interested in participating our activities (cooking together, theater, parties, citytrips, museums a.s.o.) and my obsession with C. was growing with each day, I decided, this couldn't be healthy and told him I wanted to move out. 

He was quite shocked and hurt and as I didn't told him anything about my more-than-roommatee-feelings, decided to come with me. So, here we are: moving to a smaller apartment, just the two of us, in no more than 30 days, and I'm sure my situation will get worse.

What's so bad about my situation? We are really close and I'm very sure he respects me greatly as a friend. By close I mean: I know about his fanciest sexual experiment, about the music he would like to listen to right before his dead, I weight myself before him, we dance wildly and act crazy, visit the opera together and talk to each other while shitting. We don't have and don't need a plan on chores and money.
 He knows the code to my creditcard and I know how many kids he'd like to have, and when, and that he is afraid of himself sometimes. 

He has no girlfriend, nor had one in the last 7years. I know he's not homosexual (more like bisexual, heteroromantic and sex-positive) but having a partner just doesn't seem to matter too much to him. All of this has been true for me as well -until I got to know him. And it's starting to bug me, really. He's so close, but so fucking far away, as I'm miles under his niveau, his requirements are hight as fuck. 

I'm neclecting my studies to spend every minute with him, I'm unable to be more than ""friends with benefits"" with any of the men I got to know. And we'll live together for at least two more years, which means I'm spending a good time of my best years craving after someone I'll most likely never get. 
Plus I can't talk about it with any of my friends, for they know him and sure would tell him sooner or later, thinking rightfully, that otherwise it can't be healthy for me.

 He doesn't seem to notice my situation, didn't notice it with other women (and men) that fell for him, but was always glad to have me to talk about how hard it was to tell another one that no, he just doesn't love them. 

Most people meeting us think we are a pair -we even hold hands in public and have no problem with resting our heads on each others crotch. But he (and I) do this with others as well, without thinking about it as something sexual. 

I really wished he found a girl ( or boy) soon, then it would be easier for me to let go.

Sometimes it's really hard to not see an innuendo in everything he does -he acts really jealous when someone shows interest in me, our conversations may make you think we've had sex just minutes a go -or will have -but I'm reading too much into this, he's just like that. 
I can't even say he's beautiful,  but his movements, his mimics, his lips, the vene above his eyes that shows only when his bloodpressure is hight, his intelligence and his caring of others, his empathy (beside the before mentioned blind spot of noticing) really do it for me. 

Now reddit, what do you think? Should I tell him? When? How? How does it not get akward to live together if I do? Should I reduce my weight   (I'm overweight, but quite fit and been losing weight constantly and slowly over the past years) before I do to have more of a chance, or do you think looks don't matter in this case?

**tl;dr : been attracted to my close friend and roommate for over a year, getting tired of hoping and neclecting my studies. Debating whether to tell him or not -and when.**

**Edit:** Thanks to each and every one of you. All of you helped me by encouraging me to tell him. I'll give myself until february to do so.

1341967099.0,117,self.relationships,wcx43,Gf unhappy with my living situation (I share an apt. w/ 1 guy and 2 girls),I_am_yonkers,137,20,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wcx43/gf_unhappy_with_my_living_situation_i_share_an/,"Hey guys, so here's the story:

I (male: 21) moved into a new place a month or 2 ago sharing the apartment w/ a couple as well as another girl. I had discussed this w/ my gf (20) before moving in and she said that it was fine especially considering it was super cheap and I loved the place. But now, anytime my girlfriend so much as thinks about my living situation, she gets super upset often to the point of crying. This includes being in or near my apartment, seeing my roommates, hearing my roommate's names etc. I can understand her uneasiness about me living in the same apartment as a single girl, but I've made countless efforts to make my gf more comfortable with my situation. I try to avoid 1 on 1 situations w/ the single roomie, I rarely even sit on the same couch as her, when I walk to the shower I make sure to go fully clothed rather than just in shorts or something like that. I've also repeatedly asked her what I can do to make the situation better, different ways I should have acted. Her response is only ever that the way I was acting was fine, but I shouldn't have moved into my new place.

Now here's my dilemma: I recognize that pretty much the only way she's going to be content is if I move out. And if I was a shining white knight and a perfect boyfriend, I would do that in a heartbeat. However, I'm a college student with a budget and this place is cheap and in every possible way a complete upgrade from my last apartment. That's not even considering the hassle of re-packing and re-unpacking (while working 10 hour days 6 days a week). I do NOT want to move out. I know it sounds selfish and I've asked myself if I'm really willing to risk our relationship (1.5 years) for a nice place. And in all honesty, I'm not really sure.

It might also be prudent to note that she hangs out with male friends quite often (including one's she's dated) who hug her, tickle her, etc. I don't enjoy it, but I don't have a huge problem with that. My problem is that I've had absolutely no physical contact (let alone a relationship) with my roomie, yet she's still considered a big threat. BTW my roommate is super nice to my gf all the time and tries to include her in things and make her feel welcome in our apartment.

any ideas on how I should carry on from here on out would be greatly welcomed. Unfortunately this doesn't seem like an area where compromise is working out that well. I'm honestly not sure if I'm being reasonable or just being a dick.

Tl;Dr - moved into a place w/ a couple and a single girl (w/ gf's consent). Gf now hates my living situation and basically has said the only way she'll feel comfortable is if I move out, which I really really really don't want to do.

1341774324.0,118,self.relationships,w8bu1,I cannot forgive my wife for her one night stand,Veridian800,163,45,384,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w8bu1/i_cannot_forgive_my_wife_for_her_one_night_stand/,"Wife and I have been with one another for 12 years. Two kids. I'm 33 and my wife is 32. Kids are 5 and 3. Solid marriage throughout with a few bumps here and there but nothing too severe. In January my wife went on a weekend trip with some girlfriends of hers. Ends up getting drunk and sleeping with another guy. Doesn't tell me. I find out a couple weeks later when I see a message on her phone. She ends up confessing after I confront her. Swears its the first and only time its happened and nothing like it will ever happen again. Furious does not even begin to touch on how I feel. We have a terrible fight and I decided to move out. It felt like the best choice. I hated my wife at the time and I didn't want to do something too hurtful. Seeing her everyday would have been too hard. 

I don't know what her ONS did to me but it changed me. I stopped really caring about being a good husband (and probably a woman. good father) and just became more selfish. I was a really good husband to her and I didn't deserve to be cheated on. I moved out and started to act single. I had two one night stands of my own between February and April and started to date another 

In May my wife and I finally talk and she convinces me to at least start coming by our home more often since the kids were missing me. Once I started to going back to spending more time with my kids my wife and I started to reconnect with one another. My wife and I basically started dating again and we are doing better. I agreed to move back in last week and I broke up with my girlfriend. 

The problem for me is I cannot forgive my wife. I still have love for her but I just think of her as a whore. I can only imagine some drunk guy railing my wife. Having sex with my wife is not fun. I can't stand to see her face when we are intimate. I feel bad when we argue because I've said some mean things to her. I wish I could move on but I haven't been able to. 

I still want to be married to my wife I guess. Its better than the alternative of divorce and the related expenses. But I'm not in any way loyal or in love with my wife. I don't know why I can't forgive her or move on. She is sorry and hasn't done anything like that since. She says it was one mistake and she will never do anything like it again. 

**TL:DR My wife had an affair. We are trying to reconcile after I moved out and I can't move on or forgive her.**

**EDIT:** I do want to stay married and I'm more asking this for help in forgiving her. I want to try to forgive my wife and fix our marriage. Obviously people are free to post whatever advice they want and I appreciate all the advice but I would prefer advice that is more detailed than just ""leave her"" or ""divorce"". There are two little boys who I have to think of as well. I can't be super selfish and just leave at their expense. 

**EDIT2:** Thought I should add some more details and information. I'm almost in the uncomfortable position of defending my wife with some of the comments. I didn't think it was possible to be angrier than me but I guess it is. We had been arguing a lot for the month or two before her ONS about expenses and a health issue of my younger son's. There was a lot of stress and drama over that. My wife says this was a reason she had her ONS along with her being overly drunk and the other guy being persistent. My wife didn't get his number and they never had an affair or anything like that. 

When I confronted her my wife didn't deny it and admitted it. Since then she has been a really good wife by any stretch. I was horrible to her after the ONS. I yelled at her. Called her a whore/slut/cunt/etc. I went through a terrible phase and that is why I moved out. Because I was scared I was going to hurt her. 

When I was moved out I told her I was going to be single and I essentially shoved the new relationships in her face. It was petty. I did it for revenge. I don't think it was cheating and my wife doesn't count it as cheating. I didn't even talk to her kindly for almost three months. My wife did not date anyone or see anyone during our separation. I am 98% sure this was her first and only affair. Obviously I can't be certain but it is so unlike her. She has been sorry and remorseful since it came out. 

I wouldn't have moved back in if she wasn't. Its not that I hate to see her face. That is only when we are having sex. I do have love for my wife and I care about her a lot still. We are actually pretty good and happy most of the time. Our home is not like a warzone and our boys have been so happy that I've moved back in. I want to do what is best for them and I think my wife and I staying together is best for them. I think and I hope and I pray that my love for my wife can return. **I posted this hoping someone could help me in forgiving my wife and help me fall back in love with her. I really don't want to go. I want to repair our marriage and keep our family together.** I know I'm not perfect and I have some blame in this. And I know I've become an uglier person because of her affair with my selfishness and anger and I want to get beyond that.

My husband and I were married for 17 years. We both went to the same college at separate times but somehow manage to meet while I was still in school. We fell in love immediately and I knew I had found my soul mate. Fast forward two incredible years of dating and we were married right after I graduated.

Tragically, my husband and father of my son died in a car accident 10 months ago. Both my son and I took it very badly as he was the love of my life and very close to my son. I was in denial for the first couple of weeks and the depression quickly set in thereafter. My son grieved by bottling everything up inside of him while I grieved by crying every night for months. We were both suffocating in our sadness.

We weren't the only ones who were grieving over my husband's absence. My husband's best friend, Mike, was also taking it very badly. He tried so hard to be strong for my son and me the first couple of months but even through all that emotional armor, I could tell that he was just as heart broken as the rest of us for losing his very good friend.

My son and I were living in a big home by ourselves which made our grieving process worse. About 2 months after my husband's passing, Mike asked if it would be easier for him to move in with my son and me temporarily. I told him he didn't have to and that I didn't want him to be bothered feeling obligated to be there for us. He said he didn't feel like that at all and wanted to help in every way possible.

We have an extra room in our home that my husband had turned into an office-away-from-the-office kind of set up. I offered to clear some stuff out of there for Mike to have his own room to sleep in and he declined saying that he would rather take the couch then have anything moved from in there. 

One night, 5 months after my husband's death and 3 months after Mike had moved in, I found out exactly how hard Mike was still taking my husband's absence. I woke up in the middle of the night to go downstairs for a glass of water. As I'm walking down our long bridge through the upstairs corridors, I reach a point where I can clearly hear sobbing downstairs in the living room den. I quietly reach the bottom and peer in and see Mike sobbing and tearing up looking at a picture of him and my husband.

I immediately started breaking down and hurried away so he didn't see me. I didn't bring it up to him or anyone else until last month. I don't know why I felt the need to tell him that I understood his pain and that I'm not overlooking it. I told him that I saw him crying that one night and it broke my heart to see him that way. He said he didn't want me to pity him and just wanted me to let him help me and my son as long as we need it. 

He leaves town that weekend for a business trip and would return that following Monday. But oddly, I missed him a lot while he was away that weekend. I was confused and upset with myself for feeling that way but I couldn't help it. He comes back that Monday morning and we have dinner that evening, the three of us. My son heads to bed after dinner but Mike and I decide to watch some tv in our tv room while having a glass of wine.

Long story short, we ended up kissing for a couple of seconds that night. No sex and my son had not seen any of that as he was sleeping. We both pulled away after our kiss and said that we shouldn't be doing that. I particularly felt horrible because it had been 9 months since my husband had passed at that point and I felt that it wasn't appropriate to be doing that at that moment in time.

About a week and a half ago, my son had gone out with his friends earlier in the afternoon and Mike and I were moving some stuff around in the house. We had more reminiscing moments, laughs, and again began to kiss. This time, it got so emotional and passionate that we ended up in my bedroom. I thought my son would be out the entire day as planned but he had forgotten his cell phone being charged in my room with my charger.

So as you can imagine, my son came back earlier than expected to go in my room and get his phone. When he opened the door, he saw me fully naked on top of Mike having sex with him. We both quickly cover up but the damage had been done. My son was so devastated. He just grabbed his phone and stormed out with his friends. 

That night, my son came back home and I had planned to talk to him about what he saw but he just quickly went upstairs and locked himself in his bedroom. I tried talking to him the next morning but he just became angry and told me not to talk to him after doing what I did. And since that day, he has only spoken 4 words to me (yes, no, no, maybe). It really kills me to see him hate me like he does right now.

I am completely crushed and upset that my son is feeling hurt and sad because of what I did. At the same time, I would like for him to understand that all that happened because both Mike and I were very emotional and just felt comfort with each other at the moment. We weren't trying to betray his father and would never do so. We still haven't had a proper talk about what he saw that day or the situation in general and I'm not sure how to go about it. Should I talk to him alone or should Mike be a part of the conversation as well? Should we get a counselor to facilitate the discussion?

My husband (26) and I (25) are having some issues.  I met him in March of last year and we ended up getting pregnant in June.  We decided that we didn't want to terminate and would like to stay together.  So things are going rather awesomely.  He is an extremely sweet and thoughtful man who does everything he can for me.  I move in with him and we're very happy.  

I start to notice that he tends to keep his phone away from me.  I ask him if there was a reason for it, he said no reason and that I'm free to look through any of his stuff, so I do because I'm a very curious person.  I proceed to look through his stuff and find internet history that makes me rather uncomfortable.  I'm assuming he thought that he deleted everything that he didn't want me to see, but apparently I'm more computer savvy than him.  I proceed to find lots of 12chan stuff, videos of young (12ish) girls dancing very sexually on youtube, and just lots of searches looking for sexy young girls.  Obviously I freak a bit and confront him.  He proceeds to lie to me, thinking that there was no way that I could know all that I know.  He said he looked once because he was curious (referencing 12chan), but I know he's been doing it for months and yea...  He eventually gave up trying to lie and said he was embarrassed, but it keeps happening (the looking at youtube vids).  I told him I wouldn't look through his history again, but he said that I was free to look through anything of his.  So I looked at his facebook messages...

I find that he's had a kind of love affair with a girl who is 17 and they've been planning to marry each other for years.  Ok...  so he was attracted to a girl who (I'm guessing from the timeline) was 13 when he was 22.  Apparently they stopped having their ldr sometime before I met him, but from their messages I gather that they still talked on the phone while we were dating.  He told me that he didn't emotionally cheat on me, but I'm not sure I believe him because he used to constantly look up her facebook pictures. 

To the best of my knowledge he hasn't looked at this stuff or talked to young girls for a long while, but I think the damage has been done.  

So now here I am, I've had his child and I'm a sahm/online college student while he works full time and supports us.  I'm having a hard time letting go of what I've seen and trusting him since he's lied to me before, but mostly I'm just very angry and feel stupid for trusting him and staying.  If I leave, I can't support myself and will have to move in with my father which will be an even worse living arrangement since he abused me when I was very young and I don't trust him around my child.  I have no where else to go.  Please don't say I'm stupid if I stay, I know, this is what makes me angry/sad as well.    

We are going to counseling next week because I told him that I'm constantly angry at him and very sad, but I'm not sure that I can ever look at him the same way.  Anyways, anyone have any advice for me?  How can I get over this or at least not be so upset all the time?  I can't leave him while I'm still in school, 2 more years and then I'll be out.  Or am I just a crazy, insecure person?

Then tells me it's nothing, he's just there on business and needs a place to crash for the night (apparently he has no money). Later it comes out that he's not there on business, but just to see her. She tells me there hasn't been anything between them for more than a year, then she tells me she would probably sleep with him if she wasn't in a relationship, and that they've been sending ""can't wait to sex you"" messages as lately as this summer, although she says he sent them and she just agreed to it by which I reckon she means she wasn't graphical about it. But it's hard to say, I didn't really ask how many mails or what was written, this is information I don't even want. 
So obviously this situation is uncomfortable, but I'm trying not to overreact. But last night she calls and tells me he's coming back in a month or two, unknown for how long this time, ""if it's ok for me"". So we have a huge fight, the worst and probably only serious one in our rather short relationship.  

I've been with manipulative people before, and all kinds of red flags are rising, especially the way she refuses to see that there is a problem, reduces complex issues to a simple matter of trust me or don't trust me, tries to change definitions of words in her favor (""I didn't mislead you, he *is* _just_ a friend""). At the same time, I don't think she is manipulating. I think she's awesome, kindhearted. I don't know what this is, but I'm thinking it some strange exception in a relationship that can last and be honest and open.  
  

There is more, bit this is the gist of it. So what do you think? Am I overreacting?  Is there something / nothing to worry about? Is this even something that other couples / you yourselves would rise an eyebrow over?

**Background:**


Me, 25F, him 33M been together 7 years, engaged and wedding in less than 3 months. He's been with 20+ people, I've been with 4. We both watch porn regularly and I have no issue with it, I encourage he does it when I'm not home. We are also very active where we still have sex sometimes 2-3 times a day and usually sex or BJ happen 7 days a week. I am quite attractive as well, fit, young, big boobs, and open to almost anything in the bedroom. He is more tame when it comes to sex and turns down my offers to go get some new toys or try new things. He is only interested in bringing in another female.

I've always been attracted to girls, dated one seriously when I was younger and ended up falling in love. Had my heart broken and since then kept away from them, though always been interested in having a threesome eventually, we talked when I met him at 18 about this but a lot has changed since then.


At around our 5 year mark the topic of threesomes came up since it had yet to happen. I was maybe open to trying it if I got to pick the girl and it wasn't anyone we would have to see again (I thought Vegas would be perfect for this). He was not ok with that idea, said it would have to be a friend (listed some of my friends names even) and that a stranger was not ok as he isn't attracted to strangers mentally and there are health issues. I said absolutely not, no way ever will it be a friend, especially someone you have more than just physical attraction to. We came to a standstill and it really hurt our relationship for a while knowing he was interested in sleeping with my friends but wouldn't consider having me pick someone else out. I felt like dirt for sometime. But life went on and we didn't talk about it much anymore, we got engaged, and I thought everything was great.


**Current:**


Yesterday he went out and did a bunch of wedding stuff with me and in the evening he mentioned wanting to go to the strip club. I wasn't really feeling it but decided lets go have some fun, see some boobs, and relax a bit. Hes been a champ with wedding stuff and I like to go too. Like usual it took me about 30 minutes to fully be comfortable there but once I was its pretty awesome, I am usually the one that doesn't want to leave and we were having a great time.


A few hours in (we're both pretty drunk) I bring up how we should do this more often and sometime invite a couple we know out there with us (they go too) because that would be fun. His response to this is to mention another couple to me and bring up how they do three somes. I asked what that had to do with anything and he just stared at me. I mentioned how if it ever happened it would NOT be with a friend or someone we knew or had to see again and that I would get to pick the girl, he didn't get to pick the girl, same as before. This seemed to upset him and I was pretty annoyed he would bring the topic up knowing my stance then get pissed at me, esp when we were out in public and I was trying my best to have fun and do something nice for him. A big WTF moment for me. 


So I asked him a really stupid question I should have waited until sober to ask. 1) What happens if I never want to do it or you never are ok with me picking the girl, would you still want to get married? He couldn't answer me other than he will just keep hoping it will happen. That lack of answer is a pretty big game changer to me, NOT something we can just forget about. I tell him these are really important issues we need to discuss sober and BEFORE we actually get married. Strip club is NOT the place to discuss it. I just want to have a good time, not have relationship talk while out. He wants to leave but he is still too drunk so I say we need to wait get some water and sober up before leaving. We live really close by but even a few blocks of driving is not ok if he's too drunk.


In this time I get a dance from a girl, shes older but really flexible and I liked her well enough, it gets pretty intense which I thought would be a good way to get him in a better mood again but he seems really annoyed. I thought he would enjoy the show and she wants to give me her number. Im thinking maybe he will like that idea so we exchange numbers but gets even more upset at that. I don't know how to win here.


We head home after a while. I act chill even though I am pissed, we go to bed after I make us food and I figure we'll talk today. 


We talked today. Turns out his friend told him last week about how him and his girlfriend do it all the time and he has gone to bed bitter and jealous all week that I am not more open. He wants to try it before we get married but is still not ok with the stranger. I do NOT ask for names of the people he is interested in and tell him no that is way too much pressure and really unfair to me. He did say he will be ok if it never happens and said he was just drunk when he couldn't answer that question last night. I don't believe him since this has come up before and he let his friend mentioning it get him in a funk all week. Clearly not something he is just going to forget about. Also want to mention he is really trying hard to apologize and make up for being an idiot about this last night, is doing everything he can. I just can't quite get over the hurt right now especially knowing he is still interested in doing it soon.


Now to me, Im pissed he is bringing this up less than 3 months from the wedding, wanting it be someone we know AGAIN, and its left me wanting to call off the wedding. I may never want it to happen (we watched good friends go through a divorce a few years ago as they tried this after getting married and the guy kept insisting on more and more of her friends and it got bad). I *might* be ok with it at some point but again, ONLY if I get to pick the girl. All this pressure is killing me and making it really unappealing. 


I have to go to his moms house now to work on my wedding dress and I have just been a crying mess all day. It kills me to think he's been laying next to me in bed all week thinking about how he wants to fuck other people and getting upset with me. We should be happy right now and enjoying our engagement and not letting friend's ruin it. I feel so completely inadequate too now, I can't bare the thought of putting on my dress today. He is really awesome in most ways and it would be stupid of me to not be with him over this but I can't help but feel maybe we should put off the wedding. I don't know :(


**TL;DR Fiance and I talked about having a three some a few years back but we couldn't agree on who to have it with. I said it had to be a stranger I got to pick the girl, he said it had to be a friend and he wanted to pick. So it never happened as neither of us would change our mind. We're 3 months from our wedding and a friend of his talked to him last week about his open relationship and now my fiance is jealous of that friend and wants to try a three some with a friend before the wedding. I feel like I will never be good enough and am debating calling off the wedding until we sort this out. NO way will I invite a friend into our bedroom.**

TL:DR of previous post: (just as the title says) My wife of three years had a long-term serious affair during our marriage and ended it. I found out after she ended it. She promised she was committed to working things out with me so I decided to give her a chance.

TL:DR of new post: Three months later, we are still trying to work it out. I believe she has been faithful. I am considering divorce.

New post:

Hi /r/relationships , it's been a long time since my original post, about 3 months. One reason I didn't update very soon is I didn't make drastic decisions and it's been a long, slow process. A lot of people on this subreddit update as quickly as a day after their post with their decision and with some results. I really respect their decisiveness.

I also appreciated everyone's responses. I really felt those responses that said I was a ""doormat"". In response to those I discovered a book about [""Nice Guy Syndrome""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Mr._Nice_Guy_%28book%29) (there is a free version available online somewhere). It doesn't all apply to me directly but there are some parts I am using to reconsider my outlook on things. For example, that love is not a direct reward of my efforts. I don't have to be a ""nice guy"" to be loved. I need a relationship where I can love someone and someone can love me for who I am. I recommend this book to any ""doormats"".

A lot of people stressed that SHE needs to make the effort to make up for what she did. I agree. I tried researching what it takes to fix marriage after infidelity and I found a very good resource in a [stickie](http://talkaboutmarriage.com/coping-infidelity/32002-welcome-tam-cwi-newbies-please-read.html) of another forum that has a lot of good basic information about how to think about infidelity. I encourage anyone dealing with infidelity especially in marriage to read this. (I can't say anything about how good this forum's community is, as I don't post there.)

A few people provided some positive encouragement and gave me the courage to try and save this marriage. It's my decision and I appreciate the support.

---

First of all, we are still together. As far as I know, she has been faithful and open with the entire time. (I say ""as far as I know"" because I learned that she is capable of lying effectively behind my back.) But she spends a LOT of time with me, shares her emotions with me when positive and with negative, and I have had a lot more out-pour of my own emotion to her, even more than before this whole mess. I have more open access to her e-mails, etc.

We have started counseling. It's actually a team of two counselors, a man and a woman (visit one at a time but they share information with each other). We have each gone alone a couple times, and been once together. We will go again this weekend. It's super expensive and although it's really a minor expense looking at the big picture, the expense makes us reluctant to go that often.

I think the counseling session this weekend will be different the previous ones, but what have I gained so far: Mainly, that to fix a marriage, it takes time, it takes open communication, and that we have to confront each other when we have negative feelings. I will try to update again later about counseling.

Positive developments: We have been spending a lot of time together. We have good times, and bad times, but I can feel the sincerity of her love when it's there.

Negative: She is distant sometimes. She says ""I'm not confident about my feelings."" It is at these times that I feel the most that she no longer loves me. She really swings between the two.

Divorce: I have come to terms that we might have to get a divorce. Of course it would be extremely painful but I am ready. We are both financially independent and there would be some logistical issues (moving, I am looking for a new job now, etc.). Why am I waiting? Because, like I said, she is being faithful and honest, we are going to counseling, I still love her. If we can get our emotions figured out, we still might have a future together.

I guess that is pretty much my situation now! I have no specific requests for advice or anything, but any advice, blunt awakenings, other questions, etc are welcome.

1366045319.0,133,self.relationships,1ced9x,My girlfriend [25F] and I[23F] are trying to figure out how to approach our roommate [29F] of 4 months about keeping common courtesy boundaries.,extremelyconfused,166,33,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ced9x/my_girlfriend_25f_and_i23f_are_trying_to_figure/,"So my gf and I moved into a townhouse in January because we wanted to pay less than we were paying for an apt of our own. The girl we live with owns the townhouse, is an accountant nearby and told us she's mellow and doesn't party but occasionally has her brother and boyfriend over for a movie night. Sounded great because I'm a full time student and my gf works full time, we weren't looking to live with someone who likes to party or stay up all night since we have long days. 

As soon as we moved in we realized it wasn't occasional of her boyfriend to come by. He basically lives here with her and doesn't have a job at the moment but we didn't and don't mind him at all, he's a really nice guy and will help around the house from time to time.

Two months ago our roommate was out of town and told us that her bf and his friends were gonna hang out in the living room, which we didn't mind because we normally just stay in our room (its big enough, we have our entertainment system set up and our own full bathroom). But it turned into Friday, Saturday and Sunday of all night partying. They were playing pong, playing the music obnoxiously loud till 5 am. We asked them a few times to turn it down and they did but it interrupted our sleep for those few nights. That monday I asked my roommate to let us know the next time they planned on partying since it really wasn't just a quiet living room hang out as she had originally told us. She said she was sorry and didn't realize that they were going to do all they did and that she'd notify us the next time they planned on getting together and if it would turn into a night of partying.

Within the last 2 months this has happened several times. My gf and I will be woken up at 3 am or 4 am by either the music or her boyfriends friends yelling/being loud, once we found a leftover bag of weed and coke right on the kitchen counter..definitely upsetting but we thought it was one of her bf's friends stuff, not our roommates. We really aren't the type to want to start problems and our roommate is usually mellow so we tried to let it slide. 

Then on Easter Sunday she had people over. Not like a family get together, more like drinking games that were going way past 11 PM. We thought she would quiet the night down since we all have 9-5 jobs and it was a Sunday night. 1 am comes around and we're awoken by her and her bf fighting, yelling ""you bring out the worst in me, get the fuck away from me"" literally right next to our bedroom door for half an hour till they went to their room and fought for a while (their room is next to ours and we can hear through the walls). We never said anything because we know alcohol can bring out another side of people and also because we know it's embarrassing to realize what you've done the next day. They never brought it up either but avoided talking to us for a few days, out of embarrassment I think.

So this weekend comes on by, we get a text that a few people are coming over but it's not gonna be a big thing. It was friday so we didn't mind, it's not like we had to wake up at 5 or 6 for work and she said it wasn't going to be a party, just a get together. Same thing happens, loud music and yelling that literally woke us up at 4 am. I was so frustrated at this point that I called my roommate, she didn't answer so I texted her saying ""Roommate, someone's yelling so loud that it just woke me and (insert gfs name), can you ask them to calm down? it's 5 in the morning. And if you don't mind, we definitely need to sit down this week to talk to you"". I got no reply but within 5 minutes it quieted down. No music and no more people being loud. 

Saturday when we woke up our roommate was out of the house already so I texted her asking if we could sit down to talk that night or Sunday and she said she couldn't saturday night and sunday night she had plans. So I asked about Monday and she said she couldn't because she had to bring her mom to the airport and wouldn't be back till 11. So I said how about Sunday morning? (yesterday) and she said Sure! Lets talk Sunday Morning...well sunday morning comes around and she's not home..I text her asking to let us know when she'll be around so we can talk. I get a reply from her at 1PM saying she stayed at a friends house and can't talk till Wednesday. I found it to be inconsiderate and told her so. No reply.


TLDR: Roommate said she wasn't partier. Parties a lot. Blows us off when we ask to talk to her about it. 

Guys how do I deal with this? I'm annoyed and feel slightly taken advantage of at this point. I don't want to come off defensive or rude but something's got to change.

1363797369.0,119,self.relationships,1ao61f,"I[23M] can't get past her[21F] excessive ""Aegyo""  ",aegyothrowaway,155,36,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ao61f/i23m_cant_get_past_her21f_excessive_aegyo/,"**edit 1**  She was born and raised in LA, but still heavily involved in Korean culture due to parents, friends, etc.  She does have every right to say it is ""ingrained"" in her.  

**edit 2**  just had lunch with her after the tension of all of this has subsided.  She's already showing that she's working on it greatly...I felt like I had lunch with the girl that I was starting to fall in love with.  She used her cuteness in a way I remember best: simple, reserved, more subtle, but attractive.  What's important is that we're having actual good conversation again, that's all.  Very relieved in one sense, but more cautious entering the next few weeks considering all of these events.  To all the responses, thank you, your words are helping me out.  

[For those who don't know, this is Aegyo](http://rainbow7.wikia.com/wiki/Aegyo) - it's part of Korean culture in girls to act like a cutesy innocent child to get guys.  It's gross.  I'm half korean so I know plenty about it and have experienced it, but never with my actual girlfriend and never like this.

So I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 6+ months now.  Things were incredible at first, we met out one night randomly, went out on numerous dates a couple times a week, and really started to connect.  A few months down the line, we became exclusive, and I was a lucky guy to have such a smart, mature, but fun girl to be around.  We'd go out and have fun with my friends or her friends, spend time together at my place, have incredible sexy time...it was all just great.  

And then things started changing. 

So she is Korean, and early on we talked about how we didn't understand Korean relationships, why Korean guys are attracted to that shit, etc.  It was agreed upon that the accepted cultural norm for guys in Korea is to not care for brains at all, and sometimes even as extreme as ""the dumber the girl is, the better"". She just has to look pretty and act cutesy, with lots of ""Aegyo"".  We didn't say the word ""aegyo"" specifically, but it's clear that we were on train of thought.   

Before I knew it, once we became official, she started getting more comfortable.  This would normally be a good thing, but Aegyo started to come out.  Now I didn't really mind at first, or really notice it TOO heavily.  It was just sort of there, and I figured it was part-Aegyo, and part-goofiness.  I could relate, we were very happy together, and I was also really happy.  

Then it just started to become more and more Aegyo from her.  A month had passed, and there were days that I would spend with her that felt more Aegyo than the girl I had started to fall in love with.  Her stories and cute (but normally toned) sassiness went from interesting and fun to a five-old year version of herself running up and telling me ""and then this happened..and this happened and yah yah!!!""  I was just... at a lost for words sometimes.  

I didn't know how to make it stop, and I didn't know how intentional it was, so I brought it up this past weekend, as gently as humanly possible while conveying that it was becoming a serious issue for me. 

The results weren't good, at first she took it in stride but looked hurt.  A few days had passed and she started doing Aegyo all morning, and I gently reminded her that she was doing it again.  She pretty much broke down at this point, saying that she didn't know what she was doing wrong, and that it was a core part of her personality....

I realize how sensitive of an issue this is, and I can understand how this is difficult.  She said it's not intentional when she does it, which I believe.  I'd be completely fine with ALL of these events, but after some days of thinking, she seriously said that she ""doesn't feel its a negative aspect of herself"".  She said she'd make efforts to change/tone it down, but truly doesn't see how it's a negative trait to act in that way...which scares me more than anything.  

I'm not asking her to get rid of her giddiness and fun on all levels of course, but it's the Aegyo that's truly killing me.  I want this to work, so right now we're agreeing to work on both ends to get to a better level.  

But ultimately if this just continues and more Aegyo comes out, I'm now apprehensive to bring it up when more Aegyo comes out because she's doesn't see it as a negative trait.    

I can put up with small amounts here and there, but this is just such a hard situation...I really feel like she's changed so much and she just feels as though ""she's gotten more comfortable"".  Ultimately though, how someone who's shown me a smart, intelligent, well-spoken, sexy girlfriend just turn into an overbearing Aegyo girlfriend shouldn't be part of getting more comfortable....at least that's how I feel.  Is there anything else I can say or do to give her my perspective more on the situation?    

tl;dr: Korean Girlfriend was really awesome for first 4-5 months, but once we became ""official"" and got more comfortable, she turned into an Aegyoified handful that I'm having a hard time handling.  I want to make it work and we've set a rule of ""we'll work on it on both ends"" kind of thing - but what other steps, if any, can I take to get her to chill out on the Aegyo?

She sent more messages, she thinks it's my fault and that i'm forcing him to do something to not let her see our baby? I don't even know.

She ended up writing messages to my mums phone to us, probably hoping my mother would see the messages and force us to go over to MIL's house, she asked my mum to leave the carseat at home, without even asking us if she could come over, and she sent these messages at around 2am.

The main message she sent (I will decode her horrible spelling again) is this:

""As for not letting me be a Nanna to my own granddaughter (She says this like she has some eternal right that goes over the parents rights), see you in court, and by the way you better get a baby room ready for when DOCS come to check cause you are giving her back problems, You are ALL neglecting her. I don't know what i did to you both but (SO) i thought you would have the balls to stand up to (Me) and say hey that's my mum. I will tell my mum to take back the birthday presents she bought you."" (Says this like blackmail, ""Oh if you don't come over i won't give you birthday presents.""

Last message she sent was ""Goodbye, hope you have a good life i will never bother you again."" 

Yeah, like we haven't heard / read that a million times.

So yes, she basically is trying to blame it on me.

SO and myself figured out that the reason she's so upset? Is because grandparents can now get paid money from the government for ""Babysitting."" and this is what she wants.

SO rang her last night, turned into a huge fight, he told her the reason that we won't allow our daughter there is due to past threats to take our daughter, and the smoking.  She said she threatened to do that because she was upset we were leaving.  SO replied ""You're not upset now and you just threatened to do it.""  She got angry, he told her to fuck off and she hung up, then she sent us the ""I won't bother"".

So we're just not going to even bother with her anymore or respond to calls,etc.

She wants to be greedy and threaten to take us to court over her laziness? Fine, just enjoy us not being in her lives.

We also expect her to be ringing in the next week/fortnight to ask when she can see our daughter, or when we can take her over there.

1357799680.0,119,self.relationships,16avcg,"UPDATE on ""desperately needing help regarding 13-year-old foster sister""",disturbedfamily,152,33,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16avcg/update_on_desperately_needing_help_regarding/,"You guys may remember a post around here where I described the thirteen-year-old we took in after her mother died and we began to experience some issues regarding her stealing things from us, hoarding food, and lying to us. Let's call her Lee. Someone made a comment describing her as a ""kleptomaniac"" which made it to /r/bestof. I created a throwaway so as not to overwhelm my main account, but [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/105d5b/i_desperately_need_help_regarding_a_12yearold/) is the original post.

Well, after that incident, shit kept happening. Stolen makeup. Half-empty coke cans. More lies.  She started wearing my shoes to school until we locked those up too. She wrote me an apology note and said she was sorry and that she should have asked first. After she was caught skipping classes one day, her principal confronted her and Lee screamed at the principal ""DON'T YOU KNOW MY GRAMPA JUST DIED"" (for the record it was my father's father who died, and Lee had only met him maybe twice). She wept tears of remorse over stealing and promised she would stop. At one point she was literally packing her bags to leave but then had a change of heart and wrote us an apology note and promised to change if only we would keep her. So we gave her a ""fresh start"". And then a week later we found her stealing more things. And it's not like she's just USING the things, either. She leaves the lids off of makeup jars and creams. They're stuffed with dirty cotton balls or completely dried out. 

Throughout everything I have been BEGGING my parents to get her to therapy. I asked my dad to email her school counselor to make sure the counselor knew what was going on at home. I asked him to look up therapists. I reminded him that Lee's dad's insurance would cover it. He kind of waved it off, said ""maybe you left it out"" or ""it's not stealing if she puts it back, it's borrowing"" (regarding the shoes). I disagree, if she doesn't have permission (and I TOLD her to ask me before touching things and I'd probably lend her stuff but she had to ask first) then it's stealing.

Anyway, I thawed a little over Christmas. I thought, ""Okay, Christmas is really difficult for her because her mom died just after Christmas a couple years ago. I'm going to show her kindness and try to get along with her again.""

Two nights ago I come home from my boyfriend's (I stay with him on weekends) and my mom was leaving with her sister to visit her other sister in Olympia. As my mom was leaving I ran outside down the driveway to give her the canister of coffee she had made herself and forgotten. I came back upstairs and realized I had left my bedroom door unlocked for ~3 minutes. I shrugged it off and figured she couldn't have done much damage in three minutes. Later that night I was putting together a work outfit for the next day and tried to put on a bra only to find that the straps had been drastically shortened. I scanned the little knob my bras were hanging off and found that one I kept stored in a cupboard (as it didn't fit me anymore) was now hanging with the others. But it was past her bedtime so I didn't wake her. I confronted her the next day (yesterday) when I got home from work. I asked her if she wore them. She said yes. I asked her when she took them. She quickly said the night before, when I'd brought my mom coffee. I asked her if she knew what she did was wrong. She nodded. After that she didn't speak.

I finally unloaded. I told her how she had made me feel homeless, like my own things were not safe in my house. I told her that I spent most nights at my boyfriend's because I didn't feel comfortable here anymore. I told her that she hurt my feelings so badly when I tried to be sisterly towards her and she shoved it back in my face by stealing my stuff. I asked her if she understood and she just nodded. I asked her if she felt bad about it and she nodded. I asked her if she was going to do it again and she shrugged. I told her I just wanted an explanation. I asked her if I'd treated her badly or made her feel unwelcome, asked her if she thought this was how she should treat the people who took her in and are taking care of her. She shook her head or stared at the walls. Finally I just let it go and went back into my room and she presumably went to bed. 

I opened my underwear drawer to find everything in disarray. A swimsuit I have not worn since last summer was spread out across the top of everything. Things were missing. With a sinking sensation in my gut, I started tearing through my other drawers. 

Here is the absolute fucking worst part that made me feel like barfing. My vibrators were sitting on top of everything else in their drawer. They were **COVERED IN MENSTRUAL BLOOD.** There were CHUNKS. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. It wasn't my mom, she's super prude and she passed menopause looong ago. It wasn't me, I haven't had a period in ~2 months because I am on the pill. WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK REDDIT.

All of our doors have locks on them. I don't know how the FUCK she got in or how long she was fucking around with my stuff. My parents' room and my room have the same key so if my dad accidentally left his key out or forgot it in his door then she could have access to my room AAANYtime she wanted. Currently I have a giant chain and padlock on it too.

I furiously strode over to my parents' room and woke up my dad. I told him what I had found. He said he'd handle it in the morning. This morning before work I told him that if he did not either get her into therapy or kick her out of the house then I was moving out. I finally made him choose, her or me. Today at work he fucking FINALLY sent her counselor an email giving the counselor a bare outline of the stuff going on here and asked for a recommendation for a therapist. Finally. Jesus christ.

So when we finally got home from work we marched into her room to see if she stole anything. We found a fuck ton of more used/stolen makeup, a box of swiffer duster replacements that actually reeked so badly that it  made me cough and my eyes watered, and just TRASH. EVERYWHERE. I reached under her desk to pull more stuff out and my hand got stuck on the back of a fucking USED PAD. And underneath there were more. All the while she was just staring at us with raised eyebrows like we were crazy. I confronted her about the vibrator - I asked her if she did it, and she said ""Yup"". I asked her if she knew how ridiculously unsanitary and disgusting that was and she just shrugged like we were bothering her or something. What the fuck. 

This time she didn't cry. She just watched us. 

Right now my dad is making her clean everything up. 

When I walked out I told her that we were NOT friends and said ""don't talk to me."" She said ""OKAY"" like ""duh"". Like I was being unreasonable or whatever. I can't look at her without wanting to barf. My stomach is all in knots.

You guys wanted an update? Here's your update. I think what she did is incredibly fucked up and crossed so many lines. She could have cleaned the vibrators off and put them back and I'd never have known. She could have kept them or thrown them away. But the fact that she put them back COVERED IN BLOOD tells me she was trying to send me a fucked up little message - ""I can get in and out of your room whenever I want and you can't do anything about it."" I would move out if I could but the job market sucks and I can't afford to live with roommates/by myself. My dad at least FINALLY got around to putting her in therapy. I have the vibrators ziplock-bagged as evidence. In the meantime I am moving ANYTHING I hold valuable to my boyfriend's (underwear, books, private journals, it's fucking lucky she has metal allergies or she'd be swiping my jewelry as well). She may someday get better, but that's years down the line and in the meantime I am fucking sick to my stomach. 

**TL;DR** After MONTHS of more struggles and thefts, culminating in Lee using my vibrators and putting them back into my drawer covered in menstrual blood (or did she break her hymen?), I finally gave my father an ultimatum - get Lee in therapy/another home or I will move out. He emailed her school counselor describing the problems and asked her to recommend a therapist. In the meantime I want to barf. There is probably more I am forgetting to tell you guys but I'm typing it now while it's still fresh in my head and my hands are shaking because I am so upset.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_16avcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16avcg/update_on_desperately_needing_help_regarding/,
1357143772.0,117,self.relationships,15txdk,Am I [26F] doing the right thing by cutting-off my alcoholic mother and enabling grandparents?,apninetypointfive,154,37,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15txdk/am_i_26f_doing_the_right_thing_by_cuttingoff_my/,"I'm having a really hard time figuring out if I am doing the right thing here. This is a ridiculously convoluted story (as most are) and I want to be able to give the important details without drowning you in the small nuances. But I’m going to ramble anyway.

I've had a strained relationship with my mother for my entire life. She has been a binge drinker in and out of the hospital (though NOT in AA or residential care) for over 25 years. 

She was married to my father 8 years before they had their first (and only kid - me). Her first hospitalization was 6 months after I was born. After that point, my parents had a very rocky marriage. The marriage lasted another 7 years, punctuated by 4 separations. At some point in that final year, she befriended a woman who she met in the newspaper personals and began a romantic relationship. She and that woman have been in an out of a relationship since that time. This woman is actually somewhat sane (I guess only as much as I am since we both keep allowing her in our lives).

At her worst, my mother’s BAC has been .40. Yes, seriously. Her typical pattern is to disappear for a few days by avoiding phone calls and work. So to give you an example, around 2007, by the time no one had heard from her in 3 days, I stopped by her apartment on my way to class one morning. I knocked at the front door and could hear mumbling somewhere within the apartment. The front door had glass in it, so I was trying to see as far in from every angle until I finally saw her trying to crawl to the door. She was covered in a concoction of blood and vomit. She could barely stand by the time she got to the door and ended up hitting her head on the handle several times when trying to unlock it (it was dead-bolted, so I couldn’t get in). By this time, she was so frightened because she was in withdrawal and couldn’t control her body – the tremors were so strong, I thought she was going to break the glass with her head. Once EMS got there, they were able to get her out and get her to the hospital. 

The second most traumatic part about these situations for me is the time at the hospital. Once I get there, the well-meaning staff all treat me like I’ve just seen my mother die. They repeatedly ask me how I’m doing and want me to stay by her side to comfort her. It is made worse by the fact that she’s screaming for me the entire time. At this point in the cycle, I feel like I HATE her. Disgust, anger, hatred. 

A few weeks or months will go by and she contacts me and tells me how wonderful she is doing now and how her life is back on track. Goddammit, I always fall for it. I have always let her back in. My grandparents (her parents) call me and tell me how wonderful she is doing and that I need to go see her, to forgive her. That she is “for real” this time. The treat me like a brat for trying to refuse to forgive her. At this point in the cycle, I feel like shit about myself.

I eventually give in and go see her. She is such a charming person. She owns her own business (which is why she is always able to come back to “sanity” quickly and doesn’t have more severe consequences from her binges. We talk about things and see each other regularly. Everything is peachy. At this point in the cycle, I still feel like shit because I know the other shoe is about to drop, but I also feel some hope.

It ALWAYS cycles through. She’s gone a year between a cycle (those binges hurt me the worst, since I had hope for so long) and she’s gone days between a cycle (I’ll often not even know she stopped in between). She ended up with a different woman during the last 10 or so years between the relationship with the first woman (who doesn’t want to put up with her issues). This new woman is also psychologically flawed and is, at the very least, not my favorite person.

At the end of college, I met my husband. He lived in a different state, so I ended up moving there with him after graduation. The cycle continued without me. I didn’t see all of the binges, but I heard about them from my grandparents and felt them from the gaps in our relationship. After 2 years in this new state, the economy had collapsed in the market there and my husband and I moved home. She was in the middle of a really long sobriety stage. I spent time with her, we even made plans for me to join her company (so stupid, I know!).

This was the first time I ever saw how horribly sick she still was when “dry.” This was the first time I saw how badly my grandparents enabled her alcoholism. I ended up getting very bitter with all of them. My mom finally moved out of the home she shared with the new, horrible woman and moved in with her parents. This complicated my relationship with my grandparents further because I was forced to see her when seeing them. So, when I cut-off my mother 2.5 years ago, it made family get-togethers very difficult. I’m the only grandchild, so when I came over and it was just the four of us, there isn’t really a way to remain distant with her. My mother refused to accept the boundaries that I placed and my grandparents would eventually come to be aggravated with me for the “inconvenience.”

So, I haven’t seen any of them in 2 years. I’ve gotten married and had a kid since then – none of which they’ve been invited to participate in. And it is killing me from the inside-out. I feel horrible that my grandparents haven’t seen my daughter and they keep trying to call me to reconnect. I feel like it wouldn’t be healthy to do so, since my mom keeps e-mailing, calling, and texting me that she wants back in my life and she lives with them. I know from mutual acquaintances that she was arrested for a hit and run DUI during this time period, so she is continuing the cycle and will do so until her demise.

My grandparents are in their late-80s and can’t leave the house (my grandmother has dementia and refuses to go outside), so I can’t meet them anywhere. My mom seemingly refuses to leave us alone, though I’m sure she would technically be out of the house when we visit. The problem is that my grandparents also don’t respect my boundary (since they don’t agree with it) and will give her all the pictures and information to fuel her boundary stomping ways.

**TL;DR** My irreparably alcoholic mother has intertwined her life with her parents in such a way that it feels impossible to keep a relationship with my grandparents while I’m trying to keep her out of my life (for my sanity).

Am I doing the right thing? Should I include them back in my life and just try to ignore her?

I finally confronted them. I decided to not do one-on-ones, but just get it all on the open.  After my last relative left I texted Jason ""leftovers and xmas movies at my place"" and he came right over. 

And I said, ""Jas told me he loves you, Hannah. And then on Thanksgiving I heard you guys talking in the spare room- I know you know how he feels and that makes me not know know how to feel""

They both argued that nothing needed to change. Hannah was Jason's most adamant defender. ""He's our best friend- he would never put me in that situation or hurt you. Why are you letting one conversation change the way you see him?""

For some reason this just made me angry. I wanted her to apologize and stand next to me instead of staying on the couch and going to bat for him. So I lost my temper. And he didn't- he kept calmly repeating the same phrase over and over again ""I'm not out to seduce your wife 'lex. I respect marriage."" 

Eventually I burst out, ""If you respect marriage so god damned much how come you tried to talk me out of it when we were standing at the fucking alter?"" My wife looked displeased, either with him for doing that or me for cursing. 

Jason: I did that because I take marriage seriously. We were 22 and barely out of college and you said you didn't know why you proposed, that you felt pressured because she was out-of-your-league, but you didn't know whether you really loved her or whether you just really liked her. -I- was madly in love with her and you just thought she was swell. I was trying to do us all a favor! But when you went through with it, I toasted your marriage and said you two were meant to be. I danced with your wife and didn't let myself wish she was mine for one moment. Because I'm your best friend and now you throw this in my face.

And I didn't have much to say. Hannah was in tears and I just felt.. drained. He hugged my wife and said that he was going, that he wasn't go to sit and here and defend a decade of friendship and loyalty. 

And me and my wife managed to say very little at all. Eventually we talked the next day. I told her how much I loved her and that I just had cold feet THREE years ago. I then asked if she could slow down on her friendship with him, no hour-long phone calls or walks at lunch. She agreed. 

I know they went to church together Sunday. It bothered me, but I know I can't just order her around. But maybe selfishly because I am an atheist and would rather pull teeth than go sit in a pew on football's day.

Things are still tense between us and me and Jason aren't talking yet. I hope that it isn't always going to feel this way.

tl;dr Sat down with them, had a talk- Jason and wife banded together. Pissed me off, which pissed Jason off who brought up me saying I wasn't sure I loved my wife before the wedding and then left. We still aren't talking. My wife is adding boundaries to their friendship. I hope it gets better.

1351935285.0,119,self.relationships,12k4ue,My girlfriend of 4 years never wants to get married. My world is kinda flipped right now. Help? [28m&amp;f],murrymeh22,148,29,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12k4ue/my_girlfriend_of_4_years_never_wants_to_get/,"She says she wants to be with me forever. The relationship is awesome. Things are going great. Yesterday, a friend asked us when we'd be getting married, she laughed and said ""Never! Ha ha!"" and later that night she brought it up, asking if I would be upset if we never married. I responded that I'm a bit shocked that she doesn't but that it wasn't a deal breaker and that I'd have to give it some thought and we'd talk about it again. 

The weird thing is, it just never came up for us. We were pretty serious from day one and I always felt like I'd like to have a long (5+ year) relationship before marriage as I didn't want divorce to be an option. Not for religious reasons, but more for my own peace of mind. Neither of our parents are with us anymore so there is no pressure there. We don't want to have kids, but we do own a home together.

 I'd like for her to be my wife for legal, financial, and sentimental reasons. 

Part of me is okay with it... I don't feel like much would change as we already own a home together and have a joint account in addition to our personal accounts. Our home situation is legally protected, as we went through an awesome lawyer for all that. 

The other part of me is thinking ""Why the fuck wouldn't you marry me?"" 

I don't think this is a total deal breaker for me, though it makes me kind of sad that she doesn't want to have me as her legal husband. 

Anyone else experience something like this? Did you stick around anyway? I don't wanna force her to change her mind or have her begrudgingly marry me.

My controlling mother (48) has threatened to kill herself if I (F/21) move out before marriage,family_issues,146,28,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10v3vp/very_conservative_parents_my_controlling_mother/,"**TL;DR My mother tries to control every aspect of my life, has threatened suicide if i ever move out of home before marriage, and has very conservative values that make her view me sleeping over at my boyfriend's house as ""shameful"" - need suggestions** 

Not even particularly sure of where to start with this one. My mother and I have had a very close relationship for the majority of my life. She was, however, intensely controlling for as far back as I can recall. She needed to know my whereabouts at *all* times; if i was out with school friends for lunch in my final year of high school and texted her to say that I was going to one of their houses afterwards, she'd yell at me for making her worry; she's constantly pressured me to achieve academically, despite claims that she ""only wants me to try my best"" (if my ""best"" wasn't the highest grade possible, it wasn't good enough, and was simply a sign that i was being lazy). Even at 21 now (soon to be 22), I'm not allowed to close my door at night (""in case there's a fire!""), I had to deal with her telling me about 4 times a day that she hated my hair after I dyed it blonde, i'm not allowed to catch the train after it gets dark (around 5-6pm), and she has no problems telling me to only dress in clothes that she knows her own mother likes, because ""it's not too much to ask!"". She told me recently that she “wanted to die” when I catch a 35 minute train to stay at my boyfriends house, and didn’t message her to tell her I had arrive safely. 

I live in NSW and was born in Australia, and have very liberal values in regards to almost everything. Both my parents are conservative Italians, and are **constantly** worried about how the ""italian community"" will perceive my actions. I was not allowed to have a public fb status that I was in a relationship when I met my boyfriend (23) 5 months ago, have been forced to change my privacy settings so that any family on fb (those who i have friended, and even those who i haven’t) cannot see ANY photos of my boyfriend and I looking ""too close"". Telling my mother that I was potentially going to spend a weekend with my boyfriend in the Northern Beaches simply received a ""You mean near where your cousins live? Where they could EASILY see you?!"" in response. My parents accidentally saw a post my boyfriend had put up on fb that related to me sleeping over… their response was “If this EVER gets out and humiliates your grandparents, the rules around here will change”.

When I initially asked my parents if i would be able to sleep at my boyfriends house (probably 1.5 months into our relationship), it was a categorical no. It was ""improper"" behaviour. I fought with them for **weeks** about this, refusing to take a 'no' in this instance. After probably close to 15-20 explosive arguments, my parents gave in. They set strict rules about it being ONLY on weekends. And even now, it is something ""no-one can EVER find out about"". During the period of arguments, my mother continually told me that my absence for approximately 3 days a week meant i was ""basically no longer part of the family"", was ""showing NO respect at all for their values"" (even after hearing them out, trying to help them see my point of view and explain that this was a NORMAL thing at my age), and she eventually called me a ""slut"" for my behaviour. Despite having never had a relationship before, being 21, and simply wanting to sleep at my boyfriend's house. Any time I've since asked to sleep over during the week or switch a weekend day to another day, I get screamed at for ""lying"" about saying I'd only stay over on the weekends. 

My mother has been severely depressed her entire life. She attempted suicide when she was very young, had a very difficult life with her own parents, and remains depressed currently. She has multiple anxiety disorders, suffers from anorexia and barely eats, and has refused treatment for approximately 25 years. She doesn't take care of herself at all, and has behaved as though she is slowly waiting to die my entire life. There is NO chance she would ever contemplate getting help. Both my sister (27) and I have tried... I have tried pleading with her, begging her to do it for her children... nothing. She has *always* said ""i love you and i dont want to fight"", and that we’re essentially her only reason for living, but she never actually addresses any of the problems and issues i raise… even (especially) in regards to her own life. 

In the context of this, she's told me multiple times that if i were to ever move out before marriage, she would kill herself. She's mentioned more times than i can count in the past that my sister and i would be ""better off without her"". The last time she was having significant problems, she was very got very close to driving her car into a tree. She has said that the ""shame"" of such a thing would destroy her own mother, and she just wouldn't be able to handle it. I'm well aware of how emotionally abusive this strategy is, but i genuinely believe she would kill herself if i were to ever move out.

In my current situation (finishing my 4th year of university), moving out is not a financially viable option yet, so this is not something i could do right now anyway. But the degree of controllingness and pervasive intrusiveness that she still displays in *every* other aspect of my life has become unbearable. She has told me that spending 3 days with my boyfriend, in addition to talking to him online, is ""spending an unhealthy amount of time together"" and that “he’ll just get sick of me"". Any time i've attempted to raise an argument and say that her words have been hurtful, she condescendingly says ""oh poor, poor you"" and tells me that my life is incredibly easy, and i'm just whining or being selfish… that I have no idea how hard I’ve made *her* life recently. Its one thing to attempt to control a person, but it's another to COMPLETELY invalidate any feelings they might have about it at the same time, and that’s something that has been more difficult than anything to deal with. After a particularly explosive argument recently, we’ve both said we’d try to me more mindful of each other’s feelings, but I’m not holding out hope that the same pattern won’t start up again as soon as the next potential issue arises.

My father is similarly conservative, and is very prone to getting incredibly angry. He feels my relationship will impact on my grades (having a Distinction average, anything less has now become unacceptable) - this has not happened even slightly yet, but I have been told by both my parents that if i do not get first class honours for my thesis this year, I will be paying for my own uni debts. My father paid for my sister's university degree, and he was doing the same for me... but it has now become grade-dependent. I remember getting a letter sent home saying that i'd come 2nd overall in one of my subjects last semester... he saw the letter, and the only thing he said was ""So that was the standard pre-boyfriend then."" It's been constant... both parents saying ""Well if i asked your supervisor what he'd predict you'd get, he'd say first class honours without a doubt, because that's what you SHOULD be getting"". I was terrified about not getting Ds or HDs in my course work because they would have used that as a reason why i should spend less time with my boyfriend, but it's become an even more significant issue now. If i sleep over anytime within 3 weeks of my thesis due date, i'm ""fucking up my life"" because ""boyfriends come and go, but your career is forever"".

I'm genuinely at a loss as to how to deal with the situation. My boyfriend has been **incredibly** supportive, and i have no idea how he can stand hearing about the madness that goes on in my family life. I know that my mother *will not* willingly get help, that my father only makes things worse in this situation, and that moving out is not an option financially (and if it were to become one, it would potentially lead my mother to attempt suicide).

I made sure she had a fairytale proposal seen (sorry if you didn't see it, mods made me take it down) (It’s the Dave+Kristen video, so much for total anonymity), love letters, fun dates, great adventures, an amazing wedding, and I’ve stayed true to her and my vows. 

**Background:** I am 27M and she is 24F. We have been married for 1 year and 6 months, and together for about 3.5 years.  No children. Her mother died about 2 years ago with whom she had an exceptionally close relationship.  I stood by her through these hard times, but she has definitely changed and has been depressed since her death. I encouraged her to seek professional help; she heeded my advice and began to see a therapist back in January of this year. 


This time of depression began to weigh heavily on our relationship. We were not communicating well. There were several angry arguments (we sat down and counted 7, that’s right **7**) where we both said hurtful things to each other.  I know the way I have spoken to her the past has been hurtful, but we have always taken time to cool down talk through every argument. 


March, she told me that she “checked out” of our relationship. We began marriage counseling (in March), for the next 5 months, and things really did seem to get better. Our communication was getting better; I was making sure that I was leaving her notes, taking her on dates, and communication love to her in way that I know she responds to the best. Likewise, she was telling me that she was “checking back in” and that time would heal our situation. We have not had one single unhealthy argument since we started our marriage counseling, not one. 


August 1st, I move her to another city with plans of following her in about 6-8 months. She got a job promotion that she didn’t want to pass up and I needed a little bit more experience in my career before I could transfer with her. We talked and text everyday. During this time we have 2 arguments, both about trivial stuff. One about the day I flew out of her current city (I had to fly out 4 hours earlier than expected and that made her mad) and the other about a house warming party my new roommate was having (she didn’t like the idea of me drinking at the house with girls around, I have never cheated or even acted inappropriately with other women, she just has these jealously issues). We had to “agree to disagree” about this stuff, but I didn’t think too much of it. 


August 15th, she flies to my city. I buy her flowers, plan a nice date, and I meet her at a park. She tells me there that she wants a divorce. She says she just can’t check back into our relationship. She cites our 2 trivial arguments as proof that I don’t care about her, she apologies, I try and plea my love and put our relationship into perspective, but she has made up her mind and already told her family.


There is no reasoning with her. I have written letters, talked over the phone with her, and gotten our marriage mentors to encourage her. I have even arranged to move up to her earlier (in a place close to her) and set up an environment where we can work everything out. She has told me not to come down. I desperately want to save my marriage, but my wife is checked out and there is nothing I can do.


Before we got married, people who were happily married for 10-20 years told us that the 1-2 years of marriage would be difficult. Bringing together 2 different lives, dreams, goals, and ways of living takes work. I feel like my wife took the easy path out of our relationship, she gave up when the going got a little rough, checked out, and wasn’t willing to stay true to her vows and work on our marriage to keep it alive. I know that this is common. People are excited about the love they have found, get married without fully getting to know someone (you think you do!), and then find out that it’s not what they wanted/expected. It just breaks my heart that my marriage has become like all the others and ended in a pathetic divorce. It’s humiliating. It’s frustrating.


I don’t really know why I’m putting all of this on here. I just am glad to have a place I can put my thoughts down and share my experience. 


Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any advice for someone who is hurting? Are there any women who have been on my wife’s side of this, checked out and don’t know why?


TL;DR: Watch my proposal video. My wife checked out of our marriage and is divorcing me.

I (28/m) met my wife (28/f) almost two years ago exactly. We've been married since January of this year and before that dated on and off for a about a year and a half.

I say we were on and off because I broke it off with her after a months into our dating. It didn't go well at all, and she decided to cut ties with me completely, telling me that I wasn't the person she grown to know and that I was being cruel. It was a break-up, and maybe I didn't handle it the best way possible, but I figured I was doing both of us favor.

Anyhow, she ended up contacting me a few months later and we ended up rekindling things. I knew she was still hurting from the break-up, but I figured if I showed her that she could trust me again, things would be okay. It was during this time that she revealed many things to me about who she was and how she felt about me. 
She told me things like she had to teach herself to hate everything about me in order to get over it. That she could *never* forget what I did to her, that things would never go back to the way they were.
Perhaps I was being naive, but  I thought if I tried hard enough things could go back to the way they were. And perhaps this was where I faulted. I granted her every wish, I bowed to her iron will, and essentially did everything she asked. But no matter how hard I tried, it never seemed enough.

On top of all this, she has a terrible temper. The worse I've ever seen. It comes out especially when she's drunk. She ridicules me, calls me names, tells me all my friends are stupid, throws things across the room, puts me down for having a ""easy job"", doesn't let me speak when I have an opposing opinion and when she feels that she's right. 
Because of her reactions, I've basically become irrelevant. I am not myself. I try to be who she wants me to be, and yet, because I feel like such a hypocrite, I fail all the time. I want to make her happy, have her feel safe, and trust me, but she continues to say, even after being married to me, that she doesn't trust me.

I have no friends now and no life outside of my marriage. I have  siblings (all older except one) and none of them know my stuggle. I keep to myself because that is the only way I know how to deal with the pain. Should I try to bring it up to my wife, her temper gets the worst of her.

On top of all this, she has a drinking problem. Recently she tried saying sober. To my relief, she quit drinking for two months, stating that she realized that when she was intoxicated she would say hurtful things to me. She stated that knowing was enough to get her to stop. She stayed sober for two months before she started again. And now, I'm fearing the worst again.

And now the worst part: I've begun to comtemplate suicide. I've even considered murdering her. I wont' do it. I don't have the courage, if that's what you want to call it. I just cant' take this feeling of being trapped any longer. So I drink and I smoke weed in an effort to just relax and forget.

I want to tell my wife, but I can't. I've already tried a couple of times and she dismisses it. She already thinks I'm bipolar because of some emotional issues I was having when we first met (my mother had recently died of cancer at the time), so when I get down and she notices, she thinks there some kind of chemical imbalance. 

More than anything, all I wanted was for her to understand me, and not get angry and frustrated with, to not have her intial reaction to be so hostile.

I've already spoken to my doctor, who prescribed me Zoloft (for possible depression) and she recommended I speak to a professional counselor, which I'm planning on doing. But I don't know how long it's going to be until that happens. So I'm here, asking you guys for some kind of help, relief, or anything you can tell me to continue to be strong.

I know many of you might tell me to just talk to her, but that's the problem. I feel like I can't. So what do I do?

Our wedding was supposed to be in June. After we had a fight this weekend, he is ""no longer comfortable enough to get married right now"". We've had fights before and it never changed his opinion on our marriage before. But anyway, he seems completely unaffected by us suddenly not getting married anymore and I'm am totally crushed. I have been thinking of nothing but our wedding/honeymoon for so long and I am pretty bummed that it's no longer happening. Anyway, long story short he is expecting me to just be cool with everything and like gets aggravated sometimes when he sees me upset (which is making me more upset!) I dunno why I am really posting this. Just sad and don't really have anyone to talk to about this. (Our parents know the weddings off but no one else does yet. I am trying to suck it up so I can call all my bridesmaids and friends and tell them NEVERMIND!) :(  

Any one have any coping tips? I think I am in denial. I keep just having mini freaks outs when reality hits and I realize its really not happening...

Also I am 24 and he is 25.

*****You guys have given me so much to think about. I'm sorry I didn't post more information about the whole ordeal. It just bums me out and after these few days of trying to talk to him I have realized that the majority of you are right. He just doesn't want to marry me and needs a dumb ass excuse for it. I am less sad about it now and more so furious that we are in this situation. He says that he still wants to get married in the future, but I don't think he means it. Last night I asked him reasons why he doesn't want to get married. They were not reasons that we could work together to fix. They were specific things about me that he was not happy with. I am not stupid. He doesn't want to marry me. Now I just have to figure out what to do! We still live together and it is AWKWARD and last night we were talking I mentioned that this is very hard for me (to stay in this house with him right now) and of course he began to freak out again.  ?????? I dunno.

I am signing up for a beginner's karate class today. I think that will help.

How much does sex really matter?,throwawaygurl,140,23,238,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/oau1a/what_can_i_do_to_save_my_marriage_how_much_does/,"25/f married to 29/m just over six months now, after dating for five years. I had an epiphany yesterday that made me want to cry: for the longest time we've been having issues with my libido being low and always assumed it was the birth control pills I'm on. Now I'm realizing that it's my husband that's turning me off, physically and emotionally, and it's been getting worse for months.

I'm very happy with our relationship on most levels. We share a lot of interests and are comfortable talking about those we don't, we like going on adventures together, our financial views are totally in sync, we have the same goals in life, we feel the same way about kids; it's really awesome and I do love him. But as for attraction, I don't feel it any more at all and it makes me so upset. I want sex, I really do, just not with him. I refuse to cheat on him, so I have got to fix this somewhow.

In my defense, my husband has also had a downward spiral; he's gone from overweight to obese, he only showers once a week (and that's only because we have company over that day), and he rarely if ever brushes his teeth. His job also involves driving in his van each day, so he sits and just kind of, well, marinates. Let me say up front that I've never had an orgasm so sex has always been nice but not really a big deal for me, because it never really goes anywhere if that makes sense, but I still used to like it. Lately though, it's gotten to the point that we scheduled sex once a week and though I do my damnedest not to let it show, it's really about getting him off as quickly as possible because I really, really don't enjoy it at all. I'm so depressed because I don't even enjoy kissing him any more.

There's more to it than sex, though. You know the adage about how marriage takes work? I don't feel like he ever got the memo. We're both gamers so I can understand getting sucked into games and losing track of time, but he'll regularly come home from a 10 hour shift and then sit at the computer for 6 hours and not get up to do anything while I usually cook and bring him dinner and drink refills. He then complains how he doesn't have time or motivation to do anything, while I'm doing all the chores around the house. He also is off three days a week whereas I work a normal 8-5 M-F schedule, and he acts like I have more time than him. 

He asked me years ago when we were dating to nag him, because that's what it took to get things done, and it used to work. Now he just blows me off no matter how much I try to express that things need done. I gave him two chores to be in charge of, putting out garbage every week and cleaning the cat litter. The garbage is put out maybe one week in three, and I've taken over cleaning up after our two cats because he would never clean to the point that they were going on the carpet to make a point. I can remind him and remind him, and I do it when he's not in the middle of something, but it's always in one ear and out the other. 

I feel as though he doesn't listen to me in general actually, but that could be because not being heard is one of my huge trigger buttons and he's aware of this. This past Sunday I had been nagging him to shower all day and he refused, but when I reminded him that there was a local reddit meetup, he immediately jumped up and headed for the shower. I was upset after this (random strangers merit cleanliness but the woman you're trying to screw relentlessly doesn't?) and when he asked me what was wrong, I told him without trying to point any blame, and he blew me off completely, pretending to saw at his wrists like I was being overdramatic. Usually he's not so callous though it's becoming more the norm lately, and it really doesn't make me feel like talking. However, whenever even in jokes the idea that I might leave him comes up, he panics and begs me to not leave him. 

What do I do? I enjoy our relationship immensely besides these things. Is this relationship counseling material? He's never believed in counseling but he'd probably go if I asked him. The most depressing part is that even if I absolutely wanted to, I couldn't leave him; my student loans are more than half my budget and despite being paid relatively well and contributing to a lot of the household costs, I can't survive without him monetarily. What can I do to fix this? Am I just being shallow?

1375711837.0,119,self.relationships,1jqnox,Please help; feeling crushed. Me[25M] just found out my girlfriend [23F] of a year and a half emotionally cheated on me with a woman.,cheated_and_confused,169,50,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jqnox/please_help_feeling_crushed_me25m_just_found_out/,"I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half now, and we've been living together for about the last 6 months. I thought it was the real deal: we've talked about marriage, kids, etc. I'm in medical school and am about to graduate, and we've talked about where I should apply for residency in terms of going to a place that would suit us both (she's a teacher) and would be a great place to raise a family. We've have the typical occasional fights, but overall things are great and we are in love...or at least I thought.

I started to get suspicious of my girlfriend when she suddenly put a passcode on her phone. I noticed it one day about 2 months back when she was sitting next to me and it peaked my curiosity because she's never had one on there before. Then over the next 2 months, she began texting a lot more frequently than she ever had before. We both always got the occasional text during the day, but she began sending and receiving texts about 3-4 times/hour all day every day. Every time I lightly asked her about it or joked about her phone blowing up, she would state that it was one of her female friends she worked with.

However, I became really suspicious when she began leaving the room to text and began hiding the phone screen from me so that if I was sitting next to her I couldn't see what she was sending or receiving. I couldn't take it anymore and I did the horrible thing that I've never done before: I figured out her passcode and read through her texts…I really thought she was cheating with another man.

The phone was filled with romantic texts from her female friend that she works with. Mornings contained texts that said ""good morning beautiful/buttercup/lover."" There were texts that said ""I miss you so much,"" ""I hate not being able to talk to you all day,"" etc. There were texts in there that said ""I want you so bad,"" and ""I'm drunk and I wish I was with you right now.""

However, one text string really crushed me. It talked about how they wanted to be in a relationship together but just couldn't because at the end of this month her work friend will be moving out of state and my gf just ""Can't do another long distance relationship since it never worked out with guys in the past that way."" They had never met up yet after work for physical contact yet, however there were plans in there as well to meet up this past weekend since I was taking a work trip out of town (however I never ended up going so they didn't meet up). The work friend had asked her in a text ""what do you want to do with us"" and my gf replied ""i don't want to lose my bf but I want my cake and to eat it too.""

I was crushed by these texts and I confronted her about them. I didn't care if it was a man or a woman; I cared that it appeared she had fallen in love with another person. She told me that she didn't have romantic feelings for this girl and that she was only ""flirting"" with her because she enjoyed how she made her feel in terms of making her feel sexually wanted. She said they started as just work friends, but then her work friend started coming on to her and making her feel great about her self. I asked repeatedly if there was anything I've done wrong or not been doing for her and she said no, not at all, it's just this other girl also makes her feel great about herself and liked getting the reinforcement from more than one person. I asked her why she said things like ""if only we didn't live so far away,"" and, ""i need to be with you,"" and ""i miss you,"" and she just told me that she only said those things because her work friend was coming on to her so much and was making her feel so good and she felt like she had to say those things to ""keep her on the hook"" and not lose her. I tried to be completely nonjudgemental and accepting of her curiosity but she just keep saying over and over that ""I don't want a relationship with a woman and I'm not physically attracted to woman."" (She said the planned meeting this past weekend never would have happened because she would have called it off...). For hours she just kept saying ""I'm so sorry, I'm an idiot, ""I don't want to lose you.""

I'm crushed. I feel like man or woman, cheating is cheating regardless of which gender its with. I don't really care that they didn't have physical contact yet. I care that it seems like she developed an emotional, romantic relationship with another person. I believe her when she says that her work friend initiated everything and came on to her, but I don't think that makes it acceptable for her to send romantic texts in return. I also don't really believe her when she says she was just trying to ""keep her on the hook"" and doesn't have any romantic feelings for her or women in general. If she had done this with a guy, it would be over no questions asked. However, even though I feel just as crushed and hurt, I don't know what to do with our relationship because I really love this girl and want to believe what she says. I'm terrified that somewhere down the road, some guy or girl again will come along who makes her feel sexually wanted and tempts her and this will all happen again. I can't sleep and am just thinking in my head over and over what I could have possibly done wrong even though she said there is nothing I could change, and that I do in fact make her feel sexually attractive and wanted (and we have sex 3-4 times per week which is at our baseline). I'm just trying so hard in this relationship and am constantly trying to do romantic things for her, and so now I'm so confused and hurt to find that even with all of the attention I give her, she still couldn't turn down temptation when someone else gave her attention too.

She contacted this girl and told her to never contact her again and that it was over, and she erased the number from her phone, however I still just don't know what to do.

And before the 3some talk comes out, I've been in 3 ways in the past, and that's not what I'm looking for in this relationship.

Please help

Who are trying to save a fellow friend from their lying Long Distance 'Girlfriend',Bippity_Boppity13,155,37,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cixq7/22f_and_other_friends_who_are_trying_to_save_a/,"[Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cjefp/update_22f_and_other_friends_who_are_trying_to/)

I'd just like to state that we feel terrible for what we did.  We were between a rock and hard place and we felt this could either prove her innocence or prove us right. 

Our friend (21M) James** Has been with his long distance girlfriend for over a year.  We only learned about her the end of last year. She lives in Thailand. He took a trip by himself to Thailand in March last year to meet her.  At this point they were not together. Having talked to her a few times he bought tickets and flew half way around the world to see her.  They spent a week together in a hotel before parting ways, now being in a relationship.  

Something about her nagged at us.  We heard she was refused entry into America, so we worried she could be using him.  She said she didnt have facebook, which was weird for someone living in that part of the country.  She also showed no interest in getting to know us or interact with us.  

One day, and I have NO IDEA what possessed me to, but I searched her name on facebook and low and behold, there she was!  Updates regularly. Many photos. NONE of my friends and her.  So me and a few friends gently tell our friend about this saying that we had found her thought he should know.  He tries to go onto her facebook and he can't get on it.  Shes freaking BLOCKED him.  So he vanishes offline.  We start to worry, but know he was probably at that point confronting her.  He comes back to say everythings fine.  

We ask him what she said.  She told him that she regularly deactivates her account.  Ok, That could make sense.  She told him that she 'doesnt know' how to block people. Harder to believe.  He then tried to add her as a friend and she refused saying it was a bad omen.  Hmm.  AND to top it off, she has now blocked me and a few of our friends.  Now our heckles are up.

We try for a while to make him see sense.  We even tried to support him, after all, In the end it's his decision. If he doesn't want to look at facts then he'll need to deal with the consequences We now find out she STILL has a dating profile from when they met activated.  She also refuses to accept anything sent to her by him and also has not told any of her family or friends she has a boyfriend.  It's like she's embarrassed. 

Now heres what made us take action.  

He's buying a ring.  He's about to propose to this girl who is blatantly lying to him.  He has never had a girlfriend before, so we think he just cant believe his luck.  So, we decided to do something we aren't proud of.

We made a fake profile online and messaged her.  We prayed she wouldnt reply. That she would tell us she had a boyfriend. But she proved us right in the end.

She said she was single for 2 years.  That she's never met anyone online before and that she wanted to meet our fake guy.  It was heart wrenching.  We are now at a loss on how to handle this.  We don't want to hurt our friend.  We understand we betrayed his trust. But he was about to fly across the world with a ring and propose to someone who is playing him. 

What should we do? 

I understand we will get downvoted and get replies about how we should have kept our noses out... But if YOUR friend was about to be crushed and was in love with a backstabbing first girlfriend who could destroy his outlook on relationships... What would YOU do?

We've been married for two years now.  When we were dating, I really took care of almost everything.  I cleaned, I washed and folded his clothes, I went to the store, bought dinner, cooked dinner, was awesome.  Since then, it's been a slow decline to the point where I just basically sit on the couch if I'm not at work and he does everything else. 

 I have some medical things going on, nothing super major, but enough that it really does affect my day to day activities.  I have a mentally taxing job and normally, I'm in pretty constant pain with my kidneys and by the end of the day, I don't even want to drive myself home.  I was just diagnosed with some other bullshit disease recently also, and I've started a new medication that's really made me have to alter my life and I'm just sick, like, physically ill, all of the time since I've started it, which doesn't help the situationl.  It's gotten to the point where I've had to switch sides on the couch to stop the cushion from just collapsing due to overuse.  

He's been seriously the best husband I could ask for.  He's been so patient and he's been taking care of me through everything.  It's been getting worse over the past two years and he's just adapted to everything and he never complains and he never asks for anything in return.  He's just a little worker bee all the time and if he's not running to the store to get something for me to do (I've taken up cross-stitching since my life is based around the couch!  10/10 would recommend.), he's doing all the cleaning.  We used to have a cleaning lady but we let her go because she left a pill bottle out in the same room we keep our dog in (I mention it because I'm still bitter.), and I haven't found another company yet, so everything just sort of fell on him to do.  He works out of town, so he's only home on the weekends.  I try to keep everything as clean as it was when it left.  I vacuum at least twice a week (we have four dogs, omg.) and I keep things off of the floors so that the rooms don't get overwhelming. It's just hard because when I'm up and moving around, then I start to hurt, and then I'm down for a longer period of time.  

I guess all of that wouldn't be so bad if I would just put out, but I really don't very often.  I try and sleep with him at least once a weekend, but it's hard because a) we can never seem to sync up our schedules since my bedtime is usually around 9pm and he's up until midnight, and b) this new medication that I'm on is just kicking my ass.  

I am ridiculously insecure about everything.  I know that it's in sickness and in health, and he takes our marriage really seriously, but I'm afraid one day he'll wake up and just say ""I can get someone healthy that loves me just as well,"".  The only thing that I really contribute right now, other than my paycheck, is taking care of the finances.  I always try to budget so that we can buy him whatever toys he wants, but I feel like that, obviously, isn't going to keep him here if he wants to leave.  He's never once expressed any interest in ever dissolving our marriage, and is actually really supportive of everything that's going on most of the time, but it's still really just..hurtful that I can't be the wife that he deserves. 

What can I do to make myself a better wife for my really awesome husband?  I know it's a hard question since there's an actual medical reason that I'm a shitty wife, but maybe someone has some small tips that I can use to make sure he knows that he's appreciated.

TL;DR: I have some dumb medical bullshit going on that wears me out and doesn't give me the energy to do anything but survive and my husband has picked up all of my slack.

Except for one indiscretion...

About a week ago, we were talking about sex and he mentioned that he didn't think I liked to give blowjobs. I actually love to give blowjobs, it was my favorite part of sex when I had been with other people (I've been with enough people to distinguish different smells, for sure).

My problem is that his precum has this odor, like the odor of something that hasn't been washed. The smell is really only at the tip. Like a combination of urine and ball funk. I had gone down on him a few times, and was really repulsed by the smell and taste it left on my breath. 

I've watched him in the shower, and he retracts his foreskin a little bit and just splashes water on it. I'm not an expert on male grooming techniques, so I'm not sure if that's enough. Otherwise, he's extremely clean and showers 2-3 times a day for various reasons (morning, then after work out, sometimes a third time if he works out again).

I replied to his statement saying that I actually do like giving blowjobs, but sometimes he is a little strong smelling. I think he took it as his semen smelling strongly, and asked if he should change his diet. I just laughed it off saying that's too much effort. I don't know how to correct him on that, and I know in the past he has been insecure about being uncircumcised.

How do I approach this in a situation without killing his self confidence? And any uncut redditors out there, how do you properly retract the foreskin to get it clean (and what kind of soap, if any, can you use?).

TL;DR: Junk has funk.

I've been informed it's proper manners to post a follow up after asking for advice, so here goes!

First of all, thank you to everyone who read and responded!  Talking about what I was feeling really helped.  Thanks especially to the people who took time to dig a little deeper with me instead of just chalking my worries up to, "" oh she's hot!""

Anyway, Shawn and I cooked dinner together yesterday and I told him it surprised me how different his last relationship was to ours.  I admitted that it made me nervous because it seemed his goals with each appeared to be such polar opposites.  He asked me to explain a little further and I went over the things I mentioned in my last writing:  retirement and careers, family, etc.  

He understood and told me that his relationship with Amber more evolved than was planned.  They had good chemistry, neither was seeing anyone else seriously so they became each other's ""default date"" for events, and eventually got together.  When it started to get serious for him and he told her what he was interested in future wise she let him know that she wasn't and ended it.  He didn't pursue it further because he wasn't willing to compromise what he wanted long term either.  He said he expected that to happen but didn't regret spending the time or the friendship that followed.  Basically, it was a relationship with an expiration date but they liked each other so they let it happen.

We started dating November 6th, 2006, two months after we met in college.  There were some breaks during my four years at school, but we stayed together.  Two months after I entered active duty, I bought her a plane ticket and flew her out to visit me.  I asked her to marry me in the rose garden at Point Defiance in Tacoma, Washington.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  I spent all the money I had on the perfect ring for her.  She said yes.  

She went back to school for her last year and I went to my first unit.  I got orders to deploy and we scheduled the wedding a week before hand.  We got married.  She was so beautiful and I was happy.  Everything was perfect.  The deployment was delayed.  I was stressed out and nervous.  She was homesick.  

Earlier this year I left for Afghanistan.  I remember holding her in my office and telling her that everything was going to be okay.  I didn't want to make it any harder on her, so I sent her home before the ceremony.  She cried.  I tried to be strong for us.  We kissed one last time and then she left.  

Things moved fast over here.  I heard from her less and less.  She started spending more and more money, on what I don't know.  She wouldn't pick up the phone.  She wouldn't answer e-mails.  I was so mad, and let her know how I was feeling.  My birthday came and I didn't hear from her.  Two days later, she told me that she was no longer in love with me and she would be filing for divorce.  

I've begged her not to do it.  I've told her that everything is my fault and that I can change to fix our relationship.  I've told her that we can go to counseling or therapy.  I've told her that I will do anything to make her happy.  All she has said is that she is miserable with me, and that being alone has made her happy.  She said that she doesn't want to lose that feeling.  I don't understand any of this.  She's been the most important person in my lifem, the love of my life, for six years and now she is leaving me.  

She says that she is filing the paperwork this week.  She says that her Dad has hired a lawyer, and if I don't agree to the divorce she will take everything that she can from me.  I try to not think about it because I have to focus on my job, but it's so hard.  I lie awake every night and cry.  I haven't told anyone.

1351091554.0,116,self.relationships,120bgn,My SO [22m] never wants to have sex with me [23f] and when he does... it's terrible.,beepbop101,151,35,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/120bgn/my_so_22m_never_wants_to_have_sex_with_me_23f_and/,"We've been together for almost 4 years after meeting on an online game. We've lived together for 3, and outside of sex I'd say we have a pretty good relationship. We both lost our virginity to each other. When we first started dating I was on birth control and in a 1 year period received 2 surgeries for ovarian cysts. At that time I was rarely in the mood, and when he brought it up I'd get really defensive (I was 19 at the time). 
After I stopped taking the birth control things were better, but I still think a lot different from other relationships? We would ""fool around"" (oral, manual, etc) at least 1-2 times a week, and have sex maybe once a month (this was a lot for us believe it or not). 

However, the past year or so I have been wanting more, ideally 1-2 times a week, but it has been months. At first he said he was stressed about school and gaining some weight, which I can understand. However, nothing has changed, and he hasn't made any real attempt to lose weight (I don't care for appearances, but if it will get him to sleep with me then I want him to lose weight).

I thought perhaps if I lost weight it would help, but no such luck so far (I've lost about 15 lbs).
I don't know what to do anymore. I've brought it up countless times and all he does is bring up that I used to never be horny and somehow that makes it all okay. I realize that it's hypocritical of me, when he was so patient. But I also went to the doctor about it per his request and he has made little effort to change anything.

When I finally got him to talk rationally about it he claims that sex takes too long, and that its messy. He is rather large so I often need a lot of foreplay and lube otherwise it's painful. So I guess I can see how sex is a bit of a chore for him, but it really hurts my feelings that he views it as this huge effort, when it should be something we both enjoy. At first he would always want to skip foreplay because until recently I didn't know how to get myself to orgasm, and so I sent him this huge email with articles on ways to improve sex for the woman, and he didn't read any of it, or if he did he hasn't put any of it into practice.

We always have sex after we fight for some reason, and when I asked why he said because after we fight and talk it out he just wants to ""feel really close to me"". It's gotten to the point that in the past 2 months I have instigated 2 fights just so that I could get him to have sex with me. I know that is horrible, but I don't know what else to do.

I ask if it's me and he always gets upset that I would even think that, but how can I not. What other cause I'm I supposed to come up with. I know it's not fair to men to believe the stereotype that all they want is sex, but at 22 he should want it at least sometimes, right?

Whenever we do get intimate, and it usually isn't sex, it's just so unsatisfying. Usually he will wake up in the middle of the night super horny (something which I used to hate, but now I'll take what I can get no matter how tired). He'll rub my clit (the one way I've found I can get off) but it takes a while, and he'll start scoughing or sighing because his hand is tired and I'll just fake an orgasm, blow him and he goes to sleep while I usually get up and go masturbate, resentfully.

Other than the sex/romance aspect I think I'm pretty happy in our relationship. I think we've just sort of become so comfortable in our relationship so it's passionless and we don't do as much together as we once did.
Please don't suggest breaking up, as it really isn't an option. I'm not the most attractive person alive and I am horribly difficult to live with so I don't really have any other options than to make it work with this guy.

I am 40, my husband is 42, we have been married 20 years and have elementary school age kids. 

For a while (maybe 18 months but it probably started earlier) I have felt that I really don't love him any more and would like to leave. We married young (as students so no idea where life would take us) and while we were in love we have both changed so much in the meantime that I feel now like I am living with a very annoying roommate. It has gone beyond the general irritation I hear about from friends my age where they can get upset with each other but still make a connection. I know something is very wrong with the way I feel about him compared to how I used to feel. 

To give some examples, when he is out or at work I don't think about him, unless it is close to the time he is due home and then I start stressing about my ""me"" time being over (I know this sounds selfish but that's how it is). In fact, lately I have been encouraging him to go out, or to spend time playing computer games, and I have scheduled kids activities for most evenings so that we don't have to have dinner together. When he is not home my life with the kids feels perfect, when is is around I feel upset and resentful at the intrusion. Weekends are very difficult for me because I have to spend time in conversation, and our interests have diverged to the point where we each listen politely to the others news but there is no shared enthusiasm. We have tried ""date night"" but for me there is nothing different about our conversation in a fancy restaurant. I tried to think of an activity we could both go out and do but came up with nothing. 

I have been trying to think about what has changed. Probably the main issue is that I have never been attracted to geeks. I always went for the strong silent type and he was a lot more like this when he was younger, plus a lot of fun and always ready for adventure. 20 years later he works in IT, has turned into a homebody who, when he isnt at the computer coding or playing games, talks non stop, breaks into song every few sentences and bounces around the house like Tigger. The constant activity really gets to me. The killer is, he is like this because he is happy and the happier he is, the bouncier he gets. Even his taste in music is so different to mine now and he will insist on blasting it through the house all the time. This is such a petty, petty thing but does affect my quality of life.

Reasons I have to stay: on paper we have the dream life. House, cars, vacations, great kids, good careers, etc. My husband has finally snagged his dream job but needs to focus on it and I feel I can't turn everything upside down now, I know it would derail and depress him for years. My kids love their neighborhood, love their Dad, how can I break all that up. I have a great life in other ways, good friends, work, plenty of hobbies, no money worries etc. 

I know this is all about me and I am going to get downvoted. But this is all coming from me, he is very happy with his end of things. He is a really good man, very supportive of me and has been very reasonable through all this, but he does seem to think it is a mid life crisis or me being neurotic. I have told him he should find someone who he can have things in common with and who will be happy to talk to him about his interests but he seems to put this down to low self esteem (it isn't! I just want us both to be happy and fulfilled...) He says he still loves me and when I ask why he laughs and smiles and says something flippant like ""because you are hot"" and I feel like that annoying puppy who yaps all the time but you still adore. 

I have tried talking about this very frankly with him, and he just doesn't seem to react. One time I did say I wanted to leave and he became scared and angry, asked me to think of the children and that made me back track. I make comments all the time and am totally up front with him (in a non-aggressive way) that his passions don't excite me, that I don't feel like spending time with him, etc and he just seems to take it all in his stride. I know his parents lived very seperate lives and he thinks that is normal, as long as I am there to talk to sometimes he doesn't seem to feel the need for constant companionship. 

Meanwhile I have engineered this situation where I spend as little time as I can with him, then sit lonely in the other room, wishing I had someone to talk with, laugh with, share things with. I get so jealous when I see couples doing things together (even if it is only shopping), joking around, having a fun time... I sometimes tell myself it is only until the kids grow up, but that is a long time. 

I have come to the conclusion the only way to do this is to turn things around at home, but how can I do this when my husband's personality is turning me off? 

I need to mention, because this is reddit ;) that my husband would not accept any mention of an open relationship or counselling, so those are not options. 

**tldr; I am no longer attracted to my husband, in fact I am always irritated by his presence, and we no longer share interests. I don't love him any more but he still loves me and we have small children. I have talked to him honestly about the issue but he refuses to acknowledge it. Is there any way I can make myself be attracted to him again or at least make life more tolerable?. I feel so alone.**

**Update 1**: Wow. I didn't expect so many comments, I am going through them and reading as I can and I do want to reply to some personally. I'm sorry I didn't check back sooner. I want to thank all of you for your advice and insight, there is so much here which is helpful. Even some of the negative comments, where you have actually read fully what I had to say. For those saying I am selfish, I acknowledge I am...this is all about me because I am the only one unhappy and the one who has to make or force a change, if that makes sense... But this post was also all about how I can stay in this relationship, not about the easiest way to leave. Thanks. 

**Update 2**: I wish I could answer more of your comments, I have really run out of time. I have taken on board all the advice about counselling but now feel strong enough to first work on fixing this myself. Some important points I have taken away from this: it may be the physical aspects of the relationship which died first, by this I mean the day to day contact, not necessarily sex. I know we can work on that. With the loss of the physical connection and the emotional one (our interests going in different directions so we have little common ground) I guess I feel like I have lost my ""soulmate"". If I am truthful I am resentful of that and would like to get that feeling back.  A couple of people have made the point we need to try out each others hobbies or find new hobbies to do together.

So after my last post things have gotten considerably better. Here is what worked for me:

* **More me time** - Obviously I wasn't being myself, just a slave to my family. Getting out more has made me more relaxed and more interesting. Honestly doing less housework has helped because I'm not stressing out about making the house look great. I still do more than my fair share, but I'm not obssessed by it. If there are some dishes out or the table is dirty it can wait until tomorrow. 

* **Find myself** This sounds like a weird one, but since the kids arrived I've been ""daddy"". Instead I had to remember who I used to be, and re-become that person again. In a way it was like I was dating my wife again. My sense of humor came back, and I was generally more happy. Additionally I acted more confident, which in the end actually made me more confident. I'd find really fun things to do with my wife for our date nights, and keep them a secret. 

* **http://www.marriedmansexlife.com/** Despite disagreeing with many of what the person writes, I found that I was way too ""beta"" (doing things to make family life better) and not enough ""alpha"" (leader/confident). While the author is a bit full of himself with his macho-man world view, some of the stuff hit home. There are good points on how to say certain things, how to approach certain topics, etc. One good one - try not to make sex a question where the default answer is 'no'.

* **Want her to want me** One person was right when they said it sounded like I just wanted someone to have sex with. Rather, I wanted my wife to find me attractive enough to have sex. Big difference. As soon as I took that tact, I internalized what I was doing and put it on myself. What if it wasn't her fault, but rather I wasn't being attractive enough? So I've made it a point to reflect &amp; listen carefully to what she says. Does she not like it when I go too long without a haircut? Does she hate it when the kids bedroom has toys on the floor? I tried to pick up on these things &amp; make them my priority. And if I'm not sure I ask her. 

**The result has been positive.** Our sex lives have improved, especially on the quality end. More importantly, I feel much more like myself. Much less stressed and much more happy. It's a challenge to make my wife find me desirable, although it's a game I'm happy to play. We're both flirting more. Our date nights are a ball. Life is good.

It was a shotgun marriage. I was happy because I loved her. She loved me too, although I'm not sure of anything any more.

About 2 years into our marriage, she took my daughter and moved in with her mother. Her mother was in a different state. She said it was only temporary but decided to make it permanent in a month or so. I had no choice but to follow her after I finished school. She took me back, but at the same time maintained an affair she had been carrying on in my absence. During my absence, she always said she loved me and wanted me to join her. I would tell her that I had to finish school. I had no idea about the affair or that she felt she should carry on an affair.

Anyway, I found out about it when I moved to her state and confronted her about it. She got mad at me and left the home. When she returned later that night, I asked her to apologize for hurting me. She refused and said that I had to deal with it. At that moment, I had to make a choice to keep the family together and quietly suffer the shame of everyone we knew knowing about the affair or break up the family. I didn't want to break up the family so I choose the former. Edit: in total, I believe the affair lasted a few months but I have never talked to her about it without her getting angry so I don't know the truth of anything.

Over time, I learned to suppress my issue with the affair but I know that it manifested in many ways, usually in my insecurity in our marriage during the bad patches. We had a particularly bad patch this year when she went to visit with her mother for a few weeks with my (now) 2 children.

Upon her return, we had more arguments and eventually we settled on going for marriage counseling.

I was never able to bring up this issue in marriage counseling. Whenever I did, it was dismissed by the counselor and by her. Eventually, we realized the counselor was not helping and so we decided to find another one.

During a very recent discussion about marriage counseling, I told her about my main problem being the affair of so many years ago. I asked her if she would apologize for hurting me, but not for doing the actions themselves. I did not blame her for that. She refused and got upset. As she got up to leave, I also got up and told her (firmly) that she should sit down and we should talk about it.

She said something very strange in response: ""If you tell me what to do, I'll call the police.""

She pushed past me and went to the neighbours. I did not try to stop her. I thought the neighbours might mediate this situation so I also went over. She refused to talk to me so I went for a drive.

Little did I know... Upon my return, the police were there. Long story short, they told me some fantastic story that *never* happened from her. They also accused me of abusing her for the entirety of the marriage!

I was arrested and sent to jail.

I now have a restraining order (automatic even if you are accused of looking at a woman the wrong way in my location). I sleep on a couch. I can't see my family except with the court ordered agreement. I have been crying every night since I got back from jail and now it's creeping into the days.

I filed for divorce 2 days after coming back from jail.

What do I do now? It's like the past 12 years have resulted in NOTHING. I feel like a complete and total failure.

**TL;DR marriage was OK, not horrible but not great. Went for marriage counseling. In the midst of switching counselors, she called the police and claimed abuse. I filed for divorce after returning from jail. What now? PS: 2 kids.**

A special thank to people who gave me insight how my gf might feel about this situation. It was shitty thing on my part to not tell my parents for so long. 

just to make it clear, i do not plan on getting arranged marriage later on (thanks for the laugh though). My parents are more against arranged marriage than i am so there is no pressure from them.


Although i do come from a cultural family my parents want whats best for me. My mom flat out told me that if she wanted to pick my partner she wouldn't have immigrated here. 


I ended up telling my parents today and they were pretty cool about it, asking me if i could find a Indian girl instead (my gf is not Indian) I said I only want her. They were a little hesitant but wanted to make sure that the girl was going to treat me right. Too many horror stories with home wreckers I guess. 


Also a special thanks to people who had an idea of where i was coming from but my parents aren't the strict my way or highway type. Things ended up being very good so  thanks to everyone for knocking some sense into me. Now i am going to go scare my gf a little but will finally tell her things are OK. 



Edit: To people saying that my parents are racist, I completely understand where you are coming from. But I am probably the first person in my family ( I have a huge family) to break this cultural barrier. My parents spent 45 years in a country and no matter how open they might be, they still have their cultural identity intact. Many will perceive this as racist but they only want whats best for me. I see there are a lot of opinions being thrown around in the comments. My parents wouldn't dare disrespect the girl that I have chosen to be my partner. They respect me and I respect them back, there is no arguments between me and them regarding my choice. The initial comment about choosing an Indian girl was kind of jerk reaction i guess.

He told me he wanted those things, but wasn't ready for them yet, which I respected. 

After many long, in-depth discussions, I gave him my timeline - this September - which he agreed was reasonable. As the end of my personal timeline draws nearer, I'm panicking. He obviously hasn't proposed yet, and says he hasn't even started saving up for a ring because he cannot afford it ( although we both make around $50k a year). 

Last night, I overheard him talking to some of his buddies over Skype about a vacation he plans to take at the end of August. Two of his childhood friends live in New York, and he wants to go visit them for a week. Normally, I really wouldn't care - we're pretty independent people and we always have been, and I encourage him to spend time traveling and seeing his friends - but the trip itself will cost more than an engagement ring (which, remember, he ""cannot afford""). It's a spur-of-the-moment vacation, and the last time he saw them was in April. I'm feeling pretty insecure because he doesn't have his priorities right, or I'm not his priority. I feel that what he's doing is incredibly selfish, given the length of time we've been together and how I've been patient with my own needs to give him time to be ready.

I talked to my doctor about a vasectomy but have never gone through with it. I remain fertile to this day. Then about 3 months ago I reconnected with a high school friend, Lindsay [f26]. I met her daughter, Olive [f6] and really enjoyed both their company. My entire opinion on children has changed in these past three months. My answer to the question ""would you ever have kids?"" has changed from ""no"" to; ""depends on the person.""

Lindsay backstory - Lindsay has always had a type of guy she would date. The tattooed bad boy or older guys who have spent time in jail. Her past three bf have spent light jail time and were possessive and abusive. Her daughter's father wasn't in her life for the first three years or so. She seems to welcome negativity into her life. I think this is why she is a little shy and hides her feelings. 

When we reconnected three months ago we became good friends. But I made it clear friends isn't what I wanted. I wanted more from her. But she was a little stand off-ish and would only hang out with me around other friends. Until about three weeks ago. I openly confessed my feeling towards her. She accepted and we have been dating since then. 

Last night we were having a nice, cute talk about us. I asked her, ""why me? What is it about me that makes you want to be with me?"" 

She told me, ""Honestly, I like you because how much Olive (her daughter) likes you and how well you treat her.""

Is that a good thing? It kinda makes me feel like if Olive wasn't in her life she wouldn't want to be with me. The thing is, I have totally fallen for both Lindsay and Olive. They make my life so much better. I wouldn't want it any other way.  

When we first reconnected I wanted to show her I accept her and her daughter. So I would focus my attention on Olive. Be stern but kind to her. Listen when she had something to tell me. Watch when she wanted to show me something. Help her mom when it's bedtime or she needed time to relax. Olive has taken to me very well and always asks her mom when I'm coming over again. She told her mom how happy she was when she mistakenly saw us kiss. 

So I am asking you this. How can I get Lindsay more into me? Am I doing the right thing? I feel like I'm not really her type. I have tattoos and piercings. But I'm not a douche bag lol. At my age I look at women differently. I see a future with her. How can I show her I'm the right guy for her?

TL;DR - met a girl with a kid. She told me she likes me because how much her daughter likes me and how good I am with her. Is this good or bad? How can I get her more into me as a boyfriend?

Edit/update: wow! Lots of great comments. I feel like I need to defend Lindsay here a little. She is financially stable and gives Olivia everything she need. She is a nice and caring person. She has always been an awesome mother. That should never be under question. 

I would also like to defend my manhood a little. I am a journeyman welder and run a crew of four other guys. I race dirt bikes as a hobby. I know what it means to be aggressive and an ""alpha"" male. I live my life never backing down. Never turn a cheek.

We get time to be intimate and she initiates hugs and kisses lots. I think I need to look at the entire picture and not just this one statement. She asks for me to be around even when the father has Olivia. 

A lot of people have mentioned its still a new relationship and I agree. Thank you all for your encouraging words. And to those of you who had negative or cautioning advice I will take it all into consideration. Reddit can be a pretty cool place.

First. Thanks reddit. This is an awesome community with a lot of wisdom and I appreciated and took to heart all points of view in the responses to my original post. Thank you so very much to anyone who took the time to respond.

So we talked about everything last night. I planned on shelving the issue for a little while and just couldn't do it when I saw him. Apparently I am unable to keep my feelings bottled up which ended up being such a good thing. 

I told him I was scared. I told him I felt vulnerable. I asked him questions that were weighing on me. I pretty much just laid it all on the line. And it was amazing. Communication is such an awesome thing. This level of communication in a relationship is entirely new to me and totally freeing. There is nothing I can't say. 

After our talk I have no hesitations. No fear. Love is a hard word for him but we agreed on a few things. By my definition of love, he loves me. And I asked him to please actually consider what love means to him. To think about it. To read. To ask questions. To seek the answer. I let him know that I felt his version of love doesn't seem real or attainable to me. I just wanted him to consider that. And he was totally willing. 

I also asked him to promise me that if some day, he realized he didn't love me, or didn't think he could, to please tell me that. To cut me loose. He promised me he would, though he assured me he wasn't thinking that way.

We talked about our future and our life together. The rest of our lives stuff. He sees me in it. And even though he struggles with saying the word love, I walked away from it thinking what does that really matter when the relationship is so good. I feel more loved by him than every other relationship I've had where we could say those words. I said those words when they were literally meaningless (the end of my marriage). The actions and the feelings, they are so there. And that's what feels important to me.

I brought up one other thing. That I felt he pressured me into saying it. And though I already knew that I felt that, I wasn't ready to say it then in that moment. And he apologized and didn't mean to pressure me. He misunderstood my nervous laughter as me wanting to say it and just not knowing how. Which was partially true. But I stressed it was important to understand if I need to not say something (anything) at a particular moment that he needs to give me time. And I promised him that I will never let something stew, but I sometimes need a day or two to formulate my thoughts so I can understand what I am thinking or feeling before I say it. He understood.

So we are so good right now. I am beyond happy and even excited about my future. And in my present. Things are good. Life is good. And I'm in love and not scared of it at all.

She has an excellent job, and she lives in my home with me. We have a cat together and have been really doing well.

To begin, here is the backstory: About a year and a half ago my mom passed away. I have two step brothers [33 &amp; 42] and one full brother [21], all of whom my mother was very close with, as am I. My step-dad [62] was married to my mom for 15 years and still refers to her as the love of his life. While I have begun to heal, I don’t think this is something that I will ever truly recover from. 

Now my step-dad has begun dating again. As hard as it has been for me, I know it is what my mom wanted for him so I am trying to be understanding and accepting. Over the past 8 months or so he has dated a few different women on and off and has finally settled on one – who has now moved in with him along with her 19 year old daughter. 

When they moved in, my younger brother was still living there (thankfully, he has moved out). Now, he knew the daughter through mutual friends prior to her mom dating our step-dad, making the living situation very awkward for him to begin with. He dealt with it was by spending more time at work/with friends and less time at home. However, when he was home the daughter was very rude and disrespectful towards him.

While I do not particularly care for the new girlfriend, my main issue is with the daughter. The way she treated my brother is just the beginning. While my step-dad and her mom were out of town, she threw a party which included underage kids that were drinking and using heroin. Most recently, I was lurking around on Instagram and stumbled across her account. I looked at her pictures and there was a picture of a skeleton hand with a middle finger with the caption “Hey, fuck you L!” (in reference to my mom). 

That, along with a multitude of pictures of her drinking and smoking with friends in my mom’s house, has made me so furious. (I should make a note here that the underage drinking thing is a big deal right now because a close family friend is currently going through a ton of legal issues because a kid recently died in a drunk driving accident after leaving their house.)

My mom loved her house. She spent years designing, remodeling, and decorating to get it exactly how she wanted and eventually we spread her ashes in the backyard, as she wanted. 

I feel like this girl’s actions are entirely disrespectful and she isn't seeing any repercussion from them. Everyone knows about the party and how she treated my brother, but I haven’t told anyone about what I have seen on her Instagram. 

I have no idea what to do or how to deal with this. Should I tell my step-dad or brothers? Just try and let it go? 

How am I supposed to deal with this situation without letting my emotions be the guiding force?

We are both redditors.)  He (29) and I (26) have been together for almost 8 years.  For the past 6 months or so, our sex life has been really abysmal.  Let me just get this out of the way: I am 99.9% sure he is not cheating on me.

He has not been interested in sex at all.  I am *always* the one who initiates/brings it up.  That fact alone makes me feel really bad about myself, but it gets worse.  Over 50% of our ""attempts"" end in failure, either because he goes soft (most common) or comes really quickly (under 5 minutes).  He also frequently rejects me altogether.  Usual excuses include:

* I have a headache
* I'm not feeling very sexy
* I'm just not as horny as you (in general)
* It's the wrong time of day
* I have a lot on my mind right now
* Etc.

The last time we did it was *at least* two weeks ago.  I tried yesterday, and here's how it went: I got all kissy and whatever, he said skeptically, ""Are you trying to seduce me?"", I got annoyed and said ""I guess not"" but we kept cuddling, he invited me to cuddle *naked in bed*, and after about 40 minutes of this he used excuse number 2 above.

I have explained to him how horrible this all makes me feel.  The fact that I have to always be the one who brings up sex, only to get rejected most of the time, makes me feel gross and undesirable, unsexy, like a nympho, bad about our relationship, not to mention extremely fucking sexually frustrated, all the time.  Any time I have tried to talk to him about all this, he either makes excuses like ""I have been really stressed out lately, I have no libido, it's not you,"" etc., or he blames me.

Ever since we met I knew he was into redheads but at this point it's starting to really upset me emotionally. It's making me feel inferior and that I will never be his ""dream"" girl. He watches redhead porn 90% of the time, he writes stories and there's always a redhead in there. I feel like shit.

The issue is that my feelings have never changed/matured over the years.  I am still just as excited to see her every day as I was then.  I still get butterflies, and still want to spend as much time with her as possible.  However, her feelings towards me have followed a more traditional trend - she loves me a ton, but I'm no longer the top priority every waking minute.

Also - she loves sex, but almost never initiates (partly because I want it all the time).  And when we are in bed, she basically lays there and enjoys.  If she's on top, I'm still doing all the work.

Offense #1: My boyfriend brings attention to the deficiency of my breasts 3-4 times a week. I have a trim, hourglass physique that I never have to worry about or tend to, but he says that a larger bust would be more complimentary to my frame than what I have. I argue back what I have is ideal. He disagrees.

Offense #2: Every other time we are out (even just getting groceries), if there are females with C cup or larger jiggling or peaking out just the slightest, he will openly ogle, and then point out a nice set of boobs, or just a hot female in general (yes he actually tells me). He doesn't understand why this is offensive to me. Also, it feels like he's reacting as though he's being starved, sexually (not the case).

Offense #3: He helped me get a gel inserts to stuff my bra with. Whenever I wear them (ie: a night in the city), he'll seem really attracted, and jokingly says he knows what's in my bra is fake.

I'm not sure if this is a legitimate problem, but I'm starting to feel less like a woman. How can I explain that if I'm not his type, then why is he bothering, is he settling because of his age? Should I log his comments and show him when/what he says? Does he just have sharp-knees syndrome, and I should give him a boot so this doesn't snowball?

HIM: If you're so insulted by Facebook, or what's being said or lack thereof, fuck...do you care that much about Facebook? Actually, no...we're not talking about this AGAIN.

ME:  I said sorry
are you mad at me?

HIM: No.
I'm just tired of hurting you
********** 


He doesn't want his ex or his parents to know about us dating because his ex is still in love with him and he 'doesnt want to hurt her' because he allready broke up with her, and his mum still really likes his ex and would be upset to know he has moved on. I understand this to an extend but what botheres me most is that he knows it upsets me to be kept a secret but he just seems to get annoyed if i try to say how i feel about it.  Sure he says I'm getting bothered over facebook, but i still find getting kept a secret after 9 months to be pretty disrespectful no matter what the medium. 


Opinions? Am i getting upset over not a big deal? 




he's a redditor should i show him this post? might make him see my point of view, or might make him angry i don't know.

Thanks for bearing with my giant essays.

Again, since I am paying ALL the bills I turned off our internet so he could focus on real life and get away from the computer. I expected ranting and raving but got none of it at first - just a ""why didn't you talk to me about this first? I feel like I'm being treated like a child"". 

I have to admit, I agree. I **hate** treating someone who is supposed to be my partner like a child!!

I didn't encounter hostility that first day; we had a good talk and a lot of productive things came out of it - mainly, I helped him make a list of his priorities and the steps he needed to take to make those things happen. I also contacted his old therapist, who of course couldn't even tell me I had the right person, but I was able to take that first step for my bf. Since then, he has spoken with and scheduled a therapy appointment without my guidance and for a very low fee. I will be paying for his weekly therapy, but he *really* needs it. I'm also hoping he also gets some medication to help with the ADHD, as I think it's one of the very basic underlying problems here.

In the past two weeks, the frequency of our, uh, intimacy has *tripled*. He's able to be present with me now, or maybe he's just not looking at tons of porn anymore.

Because I felt so awful about ""isolating"" him from friends/family, I added a basic phone line onto my plan for him. When I originally told him I wanted to do this, he got all excited and started picking out phones with internet on them. I told him I wasn't comfortable with an extra $40/mo phone bill, but a $10 was something I could deal with. *He told me to do it anyway, as he would find a way to come up with the extra money per month.* 

I didn't ask him how on Earth that was possible when he had no job, but instead (through tears) asked him why, if he *had* money, he thought it was acceptable to keep it for himself instead of helping me with bills!!

No answer. Instead, he went to bed with a very guilty look on his face. I stayed up and was miserable, not the last time that's happened since then.

Fast forward to yesterday. Smart guy that he is, he has been using my (web-based) phone to get online. He also has decided to go back into business for himself... *online*. **Now he's created a situation where it's MY fault that he's not making any money, and if I'd only ""sign us back up"" he could be up and running in no time.** He hasn't made any effort or shown any interest in finding a job any other way. 

We got in a huge fight yesterday because I told him flat out I had no intention of ever turning the internet back on. He told me I was treating him like a child and controlling him, ***and that I was steps away from becoming one of his abusive girlfriends he's had in the past***.

""This is how it starts,"" he said. ""I've seen it more than once. You think you're doing something for someone's good, but you end up crossing a line you didn't even know was there. And then suddenly it becomes 'my way or the highway'.""

Since yesterday, it's like I've felt absolutely nothing for him. No hatred, no love, I just want him out of my apartment and my life - not necessarily for ever, but definitely for now. He sees this and has been trying to be extra sweet to me. What I see is how manipulative his addiction is (being alternately logical, sweet, or furious towards me) it's kind of horrifying. But I don't think that's him, I think it's the addiction talking. I hope.

I don't trust him; I don't trust his actions or the words he says. That alone is really scary because I'm trapped *living* with this person!

As for me, someone who has lived and coped with depression and low self esteem for ten years, I'm not-so-slowly falling apart.

**Before reading:** I have council with my long time friend and psychiatrist since I was a kid struggling with anxiety and I have a great support system.

**The situation:** My father has always been a subtle manipulator to ""get rich quick"" and find a ""sugar mamma"" for his business ventures. My mother left after 25 years or marriage because he kept her scared into continuing bringing in money for him.

In other ways, he was a supportive father to me and never wronged me (apart from subconscious manipulation to keep me in his life).

He took my girlfriend to my hometown to get her car repaired while I had to stay at home. He had previously said things to her like ""If things don't work out with you and ____, you and I will get married, don't worry"". We always thought it was him joking around because he's never been predatory.
While they were there, he made verbally sexually explicit remarks to coerce her to have sex with him, leave me, and run off into the sunset.

Since then, I've cut ties with my father, but I'm traumatized and very upset that he disrespected and betrayed both of us. Especially since she saw him as a father figure and he shattered her really kind-hearted demeanor.
I want some advice if any of you have experienced something similar. I'm hurting inside, and everyone is worried about me. I feel decent now, but I'm still in shock and don't think it has sunk in.

He's trying to tell me it was a joke and trying to get people on his side. Said: ""She was blackout drunk that night, if I wanted to have sex with her I could have, but I didn't""

Two days ago I worked with Her again. He was back in town at this point, playing in a tournament for a local charity. She had worn a really pretty dress to work, hoping that she would see him. She texted him asking how the tournament had gone. She kept saying how much she hopes he texts her back before she gets off work so they could meet up afterwards. At the same time all of this is happening, he's texting me asking what time I get off work, how my grandmother was, that kind of thing.

Her time to leave rolls around and she's bummed cause he hadn't texted her back yet.

He calls me an hour or two after she leaves while I'm still at work just to talk, he normally calls me if I'm working late to talk about our day.

Yesterday I go over to his house to straighten everything out and figure out what the hell is going on. Dude. She's been *lying* about **EVERYTHING**. He said he had to pull her into his office to talk to her about the lies she told me. That was the third time he has had to talk to her about her telling people that they're sleeping together since she has started working there. He told her these lies could get him fired and she needed to fix what she fucked up. He said she started to cry and said she thought I was her friend...he didn't tell me specifically what he told her, but he told me if she tries to give me a hard time or makes it awkward for me to let him know ASAP. She told him that she said all those things cause she was lonely, that her boyfriend had just broken up with her and she wanted to feel like she was wanted.

He looked me square in the face and swore that he had never had sex with her, gone on a date with her, been anywhere alone with her. He told me the reason she knew about his house was because her and our sales director had been to his house one day before they all went out to dinner, to congratulate her on her new job.

He wasn't mad that I had believed her, I think he might have been sad or disappointed that I had gotten so mad and was so ready to believe her. I told him after I see Her again (cause I know she's going to be weird towards me now, and ask me why I told him) that I want to go public with our relationship. I told him that she just happened to tell her lies to his girlfriend, and if we had been public about our relationship from the start this wouldn't have happened. He completely agreed, and said he was hoping that I would be ok with going public.

Now I'm dreading seeing her at work. She's going to be mad that I told on her. She's going to be mad that I didn't tell her that him and I were dating. I know her feelings should be the **least** of my problems, but I am worried about her.

I will say though, I am *pretty* fucking relieved that she's crazy, and that he hasn't ever stuck it in her.

1 month dating.

He is a very confident and accomplished person. I am not.

He sometimes comes off a jerk to me. I value humbleness and open mindedness and sometimes I wonder if he is a borderline jerk or is justifiably confident. I generally don't have set opinions unless I'm absolutely sure. I've only been dating him for a month so I haven't been able to make up my mind yet. 



**Are these ""mean"" things to say? Or am I being too sensitive? I can see how they are all justifiable but I feel hurt nonetheless. If its my problem I want to learn how to be less insecure:**

* I was sharing my life story with him and in the middle he lost interest and started eavesdropping on the conversation next to us, and interrupted me to point them out

* He doesn't need to hear ""I love you"" from me; he says he doesn't need to hear compliments from me

* He says I don't know how to give head properly, and yet asks for it often

* He often tells me to woman up

* He mocks me (mocking voice, facial expressions) if I don't want to PDA in public

* I asked him if he was curious how I described him to my friends and he said he ""doesn't give a shit"" (backstory: He was telling me how he described me to his friends, and when he was done I asked if he wanted to hear my side)

* He is extremely smart and intelligent and said ""don't hate me because I know stuff"" when I expressed my discomfort in that we were very unequal in our intellectual discussions (he has a LOT more education than I do)

* He says I'm too sensitive or insecure

* Whenever we talk about our differences/arguements, he says something along the lines of how he is just going to be himself, so that if I ""can't take it"" and if the relationship doesn't work out he'll know I wasn't the right one for him


The good sides: he is very affectionate and says he loves me very often, we have a ton in common, we have great chemistry, except for these moments

There's no way I'm going to live in his house, though.",itsnotgonnahappen,138,21,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18e48q/he24m_wants_to_move_in_with_me23f_this_summer/,"Throwaway because I can't figure out how to explain these things to my boyfriend without sounding like a total bitch. 

Some backstory, though. We've been dating since I was 20. We're extremely compatible in every way. We spend almost every night together, either at my place, or his, so it's not really a matter of spending too much time together. There's just too many things wrong with his house, and where he lives, that makes it impossible for me to consider moving there.

Basically, my mom gave me her house when I was 19, and I gave up my apartment. My mom moved in with her husband, so it only made sense for me to move into my childhood home, so I wouldn't be paying rent. It's a larger house, 5 bedrooms, 4 1/2 baths, nice kitchen, huge yard, etc. As silly as it sounds, it's always been my ideal house (possibly because I grew up here) but I love it. I also have two dogs, who love their yard (in-ground fence) and we have a pool that obviously takes a lot of work in the summer. I can't exactly just leave that.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, lives about 45 minutes away from here. His mom moved about 5 states away for her job, and occasionally comes home during the summer. This left him with her house to take care of. Problem is, I really really dislike his house. It's not his fault, his mom was just horrible at taking care of things when he moved out the first time, so there's a lot of work that needs to be done and he doesn't have the money right to now to fix everything.

His house is also really small. It's only 2 bedroom, one bath, no dishwasher, small yard, his washer/dryer is almost shot, and it's in a small town that's in the middle of fucking no where. Guess what else is in his small town? All of his ex's. That's not a huge deal, all of my ex's live in my city too. But when you live somewhere that only has one grocery store, one restaurant, and one gas station, you run into these people all the fucking time which has caused huge problems for me when going to the store. I run into his ex that he was dating before me all the time. You'd think after all these years she'd be over it, but she's not. She's bitched me out at the grocery store before, said things like he'd never love me as much as he loved her, etc. Just shit I'd rather not deal with. 

My house is closer to his job and my job, (I'm only 6 miles from my job, his job is only about 10 from my house, instead of 45 from his.) We decided a few months ago that we wanted to move in together, and then he hit me out of no where with the ""Well, you can just move into my house.""

That's just... not going to happen. It makes WAY more sense for him to move in here (more room, closer to his job) than it would for me to live at his place. It also bothers me that his mom could come back at any time. My mom and her husband have built a new house together, they're both in their late 60's, love each other, etc. Yeah, they could break up, but they're both financially stable enough to do something else instead of moving back here. I wouldn't have a problem with that, but my mom has made it very clear that she doesn't want to live here anymore, and would rather rent an apartment than move back in. 

I told him I would have to think about it, that I wasn't really ready to leave my home. He countered saying that it wasn't ""really"" my home because my mom practically handed it to me. I understand that it's hard to leave your house, I've done it, and it sucks. But there's just no way I'm willing to compromise on that. Obviously, I'm not willing to give up my dogs. I've had one for the past 8 years, it wouldn't be fair to stick him in a tiny little yard when he's been used to his yard. I hated it when I lived in my apartment, so I'm certainly not doing that again. 

So now we're stuck with two houses that neither wants to live in. I asked if he'd be okay renting out his house, but he can't do that because it's in his moms name, not his, and she doesn't want him to leave it. My house is in my name now, so I could always rent it out but the upkeep is too much to expect someone renting it to take care of, and I don't have the time to drive down here, mow a yard, clean a pool, etc. as much as it needs to be done.

I've explained all of this to him, but he won't budge. I'm not going to push it anymore, so it's looking like we'll never live together. I know that the easiest thing would be for me to just agree and move in with him, but it's not logical and we'd end up worse off than we would be living in my house. I just don't know what to do. I don't want something this stupid ruining this relationship, but I just can't imagine living there.

My husband and I got married 2 years ago and were together for a year and some change before that. Before our relationship, he'd not dated anyone for 5 years. He had a fileserver filled with porn (multiple terabytes) and that was all he needed, apparently. 

Prior to our marriage, we started seeing a therapist because of issues we had in the bedroom (he could not remain erect during intercourse). The therapist thought it was from the way he masturbated as a youth (using his bed for friction instead of his hand) which is known to cause erectile dysfunction. She said it would take some years and a lot of work to undo things, which I was ok with because I loved him and wanted us to get through it together.

Up to and during this time, I'd initiate sex then console him when he couldn't remain erect because he'd immediately start beating himself up and would shut down. Occasionally he'd cry.

We get married and continue seeing the therapist. It comes out during therapy that he's just not really interested in sex, which is something he'd never told me before. I got really upset because I told him repeatedly over the course of our relationship how important sex is to me. He claimed that he thought I was ""just saying that, like all women."" After further discussion along those lines with the therapist, the real truth comes out: he knew it was important to me, he just didn't want me to leave him so he wasn't honest. That made me extremely upset as well. The crux of the matter wasn't that he didn't want to have sex, his sex drive was just waaaaay lower than mine...or so he said.

During this therapy, I share that I'm exhausted by always being the one to initiate sex and occasionally I'd like him to initiate because it's nice to know/feel your partner actually has some interest in being intimate with you. Therapist says I should stop initiating then, and let him do it.

He doesn't. We stop having (admittedly bad) sex.

More therapy reveals that he has no idea what turns him on and isn't really interested in finding out. It also comes out that he's so passive that even suggesting he be assertive results in him shutting down. He also has serious anxiety about sex. The net result of those things is that he would not initiate sex. These discussions and more resulted in the therapist telling him he needed to see another therapist to work on ""bulking up"" which was code for building up some...self esteem? Mental fortitude? The goal was for him to be able to face the anxiety about sex head on and push through it.

We're still not having sex. He is bitter at me for not initiating.

I continue seeing the original therapist while he see's his new one. I ask him how his sessions are going afterward, he won't say much. One day in late 2011, while I am seeing the original therapist, she lets slip that he's stopped seeing the new therapist. He hadn't told me that. We get into a giant fight about it and I tell him it seems like he isn't very interested in fixing himself, he wants me to fix him. I forgive him after some time for lying but I still feel resentment that he doesn't want to put any effort into making things better. I stop seeing the original therapist.

We're still not having sex. He is still bitter for me not initiating. I am now resentful at him for all of it. The lying about his interest in sex before we were married, the unwillingness to try to work on himself instead of me fixing him, the lying about the therapist, everything. It comes to a head last January when I had to come home from work because I forgot something. I don't announce that I'm coming home and end up walking in on him masturbating to porn. I have nothing against porn or masturbation but since he hadn't even displayed an ounce of sexual desire in my direction for the previous year, it made me angry that he obviously had some needs and was addressing those needs solo instead of with the wife he hadn't touched for quite a while.

I go back to work and later that evening when he comes home, I tell him that I can't take it anymore. Not being touched, not being shown affection, not being desired by my husband is sending me off the deep end and I can't do it to myself anymore. He cries, says he'll go back to therapy, will start trying to initiate sex, etc. I believe him and stay in the marriage.

6 months go by and he hasn't done a thing. I don't remind him to do anything because I don't want to be a nagging wife but also because I want him to take some responsibility for himself, without my being a motivating force (trying not to ""fix"" him). I mentally check out of the relationship and start looking for new places. My job became unstable so I couldn't leave even if I found one (bad excuse, I know). We go to his brothers wedding and have a big fight because I screamed when I saw a giant roach in the rental property, jumped on the bed and yelled ""KILL IT!""  Apparently he was mad that I thought he should kill it instead of killing it myself and proceeds to yell at me about it. This pushes me over the brink and I start thinking about just giving up my job and moving in with my dad just to be out of the relationship.

Luckily the job situation sorted itself out and I was able to find a place. He went out of town and when he came back, I told him I was moving out in a month. He wasn't happy, there was crying, I told him maybe we could try dating while we lived in separate places, to see if we can salvage it. He was very agreeable to that.

I moved out in early November 2012 and I haven't seen him since. He hasn't really talked to me since and every time I attempt communication, he tells me that he doesn't feel like talking, that he's sad/angry. When I ask him if he still wants to try to salvage things, he says yes. I haven't been seeing anyone since we've been separated and still haven't had sex. I'm tired of being in limbo. Should I go ahead and have divorce papers drawn up or should I give him a chance to get over his anger/hurt and attempt to salvage the relationship? We have no kids.

It's November.  This all started in May.  My last update, in July, had us deciding to divorce.

She moved out a couple weeks after my last update, moving in with her parents and brother.  I had the kids every weekend, and weekdays when I could.  We agreed to meet every other night for coffee after we both got off, in a neutral location, so we could keep arranging things and figuring out how things were going to go after we filed.

Somewhere along the way, over the diner cups of coffee, we fell in love again.  That was strange.  Very strange.  It was like when we were first dating, talking at the diner, then on the phone after, first about the kids, then joking...and finally about what went wrong between us, and the years of pain and hurt, and how they happened.

She quit drinking.  I quit drinking.  We stayed in therapy.  We stopped fighting, and started talking to each other, explaining our feelings, how we feel, why we feel that way.

Two months ago yesterday, she and the kids moved back home.  It's been a rollercoaster.  I'll get nervous and accuse her, she'll comfort me, or we'll argue over things that had happened.  The difference?  There's no yelling now, no screaming.  We're not fighting so much as explaining why something bothers us, and how it bothers us, and asking each other to help the other one to be more comfortable.  Not a day passes where we don't say we love each other, and every disagreement contains the words ""I love you, but I have a problem with (insert issue here).  Can we talk about it?""

Yesterday at Thanksgiving, she looked at me and said ""I'm thankful that we both realized how much we mean to each other, and how much we have to lose...and how we're becoming stronger and better than we ever were before.""

There are problems.  There are issues.  There will be for a while yet until we settle into the present and let the past become a primer for what not to do to and with each other...but right now...well, right now I feel blessed.  Not because she had an affair, obviously, but because after we got to the edge and stared into the darkness, we both took a breath, took a step back, and rediscovered each other.

So, yeah.

TL;DR - We've reconciled, and are working on building a stronger relationship based on love, mutual respect, and caring on the foundations of the ""house"" we both managed to burn down.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_13osjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13osjw/update_4_so_what_do_i_do/,

She's the best thing that's ever happened to me and a definite diamond in the rough. She's perfect to me and I love everything about her. Well, when we first for together I had already paid for a one week stay in New York City for myself and of course I extended the offer for her to join me. Which she did. Well as the time got closer and closer to go, I could tell she would have rathered going to an island or beach somewhere. Of course she insisted on going to NYC and she promised she would have a good time.


This is after explaining to her that it has been a life long dream for me to visit the city and do it alone..well...of course we fly to NYC and begin our week stay. We are from Louisiana by the way. Well from the instant we got there, there was constant complaining and whining , etc etc coming from her. And needless to say, it didn't stop. I didn't get to do anything I ever wanted to do during our time there, including missing the Yankees and Mets series which was the biggest reason behind me wanting to go. Well so we returned home from a crappy time and I still haven't heard the last of it.


Well anyways, my other two vacation spots are Europe and Japan. And I want to go alone. I love the girl with all my heart, but it's something I feel I would enjoy more by myself while I still can. Should I be willing to take her on anothe vacation as such? Or should I break it to her that I want to go alone? I know she would still stay with me regardless, but I'm not one to take advantage of certain things like that. Is there a possible way I could break it to her nicely or just risk it and take her anyways? Please help, because I just want to be nice and make sure everything goes smoothly.


I just don't know what to do and I'm split on the situation. Oh and another thing, she mentioned he would like us to go on a cruise to the Bahamas. Which is fine, except fr the fact that I work in the Gulf of Mexico for thirty days at a time and see enough water! Please help!!

I'm not the most attractive guy, so it could be a confidence thing leading to my problems of just not putti my foot down and moving on or doing what I need to do.  and also I want to thank everyone here for posting and opening my eyes to what's going and hopefully this will end up leading me to new adventures and a happier life.

1326103458.0,115,self.relationships,o954q,BF's friendships make me a little uncomfortable and he's FURIOUS about it.,whynothenryrollins,138,23,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/o954q/bfs_friendships_make_me_a_little_uncomfortable/,"Hi, first post here. Sorry if it seems like gibberish but I'm exhausted and so is my brain. Ugh, so here it is.

Me, 20. BF, 23. Dating for 2 years and everything is uh-maz-ing; we have so much fun together, have similar interests and ambitions, my friends and family love him and we're planning to move in together this spring! But this may be a dealbreaker.....

Most of his friends are women and that is totally fine by me. However, he has refused for me to meet his friends. He says he likes to 'separate and compartamentalize his life...and not mix his romantic life with his friends.' He says he acts 'flirtatious' around his female friends, saying that he acts exactly how he does with me but 'without having sex' and me being there when he's hanging out with his friends would be 'awkward.' Um, ok. I think that reasoning is a little strange but due to the fact that he has had sex with at least 3 (that I know of) of his best female friends it makes me preeettty uncomfortable.

I'm not trying to police his behavior or who is friends are, but I would love to meet his friends! He has met my entire circle of friends and it breaks my heart that he does not feel the need to reciprocate. Why wouldn't you want all the people you love and have relationships with to meet and know eachother?! 

Today when we were together he was on FB (he has no relationship status about us/pics of us) and I glanced and saw a comment he just received. Last night (1AM) he had left her a post saying 'suck a dick' and then she responded 'hey baby how are you? When are we smoking [BF smokes weed regularly, not an issue with me]? I miss you!' After I saw it I asked my bf who this girl was since I had never heard him talk about her and that this comment made me 'feel a little weird.' He exploded. He said that 'I have no reason to feel this way, it is just a friend. You're just like every other girl, I know where this is headed. Next you're going to tell me what to do and say. How would you like it if i acted like this?! I don't give a fuck, I'm never changing myself for anyone' I calmly replied that I would never control his actions or say who he could hangout with- but that I feel so in the dark about his friendships due to the fact that I've never met these people. Also, regarding if he were to feel uncomfortable about my friendship with a member of the opposite sex, I told him that he knows and has met all of my close male friends! And i've never hooked up with them! What hurt me the most was when he said I was like every other girl he has dated, his exes were extremely verbally and emotionally abusive, I do nothing but care for and support him. A few hours later he apologized and said that he was just traumatized by his previous relationships and does not want a repeat.

So, do I just let this go and be ok with not knowing his friends? Or is this a serious issue? I'm seriously conflicted, I want to be with him but this behavior seems extremely selfish and immature to me. Additionally, even though he says these women know about me, I feel that he is trying to hide our relationship from his friends. I wonder if they know he is in a serious committed relationship.

TL;DR: Even though he has met my friends, BF doesn't want me to meet his female friends because it would be 'awkward.' Oh yeah, he's hooked up with them too...and he's angry that I feel uncomfortable about this situation.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_o954q,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/o954q/bfs_friendships_make_me_a_little_uncomfortable/,

Update: We left that house move to our own home a few states away. After spending all night awake and looking at her phone every hour, I confronted her in the morning. I told she was acting like she needed to tell me something. So she tells me that she realized that she was in an emotional relationship and is in love with the guy. So I freak out.

The times she offered me her phone she had deleted the offending messages first, as you guys predicted. I noticed my phone didn't record iPhone to iPhone messages and I can't look at the call log until next week, so that's fun.

We leave the house to stop by work and says that we should stop this guys work so the kids can say goodbye and I look at her like she has 3 heads. I tell her I'm going go into work for 5 minutes and that she can spend this time thinking about if that is a good idea. I get back in the car she says that that was a stupid thing to say. I tell her that now would be a good time to delete his number and everything from her phone. She had a pause and then proceeded. We spent seven hours in the car driving, me slowly getting information out of her. She said there was nothing physical, she said that its ended and I'm the one. She lies about some things which I see through and tell her. She fesses up and says honesty is the answer. I ask her point blank questions which she answers. I ask her if she loved him more than me and says no and that she said that she probably could live him. I let my guard down a little when we stopped. She has since cutoff contact with this guy and I ask her to send a text to him ending the relationship and all contact in the future. She appears truely remorseful. We go to bed, we have sex and fall asleep.

So I take another look at her phone while she's sleeping find a picture of a text message that reads, ""in going to pick up my husband from the airport and kiss him."" He replies ""can I have a kiss too"" her ""yes""

I wake her and show her, she says its just a flirty thing they did and it was never ever physical, I am now not believing a fucking word from her mouth. Her luring straight to my face for days is raking its toll. She tells me not to read the texts to her best friend, which of course I do. And the conversation from 24 Jul shows up about how they talk discover their feelings. A mutual agreement is made to not tell me. And then a conversation from yesterday with her friend about me and his wife being told that my wife and the guy are in love. Her friend says ""did you use the words in love"" wife ""yes"". She told me an hour earlier that she just realized the emotional cheating that morning, I ask her how she thought maybe after discovering FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER, how she didn't know and cut it off.

So this morning we have more driving, my trust level is zero, and she says she wants me and our marriage.

I know marriage counseling will help but how do I move past this. I can't kiss her now, watch her be on her phone, I can barely trust her to tell me the truth about the most basic things. I want to be with her and our kids. The lieing has ruined me though.

Update: I pressed this morning for anything else that I should know. And so she tells they almost kissed but didn't on the 24, when she talked to her friend.  This new disappointment each day is getting old. 

Update 2: I asked her phone when we got to our new place and told I was undeleting messages and she flipped out. She fought and screamed for the phone and did not want me on it. She finally gave up and told that everything I thought happened, did happen and I was right all along and was a big liar to my face everytime. Up to and including when I was at the front step of our new house and said we could start over. She was making calls, kissing, flirting, cuddling (while I was in the house), texting. Ends up she did visit him and mis texted me, like I had thought.

I should probably clarify - I was a stripper when we first started dating, this was not a new development. I quit when I decided to focus on graduating from college. I went back to it because I wanted some extra money once we moved back down to Atlanta. When he told me to quit, it was because I was falling behind on my school work, and I did. I had promised him that I would quit if he ever felt uncomfortable with it. He told me, ""you can do whatever the fuck you want after you get your degree."" He just wanted me to get my diploma and make that my priority. So I got my degree, and dancing is NOT what I'm choosing as a career - it's just something to hold us over financially until I find what he calls a ""real job"". When he said ""you didn't go to school to be a stripper,"" I *thought* he meant he wanted me to get a job in my field. (Other comments he's made: ""That's what you get for going to school for biology. You should have majored in something useful, like engineering."" He's an engineer.) What irks me is that once I did get a ""real job"" (my internship, in the other city, and yes, it is paid) he said, ""I meant a REAL job, like at a company that pays decent.""

**EDIT 2**: I drove two hours to go home and get some of my stuff, not expecting him to be there. He was, and I said, ""oh, I didn't think you'd be here."" He didn't say anything to me, just put on his shoes and left the house. I put 3 months rent (cash) and two books (""Five Languages of Love"" and ""Things I Wish I Knew Before I Got Married"") on his desk, in front of his computer, and left a note. ""Here's rent for the next three months and some recommended reading. Call me when you're ready to talk. I'll be back to get the rest of my stuff when I come back from [my internship]. Don't throw it out. Still love you."" Did I handle this right?

---

My husband and I have been together for 7 years now; we were married in a courthouse 3 years ago and had our big ""official"" wedding a year ago. 

I moved down to Georgia for him 3 years ago because he was going to school here, and I wanted to be with him. I got a MS; he just finished his BS and is staying on get his MS at the same school. Our first year together was rough on me, he would spend 12-14 hours a day at school (leave home at 8AM, come home at 10 or 11PM) and being new to the city, I was lonely and spent most of my time cooped up at home, getting frustrated. He would come home and expect me to have all the housework done because I didn't have ""as much to do as [he] does"". I chafed at this (I had lived with my parents before this) but eventually I got used to it and just did the housework without further complaint. 

Our second year together, he had to do military service, so for about the first 6 months of the year he was away, training, and we kept in touch by calling, mail, and occasional visits. I was living alone in our apartment, and felt reasonably happy because I knew eventually he'd come back to me. He came home and then spent the rest of the year working at the local military base (part of his service) 5 days a week, normal 9 hours a day. Again I was annoyed that he didn't help out with the housework, but his reasoning was that he worked 5 days a week and was TIRED, while I was just a student and had way more free time on my hands. Well, okay. I dealt with it. At this point I had taken on a job of dancing at the local strip club to earn some extra money. He was okay with this - I had danced before, and it was keeping me occupied. Didn't hurt that I saved up enough to give him $3000 to buy a motorcycle for his birthday.


Our third year together, we were both in school, and I was still dancing part time at the club. I was falling behind on my research project that I needed to complete for graduation, so he made me quit dancing. In hindsight, it was a good idea because I did eventually get my focus together enough to finish my project, but it has never left me that when we fought about it, he said, ""you're not doing anything special, you're not a performer or anything. Guys aren't there to see you dance, you're basically being a whore."" That hurt, a lot. I almost moved out at that point. But again, I dealt with it.


Throughout our time together in Georgia, I have constantly struggled with communicating how lonely I felt, and how I felt he wasn't showing enough affection for me. I felt like I was basically a convenience to him -- I cooked, cleaned, took care of the household duties, and was available for sex. I was on the verge of leaving him, but I read ""the five love languages"" and it really made a lot of sense, and gave me the vocabulary to express my feelings. I communicated this to him the best I could, and he thought it was ""retarded"", but he listened. I tried to get him to read the book, but he brushed it off as some ""obvious advice for dumbasses."" Nevertheless, things did get better for a while, and we had our wedding and honeymoon. 


Eventually I graduated. He had another semester to go, so I tried finding a local job, but no luck. Continued to dance at the club, now at 3 nights a week and earning a pretty good amount of money. We don't have financial issues. He didn't like that I danced (""You didn't go to school to be a stripper"") but hey, it was stable and it brought in a good amount of money without taking up too much time. It didn't exclude me from pursing other job opportunities. He graduated this past semester, but decided to stay for his MS. We agreed that if I couldn't find a job here in Georgia, it would probably be best for me to move back home with  my parents where there were more job opportunities. 


Last month I started an internship in a different city a couple hours away, so I rented a hotel room and decided to stay there for the month. I came home every other week, and invariably I would find dishes stacked up in the sink, dishes still in the dishwasher from the last time I washed them, refrigerator decimated and him complaining about being hungry. I was annoyed by this - whatever happened to ""I work 5 days a week so I'm tired, you don't have as much to do""...? My internship got extended, so I moved on to renting a room in a house with a couple other women. I am finding that I am pretty darn happy on my own - I can take care of myself, and I can support myself easily on the money I earn from dancing (which I DO enjoy) while doing internship work to put on my resume. He doesn't have a job, other than going into the military base one weekend a month for training. After graduation, he's spent this entire summer sitting in front of the computer, reading Reddit and Game of Thrones, and occasionally working on a project for school. If I'm home for the weekend, we'll cuddle and have sex, but once I stop being entertaining, he goes back to school to work on his project where he can focus better.


I really, really, really don't believe in divorce. I would stay with him if I could work things out. To me, it seems like he is not willing put forth the effort to work on our relationship. He is uncommunicative - he rarely answers my text messages with more than a single word, rarely tells me anything about his day or what he's doing. A minor, petty, materialistic thing that has bothered me for a while is the fact that he never got me an engagement ring, even though I was very clear that I wanted one. It wasn't that I wanted a huge diamond, or even a diamond at all -- I would have been happy with a CZ. I really just wanted him to pick *something* out for me to wear with pride. But he couldn't even make the effort to do that. ""What do you want a ring for anyway? It doesn't DO anything. You might as well buy a car with that money."" He later explained that he didn't want to spend the money on something he considered frivolous, but if he were to get me something, he wanted to get me something nice, which he just couldn't afford right now. 

I don't think he's ready or able to take on the responsibilities of being a family together with me, and at this point, I think it's best we move on. We have talked about having children before, and it's basically always boiled down to, ""just have them and give them to my mom and grandma to raise."" I know he's joking, but he was raised by his grandmother because his mother was a young parent, so there's probably a grain of truth to that statement.


I expressed all this to him last night, and he was not impressed. He probably thinks I'm just crying wolf, since it's not the first time I've been so frustrated with him that I've threatened to leave. He simply asked me ""when are you coming to pick up your stuff?"" and ""Okay, just leave me the cat."" His response to ""I think we need to go to marriage counseling"" and ""I'm thinking about a divorce"" was simply, ""K.""


I originally told him that I would come by next week to get my stuff, but since he's out of the house for the weekend doing training, I think I might as well do it today so I don't have to see him and get sucked back in. I really do love him, and it's hard for me to not stay. I don't want anyone else. One of the effects of my job as a dancer is that I meet a lot, a lot of men, and I have never met anyone that has piqued my interest enough to want to leave my husband. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to men. I still want to give him another chance. I'm hoping that maybe he'll realize how much he loves me with a little time and distance. I'm planning on coming back to our city and renting a separate room or apartment so he can have his space. Like I said, money isn't really an issue -- but I can't really afford to rent two places at once. Would it be mean of me to stop subsidizing his living costs? What else should I do?

Previous thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f71ld/i_22m_want_to_break_up_with_her_21f_i_tried_and/

So I've broken up with her, even if I ended up acting like a complete dick, and feeling like one. I called her to break up with her, during which she asked me to come over. I agreed to this, packed her stuff that is at mine into a bag, and headed out. Whilst I'm stood at the station, I get a call from her. First she accused me of being bullshit for saying I was coming, despite being stood at the station. Then she told me to go home, as she ""wouldn't be there"" when I got there. Exchange went something like:

Me: Why won't you be there.

Her: I just won't.

Me: Where will you be.

Her: I just won't be there.

Me: Are you threatening suicide?

Her: -Noncommital comments-.

Eventually we hung up on each other, at which point I called the police. I told them I thought she was intending to kill herself, that she had made previous threats of it before (and had likely attempted), had BPD and depression, had means and generally probably wasn't kidding around.

I then headed home, and then out to see a friend of mine. She is calling me constantly at this point, and frankly I'm just ignoring the calls, feeling that I'm just going to get a load of bullshit. I glance at facebook occasionally while I'm with my friend, and see message popping up. I ignored them til I saw ""Unless you talk to me and tell me you're okay I'm coming round."" Which is naturally the last thing I want. So I end up getting roped into a phonecall.

The context of the phonecall was her wanting to know why, which I can understand, as all our previous conversation had been pretty curt. She revealed the police had visited her (and apparently done nothing?) and was obviously hurt by that. The most of the time though she spent disregarding my reasons for leaving her. Not being happy ion the relationship apparently wasn't enough. Apparently she didn't keep me from my friends. Apparently I could be free to do whatever I wanted whilst with her. Apparently she was happy for me to be going out with my friends (hah, I found that hard to swallow). She also generally just insulted me a bit and was very angry with me. I think the prime one was me saying I didn't feel like I could ask her for time away from her to see my friends or whatever was me ""not being man enough"". In the end she basically told me that I owed her money for tickets for a show I was going to her with (which I agreed to - whatever will get her out of my hair at this point) and that she basically thought I was a massive dick.

Interesting point - no suicide threats. 

In the end, I feel like a dick, but I'm free of the relationship. I'll be leaving the area in the near future, so hopefully it won't come back to haunt me. My mum is coming to collect me (as lame as that sounds) so I can have some time with the family to decompress from all this (My mother greeted me telling her about all this with a ""Can't you just get a normal girlfriend"" line, which did cheer me up a bit).

I honestly feel like I called her bluff a little with the suicide thing - there hasn't been another mention and I think she's more angry at me than anything else. Honestly, I'd rather have her angry at me than trying to kill herself.

My husband and I have been married for three years and together for 8 years in August. Now don't get me wrong I know people look at porn, I look at porn and we've looked at it together. When I was younger it bothered me a bit but that was mostly because he wasn't honest about it and tried to hide it. Now I've expanded a bit sexually I am completely ok with it. So what's the problem? 

I don't care that he looks at these girls but his comments are just sleezy, honestly the fact that he comments at all on that sort of post feels like a violation to me. I feel like its opening up a potential dialog and that makes me really upset. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but it really bothers me. In the past he had cheated and I struggle with leaving that in the past, I know it's very cliche but I'm not remotely worried about him actually cheating because when we married he made it clear that would never be an issue again. My point in bringing it up is I do have some insecurities I wrestle within our relationship. 

His comments are mostly benign like ""thank god for England"" and similar things. So am I being unreasonable? Should I let this go?

1368420077.0,115,self.relationships,1e874b,"[UPDATE] I[26,F] lost my friend's[28,F] pen and now she is devastated.",ILostHerPen,142,27,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e874b/update_i26f_lost_my_friends28f_pen_and_now_she_is/,"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dw7r5/i26f_lost_my_friends28f_pen_and_now_she_is/ original 


Not sure if anyone cares, but I found her pen today.  I'm very happy because I know it will mean a lot to her to get it back.  I will bring it to her tomorrow as a surprise.

As for the situation, the week was rather bad.  She was kind of upset at me all week.  Then a few days after the pen incident one of our friends who was traveling with did something she did not approve of and so this set her off even more.  She pretty much just ended up sulking the whole week and shaming the other friend for her actions.


I am a person who likes to always learn from negative situations.  From this situation I took two lessons.  One, I do not think I want to be as close friends wit her any longer.  It hurts me very much to come to this realization as she is a sweet woman and I love her so dearly, but I've realized much of the time we spend around each other I end up feeling like a bad person for very minor issues, and many of them just because we have some different values, not necessarily one person is right and another is wrong.  Lesson #2 I learned was that I should be far more respectful and dilligent of other people's possessions, even if it's the smallest most insignificant thing.  You never know what is important.  Yeah, my friend should have taken better notice to tell me this pen was important.  But I also should have paid more attention.  Listen, I know I lose pens horribly so to be honest I shouldn't have asked to borrow one if I knew chances were high I would lose it.  Even if it weren't an important pen, it's still just damn annoying for someone to borrow your pen and lose it.  What if that was the last pen she had on hand?  That was rude of me and I won't do it again.  I guess I discovered a bit of selfishness I have that I didn't even realize I have and so I'm glad this opened my eyes to it.  At the same time, I don't feel like a bad person nor would I be beating myself up about it had the pen not been found today.  I made an honest mistake.


Overall, I'm very happy for the experience because I learned a couple important things.


Thanks for all the advice

We have a son [10] and a daughter [6], and we were planning another. My husband has this week off and on Monday morning he came up to the bedroom and told me he doesn't want another baby. I was taken aback and didn't react too well. I didn't say much, just got up, dressed and went to the gym. When I came back I was still pretty upset and not ready to talk, but he was standing waiting for me. He ended up walking out and didn't come back for a couple of hours. When he came back we did finally talk and he told me he was really unhappy and had been for a while. 

I didn't see this coming at all. He said a lot of things and we hugged and kissed and I packed his bag and he's been up at his mother's ever since. I'm not coping very well, I haven't eaten since Sunday (it's now 1.30am Wednesday) and I  barely slept last night and can't sleep now. I've had time to think about the things he said and talked to a friend and I've realised I haven't been myself for a long time-I swing between extreme highs and lows, I lose my temper at the slightest provocation, I have trouble sleeping and concentrating, and I get this horrible feeling of being trapped. 

There's more than that, but I know it's me that's driven him away, but I didn't even know there was anything wrong till now, and I can't believe I never noticed how bizarre my behaviour is. I've made an appointment to see my doctor first thing Thursday, and my husband is coming over to talk tomorrow afternoon. My question is, how do I save my marriage, and has anyone else been in a situation like this? (And sorry if this is too long)

TL;DR: I've been acting crazy for a long time without knowing, driving my husband away. How do I save our marriage?

How do I deal with this jealousy?,elephantesimal,140,27,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b50rx/my_25f_long_term_so_24m_has_a_new_friend_21f_who/,"POST TALK UPDATE EDIT:
Decided to edit here rather than a new post since this still seems to be getting some attention. I really appreciate all of the advice and constructive criticism, however I'd like to point out something that should be obvious with any post like this: there's no way for me to appropriately convey the whole story here, and so while these issues all seem pretty serious (which, granted, they ARE) they do not make my SO a down and dirty cheater. Our relationship is excellent aside from the issues I've been having with this new friend, which is why our talk last night went very well. 

We were both able to keep out heads for the most part, and I explained all of the things I outlined in this thread again and put emphasis on how they made me feel instead of why I thought it was wrong. I got a lot of insight into their friendship and how and why its progressed so quickly. She's a very intense person, which I can attest to, and this is really how she behaves with all of them. The main difference is that the other is a gay man and the third another female; I don't think she understands the boundaries that are being crossed. Likewise it has been a long time since my SO has been swept into a new friendship and I understand that he probably hasn't realised how many lines he's been crossing. In our previous talks he latched on to the idea that he needed to spend more time with me rather than the parts where I asked him to spend less time with her, but after last night we've set some good boundaries in place and are going to continue on in our pretty incredible relationship.


-----------------------------------------


For starters we have what has always been an excellent relationship: extremely loving, open and committed. We have been together since we were quite young as we've now been together 9 years. Our biggest issue has been the fact that I typically find it difficult to express negative feelings, but its never resulted in any animosity between us. I have full awareness that my reluctance to be completely open about these feelings could be contributing to my current problem.


He is still doing his undergrad, and made a new female friend in his program back in January. He's always been the type to connect with females quite easily and this has never bothered me. I have never experienced any type of jealousy before in our relationship however I quickly began to feel that way where this girl was concerned. He's never been a huge texter, but I quickly noticed he always seemed to be glued to his phone. Alongside texts they exchange multiple emails a day: mostly memes and jokes but I'm not sure what else. He started going to the gym on campus to get back into running, which was something we originally did together, with her several times a week before or after they were to have class together.


Our first confrontation about their friendship occurred when he had plans to head to the movies with her and his other new friends. I was not invited, which was very strange for him but I assumed that he was invited by them as a group and as the new guy didn't want to insist his girlfriend came along. Later I discovered that the movies was his plan, that no-one else was able to go and that he and she had gone alone together. I let him know that this really hurt my feelings and that I was feeling very jealous of their friendship, but didn't want to tell him not to see her anymore since I was glad he was branching out socially.


Several weeks passed and I continued to feel extremely anxious about their relationship. I began to feel that it bordered on inappropriate considering how close they had become in such a short period of time. After spending weeks pouring a lot of effort into him and feeling that it was going unreciprocated, we had another talk. I said that I thought their friendship was weird, that the frequency of texts and the fact that they texted ""goodmorning"" and ""goodnight"" bothered me, that it especially bothered me when he and I were spending time together and he was texting her, and that I wasn't feeling loved in light of this. He apologized profusely, and promised to make a better effort. His main concern seemed to be that I didn't trust him, but I assured him that I knew he wouldn't cheat on me.


I felt better after this conversation but this is where I entered into the cycle that I'm in now: we have a talk, I feel much better after getting it off my chest, but slowly my anxiety returns. They have been working on a large and demanding assignment for school and so have been spending 12+ hours on some days together on campus working. I understand this kind of a commitment so I feel like I can't voice my concerns every time I have them because he has to do what he has to do and I also don't want to stress him out. I feel that I've spent so much time desperately trying not to be the crazy controlling girlfriend that I let the feelings pile up and it is eating me alive.


I've also been trying to make an effort to become friends with this girl: we had her and her roommate over for dinner last week which went very well, and it helped a lot to get to know her.


The turning point for writing this post happened today when I read a text between them. I was using his phone when a text came in, and against all reason and respect for my boyfriend's privacy I scrolled up and read their earlier conversation where he signed off with a ""much love!!"" And she with a ""&lt;3"". I felt like someone punched me in the chest. I also feel incredibly guilty for seeing this transaction and am not sure how to approach him about it.


Am I right to confront him again about the inappropriateness of their relationship or should I look into seeing someone to help me with my jealousy issues?


ALSO as an aside: our sex life has been excellent throughout all of this, at my effort as well as his. He admitted that part of why he didn't initially catch on to my unhappiness is because we've been so great in the bedroom and considered it mixed signals.

**TL;DR of original submission:**
Moved in with two fantastic room-/flatemates (both m) 25 months ago. Soon fell in love with one of them, but the three of us were *very* close. The 3 roommate moves out 13months ago, enters a new third roommate (also nice, but it's not the same). In August I decide to move out, the roommate I love (C.) wants to come with me. By November 2012 we got a new appartement for 2 persons setteled, moved mid December. Stupid me realises the stupidity.

**TL;DR of the update:**
We talked, he does not love me (other than as a good friend), which was no surprise to me, we stay flatemates and our friendship is stronger than before. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________


Better late than never:
After the discussion with you Redditors I strongly felt that something had to be done. I started by telling some close friends about my situation. They know him and me, and I've kept this a secret far too long. 
Each and every one of my friends agreed with the following:
* They would not have guessed that I fell in love with him, as I treated him like any of them.
* They did not think that the feelings were mutual.
* I should have told him before signing the contract for the new appartement.

Some of my friends (I told only three persons in November/December, 3 or 4 more in January) were advising me strongly not to tell him, as long as I could take it, most of them did not give any advice but offered a lot of help and let me make my own descisions. 

December felt like a short time with all that moving, administrative work, exams at university, but in January...
In January I strongly felt that I should tell him. Not because I thought he might feel the same, but because our friendship was getting more difficult to keep. 
Two people living together are driven by other dynamics as three people. New boundaries had to be defined, we had some discussions -this I consider completely normal and healthy. The problem was that I could not openly tell him why it was vital for me to **not** do even more stuff I considered ""pair-alike"". I mean, we already heard ""you old couple"" at least two times a week by our guests... However, I got highly emotional, not because the situation itself, but because I felt that he could not understand me and my feelings. 

The other reason to tell him was of course fairness. He was not free in his decision whether to move in with me or not, because of this information he did not have - I decided for both of us that it was ok to be secretly in love with your roommate. 

So I made a decision, and started writing long texts which I never sent, ar least not until Friday, 1.2. happend. 
It was a dance night (hard rock), the first since October that we went to, and I saw it as our last opportunity to dance as we used to (close, wild, funny, perverted) and of course practically ate him with my eyes to remember -just in case- how it used to be. 
He went skiing after that (drunken) night (did I mention the part after the dancing, when I nailed him down on his bed in his underwear and we talked funny bullshit?)* and returned -finally- last Wednesday. 
(*this is not unusual in our friendship and he could have getten rid of me easely if he wanted to, both by saying one serious word or just by strenght. It was not meant to be a seduction either, just saying good bye to something I know I could lose.)

I figured that it would not be such a surpise to him after what happend and as I was too much of a chicken to tell him Wednesday, I wrote a long e-mail (telling everything and that we needed to talk), which he read by Thursday afternoon. He wrote back that he was neighter angry nor disappointed and would love to stay flatemates. 

We talked Thursday evening. Quiet, some tea in our hands and lots of understanding towards each other. My fear to loose him as a friend and roommate was redundant and the very first thing he did as I entered the appartement was to just hold me for half a minute. 

He did only notice it on said Friday, and not by the ""on the bed"" scene¨but by ""the way you looked at me while dancing, although I later thought that, well, we were both drunk...""
And for the first time since November I felt like myself again. We laughed, talked and not a single tear was wept that evening. After the talk we cooked dinner and watched an episode of ""wire"". 

It has never been awkward since (yeah I know, only two days, but still) and although I feel sorrow now and then, feel like I've lost something (that last bit of irrational hope and a very sweet secret), I feel this is healthy. It's part of letting go of my love and everything feels very right. 
The talk had the best possible outcome, it was the right thing to do, and it was the right moment, too. I needed time to analyse my own feelings, getting inputs from my friends and to find the words for what was bugging me (not the being in love part, but the part where this love gets a danger to our friendship). 
And as my mother put it: a friendship that can handle this much trouble, can be expected to handle pretty fucking everything from now on. Cheers!

Her parents paid for everything - car, insurance, college, grad school, etc whereas I was not as fortunate. Due to this, she was able to accumulate a large sum of money by saving just about every birthday/Christmas/paycheck and not having to spend a dime of it over the span of 10 years.

For the past two years I have managed all of the bills and even managed her own finances as her parents slowly stopped paying for stuff (though they still pay for her cell phone and car insurance).  She has no idea what she spends, how much she has, etc, - she just buys what she wants whenever because she knows that she has a large amount of pull from and that she can afford to do so.

We both have well paying jobs but I have a significant amount of debt from student loans, car payment, etc. My job handed out Christmas bonuses last night and I got a 5K bonus and she was furious when I told her I wouldn't put that all into our shared wedding fund (which I manage the finances of).  She doesn't understand that I cannot afford to do that (even though I've told her), plus most of that will be taxed anyways leaving me with a lot less.  I told her I would be willing put $1K into the savings, but the rest I needed for this months bills and some stuff for Christmas (which  will actually be her present).   I also put $50 from every paycheck directly into the wedding fund, and she knows that.

He's only been surpassed by my wife, who I met in college and kind of filled the gap that I got from him going to cc for the first few years. I always hear that old trope about wives hating their husbands' friends and laugh, we all enjoy each other's company so much. She invites him over all the time and never minds if he interrupts a date night even.

They even gang up on me sometimes. Like about paint colors and what to grab for dinner or what a movie means. He even took her side and said that Eden could be a boy's middle name (we're having a baby in six months!). Some guys might be bothered by the fact that when her mom died she talked to him about it more than me or they talk about books all the time I don't read and movies I don't watch, but I am really secure.

Until tonight. He's crashing at our place cause of too many beers and it's thanksgiving, so he'll be here anyways. And he says, in that drunk honest way he has, that he envies me. Beautiful wife, great house, and a baby on the way.

I laugh and tell him he makes 6 figures and is 6'2''- he can have what I have anytime he wants it. He just needs to meet a girl and get it. I tease that he doesn't want to give up his freedom.

He shakes his head, no I want what -you- have. I'm so happy you have this, but you found the only girl I would ever want this with. It kills me. I love you both so damned much.

I ask if he loves my wife.

He says ""with everything I have, she's my soulmate. I knew when I first met her. If I had met her first... "" Then he just gets up and goes to the guestroom.

I don't know how to process this. I feel..uncomfortable. Suddenly so much of what he says makes sense. He even tried to talk me out my wedding when I had cold feet. I don't know what to do. He's my best friend. I don't think he would cheat me, or that my wife would either, but still he's sleeping a room away from my wife right now, either way I resolve not to ruin the holiday.

This morning I woke up and they were both already up, cleaning and cooking. Best friend, let's call him Jason because that's his name, is being overly friendly and not meeting my eyes at the same time. Hannah is singing along to bon jovi, it's all normal.

Anyways, the guests start to arrive, a little early. I end up watching some tv with my dad and kid brother. Jason, Hannah, my wife, and an aunt are getting everything ready. All of a sudden I feel uncomfortable about him helping while I'm not. I go to the kitchen.

My mom tells me they went to get table settings from the junk room. We bought this mammoth of a house and it's on the opposite side, I get outside the door and her this:

Hannah, in the middle of a rant,:all got here so early, I know they're just trying to look over my shoulder. And I hate that. blah, blah, blah, blah, on, on.

Jason: I drunk too much last night

Hannah, laughs: I noticed. Is that why it's taking you so long to get that box down?

Jason: No, I'm just trying to figure out how to say this. (pause) I told Alex I love you last night.. I wish I hadn't, but I did.

Hannah: You know you don't love me, I have a horrible temper and always misplace my things, you just haven't met the right girl. You will and you'll forget all about me- then I won't have anyone to talk about Madmen with or to make read the books I've read. It will break my heart a little.

Jason: You always say that. And I've tried so damned hard to forget you. [It sounds like he's crying] I've slept with so many girls, I even bought a ring, but they weren't you. I wish I could forget you. [comforting sounds, shh, shh] Jason: Could you have ever loved me?

Hannah:Your my best friend. I adore you.

Jason: No, as a man. In another universe, if you had met me first, would you have loved me?

(long pause) Hannah: I would have been crazy about you

They go on and talk about what he said last night, no I didn't tell Hannah. Yes, it will be okay. Nothing will change. He just drunk too much. Nothing is going to happen so it doesn't matter anyways.
They finally actually grab the candles and decorations and I scatter before they see me. 

I feel like an idiot.. my wife knew. Not only that they had talks about it. She would have loved him. I don't even care if it's true, why would she say it? It's been a day but we have some out of town guests staying and I don't want to bring up personal drama with them here. They are leaving tomorrow, thank god. My best friend seems to content to act like it never happened, but has been sure to never be alone with me.

I feel a little angry a lot hurt but most confused. This guy is my brother. But she's my wife and it makes me super uncomfortable he has romantic ideas about her. I can't even process it. What should I do?

tl;dr My (m/25) best friend of 14 years (m/25) confessed to loving my wife of three years (f/24) when we were drinking. We have all always been close. He says he would never act on it, but it kills him. The next day it's thanksgiving and we have a household full of people, so I hold steady. I hear them have an intimate conversation and she obviously knows he loves her. Tomorrow I will finally have an empty house and a chance to deal. How should I approach this? Can we still be friends?

The details included in this will make it more than obvious who I am to him. I could really care less. I just need to say this all out somewhere.

**tl;dr**: Guy I love was actually holding a flame for a girl who rejected him 7 years ago and hasn't been able to love since. He left me cause now I know--even though I wanted to help him through it. 

I really want to keep this brief. I met a guy online, we had an on and off LDR for close to 20 months. We could easily be just friends, chat for hours about the silliest thing. however, when we're in the same room it was like fireworks--well maybe it was just for me. He was definitely not perfect, not the most handsome... but who is? This guy was simply who he was, and it fit. Ya know?

Every time I tried to get closer--I was met with wavering. I'd get sick of it and attempt to move on. But being a glutton for pain I came back (3 times). 

Anyway, the monster of his indecision and inability to figure out what he wanted has haunted the relationship from the get go. And I'm a fairly insecure person. This 3rd time around, I had been working really hard on communicating when I needed reassurance or a bit of extra affection. Surprise, surprise, it was working to alleviate a lot of my worries.

So, I start having this creeping feeling that he may never love me. I was open about my feelings, but he made it clear he didn't feel that way now. It hurt, but I was aware that everyone moves at a different pace. I never demanded he love me or even asked for him to. 

Anyway, the creeping feeling led me to ask him if our relationship was just something he was doing cause it was there. Like, I'm just a neat girl so why not? He tipped toed around the issue for a while.

Finally he says it's probably time to talk about something really painful from his life that he never talks about. Then he lays it on. He fell in love at first sight with a girl he knew through another friend. They had limited interaction before he confessed. She rejected him. She moved on, he didn't. He said the didn't even touch. As he says, he has never loved another since then. There's no contact between them. He tells me he desperately wants to get over it. That he's tried everything. But his heart just won't let go of this girl (who at this point is as good as a figment of his imagination).

What do I feel? Sad for him. I want to help support him while he works through this. Strangely, I don't feel threatened.

His reaction? ""Welp, now that you know me better and my deep dark secret, I don't want to be with you anymore."" He let me thrash around like a dying fish for about an hour and half pleading my case.

It was fine to toy with me for this long, to string me along like a little marionette. It was okay to burrow his way into my life but once it comes out and I know what it was keeping him distant.. something we can tackle together. I'm no longer worth it.

We talked more this morning and I asked if this girl said, ""Come here now,"" if he'd get on a plane. He said yes. This doesn't sound much like trying to get over something--more like clinging to it for dear life.

I don't know what advice I can get that I haven't already heard. I hurt everywhere. Could probably use a bunch of girl-he ain't worth your time.

[Update #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fl0d2/update_boyfriend_m34_of_4_months_says_i_f31_am_no/)

Thank you all for your feedback. There was a lot of eye-opening conversations, a lot of it which I felt might be exaggerated just ever so slightly into a witchhunt.  However, it made me realize that I needed to really stand my ground and tell him just how out of line he had been and explain for a final time that I felt my relationships with my friends were COMPLETELY acceptable and his requests were not.

We have been talking via phone about the weekend over the last two days (Monday/Tuesday).   

I basically told him that behavior like this will end our relationship.  I said he had been looking at this weekend mostly as how it affected him, and avoided looking at it through the accusations, etc, that he threw at me during it. I told him that I have given and will continue to give my friends, male or female, both verbal and physical affections and he needs to understand that those affections are platonic in nature. I also preempted a lot of his responses by saying that if he cannot deal with that, and he states that I need to cease it in order to continue dating him, I will see it as controlling behavior on him part, and is a sign that we are incompatible and need to stop seeing each other. 

I stated that this weekend was either a really large bump in the road or the beginning of the end of our relationship, but I was going to give him a chance to prove that he can trust me in the way that I require.  I also made sure he understood that this is a no-strikes deal; if he EVER accuses me of the things he accused me of this weekend, or interrogates me on the phone about what I was doing in that manner again, even in the ""heat of the moment,"" this will be over and I will just hang up and never contact him again.

BF volunteered some information yesterday evening that made me feel positive about him understanding how out-of-line his behavior was.  He said he had been doing a lot of reading about how jealousy and jealous behavior affects the other people in the relationship, and how it is viewed from the outside.  He also said that he didn't think I was the right person to talk to about this but he is open to seeking outside help.  

I think this is very self-aware behavior and he is truly contrite about it, esp because he said he is open to seeking therapy, after saying that he had always been afraid to because he felt it made him appear weak.  This was not something I brought up at all, it was volunteered.  

**tl;dr**  After a very long set of conversations over the past two days, I have laid down a no-second-chances policy and a list of unacceptable behavior from him and he has offered to seek therapy.

Apologies in advance!

Six months ago, I quit my job in order to take care of my mom after her third back surgery/spinal fusion. In this time, I also started taking care of my niece when my sister needed me to. This turned into about four days a week, about six hours a day. No compensation, that's fine...she's my niece, and I love being with her.

Now, I'm taking care of her every weekend. My sister and her husband decided to move closer to their jobs, which is about a 45 minute drive from up where we live. They work really early on the weekends. So this has turned into me taking care of my niece from Friday night to Sunday night or even Monday afternoon. It is stressful. Yes I love her to pieces, but she is not my child...I want a weekend to myself, not taking care of an almost 18 month old that I did not birth myself.

My sister and her husband have always been big party animals. I have heard so many stories of them doing the dumbest shit and thinking it was hilarious because they were so wasted at the time. I have honestly always found it annoying. Before they had their daughter, I looked at it as, ""Oh they are just having fun! Good for them!"" However, now that this child is walking/running around the earth...I feel that things need to change and they are not.

When I first started taking care of my niece, it was because my sister was at work or school. I really respected her for wanting to go back to school and everything, so taking care of my niece was absolutely okay with me. When they moved downtown, they moved in with their two best friends who have and 8 year old. They do not believe in immunizations at all. So my 18 month old niece is around a kid who has no immunizations and is at daycare or school all day. They don't have a problem with this, but I DO!

Well, a couple of times they have left the baby with me to go out and have a good time. That's cool, parents need to go out and blow off steam too! I get that. But when it gets to the point when you can't get your ass out of bed because you got too wasted the night before...I see some problems with that. 

Last weekend, my niece was dropped off on Friday night. My sister's husband did not have to work Saturday...but he ""could not"" have the baby that morning because he had to prepare for the sporting event that he was taking my sister to. So, Saturday night they go out and evidently got wasted. My sister texted me Sunday morning saying that she only got 2 hours of sleep...still was going to work, but would it be ok if I kept the baby til Monday so she could get some sleep....mind you, her husband DID NOT WORK ON SUNDAY! He was too hungover/fucking lazy to come get his daughter and spend time with her.
They missed spending Easter with her. Then my sister got all butt hurt when I showed her the pictures of me and her daughter dying eggs together...well, uh....shouldn't you have not gone out drinking and partying so you could do that with her?

I cannot fit all I want to say into this post. It will turn into a novel. I just feel like I am being taken advantage of/they are being fucking lazy. I wish I could adopt my niece, but I cannot. Do I need to confront my sister? What do I do?

**TL;DR**: I do not get along with my husband's cousin, with whom he is also extremely close to. How can I move past this? 

First, I'm sorry if it's disjointed...I just have a lot on my mind! 

Okay, I'm going to start out by providing some necessary background. My husband is from central america and speaks an indigenous language, Tlapanec, as well as Spanish and English. Tlapanec is the primary language within his family/community [A/N I speak Spanish and English. Not Tlapanec]. He also has a very close relationship with his cousin F. It all started when she took him in to her home with her two kids and husband. He stayed with her for ~3 years. She made him godfather of her kids, which is a culturally heavy responsibility. 


Okay, on to the issues at hand. F never really seemed to like me. When my husband took me to meet their family for the first time, she didn't acknowledge me much less introduce herself. She pretty much took one look at me and started talking to my husband in Tlapanec. They spoke Spanish when talking to me so they could offer me food and when I turned them down [because I had already eaten] they criticized me thinking I didn't understand them. So that was the first meeting. Not very promising...

I didn't think anything except that I needed more to go off of to judge them. I thought maybe they were just nervous or shy so I let him keep taking me there thinking that they would warm up to me. 

Now, I did spend the night with my husband [then boyfriend] quite a bit. He even protested if I didn't feel like spending the night at their house. I had a pregnancy scare and when it blew over [it was just stress], everything changed with his cousin, F. All of a sudden, she was overstepping her boundaries on me. I left a few of my things over there [next to his bed], and we both realized that she would go through everything in his space because things would be moved around. There was even one time that I was taking a shower, and she went through my phone. It was around this time that my husband was also revealing to me that she was accusing me of not being true to him, I'm out to get him and use him and that going out with my friends is inappropriate and means I'm looking for men. What!? Where was this coming from!? I never went out on the town with friends;  we always settled somewhere and played videogames. There's no way she ever saw me out because I rarely went out on the town because of work and then time with my husband. It was just hurtful and untrue, all around. 

All of it ended pretty badly. After he and I got married, and moved out he told me about how she criticized me about being a good wife [she didn't think I would be one]. She had also called me very nasty names to my face if my husband wasn't around. So naturally at this point, she was like an enemy to me. She was actively trying to break us down for whatever reason. I would have loved to sit down and talk with her but she would just end up backing down to whatever I said and then go back to shit talking me to my husband. I only know what my husband has revealed to me as she only speaks in Tlapanec to him. 

**Currently**: She really uses the Godfather title she gave to my husband, to her advantage. She calls my husband for everything. She's called him almost every weekday to come pick her kids up from school [they're a block away from her house], to take her to doctor's appointments, to eat with us when she doesn't feel like cooking, when she needs to me translate things for her from her kids' school, when she needs to borrow money, when she feels like they haven't talked in a while, when she needs a ride to go to the store, etc. She says her husband is working so he can't do these things for her. 

She really likes to come over unannounced, as well. When she does come over, I don't enjoy it. Ever. She brings her two children [5 and 6 M] who jump, physically fight, and get into our food. When we tell them no, they also like to ask over and over until we say yes. She yells at them with empty threats all the time. She'll tell them that they're leaving but will continue to visit with my husband for hours before they actually do leave, so her kids never listen to her. 

One big problem is me not knowing how to address to my husband that she needs to have boundaries enforced. He's told me that he feels guilty telling her ""no"" and will lie to her to get off her hook instead of telling her ""no"". This also includes him standing up to her when she is nasty concerning me. I am well aware that she keeps it up because he didn't tell her to stop. What he would do is passively ignore her and pretend he didn't hear what she said. I've watched her chew him out and he won't stop her but sit there and ignore her while watching TV. 

I can respect their relationship because they built it before I ever came along so they have their own terms, but I'm just disgusted by her behavior towards me for the last 3 years. I want to let it all go because I have no desire to hold a grudge. I just want to move on, but I really feel like F is trying to keep him under her thumb.

So basically a few months ago our younger sister was caught doing a lot of stupid things. My older sister and I do not live with her, my older sister lives with her boyfriend, and I live with my father.

Our little sister is stuck living with our mother(she hasn't seen her father since she was maybe three) who is quite controlling, and we've tried to tell our mother this, but it doesn't work. Our mother is a whole story unto herself. 

B may also see this, but we're OK with that because she really needs to get her shit together.

She was caught a few months ago smoking pot, drinking, and we also found out that she had been sending naked pictures to her boyfriend and having sex with him.

(Our mother sent me a picture which I immediately deleted and called her and told her to delete everything, at which point she had to call B's boyfriends mother to tell her about the photos and ask her to delete them as well.)

It wasn't the pot and alcohol we were really concerned about, but she had been stealing money from our mother and lying about what she was doing, and that was a problem, along with the sex and nude photos/sexting. 

So the night we found out I took a taxi to my mother's house and went and talked to my little sister. She was laying in her room on her bed crying. She told me she was depressed, suicidal, and bulimic. I told her that was shitty, and I understood being depressed as I've been there but she had to get her shit together and that she couldn't expect everyone to just pity her. She had to admit to fucking up and own up to it. 

She acknowledged this and said she wanted our mother to trust her and that she felt our mother had been neglecting her. I told her that if she wanted trust she was going to have to work her ass off to do so.
I told her I would talk to our mother about the neglect and B made me promise not to tell her about the depression and bulimia, I told her I wouldn't if she promised to work on them. 

At this point I tell her to pack her stuff because our mother was so upset she didn't want to talk to her anymore, so our step-father drove us to A's apartment.

There both A and I talked to B more and she really seemed to want to get it together. She said she wanted to break up with her boyfriend, and not be friends with the friend who had talked her in to smoking pot and stealing booze/money. We thought we had made progress.

A few weeks ago I took B Christmas shopping and we talked a bit. She told me a girl at school had been spreading rumors about her and calling her a slut. I flat out asked her if that was true. She denied it and said the girl was just kind of crazy and they used to be friends but aren't anymore. I gave her some advice and she seemed fine.

Tonight, I'm driving home from my boyfriends beach house after having Christmas with his family, and A sends me 12 texts in a row. B has not gotten better. 

B had been at A's apartment and had gone on FB (which she has been grounded from for months since everything came out) and was offering to give some boy a blowjob in a McD's bathroom, and apparently had already done so in the past. She was also trying to find someone to fuck before she goes away for three months.

A called our mother and told her, and our mother told A she is going to install an alarm on B's window she can't sneak out. A also spoke to B and B is now telling our mother herself what she has done.

but we really don't know what to do. She's been grounded, had everything taken away, both A and I have spoken to her, offered our advice, told her we'll listen when she needs it, but it's clearly not working.

We were both Christian and around year 4 I stopped believing in Christianity or god. For this she kicked me out and we separated for half a year. During this time I began heavily drinking, went on a few horrible dates. I had no friends and my car was broken down so I was bumming rides to work, even though I am a college grad and professional finances just put me in a bind, everything collapsed at once.

We ended up getting back together, I had to agree to let her raise our children (if we have any) as christian. So here I am know, we are still married but...

...Now we are so different, our bond before was hugely based in god and religion. It covered up many differences. Now we are two different people. She is very bitter from my de-conversion and it manifests in snide critical remarks about me in all types of areas. Case in point, we take care of her sick father, I pay almost all our bills and yet she makes remarks insinuating I don't do anything to help.

Our sex life is over, it's down to once a month. This is partially on me, my desire to have sex with her amidst the nagging and criticism is non existent.

I am beginning to think about other women, and leaving. We have grown so apart, our intellects are on two different levels now. I am very logical she is very irrational, I talk about science and politics and she shuns these. I also am becoming hesitant to imagine raising children among this stuff or indoctrinate them to christianity. However...

...I am terrified. I am 30 and I am so scared of being single. There are so many horrible women in the world and Im afraid of getting into a worse relationship or that Im too old to find anything good out there. My wife does have some good traits, I can trust her 100% to never cheat on me. Despite her negativity and critical attacks of my character she would be a very devoted and loving mother (assuming the children stayed christian, which she has stated that she would end relations with them if they did).

What do?

**Edit** Huge thanks guys for giving me hope for the future, I think I will have to sit her down and have this talk today or tomorrow. All of your assessments and encouragement have really helped me make the decision which I already kind of knew was going to have to happen anyway.

Reddit,
There was a ton of advice for this particular post, and I honestly read every comment and tried to formulate the best and most reasonable approach.

In the end, I explained that my past makes me who I am today.  I said that I couldn't take back my past, but I certainly could promise him what was going to come: unconditional and exclusive love for him.  I have taken into account advice that was along the lines of explaining in even greater detail why he is the best I ever had (in every aspect).  I did not apologize for my past.  

On his end, he explained his feelings. It made him feel like less of a man etc.  He admitted that it was going to take a little bit of time for him to really move on, but that he knew we were moving forward, and he would treat me with respect.  He apologized for following what he called an ""older style of thinking"" and that my number was fairly average to the numbers he had heard from friends/etc.  

We have since been great.  Instead of letting things blow up in our relationship we have decided to not sit around and assume everything is okay.  We ask eachother how ""we're"" doing, in addition to how each other is doing separately. He has asked me to move in with him soon, and talk of marriage has been put BACK on the table.  All in all, I think it may have been time that was needed.  I appreciate all advice r/Relationships!

1375667868.0,110,self.relationships,1jppyx,Boyfriend [26M] dumped me [29F] after 6 years when he was about to immigrate. Blindsided.,6yearsfornothing,134,24,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jppyx/boyfriend_26m_dumped_me_29f_after_6_years_when_he/,"I was dumped about a month ago by my boyfriend of 6 years in a complete blindside.  We have been long distance for the majority of that, but last year I moved to the USA (I'm Canadian) temporarily while he started the immigration process here. I work at home, so it was no issue.

We agreed I'd live with him in the USA for three months.  However, he missed a test registration date (he works in a medical field and has to take the registry in order to be able to work in Canada) so it ended up being six months.  I paid for and furnished an entire house for us - probably $5k worth of stuff.  He lived with his parents before this, so he had nothing (I am fairly well off, it wasn't a hardship).  Before moving to the USA I saw a therapist weekly as I have clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  It was something I worried about (not having my weekly session) but I was willing to move for love and prove we worked well together.

I lived in the USA for six months with him.  Things were good, we rarely fought, and we only ever had one big fight that was resolved fairly quickly.  I thought things were going well but I was pretty depressed there.  I went from living in a big metropolitan area to the middle of nowhere Midwest.  All my routines were disrupted.  The house we rented was filthy and falling apart (I'm a neat freak, it made me CRAZY).  I didn't know anyone, and my boyfriend worked nights at the hospital, 6 days on 1 off, 6 days off 1 on.  He was usually asleep during the day when things were open, and at night he had my car for work.  It was hard being away from my family and therapist, but I made it.  I met and loved his family, especially his mom and grandmother - god I miss them.  I even purchased a bigger apartment so that his family would have space to come visit us once he immigrated.  I'm now living in my big new place... alone.

We drove back to Canada together, and he brought some of his things with him in preparation for his move.  We then found out that his immigration had been delayed from 2-3 months to 6-12 months (immigration wait times can change) so our time apart quickly increased.  We were both upset but resolved we'd waited this long, we could do it!  Shortly after he got home, we celebrated him submitting his immigration papers and the official wait period beginning (6-12 months) til we lived together once again.

A few days later we found out that he failed his registry test - by one point.  We had a gigantic fight about this.  Prior to the test, he refused to study at home, saying he was doing it at work.  I said I didn't think that was enough studying.  He refused and said he deserved his leisure time and because he worked nights he had more than enough time to study at work.  I was mad he failed such an important test, AND I'd paid for it (about $1100). I lashed out and said he'd wasted my money.  In response he asked for some space because he found me mean and offensive, kicking him when he's down.  I felt furious because it was exactly what I had said was going to happen (you'll fail if you don't study at home too!), and then he expected me to be sympathetic toward him.

So, I gave him space.  After 2 weeks of not really talking I told him it was unfair he was making me wait this long for an answer as to our future.  He told me he couldn't feel secure enough moving here and quitting his job and he dumped me on the spot.  This, despite me giving him a year's worth of living expenses when he relocated so he'd have an emergency fund to fall back on if we ever broke up - again, I am well off, and jobs are very difficult to find in his area - he's one of 2 students in his graduation class that found a job.  I was stunned - didn't see it coming.  We've had much bigger fights and it just felt off to me somehow.

I then sent a mail to the immigration lawyer (again, something I paid for) asking for our balance, and she offered me a 25% discount on his immigration package because the immigration package hadn't been submitted yet.  Wait, what?  Yeah, he hadn't submitted them.  He'd been lying about it, long before us having that fight - at least two weeks, maybe as long as a month.  But if this was planned, why did he sell all of our furniture and give away all our household items back in the USA?  He was dreading moving back in with his parents.  If he had been planning to do this in advance, he could have avoided a cross country road trip and found a new place to rent there and not have to buy literally everything again to move out.  So I'm so confused as to what caused all of this.

When I tried to help him initially with immigration stuff, he asked me to back off and let him handle it because his mother micromanaged him as a child and he really hated it - so I left it to him.  But then I started remembering other things.  He missed 3 total test registration dates.  Packages with his immigration stuff were mysteriously lost.  He accidentally sent things to addresses no longer in service.  There were just so many inconsistencies adding up, but I can't make sense of it.  Did he get cold feet?  Did he meet someone else after moving back to the USA?  Does he just not love me anymore?  I realized that he hadn't initiated sex very often at all when we lived together - was I not attractive to him?

A week after I got dumped I read an article on Borderline Personality Disorder and brought it to my therapist, who I'd began seeing again once I got back to Canada.  He confirmed I had it but didn't want to stigmatize me with a label, saying I had a mild case and that my symptoms were simply lack of coping mechanisms when dealing with emotions.  I'm a bit agoraphobic when anxious, and the living situation in the USA definitely exacerbated that.

Basically, my head is swimming, I have a newly diagnosed personality disorder, and this is so much to deal with.  We haven't spoken other than completely civilly to work out certain things (he sent me back the money I gave him for his emergency/immigration fund, we've mailed each other back some stuff left at one another's places) but I feel like I'm losing my mind.  I also turn 30 soon and I'm feeling like I lost all of my 20s with this man that now seems to not give two fucks about me.  It's heartbreaking and I feel like shit.  His best friend says he hasn't even talked to her about me, so it seems like he isn't taking it hard at all, which makes me feel like I've been stabbed in the gut.  I'm trying my best to move on, but I feel like my world has collapsed.  I apologize this is so long, but it is a complicated situation.

Edit: I should note, boyfriend in no way liked me for my money - when we met I was extremely poor.  I inherited money and it changed my situation drastically about 3 years into our relationship.

TL;DR for quick info.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jf8b9/me22m_with_my_wife_23f_of_2_years_discussed/

TL;DR (From the last Post) She brings up swinging, I'm totally fine with the idea, She's angry that I'm fine with the idea. What did I do wrong? Am I a bad guy for being ok with swinging?




The original post and subsiquent disscussion turned into more of a wake up call for me than advice on whether or not I did something wrong. After really doing some soul searching I realized I was a part of an abusive relationship with my Wife. Her hitting me, controlling the money, etc. 


Following many of you giving me really good advice I decided to confront my wife about all of these things. I have only had one conversation and we plan to have a few more. 

The first conversation has gone like this (we are still texting after being face to face for lunch).... Her James (fake name) ""you are not even trying to make what you did better""/ ""You hurt me and make me feel inadequate etc.""/""You won't say you love me or hug me"".

Me ""I now totally understand why you feel the way you do (I went on to show her how I empathize)""/""However the way you went about asking me if it was you that was the cause of a lacking sex life (swinging) I do not agree with""

Her ""Good and you were mean to me""/""You made me feel bad about myself"" etc. more bull

Me I apologized then went for the throat. ""You hit me and you've done it before""/It's not exeptable, and your an abuser both emotionally and physically""/ ""I wont put up with it and I will leave you immediatly if it happens again""/ ""You have made this about how your hurt, and I understand and apologize, but what you did was far more serious than anything I've done and needs to be dealt with"" No shit I said that.

Her, she got as stone cold as I have ever seen her in this emotional of a conversation. There were no tears and really no sense of emotion. It was strange especially if you know her. She says ""I apologized after it happened and I don't know how it got there. I know it's wrong and I won't do it again."" (She's said this before and I remind her of this) she says ""How did this all of a sudden become about me?""/ ""You just want to gloss over all you did""

Me ""You have done this before, if you dont get help and never do it again we are done""/ ""I dont even know if I can stay with you now""/""You literally have me afraid in my own home""

Now she is pretty much asking me to promise to stay with her. I told her I would never make her promise to stay with me through something like this for both of our sakes. 

I will be updating when I can Thank you for all the help

TL;DR We are hashing it out. I realized I am in an abusive relationship and I confronted her about the abuse. I have told her that it is her job to make this better and she is showing some signs of trying. 

EDIT; Again more great advice and wonderful people. I will update after the next conversation. She is acting very nice and making plans for the future. While asking me to promise never to leave. Also asking to be intamate like tonight. It will be a while till I see her(hours), but I'm getting away from the computer a while to get my head toghether, because I am getting pretty stressed lol.

[Both 21],littlehomelesslady,137,26,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1flypa/forced_to_sleep_outside_by_my_boyfriends/,"Hey Reddit - I love this subreddit because you guys aren't afraid to tell people when they're being crazy. Please tell me if I'm overreacting.

**TL;DR: Forced to sleep outside by my boyfriend's parents. I feel disrespected, but would feel like a drama queen if I made this into a big deal.**

Boyfriend and I are both 21, his parents are 50ish? I've been with him for 8 months, am subletting his roommate's portion of his apartment for the summer, and things are smashing.

My boyfriend hasn't lived with his family in a year - parents are ultra religious, and he smokes pot. However, the family relationship is still pleasant. We were both invited there for his brother's high school graduation. He hasn't been ""allowed"" to sleep over since he moved out, but we figured this was a different case because
a) we were invited over
b) it was a special occasion

We stay up til 3am hanging out, talking, drinking with his parents, at which point they tell us we need to go somewhere else, because they're going to sleep. (Important note: we live an hour and a half away, and don't have any money or a car. No chance for a hotel, and the family moved to this town after BF was already in college, so he has no contacts there.) Can't we just crash on the couch, boyfriend asks? **There are two couches and several spare bedrooms, and everyone's getting up in literally only 5 hours for the graduation.** Parents say no. Boyfriend tells them our only other option is sleeping outside (the town is a marsh, the mosquitoes are ridiculous, and it was unpleasantly hot). Parents tell us to have fun. We end up sleeping in a nearby park.

The night was miserable (as I mentioned, mosquitoes and uncomfortable weather), I got next to no sleep, and I was forced to get up at 8am and spend the rest of the day playing nice to the adults who were ice-cold to us last night, who note our lack of sleep but don't apologize.

They are usually over-the-top nice to both of us (constantly forcing food/gifts on us), but their black-and-white view on this is absolutely ridiculous to me. I understand that it's their house/their rules, but I was also a guest there, and they basically guilt-tripped boyfriend and I into coming a day early (instead of taking the train in the morning). 
I'm pissed at them for being so stubborn, but I'm also not thrilled that my boyfriend seemed to shrug this off. He thinks ""this is just the way they have always been."" I think, if my parents pulled that shit, they wouldn't be in my life. But here's another thing - I'm fighting with them now over similar issues to my boyfriend and his parents (difference of religious views, independence, etc), but they've been more than clear throughout that I am still welcome at home whenever I choose. 

**So my question: am I overreacting?** Should I be comparing them to my parents? If I choose to use this incident to significantly cut my (not his) time spent with his family (which feels like the best option right now to my wounded ego), will that create unneccessary tension between me and my BF, who genuinely loves his parents despite this?

",scaredykate,131,24,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/191p5k/after_4years_in_an_abusive_relationship_i_28f/,"My live-in boyfriend [30/M] shoved me across the living room and into the wall again today. I hit my leg on the corner of a table pretty hard and had scratches on my chest and wrist. Broke a lamp and a big photo frame this time. Last time he sat on me, strangled me, tore out my hair, and dug his knee into my breast so hard it was bruised for three weeks. 

There are too many times before that to count. It wasn't all the time. Not even most of the time. But when it did happen, I would tell myself to call the cops. To file that VPO. To get the hell out of there by any means necessary. But I never did. Until today. 

I went to the courthouse this afternoon and filed the paperwork for a Victim's Protective Order against him. My hands were shaking so badly I'm not even sure if what I wrote was legible. The judge decided this incident wasn't severe enough for an emergency order, but she set a court date for two weeks from now. He's being served Monday and I get to live with him until the hearing. 

I'm wondering why, after all the crap, all the bruises, scratches, scrapes, hateful nasty names and emotional abuse, after being abandoned in a strange city with no phone and no money, after having my glasses, computer and countless other belongings broken, why am I freaking out about it? I should feel strong. Powerful. In control and relieved, right? But the permanency of the VPO terrifies me. I know deep down this is the best thing for my daughter and I, but why am I so scared to lose him?

TL;DR: I filed a Victim's Protective Order against my live-in boyfriend today and am kind of freaking out about it now. 

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for the advice and kind, supportive, encouraging words. I can't tell you how much I appreciate them. I'm still feeling sort of sick, anxious, scared and overwhelmed. I'm afraid of what this will do my my financial situation. I'm afraid of losing the man who was, at one point, my best friend. I'm afraid to move forward because he's been a part of my life since I moved to my current city and it feels so foreign to think of being here without him. But after 4 years, I know it's not going to get any better. I think so many of you hit the nail on the head when you said that he's sort of brainwashed me into not trusting my own judgement. I've threatened to file a vpo against him before and he just laughed at me and said ""go for it."" 

Normally, when we would fight and it would get physical, we would avoid each other for a few days, cool off and then things would slowly go back to being okay. At least until the next fight. That was our cycle. Breaking it is terrifying to me. Even more terrifying in some ways than seeing his rage filled eyes and knowing what's coming next. I know so many people out there don't understand this and it's comforting to find a community where I'm not judged or scolded. Thank you all again.

Do I leave?,MarriedButAlone,161,52,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18r2yc/i_33f_am_no_longer_physically_or_mentally/,"We got married too quickly.  We were engaged after 6 months, married a year after we met and had a baby a 1 1/2 yrs (7 yrs old now) after we were married. We rushed things because we were both at a point in our lives where we wanted to ""settle down"" and start a family.  This was 10 years ago.  

He was never a major talker, but he was gone with work a lot, so we didn't spend a lot of time together at first.  He's a survivor of childhood abuse and I don't think he's ever really dealt with it and is not interested in doing so now (I've suggested counseling for him several times).  I feel like there's always been a wall between us.  Like I barely know him after being with him for 10 years.  

He's a good person.  He's never beat me, yelled at me, or been mean.  He loves our child very, very much.  But I feel almost nothing for him anymore.  I think he's attractive but have no desire to have sex with him.  When I do have sex with him, it's because I think ""I haven't done this in awhile, I probably should.""  I don't kiss him and much of the time I just want him to fuck me from behind and get it over with as fast as possible.  I know that sounds horrible.  He's not a very affectionate person, but I don't even really want the small gestures he makes.

I think he's a good person, but I feel no connection to him.  I have no interest in talking to him or hanging out with him.  I don't want to be resentful of him, but I find myself being resentful.  I haven't been happy for the past 4 years.  Our marriage turned into companionship, and now it doesn't even feel like that anymore.  It feels like we are roommates who happen to sleep in the same bed, but are not involved with each other except for logistics.  I know r/relationships is going to suggest counseling, but is it even worth it?  Couple's counseling only works if the couple wants the same thing out of it, and I'm not sure we would want the same thing to come out of counseling.

If it weren't for our child, I'd have left 4 years ago.  He comes from a broken family and really does not want our child growing up without both parents in the house.  I understand that, and this is the hardest part for me too.  He's made comments when we've talked about our relationship struggles in the past like, ""Don't you ever try to take _____ away from me or we will fight.""  I'd never take our child away from him.  He is a good father.  We own a house together that neither of us could probably afford on one of our incomes. 

I know that love changes in long term relationships.  That you will not  always have the sexual excitement, pulse-racing kind of love you first have with someone.  I know it is supposed to turn into a comfortable, supportive relationship.  I am okay with that, but I think your partner should be your best friend then.  I don't feel like he is even a ""friend"" let alone my best friend.  I know none of this is his ""fault.""

I'm not sure that I want the next 40, 20 or even 5 years of my life to just slip by without feeling like I was living my life to the fullest.  I don't want to look back and wonder what my life could have been if I hadn't been with him and had found a partner who I felt a real connection to.  

**TL;DR** I no longer love my husband of 10 years and struggle with whether or not I put in the effort to try and save a marriage that was probably over 4 years ago, or to get over the guilt and cut our ties now to allow us both to find partners who are more suitable. 


*edit: Thank you so much to everyone who took their time to make suggestions and to remind me of what is important in my life....and yes, to point out my selfishness in this situation.  Before I posted, I pretty much had my mind made up to leave and was honestly hoping for people to just affirm that for me.  But, I was met with many, many personal and thoughtful replies which have convinced me that you are right:  I owe it to him, me and our child to put some effort into this marriage.  I have been doing nothing and have been upset that he hasn't done enough, and that's very unfair.  I plan to schedule an appointment for us to attend couple's counseling.  If things don't work out, I will know that I at least made an effort to do what I can and the counseling will help with that too.  I really do appreciate (almost) everyone's comments.  I'm amazed how much a group of people you have never met, nor will ever meet, can force you to look at things differently.  But I felt supported at the same time.

My wife (33F) and I (37M) have been married for 10 years and together for 12.  From the night we met I expressed that I wanted children and had since the time I was about 6.  

We have been hoping to get pregnant over the last few years and trying hard with the help of Clomid the past year (although the clomid was only the last 3 months). 

Over the past month she has been very vocal about how much having kids will ruin her life, body, etc.  Trying to get pregnant is stressful and I, mistakenly wrote it off as frustration.

After this last round of medication, we did not get pregnant.  Afterward she finally admitted that she did not want kids and was only doing it for me.  Our original plan was to try for our own and if that failed pursue adoption.

Now, she wants adoption off the table as she has accepted the fact she does not want to be a mother at all.

I'm not sure what to do.  I love my wife, but not having kids at all is devastating to me.

So, divorce came up in conversation, but here are my thoughts on that.  One, I love her and see not other reason for divorce.  How could I live with myself for leaving her just because of something I want?  Two, I'm 37...Really what are the odds of finding another woman that would want to get with me and have children sometime before I'm 45?  And three, arrrg what the hell...really??

And, before anyone says it...Yes, I know kids can be tough.  They turn into teenagers and are a giant money sink.  They may become horrible people that end up in prison and escape to try and blow up Gotham.  But, the opposite is also a possibility... I work with kids and interact with dozens or more per day.  I know what they're like...

**TLDR Wife no longer wants anything to do with children so adoption off the table and I don't know how to deal with it**

I'm relatively inexperienced.  What does this mean and what do I need to know?",loverescueme,146,36,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14b0gv/i_m22_am_totally_in_love_with_a_girl_22_who_has/,"I will try to keep this as terse as possible.

I'm a 22 year old male who has never been in a relationship before. Without going into a great deal of detail, suffice it to say that I'm a generally normal, extroverted, personable, likeable guy without any major social defects, but my lack of relationship experience is due to a complex set of life circumstances. However, I'm finally to a place where my life is more or less normal; I live in my own place in a college town, have a career, a healthy number of friends, sports and hobbies, etc.

Six weeks ago, I met an amazing girl with whom I have connected in a way that is totally unprecedented for me.  I'm absolutely crazy about her.  Three weeks after we met, after developing a very fun and flirtatious friendship, I told her how I felt, and asked if there was potential for a more serious relationship.  She told me that she had developed feelings for me too, but that she was at the end of a very long and serious relationship, and although she knew that the breakup was imminent and had been for some time, she was, at the time, unavailable.  I disappointedly said ""Ok, I understand, I can be your friend and respect your boundaries.""

Fast forward a week.  She breaks up with her BF.  Goes through a  bit of a rough patch mourning for this relationship and I'm just kind of there for her.  After some time passes, she tells me that she's ready for me to take her on a proper date, and drops me some much-less-than-subtle hints by sending me some very racy text messages.  

So I take her out and we have a fantastic time.  After dinner, we go back to my place, make out for a while, and as things are going along, she stops me.  A bit confused, we start start to talk about it.  She asks me more about my experience and I answer truthfully... am I virgin?  Yes.  Have I ever been in a serious relationship before? No.  Have I ever even kissed anyone before?  No.  She seems shocked and taken aback.  I ask her if this bothers her and she answers truthfully that it's a little weird.  Eventually she asks me to take her home and we talk about it some more.  To make a long story short, she tells me that given the end of her long and serious relationship, she isn't ready to enter a serious committed relationship again right away, and given my inexperience, doesn't think it's fair to enter a casual relationship with me.  After a great deal of discussion and significant frustration on my part, we agree to just be friends.  

Well, the next day, we go running and and she almost says something but stops herself. I badger her for a while but she wont tell me... says ""I cant.""  I back off and let it be.  Later, she texts me ""I wanted to kiss you today, that's what I couldn't tell you...""  So at this point, I'm confused, because we spent a long time discussing it and she had told me that we couldn't make it work.  So, given this we talk some more about it, and I end up basically saying that I like her too much to let this go, that I can be willing to move forward without expectations of a serious relationship, and she ends up saying that ""as long as we can keep it casual, I guess we can give it a whirl.""  ""Yes we can,"" I agree.  

This was about a week ago.  Since then we've hung out a lot, texted, dated, made out, hung out, and that's about it.  We have a very flirtateous rapport, but given the fact that I've agreed to be ""casual,"" I now feel like I'm walking on eggshells because I don't want to scare her off by making things seem too serious.

How do casual relationships work?  What is a difference, besides intentions and expectations, between a casual relationship and serious committed relationship?  What is the difference between a casual relationship and ""friends with benefits?""  I want to hold her hand in public, is that acceptable?  Is she my ""girlfriend"" or not?  How do I introduce her to people?  Would it be inappropriate to want to introduce her to my friends and family?  Are romantic gestures like flowers and gifts off limits because it's too serious?  How fast should I move sexually?  If I had my way, I'd spend every minute of every day with her, but I'm trying to give her space so that she doesn't feel smothered... how often is it reasonable to expect to spend time with her?  A date every weekend and dinner one weeknight per week?  More?  Less?  I dont want to look overly eager, nor do I want to misrepresent the fact that I'm really interested.  I realize saying things like ""I love you"" is not appropriate, but where is the limit?  

Is it unreasonable to want/expect this to turn into something more serious down the road?  What is a reasonable timeframe for that?  

ANY and ALL advice, experience, tips or reactions would be greatly appreciated.  I am totally new to all of this and basically just BSing my way through it all, so whatever you have to say will definitely be helpful.

Everything was great in the beginning, and I'm still very happy with her, although the relationship is a bit rocky. We live 3 hours apart, but see each other every weekend.

About 6 months ago, we stopped having sex. My depression has been bad and I don't ever get horny anymore. It's something we've been working on and I've been seeing a therapist about it. She has always seemed to be understanding...

However, the girlfriend (we'll call her ""S"") is quite unhappy with the situation and about a month ago I found out that she's been cheating on me. She had sex with two other guys over the summer (5 including oral) and she's also been meeting and sexting with guys on another sub-reddit. She tells people that we broke up, even though we're still very much together.

S is very attractive and she is way out of my league, which is another reason I feel she had a valid reason for cheating. I'm nothing to be desired and she probably wanted more than me.

It killed me to read the texts that she's been sending other men. She would say the exact things that she said to me at one point and talk dirty to them the exact way she would to me.

She says that she feels bad, but it wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have stopped having sex with her.

So... here's my question. Did I deserve to be cheated on because I couldn't keep S satisfied? Or is she still in the wrong? I've been feeling so very guilty about how I've been treating S, I know I haven't been the perfect boyfriend and I feel like I'm totally to blame. I can't be mad at S until someone tells me I have the right to be.

Don't say OP never delivered. I (finally) went with option 2 and told her husband (who I knew outweighed me by 60 lbs), in person. She was there as well.

I tried to give her another chance and believe that she really was just in a tough position and wanted to leave her husband, but it wasn't nearly so cut and dry, and I don't think she had really made up her mind. She swore up and down she hadn't slept with him since before we met, and seemed to ""prove it"" with a txt msg convo, so I was willing to (stupidly) try again. It didn't end well.

I decided today that enough was enough because she still was playing games about leaving and finding a job that would allow her to support herself. Coupled with this was the fact that her husband was getting very suspicious and for the first time today I felt like I had to watch my back before I got into my car. That was enough. He deserved the truth, and so did I.

I went over to her place, and let her know via txt that I was going to call him and either talk on the phone or meet with him and hash this out because I was tired of the lies and games. No response because I think she was busy having sex all morning with him, as was confirmed a bit later.

I called him up and asked if he would like to talk, and that I could meet him in person right now if he wanted. He did. We walked outside along the sidewalk and talked, her in tow crying. It was likely a pretty awesome spectacle for the neighbors and people out jogging and walking their dogs, but I didn't want to risk being inside with an angry husband. To his credit, he didn't hold much anger toward me, just his wife.

What I found out is that she had been sleeping with both of us the entire time. Here is the shocker, which I didn't want to divulge beforehand because if things were to work out between us I didn't want even the slightest chance she would see it: She had an abortion, I paid for it, it was likely his, and he didn't know. She swore up and down (a couple months ago) that there was no way it could be his, and that she hadn't slept with him since we met. She ""proved"" this with a txt msg convo which I now believe was just her using both of their phones and/or deleting other txts to make it seem like that was the answer. The reason I was so suspicious that it could be my child was because I had only cum inside her twice, and it was when she was on the rag. The other reason was that the timing of conception was when he was home for a week and I hadn't been with her.

So anyway, as early as this morning she had sex with him, unprotected, and then was planning on moving in with me on monday, filing for divorce, and staying with me until she found work. I can't even imagine how morally bankrupt she has to be to do what she did to both of us. Bullet dodged...sorta.

1340831859.0,114,self.relationships,vpf1c,"When I tell my Bf that the things he does hurts me, he simply tells me that they shouldnt.  Also leaves me all the time and says won't talk to me if I'm crying.",heartofstone,160,46,328,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vpf1c/when_i_tell_my_bf_that_the_things_he_does_hurts/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible.  I appreciate any help about the situation.

My bf (M 23) and I (F21) have been dating 1 yr 10 months and living together for 1 yr.   We typically have fun together but every week or so get into arguments that escalate quickly.  I have noticed a certain trend in our arguments, they typically go one of two ways:  

1)  He does something to upset me, I cry a little, he sighs and asks ""why are you crying?"", he says ""you shouldn't cry over that/really, you're REALLY crying over that?"" or he justifies that what he did to make me upset was fine, therefore I shouldn't be upset.  And I am left still upset obviously and it goes on and on or he walks out.

2)  He upsets me, I cry, he notices and without asking me whats wrong, tells me ""I'm not hanging out with you if you're acting like that"" or just leaves and does something else while I cry.  For example, he will play games on the computer, or once when we were grocery shopping, just told me to go home and said he wasn't going to shop with me like this.  I said that I'd stop crying and go shopping, but he said no.  Like a bitch, I walked home.

Most of the time what upsets me in the first place is his tone, or argumentative style.  If he doesn't like something, he'll call me a fucking bitch then walk out of the room, leaving me in tears.  Or its something like he called me retarded or dumb or acting childish.  When we argue with each other we both get a mean tone and might raise our voice but I always avoid direct accusations or name calling.  When I tell him it hurts me that he calls me names, he just responds with ""I didnt call you stupid, I said you were ACTING stupid.""  I tell him it hurts nonetheless and he just tells me that I'm irrational and he's unable to talk to me when I'm like this (although I am the only one keeping a good tone and not insulting the other, I even try to hold his hand while talking to ease things) and that I just talk about how I feel and he talks about the facts of the matter.  

Pretty much every time I confront him, he leaves, and he justifies it with above facts.  Eventually he comes back, or I go to him asking if we can truly talk about things without arguing.  He always ends up hurting me much much more because he tells me I'm not an adult, a 10 yr old wouldn't cry over the things I do, Im trolling him except trolls are smart, Im crazy and retarded.  Instead of reacting in anger I try to tell him, here, that wasn't cool, please try to be cool with me, I'm trying so hard.  He doesn't think so of course.  

Anyhow (sorry I think I am ranting), I got to the bottom of things and I told him something that has been upsetting me a lot lately.  I said, ""I think you hurt me more than you know or more than you care.""  Because when he walks out on me (or if in public, sends me home) or refuses to talk to me because I'm crying, it really fucking hurts because I feel like my bf should be trying to see whats wrong, helping me not be upset since I'm upset about him.  Instead he gives me arguments that he is acting adult by walking away and that he's not going to support me if two of the following are occurring: ""having a temper tantrum, don't have a legitimate reason to be crying, or if hes mad"".

This makes me incredibly upset because of course he never things I'm crying for a legit reason.  I admit I am really sensitive but people are just different in regards to sensitivity.  Something that would make me cry, wouldn't make him cry.  I have ""temper tantrums"" when he leaves me to go to the other room.  I feel like he refuses to deal with me when I'm not even being that bad but because I'm crying.  This makes me hysterically upset that he just abandons me and I will cry until I can get the courage to go get him (he never comes to me).  This means I cry for about 30 mins hysterically, then I go get him cos I want to talk things out progressively.  Lastly, if he's mad at me (for ruining his day by crying) he says that he will not be nice, thus excusing his name calling and rude behavior, and he Definitely will not want to help me through the suffering he's put me through by consoling me if he's mad.

Basically, I am very sensitive and when he hurts me he is so freaking insensitive that its killing our relationship.  Maybe its both of us killing the relationship.  When I cry, I am upset but he thinks I am trying to antagonize him and that I am faking.  This hurts me more.  I feel like this is core problem and it makes me sad every day to have fun with him, only knowing that if I'm upset, he is out of the game.  Obviously I think relationships are more than that.  Hours later, I am begging him to just be nice to me, not be a little lawyer with me (picking at my arguments) but just see the msg that I am sending - that he is hurting me.  He will argue this for awhile, saying that he is going to be mean since I made him mad.  Then I just give up, cry alone and he will come over and say ""you know I love you.  Sorry for being mean to you earlier"" and its all done for him.  But for me, so much has happened (it lasts hours) that I am still hurt and humiliated inside and I still know its just gonna be the same thing next time since he made it clear how he feels.  

I don't want to break up with him but I feel he isn't there for me when I need it most.  What do I do?  Am I too sensitive?  Even if I am, shouldn't he understand that that's who I am and thus try not to hurt me so deep every time?  Or should I just see that he's insensitive and cannot and thus will not deal with me?  Is this relationship doomed if we go on like this?

TLDR:  My bf always opts out of my careful conversation if I am crying.  This opting out or walking out devastates me.  When he comes back he just does more to hurt me (name call, argue) and I am left with the constant feeling that he doesn't truly care about me when I'm down.

EDIT:  Wow... Thank you everyone for your feedback, good and bad.  It makes me feel so much better that strangers out there are willing to help me out with this.  I will clear some things that people have asked about.  
1)  I don't cry over every little thing.  Before I met him I might just get into an argument and cry like twice a year.  My sensitivity was much stronger in my teen years but ever since I've been with him, I cry maybe once every week or two.
2)  I was unclear for the sake of trying to be short - I didn't cry while grocery shopping.  I cried in the parking lot, on the way to the grocery store.  He was mad at me for saying we shouldn't buy all these fancy groceries that he wants (since we made a list before going) since he has no job and I will be paying.  We walked to the grocery store, he was being curt with me the whole time even though I gave in and said we could get whatever he wants from the store.  Once we got close to the store, at this point I was pretty upset just cos we clearly weren't okay and he hadn't looked at me even once on the way down to notice anything off about me.  I should've just said Hey lets talk, but I instead quietly cried.  He sent me to walk home after only just arriving and not having even entered the store.  This was the only time I got upset in ""public.""
3)  Obviously this is probably biased since it is me telling the story.  I can assure you, he did indeed call me a fucking bitch, but whatever if you don't believe me.  I think it is definitely both of us who need some help.
4)  We typically argue about bullshit like, ""I didnt like that you called me retarded"", or ""lets go on a run, THEN garden, not garden THEN run"" (he felt he was doing me a favor by gardening with me so he wanted to do things in the order in which he wanted; I felt like it was my only day off cos I work and go to school whereas he has no job and doesn't go to school.  I also didn't realize he felt he was doing me such a big favor since we enjoy gardening).  The argument which prompted me to post about these reoccurring events, was that he has told me he would quit smoking weed and cigarettes for the past 4 months but he's only frustrated me so much over the past months cos every other night he'd ask for weed (its my weed - long story but I get it for free, don't really smoke at all but can't say no to free shit).  Anyhow I asked him if I could smoke a cigarette (I don't smoke, just wanted to take it) but I took his last two and destroyed them.  He said I lied and violated our trust.  I said I was frustrated.  Just escalated from there.

I have since spoken to him and he said that next time he'll be there for me when I am upset, regardless of how stupid he thinks the reason might be or how angry he is.  He said that the reason why he refused to be nice or find common ground with me in yesterday's argument is that he was tired and just wanted to sleep.  This feels a bit odd since last night all he did was argue that I shouldn't be crying and if it's for a dumb reason, he won't be there.  I just feel very bleh and whatever.  I kind of stopped caring and I think I want time to myself.

I am miserable in my relationship. We have been together for 3.5 years. She is 33, I am 30; yet she makes me feel like a child. 

Everything that happens in our relationship is based upon what makes her happy. If I want to do something and it doesn't appeal to her, it is forgotten. If she wants to do something and it doesn't appeal to me, she sulks, and eventually, I will cave. 

She is jealous and possessive. She is suspicious of every contact I have with my friends and especially my mother, who I am very keen to support following the death of my father. I acutely recall some 18 months ago as we sat in the car in the days after his death how all she was concerned about was what this meant for our own relationship. When I get groceries and so forth for my mum it's ""can't she buy her own groceries?"" I don't need anything from my mother; I can take care of myself but I do feel a responsibility to her - she is pushing 70 and there are things she needs help with. 

She is sulking now. Last night I called my mum for 11 minutes; I left the TV room to do this. When I came back she wants to know about my ""secret conversations."" She went to bed without telling me. ""Have you gone to bed?"" I ask. ""Secret bedtime"" she strops. I called her out on this and she is flipping out now because she doesn't like that I thought ill of her. Note that I could fix this in five minutes by pandering to her a little. I won't do it any more. 

When I want to go out to watch the football (or whatever) of a Sunday afternoon, I am asked ""what am I supposed to do?"" Before I go its ""dont look at any other girls."" When I get back, she will be sulking. I spend nights away because of work, and she is very suspicious of it. ""Where are you *really*?"" she asks. If I am out with a friend, you can be sure his name will be mud the first chance she gets. 

And yet she's so lovely to me; when she's getting her way. But every problem in her life is someone else's fault, and that very often means me. 

We are supposed to be going on holiday in 7 days, on a trip which I argued against and which I do not want to go on. She wants to get married; I am more than content to wait. She wants babies; I am more than content to wait. Yet we move closer to both of these things because her reaction to a train of thought in contradiction to her own is so out of control. Right now the thought of spending two unbroken weeks in her presence is mortifying. 

As I write this I am asking myself ""who is this pussy who can't stand up to his girlfriend?"", but I really can't explain what it is. I don't lack for strength of character, but there really is no reasoning with her. I imagine her reading this and she would have rebuttals for all of it, yet it truly is how I feel. I don't suffer in silence; we discuss things, but derail the conversation and it deteriorates fast. She escalates things without a second thought - shouting/tears/sulking and it's just impossible to deal with. 

I can't say the words to her ""I don't want to be with you any more"". I know it sounds weak as fuck but she would somehow twist things and I would end up apologising. I always apologise for everything. She is never happy; ""why don't we ever do X?"", ""why don't you do Y more often?"". 

All I can think of to do is get in my car and leave. Please help me reddit.

Edit: thank you all. I am going to talk to her in the morning (midnight approaches here) and if it goes badly I am out the door.

Edit 2: This rather blew up whilst I slept! Going through it now, thank you all. 

Edit 3: Took a while for me to get through it all. Thank you all so much, whatever it was you had to say.

UPDATE PART 1: This morning, we sat down and had a talk. I told her the dangers of what had happened, explained my fears of a reprisal in the future, and how it would eventually lead to the destruction of our relationship in a not-so-amicable way. 

Having given this type of talk before, I told her I was tired of doing this and didn't want to do it again. I wasn't ready to give her an ultimatum yet and I wasn't ready to ask for the ring back. I still think the real girl I love is there, just hidden away.

I believe that there is something else driving her drinking. For the first three years of this relationship, she has been able to casually/socially drink with absolutely no negative effects. It seems to be some sort of self medication.

UPDATE PART 2: She had a talk with one of her friends, to get an outside opinion. She came back in tears. She admits that she has a problem, and that her actions are indeed dangerous. What she said next though hit me hard: She feels like she isn't good enough for me, that I should have someone in my life more intelligent, and that these feelings spread to her family and job. So she's got low self-esteem.

I have told her that it's no longer about the relationship, but about her getting better. She's agreed, on my suggestion, to see a therapist. We're going to take it from there.

1376473215.0,112,self.relationships,1kc812,[UPDATE] Me[32F] with my husband [31M] of two years. Something really weird happened. I'm creeped out and don't know what to think.,throwmeaway7714,144,32,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kc812/update_me32f_with_my_husband_31m_of_two_years/,"Previous thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k2y5z/me32f_with_my_husband_31m_of_two_years_something/)
 
First, I really want to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my original post. I was feeling overwhelmed and couldn't respond to everyone, even though I wanted to. However, I read every comment, a few times, and tried to let everything fully absorb.

Here's where I'm at. I'm not ready to leave him. I see the abuse. I know it's there. But I also know he's sick, and needs someone on his side. And I know that before we were married, he was a different person. I think he can get back to that state with support. And if he can't, well I know enough to know there's an end line. I will not stay in an abusive relationship forever, but I feel the need to exercise all of the options considering the mental illness aspect of it all.

That being said, one of the things that really resonated with me in the comments that I read was that I need to open up to my family about what is going on.

So I called my mom yesterday.

This was a tough conversation for me to have. I feel I've essentially lied to my family for years about my life. And I have. I try to live my life as honestly as possible, so admitting this to my mom was a hard step to take. But I'm glad I did.

It was a tearful conversation. On both sides. I let her know the true state of my marriage and where I was at. She was a bit blindsided, but completely supportive. Offered her place to stay indefinitely if I wanted it. At any time. She would buy my plane ticket if I needed it, no questions asked. I love my family. 

I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I am in this situation. I told her she could tell my brother what was going on, but I didn't want to have the conversation myself. She could talk to my grandmother as well. I will tell my father tomorrow. I'm really scared about that one, because I've always struggled with wanting to feel he was proud of me, and this just feels like one huge, fat failure.

If my marriage ends, I will feel like a failure. I already know that I made a terrible choice. I saw the warning signs before, granted I didn't know the extent of the torment, but I knew it wouldn't be easy. I shouldn't have married this guy and I... just... feel like a huge failure.

So I'm trying to make this right.

Opening up to my family was a first step. I don't know what's next but I know that it already feels like a huge weight has been lifted in talking to my mom.

Next step is getting back into therapy. I realized that there must be some reason I allowed myself to get into a relationship like this is the first place. So time to figure out why. I have an appointment set for the end of the week and I'm hoping I can figure some shit out.

Again, thank you to everyone for your comments.

I don't think ghosts. I think affair. Skyping a random dude. So, I go in there. She tries to explain it away. I don't budge. Finally she tells me Nicholas is a ghost. She thinks she can talk to ghosts and that it's been on going since she was a little kid. 

She knows it's ""a bit of a stretch"" for me to believe but claims that it's not as crazy as it sounds and offers to introduce me to some friends she knows who can. She also used the example of when my cousin died and she found where he hid his journal. I don't buy it.

I don't know it this is caused by stress from the CPA exam or what. But I don't believe it. Should I dump her for being crazy or try and insist she gets help? What should I do?

I'm not even sure why i had forgotten it in the trunk all this time... He said that i'm the ""man in the relationship."" The worst part about all of this is that right before this happened, we were talking about remembering birthdays and anniversary's in the car and when he asked me if i knew his birthday, i remembered the day but for some reason i was a month off and he teased me saying that he obviously isnt important enough for me to remember his birthday. We've been together for almost a year and about half of the time, we were friends with benefits. I didn't want a relationship but he was patient with me and i ended up falling in love with him.

So he's 24, I'm 23 and we've been friends for a couple of years. 

I've had a crush on him since the day I met him.  He's the cliche *tall, dark, and handsome man* but he's never had a girlfriend.  This is so screwed up because I've seen women checking him out in public with my own two eyes, yet they flat out reject him when he asks them out... And some of them were f'ing mean!  (Bitches!).

I just got out of a three year relationship.  Had I been single when we met, I totally would've asked him out.  However, now that we're friends and I've gotten to know him, I'm afraid he'll think that I'm only asking him out because I feel sorry for him (He's never had a girlfriend).   

You see, I've tried setting him up with four of my friends in the past but they all rejected him (For bullshit reasons BTW).  He confided in me that he was bummed out and said, ""I don't understand why women don't like me.""  =(  I wanted to scream, ""BUT I LIKE YOU!""  

I'm terrified he'll think I'm only asking him out because I feel sorry for him.  Which is *not true at all*.  

I think we'd be the perfect couple.  I'm his type, he's my type, we want the same things in life, we trust each other and never fight, and I feel like we have a lot of sexual tension.  

Is there a way to hint that I have romantic feelings for him?  Do I just flat out tell him?  I've never asked a guy out before but this one's worth it.  To be honest, I don't even know how to start the conversation or where to begin..

GF (23), needs to write her Master thesis and is pretty much flexible in her choice of residence. Half a year ago we decided we wanted to go to Berlin and live together. I'd do an internship there and she'd write her thesis.

No internship to be found in Berlin but still I need the internship to finish my education and I don't have the time to wait. Looking further, I got some connections with a University on the other side of the Ocean. It's not final yet, but it's looking really good. We discussed it and she encouraged me to look further because of the time. We would only go to Berlin if I was able to get an internship there.

I know this is a great opportunity for me to perform a 6-month internship over there (one of the top Universities in US) but I feel like I'm ruining my great relationship (1.5 years now, known each other almost 2 years, everything peachy). She has her doubts we can survive this, and so do I. I want to but I don't believe in fairy-tale situations. The realism is that 6 months (or maybe more) apart, with an ocean between us and hardly any possibilities for contact will be excruciating. I know I can have a great future with her and that's what I want but I don't want her to suffer through this.

So I'm conflicted to the point of whether I should take the internship or not and if I do, how do I keep my relationship intact... or should I even try?

Note: I love this girl really much. I can see us living together and being partners for years to come. I absolutely believe we have a good thing going on, solid and good.

Also, before you start about: ""6 months is nothing compared to other people in a LDR for years"". It might not be the end of the world but it's more than enough to question the survivability of a relationship (i think). Also, I think the maximum amount of times we can see each other in that period in 1 time only.

In addition: ""If you really want it, it can work"" is what I've been hearing around me. Doesn't help at all as of yet.

**TL;DR: Going to study abroad for 6 months instead of living together with GF. Decision might condemn my relationship to oblivion.**

Somehow this guy and I hit it off... on a website. We became friends. I was stupid and looking for attention and gradually he got around to seeing all of me naked.

Unfortunately, we got super close, did dirty Skype sessions, and sent pictures back and forth. For the first year I wouldn't show him my face.

Also, he's created collages with my real name, Facebook URL, and naked pictures. He threatens to post these online. I don't want to jeopardize my future or embarrass my family. 

Now, I want to get out of the relationship. He's more of a jerk now and I feel he is using me for my body. This relationship isn't healthy for me, but I'm scared he's going to blackmail me with the pics.

I don't know what to do. I don't want my family involved. I realize this whole thing was a stupid thing to do, and I regret it.

I am part of new a jazz band that has become fairly successful.  I organized a party to celebrate the release of our new album, and put a lot of work into the party over the past couple months.  

I'm in graduate school, and parties with my friends are extremely rare, and this was one of the best ones ever thrown according to many of my friends.  It was a very special event for us, because my band has been working hard over the past few years to become successful, and we never really took time to celebrate how far we've come.  

Anyway, almost all my friends came to the party and wanted to hit the bars with me and my gf afterwards.  My girlfriend got pretty drunk, and I was sober.  As I parked the car we got into a disagreement about what to do.  She wanted me to come with her and meet her friends at a different bar from where all my friends were.  I told her that I wanted to hang with my friends and wanted her to come with me.  She said she had already told her friends that she was going, so she had to go.  I told her I was a little irritated by this.  Any other night I wouldn't mind hanging with her friends, but I felt it was like her telling me she wanted to hang out with her friends on my birthday.  It was me and my band's night.  

Anyway, she said that she was angry with me, and stormed off in a different direction to meet her friends and told me to go meet mine.  I did, and my friends ask me where my gf is, and I tell them we got into a fight.  I know I probably shouldn't have said this, but it was pretty obvious I wasn't in a good mood, and people kept asking.  She called me a few times about 15 minutes later yelling at me, telling me she hated me, texted me that I was an asshole, that maybe I needed a different girlfriend, and a bunch of other really mean stuff.  I never say anything, drunk or sober, as nasty as my gf did this night.  I didn't raise my voice and the worst thing I said was say yes when she asked if I thought she was acting like a bitch.  

Anyway, I continue to finish my drink with my friends, and she calls again, a bit more calm, and she says she's alone on the street and wants me to get her.  She's really drunk at this point, and she says she can't walk to my car and needs a cab.  So I leave my car and take her home, take care of her for a while, and put her to bed, etc.  By this point it's 1:30.  Now I'm starting to get pissed, because she basically ruined one of the best nights I've had in years.  All my bandmates, friends who almost never come out, and new fans were all out having a blast, and I missed out only to hear about it from everyone I've talked to.

My girlfriend has apologized profusely for it, wants to make up for it by doing something special for me, and has been feeling really shitty about it since the morning after.  I'm having a difficult time letting go of it.  I can't stop thinking about how she ruined what would have been one of the best nights in my life, and it's not something that I can just do again.  Throwing our party took months of planning and money, which is difficult to come by since I'm in graduate school.  I could throw another party, but it won't be the same.  I feel like I'm being a big fucking stupid baby that needs to grow up, but on the other side, I still feel angry about the whole thing and am wondering if I could get over this.

 **Bugs:** My boyfriend's best friend's girlfriend (I will call her Jerk, so as to remain as unbiased in this story as possible) is way too touchy, and frankly is kind of bitchy to me.  She is, I swear.  Just the other day, she told me that my hair looked trashy but offered to do it for me.  I checked (with r/fancyfolicles) - my hair is not trashy.  This is just one example, but the instances are building.  This isn't a huge deal for me, I can definitely get over it, since I'm pretty sure it stems from her own insecurities.  What I can't seem to get over is her fawning over my boyfriend!  She will literally stand behind him and rub his chest and stroke his arms while staring me dead in the face.  She runs a hand across him as she passes by.  It started with just a touch on the arm and a hearty laugh when he'd tell a joke, but now it's pretty disgusting and being thrown in my face (so it seems).














 After some egregious offenses, I told my boyfriend that I was officially unhappy with how he was choosing to handle the situation.  I think he needs to get up, walk away, come put an arm around me or SOMETHING.  Remember, Jerk is his boyfriend's best friend, so I don't feel like saying something is an option, and I honestly don't even know if it's appropriate.  (Note: her BF is never around when she does this.  **I swear, I'm not crazy, this is actually going on**)  I'm actually starting to get angry at my boyfriend.  He skirts around the topic of stopping her pissing contest, and I think it's because he likes the attention.  What the what?  What do I do?!  I might say something, but it will not come out as a calm and collected thought, it will come out in full on bitch breakdown and I don't think I'll look very cool (read: it will absolutely not turn out like one of those day dreams you have where you tell off a bully or save a homeless person from being beaten, all while looking super cool, etc). 














**Reddit, I have three questions for you:**
* AM I crazy?  Should I not be taking offense to this?
* Should something be said, and who should say it?
* Am I justified in feeling some animosity towards my boyfriend here?










*OH WAIT I forgot to add, she's the ex-fiance of ANOTHER FRIEND OF OURS and started dating my BF's BFF when she MET HIM THROUGH HER EX-FIANCE.  Thus, Jerk.*8=

There is still a lot of doubt, and it means so much to me to get all of this support.  I would love to surround myself with you lovely people in a moral support lynch mob in front of her house. 
Secondly, my boyfriend is a wonderful, smart, and gentle soul, and I'm not just saying that because he's here.  He's historically bad with conflict and doesn't have an aggressive disposition at all.  He'd likely not say anything to a male who was doing this to me, so it's not suprising that he'd have trouble saying something to a girl.  I just don't want anyone to think it's because he's not invested in us, doesn't love me, or is a pussy.

Although we're sexually active, she is not on the pill; we use protection each and every time without fail. After a ""near miss"" last night (we were concerned about the condom having failed and subsequently went to the pharmacy for Plan B), she stated that if she did somehow get pregnant, then she would not terminate.

After the adrenaline/chaos died down and I was on my morning commute, I came to a few conclusions. Firstly, I am not sure whether or not I ever want kids, leaving aside the fact that it's way to early to tell whether or not this is the person with whom I would want a family. Subsequently, I'm not willing to wager my future on ONLY a piece of latex and I don't think I can be with someone who doesn't take extra precautions when they wouldn't be willing to terminate a pregnancy.

So, my plan is to discuss the option of ""the pill"" with her again and my feelings about children, but I don't want her to make this pharmeceutical decision just based on my feelings; I also don't want her to take it just because she may lose the relationship if she doesn't. I don't want to control her reproductive decisions, I would just prefer to be with someone who is playing it a little more safely.

1) Am I being unreasonable?
2) What do?
3) If she's still unwilling to take the pill, am I wrong to end the relationship?

Edit: Wow, this sure blew up. Thank you all for your responses. A few clarifications, though; firstly, we are going to talk about the issue this weekend. Secondly, I didn't intend to make it sound like I was hung-up on her taking ""the pill"" specifically. I'm going to suggest any secondary method. Lastly, I'm also asking for clarification on her perspective on the termination issue.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_si1zx,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/si1zx/is_birth_control_or_lack_thereof_a_reasonable/,
1357531432.0,110,self.relationships,163mgc,"My wife had an affair with her best friend (my friend too), and I recently had a fling of my own. What am I doing?",boxheadfox,150,40,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/163mgc/my_wife_had_an_affair_with_her_best_friend_my/,"I posted this in askreddit but thought it would fit better here. So this story is a bit long, but bear with me if you can. I also changed the names just in case.

My wife Susan (25) and I (25) met freshman year of college but didn't officially begin dating until junior year. We were both immediately and immensely involved with each other, that was until she returned to her hometown for the holidays. It was there that she ran into Max (25), her old high school crush. They began talking, shared their past feelings, and she revealed to me later that they had kissed. For a while she was torn between us, but after learning that Max had just returned to his ex-girlfriend she decided to stick it out with me.

Eventually Max faded from her mind as Susan and I both drew closer to each other. She took me home with her a few months later and somehow we both met up with Max. Low and behold we all hit it off together and became good friends. One year later, after Susan and I graduated college, we decided to get married. Max actually played the music as we walked down the isle.

The next year was a crazy jumble of relocations, as we moved from California to Portland, and then abruptly to the East Coast when my mother's cancer sadly caught up to her and she passed away. Still in a bout of grief, we moved to NYC for a contract job I had, and somehow, in a matter of months, returned to Susan's hometown in California.

Max, after breaking up with girlfriend, found comfort in our friendship and became a regular part of our lives along with the rest of Susan's friends. Eventually, after I found a well paying job, Susan and I found our own house to rent and every weekend it was filled with music, friends, and of course, a quantity of alcohol.

My birthday arrived, and after a wild evening of swimming at the lake with our friend Brittany (25) I turned in early.

The next week passed and my wife grew increasingly distant. I eventually called her out on it and she broke down in tears. She revealed that after the birthday party Max and her talked about their feelings, how they had never gone away, and that they were soul mates at heart. Then, she told me, they kissed.

Torn once again, she said she didn't know what to do and that the feelings were very real. She considered divorce, and I, knowing this emotional relationship was very real, felt torn. I had a break-down that week and even tried to take her wedding ring, resulting in a painful slap and an evening on the couch. I talked to Max the next day and told him I knew they were both in love. His response was a simple ""I'm sorry dude.""

After talking to my wife we both decided to try to make it work. We kicked Max out of our lives.

How was I to expect Max would then decide to O.D. on heroin?
Susan fell into a deep depression for some time after that, and I decided, after Max had recovered, to talk to him again.

I told him what happened in the past is a different story, that Susan and I were married and that he had to find a way to find his own happiness now. He agreed, and somehow I agreed to have him over every once in a while for the weekend.

Max however soon relocated out of town, and his weekend stays would turn out to be several days. I was working from home at the time and felt fine with it. Soon though my friends came forward saying that the story from Susan and Max wasn't quite true, that the first night they didn't just kiss, ""They fucked man."" ""It's true,"" another said, ""They had sex."" Apparently Max had told them this, and suddenly my wife's admission seemed even more vague in retrospect.

I was crushed, but still my wife and I wanted it to work.

Then New Years arrived. My friend Brittany (who was at my birthday party) was in town and came over. Late that night she told me it wasn't just on my birthday that my wife and Max had been having sex, it had been on-going for some time. She told me I was a great guy who didn't deserve this, that I could talk to her, and she revealed that she had always had feelings for me too.

Despite my own sensibilities and loyalty, I found myself kissing her. We hugged and I told her how depressed I had been, revealing my own inability to sleep well at night or even eat. We didn't go much further than kissing, but we kissed urgently and passionately. Something I hadn't felt in a while.

Brittany returned to school and now I'm left with a lot to think about.
I didn't tell Susan about the kiss, but even so she still doesn't kiss me with the same passion as she herself used to, quickly turning or pushing me away. I work full time while she stays home and knits for her online shop while watching netflix. She wants to find a full-time job, but spends most of her time looking at houses or another dog to adopt. The only time we are alone is at night, and even then we are separated by a dog. Our conversations revolve around how I need to do the dishes, garbage, mail her orders, etc. And when I miss one of the utility bills she scolds me, rather than appreciate I pay them at all, and when I ask for any appreciation, she scolds me once again. Max meanwhile is getting a realty degree, and I wonder if someday the two have plans. If they think about each other even while I'm there.

My place in her life seems to be growing smaller each day. I feel more of just a provider than a partner or friend. Although I wasn't faithful recently, somehow it's given me a sense that my life could be something more, that I have a new sense of confidence I need to grasp hold of and assert within myself. Am I a terrible person for feeling this? What do I do? Sometimes I just want to disappear completely.

Sorry, that was a long story.

Please help?",unhappysingleperson,155,47,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/157tyz/f_22_told_me_something_eyeopening_now_i_m_21_want/,"Hey r/relationships. I have no idea where else to put this so now I need some advice.

Context: I (21) am a college student in my fourth year and, prior to this year, broke up with my long time SO (Let's call her Maddy, F 23). After a few months I finally started dating again, and met a girl we'll call Katie (22).

Story: So, Katie and I have been dating for about three weeks. We met through some mutual friends many years ago but now we started spending more and more time together. Our first date was a coffee shop and I learned that she and I have a lot in common.

Our second date was more personal, for we went on a walk through the snow. We held hands for warmth and really got close, then I took her to a nice restaurant where we talked endlessly about nonsense. It was here she told me that she thought I was pretty special. I told her she was special to me and since then we've really hit it off.

The problem, however, began at our third date. I decided we would meet up last Friday and watch a movie. Before hand we'd bake cookies and eat them with hot chocolate. The problem was that the week of our date she began ignoring me, or treating me like I don't exist in public.

Come the night of our date. Everything is much better. We're both curled up in a blanket, watching a movie and talking about random stuff once more. Eventually we lean in to kiss but she then backs away. When I ask her what's wrong she says this:

""I'm sorry, I can't do this to Maddy.""

When I ask her what she means she tells me that she and Maddy are friends and that she feels guilty for dating me. Katie tells me that Maddy broke down crying when she saw us holding hands at our last date, and that she couldn't see us together anymore. When I asked her what her, and my, friends thought she said:

""Everyone feels the same way. You've been Maddy's boy for so long it feels weird having you date someone else.""

Needless to say this was pretty upsetting. I promptly left the room without saying anything more than ""I understand"" then went to my apartment. It's been a week and I can't stop hitting on every girl who speaks to me (sans friends of course) and I realize that now is the time to be single. Now, I realize, I have to live for myself because my love life is shot as people still see me as Maddy's boyfriend. Problem is, I don't know how since the last time I was single was 5 years ago. 

I apologize if this isn't the right place. I just need some advice and any would be helpful.

These are pretty common diseases and there are tons of stories of people not having any problems at all. Furthermore, we're lightyears away from even thinking about having kids. We've been together ~1 year, and have never discussed whether either of us want kids in our future.

But we've both both talked about wanting this to be a long term relationship. I feel silly bringing it up when reproducing is so irrelevant to our present (and that I might not even have this problem - wouldn't know until I tried to get pregnant), but its been weighing on me a lot.

If he wants to have kids in the future, I feel like he deserves to know about this. But I'm also worried that if I bring it up, he'll think I'm being overly attached for bringing up kids so early in our relationship.
I'm probably over-thinking this. Any advice?

tl;dr should boyfriend know that biological kids might not be possible?

Edit:  I should also add that even though this is a long term and committed relationship, and we both want very much to have a future together, we are both college students at a point in life with uncertainty.  He's graduating an going to grad school in an unknown city in the spring, and I've got another year left in school before I could move and try to get a job in his city, in which we'd be long distance.

This will take some explaining so I'll break it up into chunks. Here is the back story. 

**TL;DR: I just found out that my fiancée who I love so so much has been an escort and this has continued into our relationship and she didn't tell me even though I gave her many chances to open up**


(Gloss over this chunk. It is really long but I feel you need to have context)

**Our Wonderful Relationship**

We have been together for almost a year and it has been completely blissful. I love her more than I have loved anything and from what I can tell she really loves me too. I try really hard in this relationship, not to the point that I'm possessive and controlling, she has as much freedom as she wants.

I will always make her a cup of tea when she needs it, cook most of the dinners, roll her cigarettes in the morning, meet her when ever and where ever she wants, will always listen (without butting in), excuse her occasional laziness around our home and do most of the cleaning (without being a dick about it), I earn quite a bit more than her so I generally pay for things and I'm doing this to help her get on top of student debts and stuff. Most of all I respect her, I think she is a truly wonderful and strong woman, we're both pretty serious feminists. You get it, I'm the perfect fucking boyfriend (jokes, but I really do try to be as good as I can for her, I just like doing it, it makes me hurt with smiles when I do something special or even just a bit thoughtful and I can see her appreciating me). 

We have never had any arguments really, only minor disagreements, neither of us have ever raised our voices with each other or been violent in any way. This is pretty great considering the intensity and speed of the relationship, we hate spending time apart and haven't slept in separate beds since February 13th (I know it's sad that I know that but she does too and we giggle unbearably when either of us mention that). 

Oh my god don't even get me started on the sex! It is amazing, she get's my kinks and I get hers, we have sex often and it is consistently incredible with multiple orgasms all around. We rent a flat together, own a cat together, are spending Christmas together, getting married in June and for after that, planning to move to New Zealand and having kids. Neither of us are new to this relationship business or feel like we are rushing, we have both had a couple of serious relationships in the past (I was with a girl for 7.5 years) and she was engaged to a dude who didn't really treat her very well, as long as her having a lot of fun whilst she was at Uni!


**How I Know What I Know**

Back in April I was laying in bed watching my beautiful SO getting ready for work, I asked if I could look something up on the internet using her phone as my battery was dead and she agreed. I unlocked it and saw a strange message from a man using only his and her initials in the text saying ""Looking forward to seeing you again later on today, I'm at the Apex hotel, I'm in room whatever..."". I scrolled up to get some context and couldn't make sense of it, All I could see was that they have met before in hotels, have a long text history. 

To be perfectly clear, that is genuinely how I saw the message, I'm not a snooper. The previous time they met was at a hotel in London in February when she told me that her and her friend Jess (not her real name) were going to an opera and she was staying with her friend and she also had some freelance calligraphy work to do down there (this is something she said she used to do before we met and she has not travelled away for it at any other point in the relationship). I freaked out thinking she was cheating on me, I hadn't pieced together much of anything then, all I knew was friendly man meeting my girlfriend, secretly, in a hotel. 

When I bought this up with her she later on (instead of stalking her and calling the number of the guy texting her I might add), she said that I have completely misunderstood the situation. She used to do some free proof reading for a human rights lawyer and from time to time he asks her to help him out on the cheap and it's apparently very illegal and that is why she didn't want to say anything. She explained that that was all London was and that the dude had paid her well and given her a gift because they go back to when she did an intern-ship with him whilst she was at uni. I told her I would have understood but she needs to understand why that freaked me out and just asked her to be more honest with me in the future. No shouting was done, I felt a little hurt but put it to the back of my mind. Besides, it was cool that we scored a few hundred quid and we got a pizza.

Cue a couple of months later. Same dude, similar situation, different hotel. I found out this time because I was being a bit playfully nosey whilst she was using her phone and snuck up behind her saying, whatcha doin', or something like that. I saw enough in those few seconds to know what was going to happen. I asked her about it, got a little upset saying that I asked her just to be honest about this in the future. She said she was going to tell me but it just hadn't crossed her mind.

A couple of months after that, her friend Jess moved up to our city. Jess is a cool lady and they get on really well. I had suspected in the past from hearing bits and pieces that she was an escort which made me re-think my lovely ladies rondez vous with mystery man for cash and the way that there seemed to be some weird unspoken history between the two but I put it to the back of my mind. I tried to give her a few opportunities to say if something was up just asking generalised questions when we had been talking about prostitution and that (we have lot's of interesting political-ish discussions) and she said nothing. After a short while she finally explains to me that Jess is in fact an escort and was I still cool with that and her. Of course I was, she was still Jess, the good friend of my fiancée who has been nothing but nice to me. Who am I to judge? I even gave her another opportunity in the nicest possible way whilst having a walk saying, be honest, have you ever done or considered doing escort work. She laughed and said of course not, she didn't think she'd be capable of doing it.


**The Climax of How I Now Know for Sure**

I overheard my lady and Jess talking about something at a party whilst a bit drunk. I didn't hear much but I heard them talking about a ""Stan"" (not his real name) and an initial (not ""S"") in the same breath, the same fake name and initial combination going on in the messages I once saw. There was mention of some problem, something about remembering, and I thought I heard that he was going to be coming up. This all happened on Friday. I didn't want to be that paranoid boyfriend, I didn't want to just start answering ridiculous questions again. I just sat on what I thought I heard and tried to be skeptical and rational about it. Every time I went over anything in my head I remembered how she acted slightly strangely with her responses and I thought at the time that could be a sign of lying but I wasn't sure if I was just remembering this wrong. 

Finally, after going a bit quietly mad and not wanting to bring things up again, we were up late watching the US Elections last night (we live in the UK) both hoping the Americans would do the right thing and re-elect Obama. She fell asleep and I was staring at her phone with all this shit going on in my head so I did something inexcusable and I opened it and went through her messages. I feel awful for this and I don't handle guilt well.

I saw messages from Jess about this Stan guy where she said that the hotel she was taken to in London recently with another client was really nice and quite a lot like where Stan used to take them, and that Stan was going to be about in our city soon. I saw that Jess at some point in September had a companionship job with a couple of really rich guys where she just hung out, did she want to go with her the second time round, ""I know you are spoken for but I thought I should ask"", and ""They weren't expecting anything, well at least not the previous night but things might change"", and ""I will obviously give you cash for this"". I froze and felt sick. She replied saying she wasn't sure if she would go but then said, ""only if you come round and help me dress up"". I checked out the dates that this went on and I honestly think she didn't go ahead with this. I can't remember exactly what I and we were doing that evening.

I looked further through her messages and read the single message on her phone that was there by Stan addressing both my fiancée and Jess by their initials, saying he was going to be about, they should all meet up together again like old times and maybe this time try something new. She hadn't replied to this message.

I didn't know what to do at this point. I was guilt stricken because I couldn't trust her enough to not go through her phone but at the same time distraught about the whole escort thing. I woke her, I couldn't do anything else. She seemed mad at me for going through her phone and got very pissed off. I apologised a whole bunch and properly broke down with the stress of it all. I didn't ask her right away about everything because she clearly wasn't in the right mood to discuss it. She said she was angry and tired and wanted to talk on a clear head. By this point I had already sobbed a whole bunch and couldn't have made it any clearer to her how sorry I was. She said that she was also hurt because I had been keeping this to my self instead of speaking to her and whilst doing that telling her how great everything is, she thought I was being insincere in what I had said. I explained that I genuinely meant the nice things I had said and there was some cognitive dissonance going on.

When any specifics came up she was reluctant to say anything too specific. We talked it through without actually really mentioning the whole escort thing to a point where we were both saying we love each other and that we both want to try to make it work and it sucks. I was scared she was going to leave me. I asked her if we could still talk about the escort thing when things were more calm, even though I had betrayed her trust and she said yes. We have cancelled our cinema double date tonight to talk about it.

We finally went to bed, and she opened up a bit and said that she didn't go ahead with that paid date and then whatever job because she would have felt icky. The fact that she considered it and got back to Jess is enough to upset me. She still wouldn't talk about the hotel meetings though and remained vague, she repeated to me that she hadn't cheated on me though. I remember so clearly her story of her London trip changing with each bit of information I gave her about what I knew and how odd that felt.

The really upsetting part is that it is my birthday very soon and we were going to go away for a weekend starting with a gig. She became quickly reluctant about this about the time the message from Stan came saying she wasn't sure if she could get the time off work to leave early enough and seemed weird when I said I didn't care, I'd pay fer her train down and we could meet after the gig and have our weekend then. This weekend exactly when Stan is in town. She still has one of the days off when we are not away but I am working which was a suggested date by him.

You know what, I think I could forgive her but I don't know if I'm being a fool. I still love her and our relationship has been practically perfect except for this. She stresses a lot about money thanks to 2 student loans and an old flatmate leaving her in more debt so I can see why she would do it. She gets upset that I pay for most things and has said to me on a number of occasions that she doesn't want me thinking that she is taking advantage of me. I don't, I just want to help her help herself so we can get on with our lives together and not have to worry about past debt. If there were truly no feelings attached and it was just a job I could be accepting of that even though I wouldn't ever want her to continue doing it. The biggest thing I feel is the betrayal, not telling me straight up, even before we started getting really serious, even when I gave her a number of opportunities framed with the sincere phrase, ""I wouldn't be angry with you"".


**My Question**

What the fuck do I do Reddit? I am lost. This relationship means everything to me. She seems so honest and sincere in all the nice things she tells me and tells her friends. They all get on with me really well and are so lovely to me because she truly does speak highly of me to everyone (which means she really cares right?). I don't think any of her other friends know about any of this and though Jess is a good friend, they are not BFF's or anything. I needed to write all this down just to help me process this. I'm so sorry it is really long. I am typing this whilst shaking and choking back tears in my office at work completely unable to get on with any thing.

How should I approach talking to her? She doesn't do arguing well so I don't want to be on the attack otherwise she will end up being on the attack or become to upset and we won't get anything sorted. I hate conflict so much. How can I make it up to her for reading her messages? I guess my biggest concern is that she has had some emotional problems in the past and I really don't want to trigger another downward spiral in her, what ever happens. She has been good and pretty consistently happy since me (well at least on the surface) but she has been to some dark places mentally and I don't want her to return there. I love her.

Just fucking say some words Reddit. I need something right now.

Thank you so much for being there.



**REALLY IMPORTANT EDIT MESSAGE:**

**A lot of people are saying that she is sleeping with loads of guys behind my back. I really do not think this is the case. If anything I believe it is an old client or something. I spend enough time with her and know her work friends well enough to know with some confidence that her sleeping with a tonne of people isn't the case**

Hi Reddit - Longtime lurker, created a name solely to ask for your advice.


This will probably be a novel, and I'm sorry. This has been going on for the past 6 years, and I haven't been able to speak to anyone about it.
My boyfriend [53] and I [26] are both chronically ill. The age gap doesn't bother me whatsoever, and is preferable, as he is more understanding of the fact that I cannot do things that people my age normally do, as I'm just too sick and haven't the energy.


I cannot work. I cannot do something as simple as spend a day at the mall, nor can I just traipse off to the movies. As you can see, this greatly limits my ability to socialize, which is an important piece of information. Most of my friends from the past won't speak to me anymore, understandably, as the updates of 'Hey, how are you?' 'Still sick' got a bit old.


I am American. He is Canadian. We have been dating for 7 years long-distance, and I'm finally within the point in my life where I can come up to Canada to stay with him. I've been here for 6 months, and have applied for an extension to remain in Canada. Because of this, I am legally not allowed to work, to go to school in Canada, and several other restrictions.


Here's what's difficult:


My boyfriend, through his illness, has developed severe OCD and paranoia. I'm familiar with these traits from my past experience with him, but it's gotten exceptionally worse. Our house is trashed; there is trash sitting on the floor from a year ago because he's too afraid to pick it up (he worries excessively that it's contaminated). He has allergies that cause him to itch and burn, as if his skin is on fire, so he determines certain 'contaminations' and becomes deathly afraid to touch certain objects. I'm talking severe panic attacks - sweating, shaking, vomiting, etc. If I could post a picture of our house, I would, but he won't allow me to touch the camera in case that's contaminated, as well. I've suggested gloves, even protective clothing, but it's not enough - as if the contamination will seep right through.


It is quite trying, as every other sentence is 'Did you just touch that?' 'That' could be anything - a table, an errant piece of paper, the countertop, a chair. The floor is the worst ... God forbid the floor gets touched. I have to wear certain pants bunched up several inches from the floor, or else he goes on a cleaning frenzy that lasts for hours with chemicals so strong that the skin on his hands peel. There is dust an inch thick on just about everything. Receipts and trash lying everywhere. Stains from 9 months ago that would have been easy to clean in the moment, but now need a paint-chipper to get off.
Here's another example: I bought a $2,000 computer for school (I needed power for design and video work). Within weeks, I wasn't allowed to touch it anymore for fear that it's contaminated. He tried to clean it, but he ended up breaking it as the chemicals he used completely fried the hard-drive. Now it's sitting on a table next to a chair. That ENTIRE AREA cannot be touched - this is like a 6 x 6 ft area that is not allowed to be approached - not the table, not the chair, not the computer nor the battery, not even the t-shirt hanging over the back of the chair. This has been like this for the last year.
I am constantly washing/reassuring him/swearing that I haven't touched anything. I can't even do the dishes. The ONLY things I'm allowed to touch in the entire house are certain clothes that he has designated are clean, the toilet, the shower, the bed, an e-reader, my chair, and my computer (he purchased one directly after he broke my aforementioned laptop). I can't clean. I can't dust. I can't even do the dishes. He won't, either, so we're sitting in a veritable mold trap. The landlord, understandably, is pissed because there is trash lying around outside the house (I can only imagine how he'd feel if he looked inside! We'd be evicted immediately). The mail has been in its box for a year (he won't touch mail at all, in case someone contaminated it on purpose).


... which brings me to the next issue: the paranoia. He is CONVINCED that the government is after him. There are some things we can only speak in whispers in case someone is spying on him from the computer. We're not even allowed to talk in the car, in case it's being monitored. An example would be if we were in the main room and I mentioned picking up celery at the grocery store in a normal voice. Now, we cannot buy celery because he's afraid that someone will have contaminated it.


What's even crazier, these paranoia's are rubbing off on ME now - constant washing, mistrust, questioning, etc.


In the past (about 8 years ago), he had given an opinion on a VERY public forum that angered a great deal of people. Somehow, they found his address, and for months thereafter, his mail would be torn to shreds. Cryptic messages would be scrawled across them. Someone hacked into both his e-mail and his websites, where they left threatening words. He has a daughter, and feared that they would harass her, as well, but they left her alone and only targeted him and his wife at the time. Even though it only occurred for about 9 months, it's left a lasting impression that I believe led to all of the above issues.


He VEHEMENTLY REFUSES both medication and counseling, even though I have PLEADED him to access these routes. Even when he was pulled into the hospital twice for suicide threats by the police, I begged the doctors to put him on something, but he has a voice and a smile that can charm the birds from trees, so they believed him when he said that everything was fine and normal.


Before I moved here, I was a professional dog trainer. I've worked for years in behavior modification and animal nutrition, and it is my life's passion.


I haven't touched a dog since I've been up here. I touched a pet rabbit once, and he screamed so viciously that I have been too afraid to touch anything with fur (he thinks animals are contaminated).
His last partner cheated on him with a multitude of men, so now he holds the same fears for me. I used to have a small social circle, but he became quite controlling of who I could speak to, so I've cut everything off (I tried to re-kindle a few friendships - they don't want anything to do with me anymore, which I understand). I used to have to keep my phone on 24/7 for years when I was in the States so that he could hear every word from conversations I would have with others. If the phone cut off due to low battery, or if it disconnected from poor service, he would scream at me for hours, calling me a slut, a whore, a cheater, etc, as he thought I was having relations with guys. This phone issue racked up serious bills (up to $800 a month), but I felt forced to continue due to his insecurities. He thought I was having sex with my roommate (my roommate at the time was 78) and my business partner. I even had to close my dog training business because he thought I was using my business as an excuse to meet men. I have NEVER, EVER cheated, and would NEVER consider it. It's an act that I abhor, yet no matter how much I try to get this across, he rips up the same old wounds that I am a harlot looking to get laid. The irony of this is that I have vaginitis - having sex feels like razor blades and sandpaper are tearing my insides - he and I rarely, if ever have intercourse, and it's only when I can grip the bed and bite a sock with tears streaming down my face with me begging him to hurry that we can do it!


I'm not even allowed to talk to the landlord. Whenever he see's the landlord approaching, he'll forcefully push or shove me out of his line of sight and tell me to stay hidden until he leaves.


I am not, under ANY circumstances, EVER allowed to leave the house without him - even just to pick up something from the store 4 miles away.


Since I've been up here for the last half-year, a lot has been revealed. I didn't realize how difficult it would be before, but I am terribly lonely. I have, quite literally, no friends to talk to (I'm not even allowed to try to make friends up here, as he feels that having friends are a bad influence and that I'm only trying to feed my ego and please people by having any friends). I'm not even discussing, 'Oh, I have 150 on my Facebook', I'm talking NO friends. NO outside contacts. Everyone that we meet, he has a problem with. I can't get a pet because of his contamination issues, so most of the day is spent browsing reddit. We don't really go out, and it's such a small town, there's no where to really go, anyway. I can't volunteer, as he feels I'm going to use it as a way to meet people. When I asked if I could volunteer my dog training services to people in need (and because I really fucking miss it), he had a tantrum that shut me up for good.


My chronic illness has become much worse up here. I can't tell if it's because of the situation, or if it's just deepened in general. I just don't see a way out of this problem. I've become highly dependent on him - financially and emotionally. Since I can't work due to the worsened illness, I don't know where I would go or what I would do if I DID leave. I'm thousands in debt. I've tried disability, but it's such a harrowing process, and they don't deem my illness 'bad enough' yet.
Because I've spent 6 years following everything he's ordered - from cutting off all friends, who I'm allowed to speak to, closing businesses, quitting jobs, purchasing what he's required me to, what I'm allowed to read or watch, even changing my major, it's become a bit of a Stockholm Syndrome issue. I'm exceptionally reliant on him, and in the times when I did try leaving for a few weeks here and there (on several occasions), I would have severe panic attacks, nightmares, and feelings of being trapped without him, so I always went back. Instead of feeling freedom, I felt caged, alone, insecure, and as if I couldn't trust anyone.


I can see that I am painting him as a terrible person. He pays for everything - the house rent, the food, my medical care, etc. He has spent thousands on clothes for me (I'm not used to Canadian winters) and has repaired my car on the several occasions it's broken down. At my sickest, he brings me home-cooked meals, laughs and jokes with me, caresses my aching body, brushes my hair, etc. He has never physically hit me (that would be a final straw - I watched my mother get beaten), is always telling me how much I mean to him, and he claims he cannot live without me (he has a Will ready to go if I leave, which feels manipulative, but he says I help him deal with his illness much easier, and with the severity of his suffering, I can see that he'd see it as losing one more thing and choose to end his life).


A typical day is me getting up before him, browsing reddit for hours until he wakes up, each of us puttering on websites that don't matter, me pacing the hallway, getting food from the grocery store, preparing dinner at home, and me going to sleep while he stays up 'til 3. The next day repeats. I've begged him to change our habits for the last year, but he is unwilling due to his fears. I even asked if we could make some compromises so that we can both do what we want, but he creates such a fuss over it that I drop it.


I've become highly suicidal and resentful. I feel trapped if I stay and trapped if I go. I have tried antidepressants (several brands) to see if it was just MY issue, but they have only increased my anxiety. Several family members and friends over the years have tried to alarm me over our relationship, but (surprise!) I was required to immediately discontinue speaking with them. A month ago, when I had tried to leave again, (he was screaming so loudly the neighbors phoned the police and they took him away), I got as far as 20 miles before I pulled out a knife and tried to end my life, I was panicking so badly. Of course, I slunk back to him, with his promises that everything was going to be all right, but it only seems to have gotten worse. 


Every night I've been dreaming of suicide to escape this bleakness. I even had a breakdown so violent that I begged him for a hospital visit, but he doesn't trust doctors, so I sat in the shower for hours waiting for it to pass.


**TL;DR**: My paranoid, chronically ill boyfriend is excessively controlling, but I don't feel healthy enough emotionally nor physically to live a life without him.

I tried to give him a blow job last night and he politely declined. He said that it will take a little bit of time for him to let me love him. But he also acknowledged that if I don't try that he will just assume it's like all of the other times. I let him know that I will continue to love him and keep trying until he feels comfortable.
We have also began going to the gym together. He spots me and I do the same for him.
I know I have some stuff I have to work on as far as not being able to let go of the past. That is going to be worked out with a therapist. I have an appointment with one tomorrow afternoon. Lets see she works out if not then I will try someone else. I have a list of a few to go to provided by my docotor.
I have also scheduled an appointment to get back on Birth Control. I want to be able to just jump on him and not have to worry if I brought a condom or not.

**(I think this is how an Update goes??)**


This Thursday I learned from my husband [36M] that he is not ""in Love with me"" and and is not attracted to me but he still wants to be friends. 
We are moving to a new apartment at the end of this month. 

I'm a [33F] We have been married for 8 years and together for 12 years.

He said he cares deeply about me and wants to make sure I am strong enough physically and mentally. 

The past: 
I don't show him how much I love him physically, not a lot of sex, and affection. We have talked about it in the past and I always say I will change and never do. I thought I was doing better but now I see that I was not even close to the level of intimacy he needs from me. 

I will be looking for a therapist or someone to talk to that is impartial and will help me work on some of my mental issues. 
i.e. not letting go of past hurts, angry a lot, and generally not happy about myself. 

We will living together in the same apartment for at least another year. 
Is there still a chance to change things around? 

TL;DR!
Husband [36M] is not ""in love"" with me, I didn't follow through with changes I said I would make. We will be living together for at least a year.

It actually really helped, even the stuff I didn't want to hear. I'm going to spend a few days away from him just processing everything. I do think he needs on medication and I'm going to bring it up with him again. 

Some points:

* Yes, I allowed myself - and still allow myself - to be a doormat. I don't know how else to cope.

* Yes, it was my choice to not go back to school, but he said he would get a job and help with finances (if he did not have the GAD, this would have been a reasonable expectation. Many of our grad friends work and go to school). He then refused to get a job both times when the opportunities arose.

* I am currently in my new job (been here for a year) and love it. The move was mostly for him, so he could have quiet and ""just write"" and be closer to his family, but the job turned out a million times better than i expected.

* When he accepted the invitation from the program, they outright lied to him, so neither of us knew what we were really getting in to. They claimed average graduation time is 3-4 years (it's closer to 7); school would be completely funded and students would be given livable stipends (school is paid for, stipends were only for two years and barely covered book/research expenses); and they claimed they would help him get a job anywhere with 99% success rate (this is complete rubbish altogether; profs just dump their students after graduation).

* I never meant to insinuate Arkansas wasn't a good place to live. It's probably very nice. I meant that I would not be able to find a job there as there are few jobs in that state relative to what I do. Right now, I love my job and it would be hard to leave my great position (that pays very well) for my husband's academic job that also had shitty pay in a state where I would not find a job.

* I brought up living apart for next year if he could find a post-doc and he was generally accepting of it, although doesn't think it would be ideal. But, I think just to get him experience and keep me in my job for awhile longer would be a good thing for both of he. He could also learn to cope on his own.

I probably shouldn't blame him for the miscarriage. Yes, I know this. In my mind, I know his stress did not *cause* my miscarriage. But, imagine your body hemorrhaging giant clots of baby, a baby that was a surprise, but you still wanted it. And try to hear the person who you love most in the world in the next room weeping and shouting, ""Praise god! I don't fucking have to deal with it!"" while you are huddled naked in the tub, crying as your uterus contracts, labouring the clot of cells that could have been a wanted kid out of your body. This is why I hold on to such resentment towards him regarding the m/c. No, he did not *cause* my miscarriage. But, when I needed him most, he was celebrating in my pain.

Like the title says, he was logged in and my curiosity browsed his messages. The message causing me to post to r/relationships was a conversation between him and a sister of a girl he pined after for years. I don't know the complete history of the two, but it spans years. Basically he said he loved me, but he thinks of her everyday and misses her like crazy. Yep, he misses the girl that kept him friend zoned and wrapped around her finger.  That old country song ‘Jolene’ is echoing in my mind. Oh, and he works with her, not always side by side, but occasionally.

The message was sent around or on our six months anniversary. He made a big deal out of six months. I told him most people celebrate by the year, not every six months. Eventually he said we we’re going through a rough patch and thought making six months momentous would help.  This hurt because I didn’t know we had issues and am constantly trying to get him to communicate.
Yesterday morning while laying in bed I made the comment that nothing good lasts forever. Right before going to bed he tells me he thought I was breaking up with him when I said that. I asked him why he didn’t say anything, he had some weak excuse.  He did mention he grabbed me tightly and wouldn’t let go, which is what he does when things get especially rough or emotional. I should have picked up on it, in retrospect. 

There has been one other time when I got on his laptop and looked through his history. He was upset with me, embarrassed, and felt his privacy was invaded. I can't imagine what he will think or feel about this. I know I'm hurt and have no one to talk to. It’s difficult not to feel hurt when I accept him for everything and love him as much as I can, and yet he finds himself hung up on a girl that kept him away. I thought advice from this community would spare me from worsening the situation.  And maybe make me feel a bit better…

TL;DR  SO didn’t log out of FB account, read message, found out he is missing another woman (who kept him friend zoned and strung along) like crazy. 

UPDATE: I told him I looked at the message and told him I'd never do it again. He was calm and collected. After I told him he reread the message, to see if he had said something I construed, and explained. He and this gal grew up together since kindergarten and were very close friends. When he and I started hanging out, even just as friends, he let her go and they said goodbye. She has not tried to contact him and he hasn't tried to contact her. He said he couldn't talk to me or many people about it, but the sister knew the situation and he wanted to get those feelings out to move on. She did ask him in the message if he wanted those thoughts to be relayed to her, he pointed out he did not respond and thought it was best to leave it be. He said he didn't think it was a big deal I read the message and when I asked if I broke his trust he said no. So it may be easy to read something like this and think the relationship is crap and not worth either of our time, but this is the first time I've ever felt like I've fucked up in a relationship. I freaked and thought this was the place. I've been put in my place several times with kind and not so kind words.

I want to know how to deal with his abuse and I want to help him see what he's doing.

* He accuses me of being upset by things like him having a social life or working at home when I'm not bothered by those at all. (I encourage them if anything.)

* He doesn't believe me when I tell him how I feel, nor can he see things from my perspective. (He tells me I'm angry, and his definition of yelling is not bound by the volume of my voice, which confuses me still.)

* He blames me for our relationship's problems. (Things would be better if I could let go of how he's hurt me.)

* He calls me names and curses at me. (He's a brilliant person and his favorite thing to call me is an idiot.)

* He shows distaste when I make small mistakes like calling a router a modem. He rolls his eyes, shakes his head, sighs, and says ""nothing"" when I ask him what's up.

* He refuses to discuss problems even when I'm not angry. (He told me last night to find another place to sleep and wouldn't tell me why. I honestly didn't know why he wanted me to.)

* He interrogates me for personal information. (My traumatic past, whether or not I've smoked pot, and how many bars I've entered.)

Last night, we got into an argument. I stayed calm the entire time. He asked me what I wanted from him, and I told him that at that point all I wanted was for him to show me his love. He asked me what that meant and accused me of trying to test him. I gave him some examples of how he could show me love. When I suggested hugging, he said the last time he did that, I accused him of only wanting a physical relationship. We have agreed neither of us were in this relationship for sex several times this month alone...

I just want a normal relationship with him. He's been developing a good friendship with another girl which I'm fine with, but they're taking 3 classes together next semester while I'm moving away for school. He's also gotten very defensive when I asked him who he was taking for a motorcycle ride and it turned out to be her. He refused to talk to me for the rest of that night and told me that information the following day.

**tl;dr: I just moved in with an abusive partner and I want to know how to show him how he's treating me.**

UPDATE: I tried to post something on this last night after I saw the overwhelming response, but he refused to leave me alone in any room I entered. I told him I needed to write some e-mails (true) and he sat there reading them... Anyway... After he and his friends and I played video games (I couldn't even raise my voice above a whisper for some reason) he warmed up to me and asked me why I was acting strange.

He told me he was sorry for taking his stress out on me. I told him I didn't appreciate being his outlet for frustration like that. He didn't understand what I meant...

He told me he loves everything about me, ""even the bits that annoy him."" This means a lot to me, but I think he was referring to the fact that he thought I was upset about things that never bothered me.

He told me I'm dwelling on the past. Keep in mind we had only been discussing the past 5 days.

He's back to being his normal, happy self with me. I'm going to have to change my nature from being ready to deal with shit storms to embracing him for being the man I love.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys! I'm really glad I came here and asked for other opinions. My boyfriend and I will be discussing this after he gets off of work tonight. I will update you! Thanks again :) 

 ___________________________________________________

I (23/F) have lived with my boyfriend (26/M) for a year and have been together for four. We're pretty committed and have discussed marriage and both feel like its going to happen. 

When he started dating, he didn't have a lot of money. I mean he could barely pay for gas or groceries. I did have a decent amount, so I gladly helped him whenever he needed it. I never judged him for his financial situation and I never felt differently about him because of it. Trust me, when I say he was broke, he was **broke.** 

We currently live in his dad's house because we have been saving up for our own apartment for several months now. The living situation isn't ideal, but it's better than nothing. My boyfriend has harped on me to save my money and not be reckless, so I've been watching my finances for a few months. 

About eight months ago, my boyfriend started his own business. It's been doing well, and he's making a killing from it. I'm genuinely happy for him! The issue is... Once he started seeing those dollar signs come in, he's been an asshole. He will make fun of me for using coupons or opting to buy store brand groceries. If I have a bill of, let's say, $200, he'll laugh at me and say ""that's pocket change to me now."" I got fired a few months ago  and he likes to throw that in my face too. 

Recently, he's been making some big purchases... Or should I say, UNNECESSARY purchases. He just bought two iPads ""because he can."" He'll give his parents hundreds of dollars because it makes him feel good about himself. And... Unfortunately, I just got a TEXT from him today saying he just bought a fucking Maserati ""because its his money and he felt like it."" Yes, a Maserati...parked in his dad's driveway... While we sleep in the basement... 

He didn't even talk about this with me first. After I told him I thought it was a stupid decision, especially since his business isn't even a year old yet, he replied ""have fun in your Saturn (that's what I drive... It's a shitty car but hey) while me and my dumb decisions make moves."" He already has a 2010 car. 

Essentially, he makes me feel like shit because I am broke and he doesn't help me at all (I pay for HIS groceries, weekend dinners, etc and I'm barely making it). I just want to be like... HELLO!!! I was there for you when you didn't have shit, and now you're going to get all ""big shot money bags"" on me? It makes me sick! 

How should I handle this situation? Do I have a right to be upset about the car? I've tried to tell him my feelings and he just calls me jealous. He was teased in school so I get the vibe he wants to be the ""cool guy"" with all this money and all these cars and potentially all these females... But I feel like his appreciation now is more money, not me. 

I'm not sure if this is a temporary thing considering he's only been getting his money for a few months and its ""new"" to him, or if this is something that will change him for the worse. He wasn't like this at all until his business started, so I just don't know how to take it.

One of these different values is that he's absolutely obsessed with being skinny while I'm all about self-love-- he used to be very overweight and lost almost 100 lbs to become slender. He also often mentions liking very thin petite girls but always made clear that he liked me tremendously anyway. 

Except last night, when he asked me to lose weight so I can be 110-120 lbs.

Now, I'm 5""7 and weigh 140 lbs, which I thought was perfectly okay. I love his slender body and do want him to feel the same attraction for me, but I also feel he should love me the way I am now, which isn't too fat as it is (I think?). The request also seems callous to me as I would still love him if he gained 30 lbs. Am I just wrong and it's an innocuous request I should grant?

Since she has broken so many promises in the past, I was advised by my dad and my psychologist that what I should do is send her an email that stated the 'rules' for our relationship, so that she would essentially not be able to act like she 'didn't know' that her actions were upsetting me. I told her that I planned to do this, and she said she was going to suggest the same solution, so everything seemed positive. 

I sent the rules. They were simple, things like; making/canceling dates with each other within 1 days notice, not being asked/expected to help her boyfriend (who she cheated on my dad with) in any capacity, not discussing any future plans (because she would say she'd do things just to get me off her back, not because she meant them) and also no giving of gifts (because she'd hold them against me to try to get favours/forgiveness out of me).

There were 6 rules, and I left out the explanations for the rules because they are non-negotiable, and they are essentially logical decisions, not emotional reactions. Those are my boundaries that she must respect. At first she responded with her rules, which were: 1.) be happy 2.) don't swear at me. I responded simply with a thank you. I was relieved that we could finally move forward.

Then, the next day, I received a very long, bitter email from her where she said that she is not a child, and that my requests from her are proof that I have issues, and that if my psychologist supports the list, or the idea of having rules for a relationship, then she questions his abilities as a psychologist. She said she was repulsed and she needs time away from me to deal with the resentment she now has for me.

As it stands my relationship with her is over, I guess? I don't know if I should keep trying? Should I keep trying? Every time I point out where she has gone wrong, she twists it around and finds a way to excuse her faults, but never anyone else's. I feel like I should leave this alone now and focus on building my life, but it's very hard to once and for all accept that my mother is not worth putting energy into. I am in the process of trying to get my undergrad but I spend so many days just staring at my books, wondering about all this, and not really being able to move forward.

She's the only relationship I've been in and we were each others' firsts for just about everything (she was in a short relationship with another girl when she was 14). She's openly bi though she has never expressed interest in pursuing women while we've dated, other than playful ""I would totally do that actress"" type of stuff. We love each other a ton and she's my best friend in the world.

In the summer, she told me she doesn't identify as a female and over time she's become increasingly androgynous. She's always been a bit of a tomboy but over the last few months she's cut her hair in a more masculine style, stated wearing a breast binder and men's clothing and shortened her name to something more androgynous. We almost broke up when she bought the binder because I said I wasn't sure if I could be attracted to her looking more masculine but we decided to give it a try. In her opinion, it's been great. She tells me constantly how much she regrets almost breaking up and how much she loves me. In my opinion,  not so much. 

I'm finding my attraction to her decreasing more and more everyday. It feels like the only time I'm ever attracted to her is when she's naked but our frequency of sex has been decreasing over time and I'm not at all interested in asking her if we can have an open relationship, nor is she for that matter. I 100% support her decision to become someone she feels more comfortable as, but at the same time, I'm scared that the day where I lose all attraction to her is right around the corner. 

I don't want to break up with her but if that's what has to happen, I want it to be on good terms because she really is my best friend. I'm not even sure how to approach this subject with her (I'm pretty sure she doesn't know that this is how I've been feeling).

1370890395.0,106,self.relationships,1g28s5,My best friend (M18) of six years did something Friday that's affecting the way I (M18) look at him...,Throwmojojo,147,41,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g28s5/my_best_friend_m18_of_six_years_did_something/,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm on my Mom's computer and her keyboard is pretty wonky so I'm sorry if there's any formatting issues. This might be kind of long b/c I think some background is necessary.

I've been best friends with ""Matt"" for six years. We met when I moved in sixth grade and we've been inseparable since. For the most part, we've had a really good friendship: Don't fight, are loyal, make each other laugh, etc. 

We've only ever really had one fight and it happened a few months ago. My older sister, Lucy, is 21 and in college. She's pretty so I've dealt with my fair share of shit from my friends - mostly jokes about marrying her and stuff like that. It's usually harmless but over Christmas break this year Matt and I got pretty shitty at a party and called Lucy to have her pick us up.

While we were waiting for her, I got dragged away from Matt by a girl I liked (no, nothing happened unfortunately) and missed a bunch of Lucy's calls. Since I wasn't answering, she came into the party to look for us. She found Matt first then grabbed me. We went home and I thought all was well. The next day, though, I overheard some acquaintances talk about the ""hot girl"" that picked Matt up from the party and how he'd made jokes about how slutty she was and how he was gonna ""hit that"" (those words look so weird in quotes lol). 

I got really pissed and I told him that his ""jokes"" weren't really jokes, they were shitty, and that while I'm usually a good sport, it (reasonably, I think) makes me uncomfortable/angry to hear my friends talk about my sister. He said he was just drunk, didn't know the guys very well and felt awkward because I'd taken off (true), so he just made jokes he knew they'd think were funny. He apologized, though, so I let it go.

This brings us to Friday. Matt and I graduated high school last week and there was a big grad party at one of our friend's houses. Afterwards, a group of us walked over to my house for a sleepover. We were in the basement and Lucy came down once or twice to talk to us. She went to bed and, around 2, most of my friends and I fell asleep. A little bit after that, I woke up when I heard someone go up the stairs. I noticed Matt and my friend Jake were the only ones gone but I figured they needed water or something so I went back to sleep.

On Saturday, Jake told me that he was getting water when Matt came up the basement steps. He asked Matt where he was going and said Matt made a ""humping move"" (his words) and then went upstairs. Jake said like ten minutes later Matt came back into the basement and fell asleep.

When I asked Lucy what happened, she seemed really embarrassed but she told me that Matt came into her room and tried to hook up with her. She said he didn't push or force himself on her - he was drunk, but clearly had misinterpreted her because he made some talk about ""signs"" she'd given or whatever. She sent him back downstairs and went to bed.

So, my sister doesn't think it's a big deal. But I'm angry and feel kind of...I dunno, disrespected? Which sounds weird because my sister doesn't care (though she doesn't know he made the humping motion or that he called her slutty a few months ago).

But I feel like Matt knows how uncomfortable it makes me for people to act like my sister is a sexual object and then he pulls shit like this. He wasn't secretive about why he went into my sister's room - had he actually hooked up with Lucy, I think he'd want the rest of my friends to know. 

Jake thinks I'm overreacting because ""Matt just likes her and made a move, it's whatever"". 

I dunno. Am I crazy for being annoyed? Should I just let this go? I saw him briefly yesterday when he visited my work (I'm a bus boy) and I felt weird around him and think he noticed. 

**tl;dr**: My best friend has said gross things about my sister and the other night, made it clear to a friend that he planned to hook up with her, even though he knows it makes me really uncomfortable. Am I crazy for feeling annoyed with him?

Now, we are not poor by any means.  I have a well paying job, we have a house we are paying a mortgage on, we have cell phones, 2 cars paid in full, cable, internet, video games, eReaders and we go out every now and then to do things.  However, right now we have some credit card bills and student loans that we agreed we should try to pay off and should cut some things out as needed to help pay them down faster.

For example, last year she signed up for a 1 year personal trainer at her gym and that one year is almost up and we don't want to renew right now because we want to pay off the debt mentioned above.  She came home last night and said she only had 5 more sessions and was sad about but knew she couldn't sign up for more because ""we are poor"".  

I got really upset and said ""We're not poor.  Just because we can't afford to get you a personal trainer doesn't mean we're poor.""  

She just looks at me really surprised and said ""we are poor."" 

 So, I said that ""whenever you say that it makes me feel like I can't provide for my family and really hurts.""  

She says ""that's not what she meant.""

I said ""that may not be what you meant but that is how it makes me feel.""

She says ""Whatever"" and rolls her eyes and walks off.

Later I apologize for getting upset but stated that ""Even if that is how she meant it, the fact of the matter is that is how it made me feel.""

She was taking the kid to get new shoes and says ""We'll talk about it later.""

We never talked about it later.  This isn't the first time she has said this and the first time I've gotten upset about it.  It really upsets me because

1) I grew up poorer than we are now.  Half the time how I would eat on the weekends was at a friend's house because we didn't have anything at home except for stuff for dinner.  We are no where near having to do stuff like. While I didn't grow up in the poorest of situations, we were still pretty poor.  I had to get a job at 15 to help with the bills.

2) I worked my ass off through college to get a good education to get a good job and help build up my finances so that my family and myself wouldn't be poor as long as I could help it.  So whenever she says we're poor it just seems like a knife to the heart on everything I've done to try and prevent that.

3) I think saying we're poor diminishes what actual poor people have to go through.  I think we should be thankful for what we have and she just doesn't seem to be.

I know I have to talk to her about this, but my question is how should I go about it?

**td;lr: Wife keeps saying ""we're poor"" and it pisses me off because we're not and I worked hard to not be poor.  Any advice on how to talk to her about this?**

",RelationshipTossAway,135,27,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1142q7/i_24m_am_unsure_how_to_deal_with_a_friend_21f/,"I'm not sure if this is a petty issue or not, but it's been bothering me lately, so I figured I'd ask for advice. Met a girl through a friend about a year ago and we hit it off. We started talking a lot more frequently last spring and I noticed that she seemed to want to learn more about a lot of my hobbies and interests. At first I thought it was awesome. I was excited to meet a girl who actively wanted to read graphic novels, watch sci-fi, go hiking and similar outdoorsy things, and was cool with the music I'd play on drives that almost everyone else begs me to turn off. We seemingly had so much in common, far more than with most girls I'd dated in the past, that I asked her out. Our first date was a ton of fun, but as we spent more time together, there were several signals that I should cool things off. A lot of the ""problem"" was me: Several things made me realize I was in a bad place to pursue a relationship with anyone. But two of the biggest issues were that I was concerned she seemed to take our casual dating much more seriously than I did and how annoying it was that the moment I mentioned having an interest, she was all over it. 

When I mentioned going to the planetarium with some friends, within a day or two she started trying to talk to me about astronomy, making Internet posts about NASA and space exploration, etc.. She's added a bunch of new interests on Facebook and nearly all of them are activities/books/bands/etc. that I've either mentioned my appreciation for directly, or on social networking platforms where we're ""friends"". When we disagree on something, she's quick to backtrack and alter her stance so it's more in line with mine. When we started talking, she expressed zero interest in looking at grad school out of state. Last week she told me she's looking into two of the schools I've mentioned planning to apply to on the other side of the country. The location from one of them is so much the polar opposite of places and environments she said she was looking for that I can't imagine she ever considered the school prior to me talking about it (this is the thing that creeped me out the most). Today she texted me and I replied I was having a lazy day in bed watching football. She remarked she was doing the same and, though she's said in the past that she didn't understand or even like the sport, she magically acquired an understanding and deep appreciation for it. There's at least another dozen examples of behavior like this, but you get the idea. 

For a while I was silently annoyed by this, but thought I might be being ridiculous about a trait that's annoying but not hurting anyone. After venting to some friends about it and having the general consensus be that this behavior is ""super fucking creepy,"" I've been debating saying something. Still, I'm concerned that my reaction is on par with an angst-filled teen who gets upset that someone started liking his favorite band after he did. One of my favorite aspects of forming relationships with new people, platonic or otherwise, is discovering new knowledge and interests through them. I'm usually equally thrilled when friends get into books/music/hobbies/etc. that I introduced them to as I am when someone recommends things to me that I end up liking. At the same time, I've never had a situation where someone takes it beyond forming an appreciation for a few new things and winds up being into everything I like. I don't have Special Snowflake Syndrome and am aware millions of other people share my interests. Still it's odd when people begin referring to themselves as enthusiasts of, for example, genres of music, they've only begun listening to after you spoke of it, or copying a bunch of your ""likes"" off your Facebook profile. I've discussed the matter with our mutual friend who confirms she's never seemed to care about any of this stuff in the 2 years they've known each other.

I really want to call her out on it and tell her that it's unsettling and pushes me away from her. The problem is, I'm non-confrontational unless someone is actively trying to harm me or otherwise push me around, so I'm not 100% sure what I should say. She's extremely sensitive and I'm afraid that even if I express myself in the most gentle  way, she'll take it horribly. Although this bothers me, I think she's a great girl with a lot of positive traits. I'd like to continue being friends with her and definitely don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also think it's important for her to not neglect hobbies she had before we met, acquire more interests of her own, and overall be cool with being her own independent person.

So /r/relationships, what to do?

tl;dr - Guy goes on a few dates with a girl who winds up becoming into almost all his key interests extremely quickly, even though friend confirms she's expressed no interest in them before.

He was a great friend to me, always doting over me, there for me, complimenting me, he would give up anything to be with me. One day I gave in and we dated and ended up married with children. 

About 3 months into the relationship he started to change. He was more selfish, he was lying about where he was, what he was doing and who he was with. He would become mad at me for seemingly no reason, offering no explanation as to why.

For the past year or so, it's been the worst yet. He tells me to ""shut the fuck up!"" if I disagree with him about anything, visibly ignores me while I try to talk to him. (he stares intently at his computer or phone or out the window) He's been calling me names such as ""stupid bitch"" and telling me I'm worthless, stupid, boring, and that I only ""fuck up everything for him"".

For some clarity, when he refers to my fucking things up, he means we were late to a concert. (which he only uses as an excuse to do massive amounts of hallucinogens, proven by his inability to attend a concert if he'll be going sober)

I've done the best I can as his wife, I do his laundry, keep house, raise our two year old and 6 year old with very little help from him. I always listen to his venting about work, and I ask him to spend time with me on a daily basis. He usually is on his computer and responds to my advances with ""yeah, I'll be done in a second"" and then two hours later he's getting off the computer to either go to work or go to bed. 

He does something that frustrates me more than anything else though, he will do something like make a snide remark / complaint, or say something offensive, and when I react with being upset or hurt, he absolutely loses his shit and goes off on me saying things to make me feel worthless and like I'm just a piece of shit. 

When he gets wasted, he's so nice and caring and listens to me. He always makes these great promises that would surely set our relationship on the right track again but by the time he sobers up, he's back to being cruel and rude again and all of those promises just get thrown out the window and I'm left disappointed and crushed.

I've begun to adjust to his behavior by hiding my negative emotions from him because if I don't he'll get mad. I don't disagree with him anymore so he won't yell at me. When he does get mad at me anyway, I just sit there and take it because I'm too exhausted to fight back anymore. 

I'm a stay at home mother and can't afford to live without him, also we share a vehicle. The kids a father too so I stay with him, but lately I've just had enough and I don't know what I should do. Should I just adjust to his behavior and live life or should I leave him and try to make the lives of my kids and myself work somehow without a car or money? I just feel so lost anymore, I don't know what's true. I'm worried I'm going to start believing all of the shit he says about me all the time.

TL;DR:
My husband is emotionally abusive but I don't know if I should preserve the life my family has or flip everything upside down to get away from him, leaving my children fatherless.

In fact, I can't say I've ever heard him complain about anything up until recently.

About 2 years ago they get married, and about year later they had a baby.  Perhaps because of the stress or something, he seemed to change.  He was much more outgoing about getting together with me to have lunch or to talk about video games.  It seemed like a reasonable way to burn excess anxiety, especially since out of college, most of his other friends had moved on.  We never spoke about his wife or family and seldom about his daughter.  When we were together, it was like we were bros in a treehouse or playing our favorite 16-bit games for the first time.  We were and up until recently like little kids.

I began sensing increasing hostility from his wife though.  She had always had a certain brat-like personality and I suspect with her taking the role of a pre-school teacher and with her mothering her daughter, that she had developed a superiority complex.  In the least she was getting unbelievably bossy over inconsequential things.  My friend for the first time in over 2 decades started complaining to me.  He was beginning to see what I had seen before.  

A few days ago, while at my friend's place watching him play banjo-kazooie for the first time, she walked in and told me to leave.  Her voice raised to a yell as I got up.  I left without much of a question and my friend believing something was wrong saw me out.  I received a text a bit after with him apologizing for that and that there was something he had to deal with. We had lunch a few days later and he informed me that his wife, full of rage had ""had it"" with my presence in my friend's life.  Forget that she didn't want to have any part with me, she didn't want him to have any part with me.  She had demanded that he sever our relationship on her whim.  There was no apparent motive or justification.  My friend was conflicted by an undisclosed ultimatum she used on him and seemed to be trying to comply with both parties.  As a friend I didn't want him in any trouble.  What can I do really?    We talked for some time about it and how absurd she had been.  We didn't talk as if we were children.  He spoke and I listened.  Then he got the bill and told me that he would shoot me a text since he could delete those from his phone and that he would keep me in the loop.  We've had lunch 3 times since and nothing has changed.  He keeps taking the bill and we haven't talked about games since the incident.

My friend seems to believe that it bothers his wife to not be the center of attention.  I was never the center of attention when I was around, but she certainly wasn't because she didn't want any part in our gaming or movie escapades.

Is there anything I can do?  Is there anything I should do?  I'm so perplexed by the whole situation.  Imagine how she treats his other friends if she treats me, his otherwise best friend, like this.  Should I try distancing myself from him to help him avoid rather serious trouble?

If it means anything, we're both guys, he of course is married and I have a girlfriend (which the wife has kindly remarked to me as being ugly), so there's no doubt that we could possibly be having that kind of relationship behind her back.  Also she hits her dog and has a problem when others pet him- feast on that.

**TL;DR-My increasingly overbearing best-friend's wife is forbidding him from seeing or engaging in any communication with me for selfish reasons.**

I found out he still has nude photos of his ex girlfriend. I asked him to delete them. He refused. I asked for the reasons, he said he has no reasons, he just wants to keep them.

Little bit of a background. It appears, I have been very bad towards him for the whole relationship. He has sacrificed a lot. I havey sacrificed almost nothing. He says I have been abusive towards him all the time. He has forgiven me a lot of times. I have changed a lot since the beginning of the relationship, tried to fix everything, bit a slipped a lot of times and caused many huge fights which made him further away from me. And still continue to cause these fights :((

So he told me he doesn't want to delete them becuse he doesn't want to sacrifice this for me. He doesn't trust me with anything. And he believes that i will screw up again, and he won't forgive me it (because of deleting these pictures). 

Later that day,when I came home he said ""ok, i dont want to delete these photos,but i will, even if i dont want to"" i said to him that the problem is in him wanting to keep these photos, and said that i would want him to delete them once he wants to do it. He blew up, saying that i should have just accepted this gift. Said that i always make a problem out of eveything. And now he won't delete these photos. 

I very much want to fix everything, but i am hurt a lot. And our relationship is on the lowest level.

What do you think of all of it?

TL;DR He said he will delete this photos, even if he doesnt want to do this, i said i want him to want to delete them,so he can keep them for now and delete later,when he will want to do it. Our relationship became the worst because i didnt accept this gift.

Ps. He is friends with his ex gf, they talk on fb,sometimes,sometimes call each other. She also has his nude picture.

EDIT. His ex has a boyfriend now. When they were on a phone, she was on the computer and saw this photo and freaked out. She wanted to keep it,so she was going to hide it deeper. My boyfriend didnt mind it, said ""hide as deep as you can and etc""

Another EDIT. I did not find this photos. I found out that he has them. He told me after i asked him if he does have them.

1342314880.0,105,self.relationships,wknfj,[UPDATE] My best friend admitted that he has feelings for me. We signed a lease on an apartment and were supposed to move in next week- now what?,2ManyWords,126,21,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wknfj/update_my_best_friend_admitted_that_he_has/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wbbdd/my_best_friend_admitted_that_he_has_feelings_for/)

First, thank you all for your input.  Seeing so many perspectives helped me realize how I felt about the situation.

After a bit (actually, a lot) of calling back and forth, an acquaintance of mine (24M) told me that he'd be interested in living with my friend (25M).  I (24F) knew him from college because we had some mutual friends, and I had seen his dorm enough to know that he's a neat enough guy.  Non-smoker, rarely drinks, has a steady job.  I introduced him to my friend and they talked over lunch.  My friend likes him and said he'd be fine with living with him, so I went to talk to the land lord yesterday and brought the guy I knew from college with me.  I told him that I couldn't live there after all because of a family situation that came up, but that I already found a replacement and that my friend would still be living there.  The land lord didn't seem too bothered by this and sat down with the guy I knew from college to talk about things- setting down rules and such.  Afterwards, the land lord told me that this arrangement is fine and gave the guy paperwork to fill out.

As for my friend, I had a long talk with him today.  I told him that it wasn't fair of him to tell me about his feelings so shortly before we were supposed to move in together, but that I'm at least grateful that he didn't wait until after we had already done so.  I told him that I don't feel the same way about him and that I don't ever see us as being more than friends.  I also suggested that I distance myself for a little while- we'll still see each other at work and continue to hang out with mutual friends, but perhaps not hang out alone so frequently.  He agreed.

After maybe 2 hours of talking, I started getting irritated that I was the only one offering any thoughts on what happened.  This is a lot like how our friendship has been in general; I'll tell him everything and he'll always have a response, but when it comes to his life, he's not quite so open.  So he gave in.  He said that he's always found me attractive, but he never necessarily wanted to be more than friends until earlier this year.  There was a random night a few months ago where we had dinner with a mutual friend, and a guy that I didn't know very well came along too.  Apparently after I left, that guy asked if I was single and said that I'm pretty.  My friend said that this has happened before, but this was the first time that he minded.  Then over the last few weeks, he started ""getting a weird feeling"" when I'm around which isn't quite like having butterflies but ""more like a feeble lurch.""  His words.  Regardless, he said that the feelings aren't strong and he's not in love with me, they're just there.  He had much stronger feelings for some other girl a couple of years ago.

**TL;DR I'm no longer moving in with my friend, and told him that we won't ever be more than friends.  Found someone else to live with him and he and I will continue to be friends, but I'm going to distance myself a little until he gets his feelings in check.**

[*Edit*] After seeing the comments, I might as well add that I do feel awful for ~~friendzoning him~~ having to tell him that I couldn't be in a relationship with him, but I would never lie and tell him that I felt the same way about him just to make him happy.  The whole situation is unfortunate, but I appreciate his honesty and just want to move on from the whole ordeal.  I also don't feel bad for myself at all, though I feel terrible for my friend.

Basically I've been seeing a woman since last fall, I'm 27M and she is 26F.  We have had a great relationship so far, and have been sexually active as well.  I wanted to get a better feel for how many partners she has had in the past, and have asked her a few times previously.  She would always go cold and turn away, so I assumed maybe something bad in the past happened, and I would just let it go.  

Well, much to my surprise, we went to the bar the other night and as we get to car she bursts out in tears.  She begins explaining to me that she has had a lot of partners.  I'm thinking ""okay, maybe like 25 or 30"".  She then tells me she has had sex with well over 400 men in the previous years, starting when she was 13.  She said she can't even be sure if it is that low.  Obviously I'm quite shocked by this revelation, I have had a decent amount of sexual experience in the past but nothing could have prepared me for that.  She told me she was so embarrassed by this fact that she didn't want me to know until she thought the relationship might be concrete between us, because she feared I might leave her on that fact alone. 

We go to Church every week, and I would have never suspected this from her at all.  I did not know her until last year when she moved to my town.  I thought she was a good Christian woman, who I actually met at my local Church. Now I'm really taken back by this whole thing.  I told her to talk to a therapist about it because obviously I'm not qualified for this type of thing.  She said she will give that a shot.

Now I'm worried, not about STDs or anything (I have since been tested).  But more about her ability to cope with something that obviously made a huge dent in her life and something that she seems to regret deeply.  I don't know if this will be something I should worry about, or if I should continue to encourage her to seek help.  I'm thinking something of this magnitude might put strain on our relationship, especially in the future.  

Is this whole ordeal a big red flag?  I was really starting to see potential in this woman up until this point.  Now I'm just stunned and seriously thinking about the consequences that might arise from such a situation.  

TLDR:  Seeing a woman who didn't tell me how many partners she had until we got drunk and she told me it has been over 400 (maybe more).  Not sure if this is something I should worry about or not.

1332189217.0,108,self.relationships,r3ym1,My girlfriend thinks I took advantage of her.,y4w4w0rh7,126,18,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r3ym1/my_girlfriend_thinks_i_took_advantage_of_her/,"Hi r/relationships. I am really embarrassed about this whole incident and I have nobody to talk to about it (too ashamed to go to my friends/family), so I felt that I should let it out here.

**TL;DR:** I initiated sex with my gf, not realizing that she was falling asleep and drunk, and now she's making me feel like some kind of rapist for an honest misjudgement.

**Background info:** My gf and I have been in a relationship for over 2 years now. She is 21 and I am 22. We live nearly 2 hours away from each other now because I graduated from our college, and because we're both busy we only get to see each other one night a week. I have a relatively high sex drive, and hers is lower, but not to the point of me being unhappy.

**The issue:** On Saturday night we went to dinner and a movie, and then went back to her house where there was a little St. Patrick's Day party happening. My gf had a couple margaritas but she didn't even seem buzzed; I figured they were weak. I didn't have anything to drink. Later on that night we got into bed and made out a little, and then she pulled my penis out and jacked me off for a bit until I was rock hard and very horny. She then said that she was tired and asked me to play with her hair and rub her back. I took this as an innuendo, and rubbed her back for a bit, letting my hands wander closer and closer until I began massaging her breasts (this is how we usually initiate sex). She made some movements, which I thought were motions of pleasure, so I moved one of my hands down south and began rubbing. This is when she turned around and asked, ""Do you *always* want to have sex with me?"" I replied, ""Of course,"" and laughed because she knows that I love sex. I don't quite recall what she said after that, but the point was that she was actually really tired and just wanted me to play with her hair and put her to sleep. I did just that, and put my penis away because I knew I wasn't having sex that night. I fell asleep a while later.

She was really upset with me the next morning. She kept telling me that I took advantage of her, and I was completely blindsided by the accusation. I had no idea why the hell she would say that. Here's the text she sent me to explain: ""*I was falling asleep and I was drunk. I had no idea what was going on. I really don't appreciate you taking advantage and 'not knowing' I was asleep. Don't do that, I felt really wronged this morning. I don't know what to think or do. It's been on my mind all day.*""

I honestly had no idea that she was asleep or almost asleep (she had JUST been jacking me off!), and I did not know that she was drunk. She was definitely not acting drunk before, and it's usually very obvious. I am really weirded out by this whole thing. I apologized several times, and even though she now says that she forgives me, she's been acting very distant. I feel like in the back of her mind she really thinks that I was trying to creep on her while she was asleep/intoxicated. I would never ""take advantage"" of her, or anyone for that matter, and I am hurt and upset that she would actually question my character like that after 2 years of being with me and knowing that I'm demonstratively *not* a creep.

Any tips, comments, insults, or critiques would be appreciated.

**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for the replies. I am at work and I've literally gotten nothing done today, so I'm going to stop replying for a while so I can get some stuff done. Please keep the input coming, it has really really helped me process the situation and I feel a lot better already.

But this event has left me unsettled.

My BF and I have been together for two years. We are both in our early twenties and go to University together. About a week ago we were at a house party. I was reasonably drunk, but my boyfriend wasn't. At one point during the party I walked into a room and was promptly punched in the stomach by a guy I know for absolutely no reason. I found out later that apparently he has a habit of doing this ""playfully"" and accidentally hit me way too hard because he was extremely drunk.

The punch knocked the wind out of me and nearly brought me to my knees. It fucking hurt, even despite my inebriation. I went up to my boyfriend, dazed and a little in shock, and told him that I was just punched in the stomach, with tears in my eyes. He barely fucking reacted. It amounted to about ""Well, that sucks"". I don't expect him to confront the guy or anything, but some concern would have been nice. I dealt with the guy on my own (non-violently), and that was that.

Except a couple of days later we were talking to a mutual male friend and he mentioned the incident, saying if he had been there he would have beaten the shit out of the guy. My boyfriend then promptly said that he agreed, and if he had known it happened he would have shown the guy no mercy. Again, I didn't and don't want my boyfriend to get into a fight over me, especially when I was able to handle it on my own, but it really bothers me that he pulls this bullshit macho act in front of other guys when really, at the time, he gave less than a shit.

I'm not even really sure what I'm asking. It's difficult to talk to my friends about this because my friends are his friends and I don't want to talk bad about him. He's a good enough boyfriend otherwise, but it strikes me as off and the discord has been bothering me.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_n5mb5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5mb5/my_boyfriend_barely_reacted_when_i_got_punched_in/,

Ever.**

---

Okay so my sister and I are both in relationships that are over a year long, and both are in LDR (long distance relationships) so naturally when we see our SO's we kinda want to be intimate. However, my dad and his girlfriend believe that no one should touch us ever and even making out is a nono, let me repeat that, an 18 year old and a 17 year old can't make out with their SO, ever. We both have pretty much hinted to the fact that we kinda are drifting into sex by asking for birth control (a move I thought would look like I was trying to be responsible, guess I was wrong). My dad took us to the OBGYN but refused to get us birth control. 

Something my dad said the other day about sex and teens that really offended me was something along the lines of ""why don't guys just grab a pair of tits instead,"" which to me makes it sound like he thinks teen girls never want sex? 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I love my SO and have known him all my life and I know the risks and I WANT to take the necessary precautions and wear condoms and get an IUD and pull out. 

I also worry about my sister. Her SO seems to be questionable and I don't trust him in the STD department and I want to make sure she has condoms but I don't want my dad to flip out if he sees her with them. 

I'd like to add I never even have my boyfriend at my house, so my dad has only met the person I've been dating for over a year once. 

My dad's gf got pregnant at 16 banging her bf in a barn after her parents told her no sex, so you'd think that approach wouldn't work?

My dad knocked up my bio mom in their late teens, so same idea. 

Should I go against what my dad says and just go to PP by myself? Or am I just being a bratty horny teen?

He's a very outgoing, true-to-himself, social guy - which is great! Except that he doesn't seem to really be very aware of his surroundings and the people in it.  





He constantly interrupts, talks over people and makes everything about him. He's basically a big know-it-all. Like if someone is telling a story, he'll interrupt and talk about how the topic relates to him or he'll explain something he knows about in relation to the topic instead of just letting the person talk.  



For example, if someone was to tell a story about a helicopter, he would jump in and explain in detail how a helicopter works while the other person is trying to tell the story.    



Another big thing is that he also doesn't really respect people's property. For example, if someone has their phone on the table, he'll grab it without asking and start looking at it while asking the owner questions about it. It's not that he's being destructive or malicious, it's that he just grabs and touches things without asking.     



He's not doing it on purpose to be an ass, he's a genuinely good guy, I think he just doesn't realize how the way he acts is pretty annoying.       



  It can get really frustrating because, to be totally truthful, I find I'm on edge when we go out with other people because of how he dominates the conversation so much. I get really uncomfortable.  However, nobody has ever really commented on it, so maybe I'm the only one who takes issue with it?      



Am I being way too prissy about this and just let him be himself?

Obviously, this will be very biased but I will not leave anything out.

My girlfriend and I have only been together for about 3 months. She said that a doctor told her she was unable to have children. 7 weeks into the relationship, she gets pregnant. 

**Background on me**: My last relationship was 5 years ago when I was in the Marines. I was extremely unhappy and entered cognitive-behavioral therapy. I ended that relationship and decided to work on my own life and to only enter into a relationship if I really felt strongly for a girl. I have a B.S. in Psychology and am working on a 2nd degree. I’ve only had two jobs since high school and have never been unemployed. I live in a house by myself. I think that I’m a pretty happy guy these days.

**Background on her**: She didn’t finish highschool and had a serious drug abuse problem for quite a while, according to her. She injected a drug called “dilaudid.” Up until the pregnancy, she abused pain pills. She has had a poor job history (never a job longer than 3 or 4 months), but recently got a decent job. She doesn’t have a vehicle and lives with her brother and his gf. She describes herself as bipolar and has severe mood swings.

**Why I like her**: Despite all of this, she is extremely intelligent, very attractive, and very funny. Being intelligent and having a good sense of humor are the two most important things to me, and her combination of those is unlike anyone else’s whom I’ve ever met. We both laugh at each other’s jokes genuinely and very hard.

**What I believe the problem is**: She is extremely insecure and jealous. As soon as we officially became a couple, the cheating accusations began. Any comments on my Facebook from female friends made her very uncomfortable. Once I said that an actress on TV was hot, and she left.  I said “Hey, I’m running to Taco Bell, you’re not dressed so you don’t want to go, do you?”  She suggested that an attractive girl works there and that I want to go flirt with her. She eventually told me that she didn’t want me going to Taco Bell anymore. She tells me that she doesn’t want me to look at any porn. She won’t watch a movie with me if it has a nude scene with a girl in it – if it does, she covers my eyes. I can never go out for a drink with my friends. She asked me how many girls I’d slept with – I told her between 70-80, despite only having two girlfriends in the past, each for less than a year. It made her very uncomfortable – she told me (despite me not wanting to know) that she had only been with 10 guys, and they were mostly her boyfriends. She doesn’t want to have sex very much at all – maybe once a week. She won’t even take her shirt off when we do have sex, despite her being pretty thin.

The accusations like this are CONSTANT. Daily. She is so convinced that I will cheat on her and there is a confirmation bias because of it. Everything that happens, she concocts elaborate scenarios of how I possibly could have cheated in that scenario. I’ve never cheated on her. I’ve never thought about cheating on her. I haven’t done anything remotely suspicious. I haven’t lied to her. And, I have given her my full trust.  I don’t worry about her cheating on me and I don’t accuse her of anything.

I don’t try to fix her. I don’t tell her what her problems are. I don’t criticize her. I don’t try to “psychologize” her. The only real problem in the relationship is the unfounded cheating accusations. 

**My question**: Is there any hope for this relationship? I am not angry with her for all of this stuff. I see it as a fear of abandonment and severe trust issues. Despite her anger, I see a girl who is terrified. I want to make her comfortable with me and trust me. I’ve acquiesced to her demands in hope that maybe she will begin to trust me and a more loving relationship can develop. Now, with a baby on the way, I do not want to give up on this. When we were together, I told her I was happy about the baby, but I did suggest an abortion if we weren’t going to be together.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I have such good control over everything else in my life, but nothing I do in this situation works. Please, any advice would be appreciated. I know that I have been very stupid, and I probably deserve whatever bad happens to me. I’m not claiming to be right. I just want to make this work.

**tl:dr – Girlfriend got pregnant early in relationship. Constantly accuses me of cheating and places absurd “restrictions” on me like no watching movies with nudity and no talking to female friends.

edit: I think it's important to add that I used to be exactly like her. 5 years ago, before I entered therapy and before I studied psychology, I was just as bad. But, through therapy and a lot of effort on my own, I changed. I beat my depression and anxiety and have been mostly happy ever since.

We've been discussing engagement for the past few months. I brought up engagement first and it's something that I want very much. However, we have very different ideas as to when we want it to happen.

Here's some background: 

I graduated college in 2011 with about $60,000 in student loans, which is split is split about 50/50 between private and federal. I have a very good job ($50K+ base salary) but I'm living with my parents due to my debt load. However, I'm paying off my loans very aggressively. About 2/3rds of my take home pay goes towards paying off my loans each month. At my current rate, I should be debt-free in 2-3 years.

My girlfriend attended art school for two years and then was forced to drop out due to her co-signer bailing on her. In those two years, she racked up about $70,000 in student loan debt, all of which is private. She took a hiatus from school for about two years and is now attending a public university with the goal of getting into the nursing program and become a nurse. During this time, she is accruing more educational debt, but at a much slower rate. She'll be 24 next year, so she's be able to file as independent on her FAFSA and receive much more financial aid. She also still lives with her parents and they are making her loan payments. She's doing well in school, but has effectively had to start over from square one. She will not be graduating until at least 2015 or 2016.

We've made plans to move in with each other once I've paid off enough of my loans that I can afford to pay the rent and other living expenses by myself and she'd be living with me rent-free. I want to do this because I want to give to her what my parents are giving to me, which is an opportunity to live rent-free while aggressively paying off debt.

She and I want to get engaged, but disagree of when we want that to happen. I want it to happen once we're in a more stable financial situation. At the very least, I want to be sure that I've made a lot of progress on my loans and that she's accepted into the nursing program and doing well before making that commitment. I would be more comfortable if we waited until things are even more stable and she's got a good job and is able to pay off her debt by herself. She tells me that I'm being selfish and self-centered for wanting to wait until we're both in more stable and independent financial situations before getting engaged. She wants to get engaged soon, much sooner than it would take for us to be in a stable financial situation. She tells me that I'm too concerned about money and that if I feel this way that my love for her is conditional on her getting a good job. I don't feel that way at all. I love her very much and I want to help her to be successful and I want to get engaged. It's simply a matter of when. Am I being selfish for wanting to wait until she's at least accepted into the nursing program and performing well or even waiting until she graduates and has a nursing job to get engaged?

My gf is out of the city for a few months but I am going to visit her next week.  I told her how much I wanted to see batman with her because we both love the movie and thought it would be cool if we both waited to see it together.  She told me she wants to see it opening weekend and wants to see it with her sister.  Fine.

Few weeks later I find out another dude got tickets and they are seeing the show together at 3am.  Nobody else, just the two of them.

I'm pretty upset but she thinks nothing is wrong here.  Am I the bad guy for not being cool about it?  She just has to wait a week to see it with me.  Instead she is going with another guy friend at 3am and watching it with him instead.

She thinks she is doing absolutely nothing wrong and I should be cool instead of upset... am I wrong?

Also don't bother writing about she is cheating, blah blah blah.  That isn't part of this scenario in anyway.  She is going with a friend who I can 100% certain nothing is going on.  I just rather she watched the movie with me instead of him.

I am 26 she is 24.  We have be together over 3 years and lived together 1 year.

td;lr girlfriend is seeing batman tonight with another guy at 3am instead of waiting one week to see it with me next weekend.  She thinks there is no problem with this and I shouldn't be upset.


**EDIT:** THANKS.  We just talked again and I sorted it out. The mature/immature thing really stuck out for me. I just told her F it. If we can have a good time next weekend then that'll be fine.  She is going to set up some cool things to check out and that should be nice. I guess she wins these things most of the time but really its just a movie. It definitely spills into more serious things but for this I figure I should just let it go. Fuck it. Thanks reddit for all the good advice around here. Helped me get it all out!

When I told her this she almost cried because she said that's exactly what she wanted to hear. She does try a lot in other ways. Just different than what I expect. I guess that's how it goes.

**Let's move on now, thanks!**

He went out of town the other night with a friend (whom I really dont approve of) and ended up having to stay the night out there. They stayed with this guy the friend met out there last time he visited. I was out drinking with one of my friends at home, he called me a few times, I answered for one incoherently- but I do remember him telling me some guy just tried to make out with him, but didn't really put too much worry into it in the state I was in.

He calls me early the next morning and tells me he woke up in this guys bed naked and doesn't remember anything. I immediately leave to go get him given that where he was is only an hour away. He seemed shaken up but from what I could tell was handling it much better than I had expected. I took the day off work and tried to surround with all the love and support I could- he didn't really want to talk about it, and I was having a hard time wrapping my head around it as well.

As the day continued he seemed alright, but at night he really became uneasy and started looking through his phone trying to draw up a timeline and talking with the friend he went with. He thinks that he passed out/blacked out shortly after his phone call to me. His so-called friend was intoxicated (they had all been drinking) and went to vomit then doesn't recall what happened. Only my BF was drinking the booze the guy kept handing him and thats how he thinks he was drugged. 

He feels extremely violated and I can tell that he is struggling trying to cope with this. He is very reserved, and even has a hard time sharing his feelings with me, so I dont know what to do. I feel so guilty that I wasn't there and I feel helpless toward helping him. 

I don't know how to be there for him. I don't know how to make him feel like it wasn't his fault. I only know how to show him love and support and I just dont feel like it is enough. 

TL;DR- Bf was out of town staying with acquaintance of the friend he went with and was drugged and sexually assaulted buy the acquaintance. I could really use some advice on how to be there for him.

EDIT: AS OF RIGHT NOW, FILING A REPORT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. PLEASE STOP SUGGESTING THAT IT IS HIS ""MORAL OBLIGATION""- THAT MAY BE, BUT THEN HE WOULD BE FORCED TO RELIVE IT FOR YEARS UNTIL TRIAL, WHICH WOULD MOST LIKELY RESORT IN SOME BULLSHIT SENTENCE OR A SLAP ON THE WRIST- NOT WORTH IT.

1376248338.0,109,self.relationships,1k5pgi,My (19f) best friend (20m) is trying to force me into ending my 3 year relationship with my boyfriend (20m) because he watches porn.,BlankCarrots,148,39,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k5pgi/my_19f_best_friend_20m_is_trying_to_force_me_into/,"Well, the title says it all. I love them both, I have known my best friend *rob* for 10 years, and my boyfriend *Harry* for 4. I've grown up with Rob, and we've always been close, but i've never had feelings for him, ever. Which Harry knows, and is fine with us spending time together, although we have established boundaries with how close we get (hugging, kissing, cuddling), which I am also fine with. I'm in love with Harry, so I wouldn't do anything he isn't comfortable with. 

The porn side, I knew about. About 4 months into out relationship, I saw porn on Harrys browser history (I typed reddit, it bought up redtube in suggestions) Harry tried to play it off as a mistake, but I told him I didn't care if he watches porn, it didn't bother me as long as he didn't take it further than that. It's never been an issue whilst we've been together, until now.

By what I gather, the guys were together and discussing their ladies. Rob isn't with anyone, but he decides to involve himself by bragging ""at least I can watch porn and jerk it"". Harry has never been a fan of Rob, but has never let it affect our relationship. But (Harry told me all of this) Rob had apparently been really grinding on him all night, saying that ""it's hard to get a relationship closer than us (me and him) and Harry was pissed. So he said ""so can I, and I get an awesome relationship too, so whatever."" 

This apparently has sparked some outrage, Rob didn't think I knew about Harry watching porn (and masturbating to it), so decided to 'drop him in it' by telling me. He's now trying to force me into ending my relationship, which I am not by any means. But will I be able to keep them both? Rob says that if I could be so stupid to stay in an ""unfaithful relationship"" then he can't fathom our friendship continuing. I don't want to lose such a good friend, but is it selfish of me to prioritize my relationship over a 10 year friendship?

tl;dr. My ""best friend"" has been a dick to my boyfriend, riled him up and is trying to force me to end our relationship because ""he's cheating by watching porn"". Says he's going to end our friendship if I don't end my relationship.

Edit: I'm going to phone Rob and tell him that what he's doing is crappy. Hopefully he'll get his shit together and realize that he's not being a good friend.

Update?: I phoned him, he seemed really happy I did, because we haven't spoke in a while. He told me he missed me,  and that he was hoping to hear from me. This was our conversation (ish)

Me: Look, i've not phoned you to have a chat, i've phoned you cause i'm still peeved about what you did to Harry. You thought you were chucking him under the bus and i'd be mad, but I thought you of all people would know our relationship is better than that. I've never had a problem with him watching porn, and that's the end of that. I'm not discussing it further. As for you wanting to end our friendship, if that is how you feel, then you do what you have to. At the end of the day, I love Harry, and I love you. The only difference is, I love you like a friend. Any feelings you have for me, friendship or otherwise, is just that. Feelings. I think we need some distance, I want my relationship with Harry to work, and if you don't, then you're not as good a friend as I thought you were.

He started shouting ""Is this what you think this is? I just didn't want you to be taken for a fucking mug, but apparently that means i'm in love with you? Just in case you were wondering, i'm with *Jasmine* from uni, so you can get that idea out your head. I don't give a shit about your relationship, i'm just sick of that prick Harry thinking he can do whatever the fuck he wants. He's an arsehole, I don't see why you'd want to be with that bastard anyway""

Me (got pretty pissed at this point): ""Funny how you only tell me that now! I was trying to be nice, but you can fuck off. I want to be with Harry, and you're acting like a jealous prick, I never gave you any signals that we'd be any more than friends, so there's no reason for you to care if I was with an arsehole or not!"" 

Then I hung up. He tried to ring back, but I ignored him. I'm so pissed I can't even explain. 

Edit 2: I can't believe how stupid i've been. I think I need to end my friendship with Rob, i'm going to phone Harry and let him know how I feel, and how sorry I am for being a fucking idiot.

Update 2: I phoned Harry, told him everything. I basically said i'm sick of being manipulated by Rob, and i'm putting our relationship first. Harry nearly started crying, saying he was so happy to hear me say that, and it was what he wanted all along but he didn't want me to resent him for doing exactly what Rob is doing right now. Lots of mushy crap ensued. 

I then texted Rob, because I don't want a shouting match, I don't want him manipulating me. I said:

""I'm sorry that a 10 year friendship had to end this way, but this is your doing. Your manipulating could have cost me my relationship if me and Harry weren't stronger. In the end, it's my fault for letting it get this far, and i'm sorry. But I choose my happiness over your petty jealousy, and a friendship that wasn't really a friendship. I hope you find what you're looking for."" He's tried to ring me a few times, but i've rejected them all so he knows i'm not prepared to hear what he has to say. I'll see Harry in the morning so we can have a proper chat. I'm crying, i'm shaking, and I feel sick. I can't believe I never realized how badly he treated me, and Harry for that matter. Thank you for making me realize how shitty i've been for letting him do this to us.

---

Thanks for all the advice you guys gave me last time- there were some really good suggestions given, and I actually brought up many of those points when I spoke with my husband. 


Summary of previous post: Last week, my husband received an email from his dad. The email said that my FIL and MIL had decided that they were going to come and visit us for 10 days, because they couldn't wait any longer to see their son. A direct quote from the email, after stating that they are visiting, is: ""No approvals needed, no denials accepted"". 


I was really angry about the situation- I felt like they were overstepping their boundaries, and my husband seemed apathetic. I gave my husband a couple of days to think about what he wanted to do, and gave myself a couple of days to cool down, and then I talked to him again. He actually was pretty receptive, and we had a good conversation. We both agreed that he would talk to his parents, and discuss appropriate boundaries. We wouldn't ask them to stay in a hotel (because they can't afford it), but would tell them that they will need to respect our need for privacy and alone time, should we ask.


What's happening now: He skyped with his parents on Saturday (alone because I was out of town). He said that it went well, and they seemed like they understood. After he spoke with them, I sent them both a follow-up text that Saturday night, letting them know that during the ten days they will be visiting 1) We will be away for one full day, as we had already made plans to celebrate our wedding anniversary 2) A friend of mine will likely be dropping in from out of town, and might be with us for a day or two and 3) I asked them to leave their handguns behind (This is a personal preference of mine- 6 months ago they both bought handguns for the first time, and have decided that they only feel safe when sleeping next to their guns- I do not feel comfortable with that in my house, so I asked that they leave the guns behind).  


I honestly wasn't trying to be antagonistic- I just wanted to be very clear with them upfront, so there were no surprises when they arrived. I didn't want them to make conflicting plans, and end up disappointed. I sent a text because I was out of the country and didn't have access to wifi and couldn't call. 


I didn't receive any response from them Saturday or Sunday (unusual because they are always quick at answering). Then yesterday (Monday), my husband texts me to tell me that he got a text from them saying that they loved him and missed him, but that they were not going to visit us any more. No explanation- just that they were not longer coming (despite the fact that they have booked their vacation time, and bought a flight ticket for my MIL's return home). When he asked why, they said that they would talk to both him and me over skype. Well, my husband has a super busy week, and doesn't have the time to have another lengthy discussion- and they had planned on driving down here June 30. So I told him I would talk with them and try to smooth things over before then, because at the end of the day, it would be nice for him to see them, and I don't want him to miss out on family time because of petty drama that I may or may not have caused.


So, I texted them immediately (Monday) and told them that I wasn't sure what was going on, but that I would love to talk with them, and listen to what they had to say. I told them that I'd be back in the states today (Tuesday) and asked them to let me know a couple of times that might work to Skype. No answer- instead, my FIL texts my husband (as a response to my text?), and tells him that they will not answer any texts, and will only communicate via Skype. 


So I played dumb, and sent them another text today, saying ""I didn't hear back from either of you, so I think my last text probably didn't go through. [Husband] is busy all week- do you have time to skype with me today?"" A few hours later, I get a text from my MIL saying they will skype when my husband is able. I responded saying ""I just asked because between both of our schedules, we won't be able to skype with you until this weekend- and if you canceled your plans because of something I said, I want you to know that I'm available to talk before then"". No answer. I know that they've checked their phones, because they sent my husband a text after that saying they were thinking of him.


It's frustrating, because this still boils down to the same issue- a huge lack of appropriate communication. The one positive note is that at least my husband and I are on the same page finally. He is really embarrassed by how his parents are acting, and has said that unless they have some legitimate reason (ie: their car broke down), he has nothing to say to them. 


So now it looks like they are no longer coming- and I do feel guilty for causing tension between my husband and his parents. Part of me wishes I just kept my mouth shut, and just gone with it and then there would have been no drama to deal with (ridiculous, unnecessary drama at that), while the other part feels like if I didn't say anything, they would have continued to overstep their boundaries and I would have gone crazy. 


So as of now, they are not visiting, my husband has no desire to talk with them, and I guess I'll stop asking them if they want to talk with me.

I face one of the classic guy problems: should I go ahead and tell her how I feel or not?,cognitivelydeparted1,176,73,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1evjk4/im_a_male_18_and_ive_been_friends_with_a_female/,"   I'm a male (18) who's a senior in high school and there's this girl (18) I think I'm in love with and I've had some serious conflict in my head about this. I have no idea what to do and I need the collective wisdom of reddit users. So here's my story:
   In the fall of 2011 I met this girl though my friend and we found out we were taking several classes together that year. We had known each other for several years before that, but we'd never really gotten to know each other well. Anyway, we were both taking the same Calc. class and I was really good at it, but she had a little bit more trouble with it than I did. Don't get the wrong impression though - this girl is really smart, she got a 5 on the AP Calc. exam later that year - but she the concepts didn't come quite as fast for her as they did for me. So, I agreed to help her out at her house whenever she needed it. 
     At first, she would just call me with some problems she had doing and I would help her over the phone; however this progressed further and I ended up going to her house frequently to help her. At this point we were still just friends but this ended up changing by the early winter of 2012. I had developed some strong feelings for her but I couldn't tell her. Although I didn't tell her I couldn't contain my feelings completely for her - I would end up getting jealous whenever I perceived her flirting with other guys. I would often end up getting mad at her for trivial reasons because of my jealousy and we wouldn't talk for like a week but after the week we would end up interacting with each other like best friends. 
   It is worth stopping here and noting that she and I are very much the same personality, she's more extroverted than me but we have the same humor and she's very intelligent. Sometimes we give each other these looks that are like a secret language of their own. Anyway, we had these periods where we were like best friends almost like we were a couple: for instance it would be just the two of us on a run or us walking back to her house and we would just talk about anything that came to mind. But there would also be these dark periods where we wouldn't talk to each other - we would act like the other didn't exist. Anyway by March 2012, I basically told her I didn't want to be friends anymore because I didn't feel like she valued me. We weren't friends for about a month after that, but once again we were drawn back to each other. I left during May for a volunteer project and I returned in August. She told me that she really missed me over the summer and we became great friends again. Anyway, we once again had these periods where I thought for sure that we would be together and we also had these dark periods where we wouldn't talk. I'm a runner and I was injured for most of the winter of 2012-2013 when I finally came back she told me how much she missed me not running. 
   Finally, we come to the present: we're both seniors about to graduate high school. She's staying in my hometown for college and I'm going to a school about 3 hrs away. Here's my conundrum: Should I tell her how I feel, or whether I should just let it go? Sometimes we get along so well that I think we'll end up together, yet sometimes I think she just craves the attention. I don't want to regret not telling her, yet I don't want to feel the pain if she rejects me. BTW I don't tend to do this kind of stuff (partly because of a high school culture that emphasizes getting laid over emotional attachments), but I made an exception because she's so important to me and I think I love her. Any advice will be much appreciated!

Basically, the boyfriend[22M] and I[22F] had a pretty intense talk a little while ago. He admitted to feeling that well-known ""am I missing out on anything?"" angst that so many people seem to get towards the end of college, particularly if they have a history of exclusive relationships. I admitted to wanting to be grounded and much more defined in terms of how exclusive our relationship is and what is/is not acceptable when it comes to other people. It was a pretty emotional conversation, because I was afraid he'd end up choosing the carefree single life (or what he imagined it would be) over me.


BUT. We ended in a good place. He explained that although he had these feelings of lust for other women - which a commenter on my previous thread pointed out, very nicely - that didn't mean he didn't love me, and ultimately, I ""always, always, always come first."" So we've ironed out what I'm not comfortable with, and he's promised to keep being open and honest with me about these things as well as to reign it in with the other girl.

Well, I just spoke to the girl I've been having issues with. The short story is that she's no longer my girlfriend. The long story is as follows.

We met in person, and I went in with an attitude that's rather hard to explain. I knew that the end of the relationship was inevitable. I just had to constantly justify that fact to myself. Thinking back now, it's incredible the case of oneitis I was plagued with. Anyway, I started the conversation. I told her that I felt disrespected, lied to. I told her that she's welcome to do what she needs to do or think about what she needs to think about, but that I'm not waiting for her. I can't do that to her, but most importantly I can't do that to myself. I'm no one's back-up guy. I told she was either in or she was out. There is no in between. Then I let her speak.

She explained to me that the ""feeling"" she felt was not related to the guy who kissed her. In fact, her feelings weren't related to anybody except herself. (On a side note, it turns out the guy who kissed her was actually an entirely *different* person than who I thought, someone who she really didn't necessarily have feelings for). Rather, someone kissing her (who wasn't me) made her realize that perhaps she wasn't ready for a long term relationship, or at least not as ready as she had previously thought. She told me ""You [me] love with your whole heart, and give 4000%,"" and that she doesn't think she's ready to do the same. She also said that I was ""too good for her.""

Apparently, the issue came down to recognizing the difference between what she thinks she wants versus what she knows she wants. Rationally, she told me, there was no question. I had been an ""amazing boyfriend"" and had ""treated her better than anyone had ever treated her"" (her words). Common sense dictated that our level of compatibility (emotionally, sexually, etc) should lead to a relationship.  When feelings are involved, however, she can't reconcile the disparity between common sense and her emotions.

I told her again that I can't wait around for her to decide what she wants out of a relationship, and that I'd drop off her stuff on Monday. We left it at that. It was relatively amicable. At this point, I've assured myself that this was the right decision. My choice was for the best. Clearly, this girl has a lot of personal issues to work out. I can respect that. She's young, and probably still has a lot of difficulty understanding her emotions. I'm happy she's one step closer to finding out what she wants out of life.

With regard to the relationship, I'm glad it happened. It was a ton of fun, and the sex was great. I'm almost tempted to keep in contact with her just so we can maintain a FWB relationship. But then I slap myself, realize that that's probably a really terrible idea, and acknowledge the fact that I'm just a horny 20-year-old guy. Damn... I can't believe I'm now considering this. Thoughts?

As for me, I'm going to take the opportunity to live a little more and care a little less. I'm a college student, and I have a lot of life ahead of me. I guess this relationship was a learning experience. From it I've learned a little bit more about myself, about other people, and about what it truly means to be in a long term relationship. Time to move on .

I walked away with my dignity intact, my head held high, and hope for the future. And to all the people who commented on my first post, THANKS! You all made me see this situation from perspectives I likely would not have considered otherwise.

Peace.

1354646467.0,108,self.relationships,149uw2,I think my girlfriend (F21) is jealous of my (M23) sister (F23).  Need advice,brecklesup,128,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/149uw2/i_think_my_girlfriend_f21_is_jealous_of_my_m23/,"My gf and I have been dating for a year, known each other for about three.  She is really great, everything I want in a girlfriend (smart, motivated, funny, cute etc).  We have tons of fun together and hang out a lot.  But lately she's been acting really weird and I don't know how to talk to her about it. 

My twin sister recently came back from studying/working abroad, and I've been hanging out with her a lot (both with and without my girlfriend.)  We've always been really close, and also we have a lot of mutual interests that my girlfriend doesn't share (video games, rock climbing), so now that she's back we've been spending a fair amount of time together.  Anyway, my gf for some reason isn't okay with this.  I ALWAYS invite her to come, but she usually says no.  Which is fine, but then she'll act cold towards me and like I'm abandoning her.  

Additionally, I always thought gf and sister would get along really well (they actually met a few times before we were dating and hit it off, or so I thought) but now it seems like gf has no interest whatsoever in hanging out with her. The few times we have hung out together, gf has been kind of sullen and unwilling to engage with the conversation/activities.  And I don't think it's because she felt left out of our twin-ship (for lack of a better word) because the most prominent time was in a large group and usually she is very outgoing and usually totally fine hanging out in big groups.  

Whenever we hung out together, I felt like she was kind of mad every time I talked/laughed with my sister.  Afterwards she would be cold/unwilling to talk for a few hours or until the next day.  When I tried to talk to her about it, I straight up asked if she felt left out or if she was jealous of my relationship with my sister, but she brushed it off and said she had just been feeling awkward and it was nbd.

However it's still happening, and recently my sister said something to me about it (""Does Amanda not like me or something?"") after we were all supposed to go to a party together and my gf bailed at the last second.  She tried to get me to stay home too, but I really wanted to go since I had helped plan it.  

And last night was the most ""what the fuck"" moment so far -- I was looking at pictures on FB from my sister's trip to Dublin and gf asked if I thought my sister was prettier than her.  My goddamn TWIN SISTER, who looks exactly like me except girlier.  I still can't believe she asked that.  I had no idea what to say and unfortunately got kind of mad (didn't yell or anything, but said like ""what the hell are you talking about, she's my sister, why would you ask something like that"" etc) and she apologized but now she hasn't talked to me all day.  Also, she's never really had an issue with jealousy about other girls/porn/anything like that.  

It makes no sense.  I am not sure what's going on or how to talk about it with her without it being weird/awkward.  How should I approach this?  I love this girl, but stuff is getting bizarre and it's causing a lot of unnecessary tension between us.  Why is she acting this way?

**TL;Dr -- Otherwise perfect GF seems jealous of / threatened by my sister but won't talk about it with me**

EDIT: Thank you so, so much for all of these awesome replies (especially Exis007, but all of you!)  I called her last night and asked her out to dinner tonight (she has a big project to work on so she is not free before then).  I am going to try my damndest to follow your advice and let her know that I am always here for her, no matter what, and she can talk to me about anything.

* Either he would see it as really sweet and want to do it
* Or he'd think it were really sweet, but not something he wants to do

I did not expect to end the conversation embarrassed and feeling stupid for bringing it up. He doesn't get Reddit, and I never even mentioned Reddit or my post from earlier but he said, ""Did you get this wild idea from Reddit?"" I told him it was my idea, but I asked you guys about it and he said you guys know nothing about our relationship (which is true) and I probably didn't give the whole story, which I did. I don't think he got what I was saying - he kept telling me he didn't want to get married yet and she wouldn't want us to get married for her. 

He also brought up that I've been talking a lot about ""family"" stuff ever since my friend had a baby and it's not something he's ready for. I haven't been this humiliated in a long time. 

I busted up crying, not able to hold in my emotions, and he claims he knows this idea that I came up with wasn't for my benefit, and that it was my way of trying to help him and make him feel better about the situation. He said it was really sweet, but a really bad idea. 

Sorry guys, no pics in the near future. Thank you for your input last night, and thank you for making me feel like I wasn't crazy and juvenile for thinking it was a good idea.

Ive been with my fiance for 3 years he 28 me 28 and got engaged last month (he asked me).  Ive always known he had issues about his ex but hes always reassured me that hes moved on.  

In the beginning she was all he talked about, usually saying how horrible she was and how badly she treated him. Examples would be, if i did something nice for him, he would say ""Wow Ex would never do that""  at first it made me feel good but then i started to get sick of hearing her name.  I asked him about her and he said that she had totally messed his head up when he found out that she had been cheating on him.  He had only just moved in with her when he found out she was sleeping with a mutual friend.
I told him that he needs to forgive her so that he can let it go and be happy with me. 

Problem is although ive been very supportive to him through this its been eating away at me.  As a woman he supposedly wants to marry should he really still have his ex in his head so much. I got suspicious and checked his p.c  He has pictures of this ex some taken when they were together and some profile pictures that were taken since they split up. The pictures were in a folder filled with porn stars pictures so its obvious to me this is his 'man time' file. 
She is very different to me, i am very tall and dark and slim, she is short dark with huge boobs. Now im wondering if this is his prefered body shape and i am so hurt.
I think this is a really strange thing to do and im sure it means the end of our relationship. i havent spoken to him about this yet but i know he knows somethings up. 
my head is spinning with thoughts like
Does he wish i was her?
Does he think of her when hes with me?
would he go running back if she gets in touch?
why keep pictures of someone who hurt him?
will he ever get over her?
or is this normal?
I posted this question on an advice forum and got lots of responses saying to dump him and that he will cheat on me with her. But nearly all of them were women lol im hoping for some mens input 
SUMMARY:Me 28 him 28 FIANCE ISN'T OVER HIS EX. WHAT DO I DO?

**UPDATE** I spole to him a couple of times over the weekend (on the phone as im away) He admitted he used the pictures to masturbate to. He didnt think it was healthy and agrees its a problem
He couldnt really explain why he did this only that its a sexy memory. He doesnt bother with porn anymore becuase hes watched it too much and it doesnt feel real. I asked him where he got the pictures from and he said some she had sent him when they were together and others hed gotten off her facebook page while weve been together. I asked him why he would be on her page and he sys he was just curious. I think he isnt over her why would he care what shes up to now. This has happened on nights ive been out with friends or away with work, so now everytime i leave the house ill be thinking thats what hes doing. 
Thankyou so much for all of your comments, im going to put the wedding on hold because i cant commit to marry him while i dont feel like hes fully commited to me. Im nearly home now and i dont know if he will be in or not but i dont know how im not going to go searching through his pc. My head is full of questions and now im thinking what if hes been in touch with her?
Ive always known he wasnt over her but hes told me he wants to be so ive supported him. Now i feel that has been thrown back in my face cos whats the point in me helping him to get over her when hes not helping himself",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1349688708.0,,,True,t3_1121vp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1121vp/now_i_know_my_fiance_isnt_over_his_ex/,

**TL:DR** My gf has been chatting to a guy, a lot, and hiding it on occasion (see chat log below)

A quick background. We have had ups and downs, especially lately, we haven't been as close and we having problems and small fights. My girlfriend (call her An) has always been a bit insecure and finds it hard to trust as a result she can get very protective and a bit jealous/paranoid, she doesn't like me talking to girls to the point where it can cause a big fight at times. She thinks I don't see what girls are like and im gullible and could easily led on, Which is true to the extend that i do find it hard to read people intentions but isnt she supposed to trust me and not what another person thinks?

I've never cheated on her, though in the past ive not told her things straight away (like talking to a female class mate, etc) because of they way she can react ive never done anything bad. That said we were pretty good and until recently (maybe a bit more than recent, past year'ish) we were great and she is, with exception of her insecurity's (which can lead her down a pretty dark road at times) a very good person.

Well shes has been talking to a guy recently (she has a few friends a couple of whom are guys, which kind annoys me only because of how she doesn't like me talking to girls), I was fine with this at first, I trust her, It just seamed like she was friends with this guy, she said he doesn't have a lot of friends and they get on well. They talked about meeting and Am had said to me that if they ever did meet I would come too.

However recently she has been hiding her conversations with this guy. For example I would come to bed and she would move her laptop out of my field of vision. She's been spending a lot more time talking to him, and being more and more protective over her laptop, despite the fact ive never really went to look she would hide or protect what she was talking to him about even if i came over (though not always).

The thing i did next was something I hate, after having this go on for a while now and asking her basically if she was doing anything wrong (which she said no) i looked at her chat logs, i knew exactly what I was looking for, and found it :(

These are a few snippets from one (much larger) conversation last week.

&gt; him: on the subject of longer, maybe you'l wish my dick was longer when you see it heh heh

&gt; her: lol

&gt; her: ud totally just let me undress u wouldnt u :P

&gt; him: uhmm probably :D

&gt; her: :D

&gt; her: then i might :;)

&gt; him: so really is it that it?

&gt; him: we wil probably end up together and so much more?

&gt; her: yup :)

&gt; her: if u want me , i mean im abit crazy when it comes to girls coming near my 'guy'

&gt; her: llol

&gt; him: yeah I kknow :D

&gt; [...]

&gt; her: and well yeah a baby would be nice and well alot of people i no getting engaged married pregnant and having babys and well im stuck here with this dick of a bf and going nowhere fast

&gt; [...]

&gt; him: how badly you want to fuck me?

&gt; her: oh i want to , how badly do u want to fuck me?

&gt; him: very badly :)


This seams only recent, and thing is I thought we were getting a little better, fewer arguments, more affection. Though we still have been a bit rough we were better.

I'm not one to go through peoples stuff I regard privacy highly, I kind of hate myself for looking though her logs but I didn't expect this :( I thought id find nothing or just a little inappropriate talk on his part but not this.

It sounds stupid but what on Earth do I do?

1375967201.0,101,self.relationships,1jybik,"UPDATE: After years of emotional abuse from my[20s] mom [50s], I fear my relationship with my father is done for [50s]",throwawaymyparents,137,36,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jybik/update_after_years_of_emotional_abuse_from_my20s/,"My [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1juy9k/after_years_of_emotional_abuse_from_my20s_mom_50s/) didn't really get much attention but I figured I'd do a little update anyway. 

**Recap:** My dad[55] is in an emotionally abusive marriage with his wife [56] where we were both affected. I luckily am now for the most part on my[21] own minus finances but he has become a shell of who he used to be. My dad curses at me, barely speaks to me, barely spends time with me, tunes me out after a few seconds of talking, gets extremely overwhelmed by me if I want to spend time with him, he hangs up on me, and gives me the impression that what I say isn't important and that I am no longer a top priority in his life. He's overweight and unhappy and sleeps in separate bedrooms from his wife and uses work as a form as escapism. 

**The Good:**

I made my dad come to therapy with me and I voiced my concerns with our relationship. He is going to try to work on the cursing since the therapist says it is a form of emotional abuse and highly inappropriate to do to his daughter. He was embarrassed by it and will try to be more careful about it. He cursed after we left but not to me...but she wants him to stop completely. She also wants him to stop crossing boundaries, because when we do actually have a conversation he wants too many personal details like about my relationship with my boyfriend. 

**The Bad:**

I discussed this in therapy last week but we covered so much we didn't discuss it this week. My dad had a past of finding an excuse to drink alcohol with his sleeping pills to get more drunk back when the marriage was at it's worst and he felt like he couldn't leave. It was scary and we banned alcohol from the house. Now, he lied to his psychiatrist to get 2 different types of pills that he's not supposed to take at the same time. He combines them twice a week as his ritual but the reality is he knocks out instantly and naturally on his own. He's convinced himself he needs it but purposely stays awake to get a high. He denies it of course but it's scary to see how delusional he gets from combining two different pills. He begs for alcohol when he takes them as well. I'm afraid one day he'll sneak some liquor home and take pills with it. He doesn't think this is a problem and his wife isn't all that concerned. How can I get through to him?

**TL;DR** Went to therapy with dad. He's going to try to curse less at me and respect boundaries and spend more time with me. He is abusing2 different types of pills he uses for ""sleeping"" but gets a weird high from it to cope with his life.

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 happy years. We're so in love and want to spend the rest of our lives together. But recently we hit a pretty big speed bump.

My boyfriend and I were at a friend's party a couple weekends ago. My friend (let's call her E) has known both of us for about 7 years now and is one of my best friends. 

A couple hours in, I was talking to a group of people and noticed my boyfriend and E with their arms around each other's waists talking to another group. I felt a sting of jealousy, since in the past my boyfriend has hit on E a couple of times right in front of me. But I shrugged it off, figuring I should just trust and they were with a group anyway.

I was pretty drunk a few hours in. I get emotional when I reach a certain level of drunk, so I went to my friend's room for some quiet time since I could feel the emotions kicking in. Some time went by (not sure how much) and my friend H came in to console me. Some more time went by, and my boyfriend came in and told me he'd just kissed E. 

The next part is a bit hazy, but I was very angry and yelled a lot. I even managed to punch him in the jaw. E came in and told me that it was just a peck and meant nothing. I was angry and I know I said some hurtful things to her. My boyfriend got us a cab and we went home.

My boyfriend and I talked the next day. He said he was so sorry and felt guilty, and said he hated himself for hurting me. I told him I had heard it all the last couple of times he hit on E, and that I wasn't sure I could trust him anymore. 

We both really want to be together and we're working things out. 

My dilemma: I love my boyfriend with everything I've got, and I know he loves me just as much. But he has a problem controlling himself with E, having hit on her twice (that I know of) and kissed her. I think it's really important that he told me right away, but I can't stop picturing him kissing her. I need your help, Reddit. How can I trust my boyfriend again? Or am I just stupid for trying?

Edit: This girl E flirts with everyone equally, myself included.

Should I ride this out or be proactive?,MindMyOwnB,124,20,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fcghw/i_30m_work_with_a_flirtatiouspromiscuous_young/,"This gets a little complicated.

I work at a small business that has had an almost exclusive male employee roster for the two years I've been here. Our HR woman, a middle aged no-nonsense type has been the only female of our 13 person team in all the time I've been here. That changed earlier this year when the owner's daughter was hired to work in sales in the front office.

From the very start she has been extremely unprofessional: flirtatious with every guy there, dressing in insanely short skirts and other unprofessional type outfits, etc. In fact the HR woman, rumor has it, had to sit her down eventually and inform her that she was on probation after multiple warnings for being in the back warehouse too much (her sales position doesn't require going there very often) and for her choice of attire. 

Obviously this had nothing to do with me. I have a live-in girlfriend whom I love and so everytime she did her flirty thing with me I always just ignored her and stuck to my work. Eventually she gave up on me which was fine by me. Didn't want to anger the owner's daughter but there was no way I was flirting back with her.

A little while back I was on facebook at home one night when I saw that she had posted a status that read, ""6 down, 6 to go! ;)"". She always writes vague comments like that but earlier that day in the breakroom she had been blathering on to a few of us about some new diet she was on. All the guys were saying she didn't need to lose weight, which she doesn't, I think she was just mining for compliments. But, I figured, if she'd lost half of her 12lbs goal for her diet, well, I might as well say congratulations. Keep in mind the other people who had commented had said things like ""u go girl!"" and ""keep it up I know you can do it!"". I felt for sure this meant she was posting about the progress of her diet.

The next day at work for the first time in months she was super flirty with me again. As always I just smiled politely and kept working until she finally whispered ""Why did you ignore my chat message last night?"". I told her I hadn't seen it but would check it out when I got home.

The chat she had sent basically said: ""lol I didn't know you knew! Who told you? It's okay you don't have to answer that. Do you want to be next?""

Confused as hell I wrote back a short: ""No thanks I'm happy with my current routine but  thanks for the offer"". I was referring to my own exercise/diet routine of course. 

A while later she wrote back: ""Are you sure? I'm more than willing to and we can just do it once. I want to win this bet so bad lol""

Me: ""What bet?""

Her: ""You know, 12/12 by January. :)""

Well the confusion went on until she made it clear that the 6 down, 6 to go post hadn't been about her diet, but about her goal to win a bet some friends had made her that she couldn't have sex with all 12 male employees at her new job. At this point I ended the chat.

For the next few days she was super flirty with me again. She left me little notes on my desk with things that said, ""If you change your mind meet me at (her address) tonight at 9pm!"" or ""can't stop thinking of u"", etc. Always vague enough to be explained away but it was clear she really wanted me to be guy #7 on her hitlist.

Then she took a different route. She confronted me in a supply closet once and made her biggest move, started unbuttoning her shirt, saying she needed me, etc. When I rejected her firmly she went into ultra bitch mode. She essentially threatened me, saying that if I didn't want her, fine, but the bet thing was a joke anyway and wasn't true and if I started spreading rumors about her like that she'd have me fired for sexual harassment. I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

Learned along time ago to just keep my head down and mind my own business so I did. But after another few days she began to be hostile to me in public, around other employees. At some office meetings she would bring up certain accounts that I was responsible for and pretend she didn't know they were mine, but say that she'd been getting anonymous messages from their reps saying they might be bringing their business elsewhere. That was pretty major but I was able to shoot it down by pointing out several new contracts and my ongoing good relationships with those reps. 

Lots of other little things she started to do really made me start dreading going to work, but I toughed it out. Until this week.

I made an honest mistake with a sales order that somehow she found out about. I corrected it right away and honestly, these types of mistakes happen. The rep I work with for that company wasn't even mad so I didn't think anything of it. That is until the boss (not her father, he owns the company but doesn't run it) called me into his office yesterday and brought up the mistake. He was furious. He said that the owner had chewed him out the night before about that mistake and how it was unacceptable. He suspended me for two days for the transgression as a result. 

Now, who do you think told the owner? Obviously it's the daughter, going over our boss's head to try and get me in serious trouble and/or fired.

I don't know what to do anymore. The only real evidence I have about her and this stupid bet/sexual harassment are the FB chat logs but I'm worried that's not official enough for any legal actionshould things get worse. I could try talking to the owner, who always seemed to like me, and quietly let him know about what his daughter is doing but what if he refuses to believe me? I could go to HR and file an official complaint about the daughter harassing me but again, not sure how to prove it. 

The final and worst part here is that if she was telling the truth, and she's had sex with half the men here, I have no idea who they are. The boss/manager? Only warehouse guys? More people in sales or finances? And if they have, since most of them are married or have girlfriends, why would they back me up? They obviously wouldn't.

If I could do it over again I would have started reporting her flirtations early on so there would have been a record. I would have kept the little notes she left on my desk. I would have spoken to the HR woman immediately after finding out about this supposed bet/game she's playing. Have it all on record but I didn't. So now what?

My [f/20] boyfriend [m/21] and I have been together just short of 3 years. We've had an up-and-down relationship, but things have been good recently (or so I thought). I also live with him and his family (around 2 years now).

I attend college and work part-time, although my work schedule fluctuates every week and can go past 40+ hours, depending on the week and what's going on. My boyfriend, however, does not go to school and does not work anymore (he quit his job due to his hatred of his manager).

Well, today, my boyfriend got mad at me when his friend, R, was over and they wanted to make burgers, whereas I really just did not want any, I wanted soup (I'm not feeling too well). I went out, got my soup, and came back to the house, where they were still making burgers. Alright, no problem, but I noticed he kept acting pissy towards me, making it a little awkward for R. Okay.. R leaves, and my boyfriend's best friend, P, comes over. It's all fine and dandy, I act like I always would around my boyfriend, but he's still acting pissed off. He and P play with our cats, we clean a little, and we're getting ready to go to P's house. I'm not even sure how the topic of sex came up, but my boyfriend made a comment somewhere about how our sex is boring. P asked if we did anything freaky, and my boyfriend said no, because I'm boring in bed. Alright.. I've been open to trying new things, however, some positions hurt my cervix and I can't help that. I also get quite exhausted after work sometimes (there's a lot of running, including up/down stairs, for up to 9 hours), but I try to give him what he wants (he finishes, but I don't). It just really hurt my feelings, because I had been trying all day after the burger incident to make things up with him, but instead he says that, then leaves with P without saying anything else.

Any advice?! I can give more details or info if needed.

(Oops title should say best-friend, not best-fried - anyone know how to change that?)

So over the last few days, while trying to get my head around everything that has been happening, I went about 'investigating' the claims made. I asked probably 5 or 6 people, whose names had been mentioned, and they all had relatively similar answers. That they had said/heard something but that it was nowhere near as major as the way my friend expressed it to me. 

I spoke a lot to my other best-friend (lets call her N), who is really close with the friend who i fought with on the weekend (lets call her K). N said that K had sporadically come to her over the last year or so with tidbits of info concerning my boyfriend, but that none of it had been very serious or it didn't make sense. The had toyed with the idea of telling me some of this stuff but N always decided that it was not a good idea. 

So, I decided to contact K and ask to see her and N so that we could discuss Saturday night. I went with the express intention of discussing her actions, rather than her accusations. Following the investigations I did, and the conversations I have had with my boyfriend, I have determined that he has not been unfaithful. However, the talk did not go as planned. She launched another attack on me, in the form of 'I just don't get why you're with him, he's a dick'. It was a tirade of her opinions of him and me, and she said lots of nasty things like she doesn't get how I put up with the abuse (he has never abused me). She also spoke a lot about how she is afraid of him, and that he bullies her. This also makes no sense - he can be a bit aggressive at times but he is not a nasty person and would never purposefully hurt someone. I endured about an hour of this, and then left. 

So now I am home, crying, not quite sure what to do. K thinks that we have 'resolved' our issues, and now my boyfriend thinks I should ditch her as a friend. I didn't really think things could be worse but I dare say they are now. 

TL;DR: investigated allegations of boyfriend cheating and found nothing, but my friend still insists that she was in the right and that I should dump him.

Thanks again everybody!  Keep being excellent

...

We have been dating for about two years and over the past couple weeks she has become extremely worried about our future together.  She actually came out and told me that she is afraid of me dying before her and leaving her alone since I am older and women statistically to live longer than men.  I can certainly appreciate that concern but the reality is that none of us really know how long we're going to be here.  She told me that for that reason, her parents didn't think it would be a good idea for us to get married and she couldn't imagine doing anything to disappoint them.

She is Indian and I understand that, in that culture, family is central to those kinds of decisions.  Hearing her put it into those words was disheartening, but what really upsets me is that she seems to want to have it both ways.  After dumping this in my lap she tells me in the next breath that she doesn't want to break up.  She sees no future for us but when I suggested that maybe it would be best if we both tried to move on, she turned everything around on me and said that I'm not fighting enough for her.  Wtf?

I am in the process of a major lifestyle change right now, which seems to have her on edge as well.  I have put my employer on notice to find a replacement and effective the middle of next month I will be drastically reducing my working hours in order to pursue a business idea I've been working on full time.  She has been against the idea from the beginning, and thinks I should just find that kind of job in an established company instead.  I have quite a bit of savings to hold me over, as well as several backup plans in case things don't work out.  I have what I feel is a fairly solid business idea for something that, to my knowledge, has never really been done before.  I know it's going to be a lot of hard work and I am willing to accept the risks, but the whole thing does not compute in her mind and I honestly don't think I can count on her to be there if the chips are ever truly down.

I guess I will just try and make this as simple as possible, although it definitely doesn't feel that way.  My boyfriend(M24) and I(F24) have been together for about a year and a half.

About 9 months ago, I made out with an ex(M24) who had just moved to the town where I currently live.  We hung out with the intention of catching up and to see how the other is doing, as we were on friendly terms. At one point in the night (both of us extremely drunk) we ended up kissing. I felt like absolute shit immediately after and later established with my ex that we could never talk to or see each other again. I hadn't done anything like this before this incident, and I sure as hell haven't done anything since. 

I love my boyfriend beyond words. He is the kindest, most caring, generous, hilarious person I have ever met and the thought of losing him is worse than almost anything I could imagine. I currently do not deserve to have him as a partner. Because I was very confident that a) I would never cheat on him ever again, that it was a one-time drunken mistake, and b) He would absolutely leave me if he found out, I never told him. I tried to bury it and move on with our relationship as though that stupid, fucked up thing I did had never happened. (By the way, I had covered my trails so he would have only found out through a confession from me)

A TWIST! The guilt grew like an evil monster. I arrived at a point where every loving thing my boyfriend expressed to me was almost unbearable, knowing that he was unsuspectingly with someone who made out with her asshole ex at a bar whilst in a relationship. I told him today. Over text, no less. Which probably makes me even shittier of a person. I didn't trust myself not to wuss out tonight about telling him, and also he knew something was up, so I told him in a nutshell and asked if we could talk tonight. We are going to talk later (oh, we live together, if that makes a difference) but I have to wait for another few hours for him to get home from his friend's house. 

Finally (and thank you for reading this far, if you're still here), my question for you. Have I done the right thing, given the situation? I know waiting 9 fucking months to confess to something like this is extremely shitty, but I was stupid and thought that it could be left in the past. As I said, I love this person more than anything, and I ultimately decided he needed to know and choose for himself whether or not he wanted to continue the relationship.  I feel selfish in a way for telling him, because I am no longer hiding an ugly secret and it does feel somewhat better to get it out in the open. Was this the right thing to do? I feel lost, sad, and sick, and I deserve no less.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

The have been married for around 15 years.  Our kids are friends and we have a lot of mutual friends.  Over the last 6-8 months the husband has started having an affair.  We have parties at our house frequently and he has started having the girlfriend come over after his wife goes home.  My husband and I have kept quiet about it up until now because we did not want to get involved.  Some of our other friends have noticed and may have been telling the wife at least some of the details.

Well today I got a message from the wife asking point blank if something is going on with them.  I am torn.  I want to tell her but I don't want to betray the husband who has been a good friend to us.  I feel that whatever way we go we (my husband and I) will get blamed.  Any advice on how to proceed?  The husband is out of town this weekend and the wife wants to talk to us, I'm afraid she may be planning on being gone when he gets back.

TL/DR:  Wife asked me and I'm not sure if I should tell.

Edit:  Thank you everyone for your responses. I just wanted to add a few things:  we didn't just let this happen, the gf was a friend too, so we were all hanging out.  But as things got more intimate with them it was hard to say go away.  But I plan to take the consensus advice and just tell her.

Edit 2:  Ok, I have emailed her direct answers to her questions.  I have never actually witnessed him kissing/fucking her, but the way they act is obviously inappropriate for a married man.  I told her that they have left together and where they went I have no idea.  The husband has always been a touchy feely kind of guy for as long as we've known them and it never bothered her before.  But this is obviously much more.  I don't really have more details to give her, just speculation and I'm sure she has plenty of her own already. 

Edit 3: So I've emailed back and forth with her a few times. Apparently, she was already well aware of what is going on.  She has been documenting his comings and goings with her, she just wanted me to fill in a few more details about when he has been at our house with her.  She thanked me profusely for the information.  Sounds like a divorce is imminent, but is won't be solely based on the info she got from me. He has confessed to some things already and the rest is now plainly obvious to her.

What are the rules with this and how can we tell her family?**

Obviously using a throwaway for this. I'm a **25 year old male** and am in kind of a messy situation with a girl I've been seeing for the past few months. I've been married once - but the marriage ended after 3 months - and I've been single since 2010. Mostly casually dating and I haven't gotten serious about anyone in a long time. 

One of my close friends at work is Jon (38/m). He was hired about a year ago and we hit it off and have become very close friends at work and away from work. I've started to spend a lot of time with Jon and his wife and family. They have three kids. **Sara is their oldest and she is 18/f**. They have two younger sons that are elementary school aged. 

Sara and I have always been friendly and I liked her a lot. She is young so that is a consideration. We got close in the fall when Jon asked me to help her with some college application related things. Nothing happened then but we became friends and started to talk a lot away from Jon and his fam. 

In January I asked her to come with me to a show. We had a great time and kissed. We hung out casually some more for the rest of January and February. All of this was behind Jon's back and I didn't ask his permission or let him know I was hanging out with his kid. 

In March we got more serious. Agreed on being monogamous and boyfriend/girlfriend and we finally slept together. I feel a little sketchy saying this but we had to wait a while just for some legal issues. I doubt we would have got caught but better safe than sorry since Cali's age of consent is 18. Also was Sara's first time. Everything went well and we both started falling for one another hard. 

Our relationship is really, really good. We both have so much in common and she is so much older than her years. We have a ton of fun, trust one another, and are just very, very happy. I've met her close friends and she has met a couple of my close friends. 

Sara's parents knew she was seeing someone at this point but didn't know who. We have been going behind people's backs to hangout and we both are getting tired of it. 

We don't know how to come out to her parents. I'm afraid of what Jon is going to think and feel since he introduced me to his teenager daughter and now I'm dating her. I didn't plan this out and our deception for the past few months is making this a lot harder than it needs to be.

Wife and I have been married 17 years. (M)e 38 her 37.  We have two kids 9&amp;13. We moved to the city we currently live in over 10 years ago because of my job. I have a great job and make decent money, usually work 50 hours a week. We live a nice house that we built. My wife home-schools both of our kids so she is home every day, all day.  The kids are involved in sports, so we stay busy between practices and games on weekends. 

My problem: My wife is tired of living here. She wants to move, and has mentioned many times that she wants to live in another country, because our society is “so screwed up and we live in a rat race”. She has always had friend “issues”, finding  problems with them and when they do not meet her expectations, the friendship gets rocky and eventually fails. She knows this is a problem and has tired to work on it in the past. So this leads, in my opinion, to part of her issues. She has no real friends, therefore no strong ties to anyone here. She thinks that moving to a location where people are “nice and friendly” will make things better. 

 I am very apprehensive about quitting my job and moving, so this causes tension between us. We’ve had many talks, but what really bothers me is that she will always throw out this **“ if you really loved me, you would sacrifice and move”**. I responded last night to this by saying that I felt like she was putting stipulations on my love for her. She is a wonderful person. She will go out of her way to help people or lend an ear. She is a great mother to our kids and a faithful wife to me. She is the most detailed person I know.  Maybe she is depressed. No friends, no hobbies, etc… 

Reddit, what do I do here? Sell the house, quit my job and move somewhere else.  How do I handle this “if you loved me you would just do it” attitude? I do not think that quitting my job is smart in times like these. This has been eating at me for months and starting to strain our relationship.

 I’m not looking for pity, I’m not trying to beat down the woman, I just don’t know how to handle this. I need your collective insight, advice and help. Thanks guys. 

**TL;DR** Wife says we live in a “rat race” wants to sell the house, wants me to quit my good  job and move somewhere different. She has used the “you must not really love me or you would just do it” line repeatedly. I need advice on how to handle this.

Tonight, we had a serious fight because I decided not to cave and ""explain"" myself to her. This issue has come up several times before. Here is what happened.

We're enjoying Ghost Protocol, and she gets all bothered by a low cut dress worn by one of the characters towards the end. My wife pulls away a bit, makes a comment that the dress is awful (because of the cleavage it reveals) and comments that this sort of thing bothers her.

Here is where she gets mad at me: she says I didn't appear as perturbed as she does, which upsets her further. In the past, I would look away from the screen after she explained how much it bothers her that I watch these scenes. But tonight, for whatever reason, I didn't think to. Probably because it's harmless cleavage.

She demanded that I justify this and explain why I didn't look away, and why I was okay with watching it. And I told her I wouldn't. Rather, I told her if it would make her feel better, I just wouldn't watch movies thats showed cleavage anymore. I made some more inflammatory statements like that, both out of frustration and out of an effort to make her see how wrong I thought she was.

She accused me of being extreme, and I told her she was the one with extreme opinions.

I think she is being over-sensitive. I make it clear to her that don't ogle and drool over women. I make it clear that I find the objectification of women a worthless feature, despite its frequency in media. I make it clear that I'm not hooked or lured by the promise of sexual content, as often advertised to be waiting in movie trailers and the like.

If my opinion is true, that she is over-sensitive and has unfair/unrealistic expectations, how can I convince her of this?

I noticed that my BF, who uses my laptop when I'm not home had been looking at my email. I usually leave my email and FB accounts logged in. He had looked in my email folders, sent messages, deleted messages and looked at my exes on FB. I really don't have anything to hide so I'm not worried. But I've been checking the history on my computer more often now and he's doing it almost daily.
I want to confront him but I don't want to piss him off. I really don't have anything to hide anyway but it makes me feel terrible thinking he doesn't trust me.
Should I bring it up or just hope he'll eventually figure out that I have nothing to hide?
We've been dating for about 6 months by the way. I'm 28, he's 27.

Update: I made another account for him on my computer and changed my admin password. I told him what I found and that I felt hurt by it. He apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. He didn't get pissed but does seem a bit embarrassed, understandably. We had a pretty decent discussion about it and I think he'll talk to me about his insecurities in the future now.

I've avoided talking to him for the last four days but feel like this is coming to a head. I'm lost and have no idea what to do.**

My head is such a jumbled mess right now so I'm going apologize ahead of time if any of this comes out fragmented and incoherent.

I met my boyfriend in January at a dance club. We bumped into each other in the lounge area and started chatting it up and spent most of the night with each other talking. He was so charming, funny, kind, and every other generic word that makes a human being great that I immediately fell for him. We exchanged numbers and set up a date a few days later. The date was perfect and we had two more before our first kiss.

We've never been intimate, mostly because sex wasn't an activity I didn't feel I was ready to engage in (partly because of my religious beliefs) and I told him that on the first date. He said it was okay and there was no pressure, we could just hang out and get to know each other. As time went by, thing really began to heat up between us and we would fool around a lot when we had time alone (always clothes on and not a lot of touching below the belt). I decided I wanted to be intimate.

About 2 week ago I sent him a text saying that I was ready to take our relationship to the next level. He never responded. I tried to contact him several times throughout the day and he never called me back. I was worried that he thought I was moving too fast and was freaking out that I'd lost him. He texts me two days later saying he's been really busy with work but he'd like to talk to me when I was free and we set a time to see each other that night.

He came over to my house and I went out and sat with him in the car. He then told me he wasn't born a boy (it was really long and drawn out and painful and I cant write it all out yet) and he had started his transformation into one when he was 24. He started to cry and told me he thought he was falling in love with me and that he didn't want to lose me and I started to cry then too.

And this is where it gets muddy. 

I feel like a terrible person and maybe I am but I told him that I was disgusted. My stomach hurt like I was going to throw up and I went in my house and have avoided him since. He has called and texted and even sent me a long email but I don't know how to respond to any of it so I don't. I feel bad that I said that to him because I really do like him but I think what I said was true and I am disgusted by the idea that I've been kissing a female and letting another female touch me (I'm trying to be careful with wording here to avoid accusations of transphobia. I'm trying to be as sensitive as I can). 

I can't go on avoiding him forever (he's now friends with a few of my friends) and I don't want to. I want to be with him but I don't know how to be knowing that he was born as something I am not hardwired to be attracted to. Reddit, how do I approach him with more grace than I had during his revelation? And what should I even say?! Please help.

I'm not sure what to do.

**Edit: I've gotten a lot of really great feedback and I'd like to thank everyone for offering opinions and suggestions. I've learned a lot in the past night alone and feel a bit better now. I only ask that you do not begrudge anyone of their opinion- everyone thinks differently, and that's okay, there is no reason to call them or me a bigot or transphobe or anything of that nature because they do not agree with you (But I am happy to learn that the Reddit community is generally very accepting if not tolerant). I'm still really confused and, like some have suggested, I plan on doing a lot of soul searching before we have our conversation. Despite my strong feelings, I am not sure if I can be with a trans person but I am eager to learn more about him.**

**At this point I have sent this email:**

*""Hi, [throwinnthedark's boyfriend].*

*I first and foremost want to apologize for being so rude and saying that I was disgusted. It was inappropriate and insensitive and I feel awful about it. Please forgive me for that.*

*I haven't been answering your calls or texts because I don't know what to say to you. I need some time to work everything out before I can talk to you again.*

**And gotten this reply:**

*""It hurt to hear you say that, you are the last person I wanted to but I forgive you. While you think don't forget that I love you and I will respect whatever decision you make"".*

1st Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bft0a/update_1_im_losing_my_wife_and_it_seems_my_life/

Hi Guys,

So some of you requested an update, and I'm happy to give it to you since I think this helps me cope with the situation. 

We had our first therapy session today, and nothing that was communicated was anything new to me. It was a basic intro, and then I went ahead and just told her everything I thought. I am open with my feelings, my wife is not.

I already knew this, but It was still a reminder that my wife has a very hard time discussing her feelings. I think it may be due to the fact that she doesn't want to cry, or open up, or feel the pain. She holds it in. She studders over her words, or just looks EXTREMELY uncomfortable. It's weird to see her in that light, because it's very rare that I see her so fragile.

The therapist asked questions, and said things EXACTLY the way I thought they'd be done. She picked the most general/popular issues marriages have, and explained them to us as if we might be experiencing the same problems. Things I already know and understand. I could understand that with limited information, those would be the first in her thought process. I sort of laughed a little inside to be honest, because I thought, ""You obviously don't know my wife. (Yet)"" It also felt good because it was a reminder to me that I am not crazy for the way I feel. It also felt painful because we didn't get anywhere productive besides letting her know whats going on. I kept looking at the clock and trying to fit as much stuff into our session as possible. (That's the business man in me)

My wife expressed her feelings. She said she regrets getting married, but doesn't see herself with anyone else. She wants to be with me, but she doesn't want the responsibility of having a partner.

She said she likes to do things alone (with our dog), and is happier doing that than hanging out with people. Not just me, but with people. (Another indication of depression)

The main theme I got out of the discussion was that she doesn't like responsibility or compromise in her life. Period. She loves me, but she feels like she has to compromise on things to be with me. Whether that's her time, or any effort being physical or emotional. She wants to do everything on her own terms. She said, ""I am very selfish."" Which is something she's expressed to me before.

She just sounded confused about her own feelings. 

We didn't even really talk about sex. Which is fine, because that's gotta be the last step in this whole fiasco. We did mention that it's been almost a year since we've had sex, and that it's become so awkward, we barely even cuddle anymore. 

The fun (sarcasm) part of the experience was when the therapist tried to send us off with ""homework"". She said she wanted us to do 1 non-sexual, physical thing for each other for 5-10 minutes. She said we could pick. Back rub, foot rub, just cuddle....That's when things got awkward. My first thought is that, ok, great-- I get what I want, the physical touch of my wife. I knew my wife's first thought was, ""You can't make me!"" (And as you know, what she doesn't want to do, she doesn't do)

She had us pick our thing. My wife picked back rub, with A LOT of tension in her voice. I picked back rub too, (because it was an easy pick) but explained that I really don't care much for massages or anything, so the therapist said, ""what about cuddling? Like, before bed on the sofa watching TV"" and my response was, ""Well, yeah-- that would be my first pick, but I don't know how she (my wife) feels about that."" That's when my wife said she felt awkward and uncomfortable with it. So the therapist took it all back and decided not to give us homework. 

I have to say that I thought that was funny because about 3 days ago, my wife totally cuddled with me in bed on her own accord-- but as soon as it's a ""plan"" or anything out of her control, it's shot down like a nuke from North Korea. (LOL's anyone?)

Anyway, next week we're supposed to meet separately in 2 different meetings. (Expensive) I'm not sure where this is all heading. Obviously my wife doesn't know what she wants, so she just keeps playing the ""I don't know"" game, and it's not getting us anywhere.

I'm starting to wonder if she'll ever compromise, and if our relationship is going to have to be decided by ME, and not by her. I'm not trying to sound big-headed, or above her, or anything like that-- but I really think she has it good. I care about her a lot, and I am a very loyal, caring, providing husband. A part of me feels so screwed over. :-/

On another note, I am looking into selling my business and hopefully walking out with profit after debt, giving me (and hopefully her) new opportunities. My plan is to see if I can escape the debt and walk out with $50-$100k in my pocket. I could be overzealous, but it's possible.

Also, I've lost 5lb, I'm feeling a lot better about my body, and I've cut my drinking down way more than half.

Sorry if this is against rules, let me know and I'll do something different.

**Note 2**: Title says ""cheated on her date"", **should say ""cheated on her diet""**... I was typing quickly since this is the second time I've posted this thread. I should have double checked but my feet aren't on the ground right now. 

***

The first two posts are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b9m8x/my_m24_girlfriend_f23_of_about_a_year_cancelled/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bj4c6/update_my_m24_girlfriend_f23_of_about_a_year/), but I'm going to be honest, this is a little out of left field. Whether it's because I'm a total idiot, as was widely suggested, or because my girlfriend is a terrible liar, I don't know.

Backstory: Girlfriend cancelled date on Friday before Easter because she cheated on her diet. Thought she was acting weird, came to Reddit about it possibly be cheating on me. Reddit rightly whooped my ass and told me I was acting self-centered. Saw her on Sunday, she was still acting weird, came back to Reddit, and then sat down with her on Tuesday night and actually talked.

She finally came out and told me what was wrong. On Saturday, she got an abortion.

Yeah. So that was a bit of shock to say the least, and I'm still reeling from all of the implications. 

She was six weeks along. It was a medical abortion; she just had to take two pills. She took off work on Monday to help recover; on Sunday, a few times, she told me she was on period when I noticed she wasn't eating much or when she winced when we were cuddling together and I pressed her stomach. I feel horribly guilty about all of this.

She had decided not to tell me and has only told me now because she realizes she can't ""get away with it"". Her plan was to act like she was really secluded because of stress/her diet and then she was going to act like nothing ever happened. The only person she told was a friend of hers from high school who she isn't even that close with, who ended up driving her to and from the clinic. I asked her why that friend, and she said because said friend was the only person she knew who wouldn't hate her, because said friend had an abortion in HS. I told her I'd never hate her, and that I support any decisions she makes, etc, but she was just really upset. I held her and tried to talk to her, but I have no idea where her mind is at, so I didn't really know what to say, other than I kept telling her I loved her and that everything was okay and that I appreciated her telling me now, and that I wasn't mad she didn't tell me earlier. I'll be honest, the last one was a bluff, but god, she was just so sad. Before she left, I did ask that I come with her to a therapist appointment, which upset her at first, but I explained it was just for me, because I didn't know how to communicte my thoughts with her, not because I thought she was acting crazy or anything. She accepted that, was still weird about it. We were supposed to go to a work thing of hers tomorrow, but I told her that if she wanted, she could tell her boss I was really sick and stay home. 

If you want to chime in with advice, feel free. Honestly, I might not respond this time. I only came back because I wanted to thank everyone for their advice and their time, and I felt like I owed you all a response.

I really went back and forth on posting this update. Especially now that the first one didn't go through. It's like fate is telling me not to update. It's one thing to tell the internet your girlfriend is cheating on her diet, but this is another thing entirely. That said, my life is kind of consumed by a thing I can't talk about, so I'd like to get a bit of this off my chest somewhere. 

Anyways, thanks again, guys.

He and I have been on and off for the last four years now, the duration of our current relationship is 7 months. From the second we started dating we were an extremely physical couple, and even after breakups we were fooling around/having sex often. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. 

For the last three years our relationship has been long distance because he goes to school four hours away from our home town, but we still managed to have sex anytime we had the chance.

He's always been paranoid about the risk of pregnancy and always has made me take pregnancy tests almost every month that we're sexually active. But now, despite being on the pill, and despite the use of condoms, he says that he no longer wants to have sex because although he enjoys the physical aspect of it, he immediately regrets it afterwards and worries that I am somehow pregnant.

This makes me feel like I'm not an adequate lover, and that my body is a nightmare for him. I'm an extremely sexual being, and I can't have our relationship without any sexual element in it. I want to try to find a middle ground for him, or try to find a way that he can enjoy sex with me, but now it's hard for me to feel comfortable with him seeing my body when I feel like it's the embodiment of his worst nightmares. I know I need to get past that if I want to get our relationship back on a physical path.

So I have been going out with this girl for 4 years, we now live together and I love her more than anything. Here's the issue.

She has always been super Flirty with everyone, and after a couple months that stopped bothering me, just because that's who she is. We have always been really open about everything, and we tell each other everything. Recently, she has become really good friends with a guy, she texts him all the time, gets bummed out when they don't hang out, and has long phone conversations with him at least a couple times a week. She has had a lot of Guy friends before where something like this has happened, but something is weird about this because she has stopped sharing everything with me, and has stopped wanting to do anything sexual with me. She says it's because of her history of being molested, which is absolutely believable and she has been molested, and I can't even begin to imagine the effects of that, but it has never bothered her before, and she has been denying me anything more than a kiss for almost a month. Because of my suspicions, I checked her phone, which I know I shouldn't do, and I would take it back if I could, but there was a text from her to him saying ""can I have a kiss tonight?"" And he responded, ""yes, of course you can."" And, a couple texts from another day she sent him saying ""phone sex?"" And he said ""I don't know how"" which is where the conversation ended. Then I looked in her photos and there are some of her in her bra and underwear, and she has never sent me those types of pictures.

So I kind of brought it up without letting her know I looked into her phone and she is denying everything. She normally isn't one to lie, I honestly don't think she has lied to me before, especially about something this big, but I am worried.

1.I hate admitting that I am wrong

2.He is a redditor, I didn't want him to know I came to you guys for advice after he got me into Reddit.

Here is a TLDR of the past 6 months and what I came here for advice on, followed by the update;

21f here, (ex)boyfriend 21 aswell.

after 2 months of dating and talking, I found 300 texts between him and his ""stalker"" 17 year old neighbor.  The texts were disturbing, such as, ""I love you""s ""Im just waiting on you to change""(she cheated, multiple times) ""Indatrashz is a down grade dontcha think?""(to which he agrees)  At one point he says hell leave me for her.

At this point I did not know they had a serious relationship at one point, I only thought it was a crazy girl obsessed with my man.  I then found out they dated...but it was ""nothing serious"".  I dismissed the texts with his pathetic excuse of ""She fucked me over so I just wanted to hurt her""

FF to about 3 weeks ago. I see them texting again, this time with no snooping.  It hurts, and it hurts bad.  He swore he wouldnt talkt o her ever again. He claims he has no reason to ignore her because it's his neighbor.  I say its absolutely disrespectful towards me given what happened previously.  We fight, he is resistent and condesending (even laughing) towards my feelings in the situation.  Oh but that wasn't enough.

Two weeks ago we go on a break. During the break he is a complete dick to me.  I still try to get back with him, thought we were back together as of Saturday, then I came here once more after he fucked me on sunday and didn't even bother to shoot me a text on Monday (I left out a lot of info in that post knowing that if you all knew it was me, you would be pissed that I gave him a shot again)


***TL;DR caught bf texing 17 yr old ex 6 months ago, and again 3 weeks ago(she texted him but he always responds) Go on break. Treats me like shit during break, like a dummy I still want him, have sex with him sunday, he ignores me monday.***


**So here is the update.**  Last night, we sat down for a beer. I told him I am sick of this relationship purgatory and being strung along. It's either we move on or forget this all happened.  He can't get over that i ""actually took a break because of something he cant control"" (her texting him) I told him he can tell her not to, or simply not respond.  He still says that its unreasonable to be that mean to her, I say he had no problem ""leading her on to burn her before"" he says it's alot easier to be mean to someone you have a stronger emotional connection with (DA FUCK?) than a stranger, which is what she is now.

Still I sit there, dumb founded, as he says lets just move on. He realized he doesn't need a girlfriend during the break.  I say what in the fuck were you doing telling me you love me and having sex with me then because you know I would NOT have fucked you if I thought we weren't getting back together.

Then heres the kicker.   I was in a severely physically abusive relationship before I was with him.   It was two years long and seriously fucked with my head, you'd think he's the guy I could talk to about it right? Wrong.  I say  ""I just though seeing as you knew what happened with me and _abusiveex_ you would have been a little more careful with my feelings.  He said ""See, somethings wrong with you. Theres alot of things that have happened to me that I havent talked about or told you""   


I walked out, texted him ""It's my fault, I should have left you after I found you telling a 17 yr old you love her.  It probably is easier to tell some one you ""hate"" youd leave a girl like me for them when you have a ""stronger emotional connection"" also, you still owe me at the least $75, and that's being nice.""   (it's actually about 150, we went to colorado and I ended up having to pay for everything because his PARENTs did not give him enough money.


I then deleted his number, his pictures out of my phone, all of our texts, and deactivated my facebook (only til monday, can't go with out it thats probably why I am here.)  

I met up with a girlfriend (lol its actually his bestfriends ex who I happened to become really good friends with) we joke about how the only thing those losers were good for is bringing us together.

THEN I get home and read in [/r/relationships](/r/relationships) about a girl who caught her boyfriend texting. Open the comments, and Student1975 [changed my entire perspective on everything. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ri764/update_need_advice_snooped_bfs_phone_to_find/c460uj0)   I want to thank this person so fucking much, THANK YOU STUDENT1975.

I feel fucking fantastic, I stood up for myself reddit and I honestly don't think I'd have done it without you.  I have let men treat me like shit for much too long, It's time for some serious personal reconstruction, hot dates, and girl time.


Thank you reddit, I love you. And if you have anytips....please leave them with me.

I feel like I'm broken.  ,isitaproblem,136,30,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qiz2f/update_from_a_little_over_a_year_ago_turns_out_he/,"Posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ddxi9/bf_is_in_occasional_contact_with_ex_but_has_not/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dl6mt/boyfriend_may_be_hiding_contact_with_ex_am_i/) about a year/year and a half ago? To summarize my previous two posts, my boyfriend (M, 22) was in sporadic contact with his ex, but was behaving kinda suspiciously about it - wouldn't acknowledge to me at all that he still had contact with her, and if I asked, would tell me he was talking to ""just a friend.""  I (F, 20) accidentally opened up his text message history with her and found that he'd visited her while visiting family and lied to me about it.  

After those I made those posts, I confronted him about it.  He assured me that nothing was going on and that he was absolutely devoted to me and that I had nothing to worry about.  To put my mind at ease, he told me I could look through his messages whenever I wanted, if it would make me feel better.  I told him it wasn't necessary, that I felt better because he was being so open, and we could just forget about it and move forward.  

Things seemed to be getting better from there on out - we moved in together over the summer and everything seemed to be happy and good.  I started seeing a therapist to work on some of the anxiety and insecurities I had been feeling, and I improved by leaps and bounds.  I felt like a new person - it was easy for me to trust, I broke the habit of getting stuck in circles of negative thought, and I became more productive and engaged in my job and schoolwork than I had ever been before.  

Then we went to visit his family for Thanksgiving.  I found a pair of panties in his room that weren't mine.  I asked him about them, and he told me that they must have been his sister's and gotten mixed up in the laundry.  The excuse set off some warning bells at the time (they didn't look like the kind of style someone like his sister would wear, and they haven't lived in the same house for many years), but I figured I was just being paranoid and tried to forget about it.  

Things started going downhill in the months after that.  He started withdrawing from me and refusing to communicate about the simplest things, and it started driving me crazy with anxiety.  It got to the point where I couldn't stand it anymore and I finally (a couple weeks ago) checked the chat logs on his computer to try and figure out what the hell was going on (he *had* given me permission, after all, when we had the discussion last fall).  

Turns out that he had been seeing his ex in a less than innocent manner.  The panties were hers.  Whenever he had been going back to visit his family without me, he had been taking her out on dates, shopping trips, buying her expensive gifts, and sleeping with her.  He had been doing this for the entirety of our 2.5 year relationship.  

I broke up with him, obviously, but this has seriously fucked with my head.  I thought I was just being crazy and paranoid, but this has completely validated a ton of my anxieties and triggered a ton of my old insecurities, and I don't know how to put myself back together.  I feel like I'm falling back into my old, destructive ways of thinking.  I don't understand how he could just lie to my face like that, and I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to trust anyone else again.  I don't feel like I'll ever be good enough to have a healthy and loving relationship.  

I am still seeing my therapist, but after these events, I find it difficult to trust even him - it's like there's some sort of mental block there, and I can't let on to him how much I'm hurting.  I go in to my sessions, and I sit there and tell him that everything's going just peachy in my life, that I'm feeling much better, that I'm not hurting at all, but inside, I feel like screaming.  I haven't told my therapist what exactly happened.  I've tried, but the words won't come out.  I didn't say why we broke up, and he just kind of assumed it was due to the communication issues we'd been having, and he hasn't pressed the issue at all.  I am in so much pain right now that I don't know how to express it in words.  I've been putting all of my energy into my schoolwork so I can keep my mind off of other things, but I can't do that forever and I feel like I'm going to fall apart any day now.  

I don't know why I'm posting here...  To vent, ~~to give a hearty FUCK YOU to everyone who told me not to worry (or who called me crazy via PM) on the previous posts,~~ to update because people like updates...  But if anyone can say anything that will make me feel better, it would be much appreciated.

tl;dr: Don't stick your dick in crazy!

So I started to get suspisious when she told me that one of her friends was going to go with her to buy a pregnancy test. I talked to this same friend at a party while she was supposed to be with my exgirlfriend (who we'll call Nancy) buying the pregnancy tests. I got a text later that night from Nancy that her friend (who I was with the entire time) had taken her to get the tests and she was pregnant. At the time I disregarded all of this but now that I look back on it it makes a lot more sense. Getting back on track, she continued this lie for about another week. She said she skipped school to go to the Gyno and tried to avoid me (I saw her but didn't confront her) and ""faked"" morning sickness. Three days ago she told me she ""had a miscarriage"" and that she isn't pregnant anymore. I just nodded and kinda sat there mindfucked. There is few things in life that you should lie about, and being pregnant in one of them.

She told on of her friends that her reasoning for it was to get me to ask her to marry me, which is stupid seeing that she is fifteen and I'm sixteen.

I think I might cut off my dick and never get near girls again, because this cause WAAAAAAAY too much stress.

We skype about twice a week and talk on the phone every day along with texts going back and forth.  I have no reason to believe anything sinister is going on except this: the condoms.    
    
When I got home, after not having seen each other for some time naturally we wanted to screw like rabbits. So we do, and again. While she's showering I decide to take stock, see how our condom supply is holding up. And here's the problem.  It *is* running low. For unrelated reasons I know exactly how many condoms were there when I left. I made no mistake.  We're short by 5.     
    
Am I being paranoid?  I do plan on approaching this, but I'd like to hear some opinions first.  How do I bring this up without being accusing? I don't want her to get defensive, I just want an explanation. How do I continue if she says ""I don't know where the condoms went""?

""Babe, I don't want to sound like I'm accusing you of anything, so please don't take it that way. I have to ask you this because if I don't I won't stop thinking about it so please hear me out. I know we had more condoms than this when I left. I don't know where they are, but I am certain of the number. Can you explain what happened to them?""    
    
That's more or less the exact wording.  She responded with raised eyebrows and a little bit of anger ""That sounds exactly like you're accusing me of something. What is it exactly you think I did?""    
    
And cue me explaining my thought process. ""Not accusing you, just looking for explanation, yada yada etc.""  We argued about my ""accusation"" and finally she stood up and walked away saying ""I can't believe you'd think I'd cheat on you.""

Me: 22, her: 21. Okay, I'm the first to admit that proposing at this young age is completely mental in the first place, I never thought I'd do it, but I felt compelled by my love for her to do so.

She initially did the whole shocked thing and said 'yes', the ring was on her finger. Then she went silent, and decided to change that to a 'I want to sort my life out first.' This stung me, considering for months she'd been pestering me to do it, saying she didn't care when and how or where I asked, as long as I asked, she'd say yes.

More back story - we've broken up a few times, usually from me being completely driven to the ground by her problems (anorexic rape victim, it was never going to be plain sailing). I love her to the ends of the Earth - obviously, since I proposed to her - but now I'm told that she's ""still hurt from all the times we've broken up"" and ""I love you but I don't know if I'm in love with you right now.""

The other day she said she was moving back to where she went to university because, I quote ""I'm me again, I'm 21 and I don't see why I shouldn't."" Which, for all intents and purposes, is fair enough and completely justifiable. What's thrown me is the fact that not four weeks ago she was looking for a place with me in this city and, now I've proposed to her, she's running off elsewhere saying ""I want to marry you, but I want to live before I get tied down.""

So I was molested from age 10-12 by my best friend's grandfather. It was obviously a fucked up experience, I had wonderful parents who saw that I had a good therapist and I worked through my shit. And there was plenty, through different stages of life. Fast forward to adult me, and I now sit on a board of directors and do volunteer work for a sexual assault center. 

My husband obviously knows about my past. It's stuff I've dealt with and part of what made me who I am. He has always had an odd fascination with it, that has never quite made me feel comfortable. Like he liked the fact that some part of me was broken, only I didn't feel broken about it.

See, he battles mental illness pretty hardcore. I've lost count of the number of ER visits, of the paramedics showing up to my house when he ate a bunch of pills and got piss drunk, the stays in the psych ward, him screaming in the middle of the night ""help me"", so loud neighbors 3 houses down can hear, the hallucinations and ""demons"" he sees, how he laughs hysterically at me when I break down and cry. Tells me he's SHOCKED that I'm capable of feeling. He's not right.

I've tried to get him help. He's on medications, a bunch of them, but he drinks, he's an alcoholic, the meds don't work. My family lives on the opposite side of the country. Every time I go home to visit them, he lands himself in the psych ward. I've started extending my trips out there. 

So, last night. We are laying in bed and he's grilling me about wanting to know the details of how I was molested. He's brought this up many times before. I've told him I've moved on, I don't want to think about the details, they serve no purpose and they don't add to the story. I said those details once in my life. In a deposition to the court when I was 13. I spoke about them once and really didn't want to utter the words ever again.

Well he wouldn't let up this time. He kept telling me how I didn't love him enough, I didn't trust him, he didn't really know who I was... until he broke me down. I couldn't take his beating me down about it anymore. He wouldn't take no for an answer. So I told him every awful detail of what happened in-between heaving sobs. These words I never wanted to speak again, these details that I'd left in my past, I had to recount, in excrutiating detail to him.

I felt sick to my stomach. I just have this icky feeling about all of this. This feeling like he will love me more if I am broken? That is so fucked up. I know it is, but I also know that he is broken. He has such a good side. Everyone that knows him would say he's one of the kindest people they'd ever met. He has a good soul.

I'm just really conflicted about all of this and I don't know what to think. I don't even really know what happened and I could use some perspective.

My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We come from two very different types of families. His is well to do and he has never wanted for anything, mine started off well to do but quickly went downhill after my father was laid off from a very lucrative career. My father decided to move ""back home"" to be closer to his parents, and started his own business. That failed, and we were dragged back to where I was born and that's where I ended up meeting my current boyfriend.

We knew each other about ten years before getting together. In that span of time, I lost both my parents, was forced to move out on my own, and the shitty economy has presented me with only shitty jobs where I don't get paid on time, have my employers break tons of labor laws, and I was just fired from a job (I was on probation) that gave me the hope I could pay off my student debt in just over a year.

I've lived on my own for almost eight years, he's never lived on his own. We had a disagreement where I brought this up (not in a bad or bitchy way, I was as gentle as I could be) and he became incredibly insulted. He insisted he paid his own way through college, and compared his 4000 dollar a year rent to mine (I pay around 10,000 a year). After hashing it out some more, he admitted his parents paid his rent.

Despite being incredibly good at saving money, he has no idea what it's like to have to budget, and pay bills, and worry about your credit score. He thinks that I can pay off 6000 by the end of the year, that's not happening now that I just lost my full time job. 

In the past I have suggested finding a room mate, to which he flip flopped between ""No, I like our privacy"" and ""Maybe"". And in fact, a room mate might just be as much in rent as I'm already paying - I live in a city of condos - I can't find anywhere cheaper to move, so I stay where I am. 

He refuses to move into an apartment together (he cites me as an example, says me paying rent all these years was a waste of time). He says he wants to buy a house (and he could, he has enough for a down payment) **with me**; but pay off that student debt first! And trust me, r/relationships, I know moving in together should be about taking the next step, which we're both ready to do (but I guess much more me than him...).

I'm thirty years old and I suffer from endometriosis. I worry constantly that I'll be infertile anyway and worrying about paying off my student debt so we can get married and have kids is a moot point. 

Every time I've brought this up with him he just acts like I'll pay off my debt in the next two years and we'll finally be ready to have kids by then. He says pay off 10 grand and he'll pay off 6. 

I don't know how to bring this up with him and tell him I honestly feel like he's being unfair in asking me to pay off such a large amount of money (10 grand! 1 year's rent!) when I'm already struggling to make ends meet on my own. I was working two jobs at the time I was fired from the full time job. I want nothing more than to pay off my debt and get married.

How do I bring this up to him without sounding like a whiny bitch? I WANT to pay off my debt (and am totally ok for trying to pay off 5 grand a year!), but I feel like it's impossible and it bothers me ever. single. day.

Hey guys. First I'd like to thank all of you for your advice, it was awesome and really helped me get a grip on things. We went to the store and got a test. One came back negative, one positive. I was still pretty scared, but at this point I had realized that I had to own up to my actions, so I began bringing up some points with her about what we should do. She was ""too scared to talk about it"" But I stressed that we needed to. She still would not, so I drew up a contingency plan on my own. I calculated some basic finances with information I gathered on the internet, I figured that if we could get help somehow with the child, I could still go to school and manage to pull the weight of our finances. I never brought this up with her as she didn't want to talk about it.

Finally, after nearly 12 days, she got her period. Just to be sure, my friend drove her to the doctors. She got a blood test, but the doc said she seemed fine. Thank god.

Her and I have learned a valuable lesson, especially me. If we do have sex again, she will be on the pill. I have made this clear to her. She wasn't very happy at first but she has ultimately agreed. 

Thank you very much reddit. Without you guys I probably would have gone insane these past few days. I've learned so much about how valuable my youth is, I'm glad to go back to my biggest problem being the AP chemistry work I have to get done over the summer.

We briefly split up, but he came home for 2 weeks to fix things with us because we both realised how much we want to be together. He left this morning. 

My best friend, who has never been in a relationship, and my boyfriend have never got on terribly well. However, they are civil enough for my sake. I knew that she wasn't all that happy about us getting back together but she never said anything to me. 

On Saturday night, after too much to drink, she decided to tell my boyfriend that he's not good enough for me, he treats me like shit, everyone hates him, everyone thinks he doesn't deserve someone as good as me etc etc. I overheard the whole thing (not sure if that was her intention). I left the bar, and my friend came after me. We yelled at each other, until she eventually said 'he's been cheating on you for months, and no one knew how to tell you'. Obviously I was shocked. I asked her to tell me everything she had heard. But she didn't have any names or dates or anything it was all just big statements (e.g. 'he hangs out with that girl'). I asked her to leave.

I then spoke with my boyfriend, and told him what she had said. He said to me that he knows that he has been an asshole to me lately and he's made some mistakes but that he would never ever cheat on me. We talked for ages then we decided to go home and figure it out. We talked all night, there was a lot of crying - but he left today (Monday) so we didn't have much time to work it all out. 

The next day, I asked my friend for specifics - who told her what, what they told her etc. She sent me a really long text with all this stuff, but when I asked the people who she said told her, they said that they have never said anything like that before and don't know where it is coming from. I showed my boyfriend the text, and there were really simple explanations for everything.

*My girlfriend of 1 week just told me that the dude [Dude 1] she cheated on her ex bf with and her are becoming friends again. They have been friends since highschool and were sexually involved 4 months ago where she cheated on her bf with him. I met her after she broke up with her ex and stopped seeing Dude 1 for sex. I certainly don't feel threatened by Dude 1 but I cant help to feel like there should be some sort of boundary with her involvement with him. I told her that I would like to meet Dude 1 and for her to make that happen but I'm just not sure how I should handle the situation.*

I thought maybe r/relationships might have different advice. Some more info on the situation: She took my V card and I do dig her but im just really frustrated that I'm having to deal with this a week into the ""official"" relationship. I'm going to visit her tomorrow and at the moment I'm planning on telling her I'm totally not cool with this dude and she needs to cut it off with him. If she can't do that then I'm going to end things with her right then and there. Any and all advice is much appreciated because I'm just really confused on how I feel about the situation.

1311696281.0,100,self.relationships,j097d,UPDATE: how to handle my sister's excessive PDA with her girlfriend,gingerdoc,124,24,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j097d/update_how_to_handle_my_sisters_excessive_pda/,"Here is my original post from 1.5 weeks ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/isfah/advice_on_how_to_handle_sisters_excessive_pda/

So, after reading your responses, that night I wrote a respectful e-mail to Jenny explaining the situation, and cc'd Tam on it. I chose to e-mail them, rather than confront them in person, so that we would both have the time to process our thoughts &amp; responses, and avoid a potentially large argument that could have tempered our week together.

I didn't receive a reply to my e-mail or any acknowledgement that I'd sent it, but for the rest of the week they toned the PDA down significantly. Before I sent the e-mail I'd told my parents what I was planning to do, and later that week my mom made a point to thank me for sending it- she said that it was SO MUCH better, and that she was able to enjoy spending time with them now (This has been an issue for the entire time they've been dating, not just this last week).

The four of us did end up going to the water park later that week, and the PDA increased again, I'm assuming because we weren't around my parents. Not a big deal. However, this water park is in a more rural area of our state, and it was a bit painful to see groups of teenagers/young adults pointing and whispering at Jenny &amp; Tam while standing in line waiting for rides. I don't think they noticed as they were too into each other, but at the same time I can't imagine they're totally ignorant of it. Here I am quite conflicted: objectively, they displayed the most obvious/over-the-top PDA of any couple I saw at the waterpark, and it's no wonder people were whispering. At the same time, much of that is due to the fact that they're gay.

So anyway, Jenny left on Sunday, and today I finally received a reply from Tam. The e-mail was respectful and well-thought-out, but its essence was that I find the PDA offensive not for the fact that it's PDA in front of family, but because it's PDA between a gay couple. I felt uncomfortable because they're challenging societal norms. I wouldn't have sent the e-mail if they were straight, because even if their PDA had annoyed me, actually addressing it would have been a breach of interpersonal boundaries, etc. etc. She made some good points, but she also completely refused to acknowledge the validity of some of the points that I made. I'm planning to reply eventually because this is an important conversation to have, but for the moment I'm going to leave it be because we are coming from such very different places. 

Anyway I just wanted to give you all an update, because I generally like hearing how these situations turn out. Your advice turned out to be extremely helpful for that week, and I really appreciated it. Trying to continue this conversation with Tam is going to be more difficult, but I think I'll have to figure that out for myself...though I may cross-post to r/LGBT as someone suggested last time.

My father knows about her social/mental difficulties and the problem is that he doesn't do anything to help her grow up: he just do everything she wants. In other words, she became a ""spoiled"" mother.

My bigger problem with her is that she is constantly spying on me when I go talk with my dad.
It's insane: when she is watching TV and I am on the kitchen with my dad, I start to talk to him and she immediately turns the sound of the TV off just to hear our conversation.
As long as our conversation ends, she turns on the TV sound again.
This confuses me a lot, and when I try to speak with her about it, she never admits it and gets very angry about me questioning her behavior.

My father knows that she doesn't like when we are alone talking or just on the same room without her.
The result is that he is always distant and we NEVER got a normal father-daughter relationship.
He is always cold and distant, because he knows this is the best for their marriage.
Unnecessary to say that this hurts me a lot.

This is just one of the many, many situations I am constantly passing with my mother spying on us.

I just want to clarify that as my mother, I love and respect her very much, but I am very sad about all this situation.
I wish I could help her out, but ANYTHING I say to her, she takes as criticism and get very angry and upset (thanks to her childish and proud behavior).

This is starting to really freak me out, and I would like to have some help from you, please.

**tl;dr**: Mother is always spying on daughter and father conversations due to her insanely jealous, and never admits it. When daughter tries to help her out, she became furious and always ends up in a fight.

**EDIT:** Thank you all for the good advices and healthy discussions. This thread is helping me a lot.

We've had our ups and downs but generally have been compatible and get along well. We have a toddler. 


Over the last 6 months she has struck up a friendship with a coworker who is a lesbian and is in a committed relationship. They started having a regular happy hour after work, just the two of them, and I happily agreed to take care of our child during these nights so she can have her ""girl time"". Stupid me thinks everything is fine.


Fast forward to last week, they come back to our house after they think I've gone to sleep. I hear them in the living room talking on the couch, both of them pretty drunk. Their conversation turns flirty and sexual in nature with them asking each other questions about their sexual history, turn-ons, etc. Admittedly, to hear this from the bedroom I had to strain to listen, but I definitely caught enough of the louder snippets to get the gist of what was happening. My emotions ran the gauntlet from jealous to a little turned on. Anyway, their conversation ended and my wife came to bed. I initiated sex with and I noted she was already quite turned on.


Fast forward a couple nights later (last night) and we're having sex again. During a bit of foreplay and dirty-talk she asks me how I would feel about her having sex with another woman. We banter back and forth in the heat of the moment and I tell her I could be convinced and watching her with another woman could be a turn on. She then asks me what if it was just her by herself...at which point I saw something along the lines of I'm not sure.


Post sex, we end up having a really good conversation. I tell her I don't think I could handle her have sex with another woman alone and that it feels like cheating and that our marriage wouldn't be as whole. She said she understood my feelings. She explains that she's always been curious about girls, and we met not too far out of college and she's never experimented. I ask if she want's to sleep with her lesbian work friend and she says maybe and says they told each other that they have crushes on each other. She swears it has gone no farther and that it will not without my blessing. They've only flirted in person and over text.


After a very restless night of sleep I wake up feeling very conflicted. Twice I awoke in the middle of the night to see my wife looking at her phone. In the morning as we're getting dressed, I notice she's texting on her phone but when she see's me glance at her she immediately closes the text. I take the, admittedly wrong, step of looking at her phone but she's changed her unlock pin. This is a woman who's had the same pin and passwords for years because she never can remember them.


My stomach has been in knots all day today because I feel like there is more going on. It bothers me immensely that she could be getting something from someone else that should come from her husband. I worry if I don't' let her do this she'll end up resenting me and divorce me at some point and break up our family (coming from a broken home, divorce is something I promised myself to never do to my children). If I do let her do it, I'm not sure I can handle it emotionally. I'm mostly bothered by the feeling that she is more deeply involved emotionally than she's admitting to me.


Am I being a pussy about this? Is it too late?


Edit: grammar 

Update: Wow, thank you to everyone for the advice. I can't tell you how much all this means. I confronted my wife this morning and asked if she was having an emotional affair. I also said he was acting shady with her texting and asked to see her texts. When she hesitated, I asked if there was something she didn't want me to see. She said yes, and admitted to very sexual texts. She professed her love and sorrow, and said she was confused because she's never had feelings like this for a woman. I tend to get very cold and clinical when facing emotional distress (coping mechanism I guess). She became very upset to the point of hysteria when I said I didn't know about our future. She then admitted that she came home from work early to ""talk"" with her about things and they ended up making out. She wears that's all that happened. I left the house after that. Not sure what to do next...she keeps texting me, begging me to talk.

Ever since she became a teenager, her behavior has been appalling. She treats my dad like he is worthless and it really stresses him out. We live only with him and have since we were very young. He stepped up and became a single dad of two girls and I really respect him for this choice. She however, hates him. He really is not very smart, nor is he reasonable, but he is our only parent and he tries incredibly hard to help us. She is a senior in high school and he still pays for everything for her. She gets money at the beginning of the month that is supposed to be it for the whole month, but she runs out in the first week. We're talking $200 in one week and she has nothing to show for it. He is then forced to give her money daily so she can go get food or have fun with her very expensive friends. We have had to pick her up off the side of the road countless times because she managed to run out of gas, and that is ruining her car. She was given a car for her 16th birthday, a little over a year ago, and has now been in 3 wrecks with 2 tickets. She has caused our insurance rates to rise and lots of expense towards my dad.

I mentioned earlier my dad is a single father, well he does not have a very good job because his major from college didn't allow him to find good work. He has no career, but he works constantly to make enough money to pay for everything we need. She puts constant financial stress on us and our family. These wrecks have cost thousands of dollars and so has fixing her car due to her treatment of it. He has very little saved and we have no college funds. The more she does this, the more we struggle. 

She also hates me. We go to high school together and are in the same grade (long story). We hang out with lots of the same groups and she talks about me consistently behind my back. She convinces all of my friends that I have anger issues and talks about what a bitch I am. I think this is ridiculously unacceptable. She spreads lies about her own little sister to ruin my reputation. When I confront her about it, she refuses to admit that she has been doing this. I'm no angel, but I certainly don't have anger issues, and I get shit done.

She has no plans for college, she thinks she may move in with my dad after he moves because his job is not in our town. She has no job, no work experience, has only taken a standardized test (ACT/SAT) once because we forced her to. While most of us are applying and researching college, she lays on the couch and does nothing. She is the laziest person I know. When confronted about this problem, she claims that because she has no money to go, she shouldn't, but there are all kinds of financial aid available.

Until recently, she was in a long term abusive relationship. Her boyfriend was also a sociopath. He was abusive to her family, friends, and her. He threw things at our house and forced his way in when we asked him to leave. They dated for like 2 years and finally they decided to break up after both cheated on each other multiple times. The neighbors have called the cops on them fighting in the yard. Several members of my family have disowned her because they couldn't deal with him. She covered for him and refused to listen to us. 

Oh god. This is so long. I'm so sorry. I have more examples if necessary, but I need to know how to get her behavior under control enough so my dad doesn't lose his mind.

UPDATE: So I had a nice long talk with the boyfriend last night. What started out as gentle probing turned into him looking at me and saying, ""Honey, stop beating around the bush.""

He basically told me to be patient. Not because he wouldn't like it if I proposed, or because he thinks it's ""backward"" or whatever.

I had been relatively single since my divorce 10 years ago and abstinent for the last 6. At the urging of a new therapist, I created a profile on virtually every dating website known to man.  After a couple of dates with someone I called Poor Pitiful Pete and a date so bad I don't even remember his name, a guy on one of my sites indicated an interest.  After reading a nondescript but non-the-less 'no-red-flags' profile, I asked him why he might be interested.  I had become a bit jaded after my horrible marriage to a heroin addict in Los Angeles.  Since he seemed to respond honestly, I answered in kind.  We exchanged a few emails and I gave him my number in case he wanted to call.  The long and short of it was he did.  We spoke for 3 hours I think.

For the first time in my life, I didn't try to hide anything about myself.  I called it my George Kostanza plan.  Do everything the opposite of what I normally did.  In our first phone call I told him anything I thought might be a red flag to him.  I am horrible with money, I have been a little slutty, and I am not an alcoholic...but probably drink more than I should.  He asked me out anyway. He was a little more vague, but interesting all the same.  He made me laugh.

Our first date was good but not earth shattering.  We had a lot in common.  Both married previously, both divorced about the same amount of time.  Both educated in our own way.  Both financially OK.  He has an adult son, I have none.  Both our parents are about the same age, from the same part of the country.  Just basically we mapped out well.  Sometimes that means nothing, but I did find myself unusually attracted however and found myself hoping he'd ask me out again.  And he did. 

By day 10 (not date!) I told him I thought I was falling in love with him.  He told me he didn't think he was falling in love with me.  He WAS in love with me.  In a previous conversation he told me he'd only told those words to four other people in his whole life.  I was scared and excited at the same time.

By November he had gone on a four day retreat with me, I had gone on a family intervention with him. I told him I never wanted to spend a night without him and he moved in the next night. 

By December, we had plans for a cruise in February and he had told me he would be asking me to marry him SOON.  When we went to my home state for Christmas, I knew he'd be meeting my family for the first time and informing my father of his intentions.  He asked me to marry him days before Christmas.  I said yes.  We made a plan for a church wedding in August so as not to alarm anyone.

In January, I had a business trip to Las Vegas.  We made plans for him to join me at the tail end so we could enjoy the weekend.  On Thursday he arrived and we spoke at length as to why we would NOT get married on a whim in Vegas.  By Saturday's early morning...I had changed my mind and woke him up to tell him so.  He told me we would discuss it at dawn.  By 6am he told me he asked me to be his wife for a reason and if I was willing to get married now, nothing would hold him back.  By 5pm that night...we were.

Our February cruise turned into our honeymoon. It was a fantastic trip filled with laughter, unrequited stress, unbelievable sex, and intense professions of love.

It is now May.  Both of us are more in love than we ever thought possible.  We have both dated and slept with an substantial number of people.  We have both thought we were in love before...but nothing we encountered in the past comes close to what we seem to be experiencing now. We are completely committed to keeping no secrets from each other.  I have handed over all my diaries since I was sixteen.  He has given me every autobiographical writing he's ever attempted.  We both defy our entire concept of what we thought we wanted in a mate (ME: if you have no car, no job, no friends, AND don't want to have sex with me I'm your girl!) (Him: If you cannot commit/don't want to commit OR are a stripper...I'm your man!).  I go to church most Sundays. He's an ex-Army paratrooper/Cowboy.

We still have plans for our August wedding.  Both our families think this is the best thing that has ever happened to either of us.

Does true love really exist and can two people in the middle of their jaded lives actually find it?  We think we have.

The original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19e2qf/she_needs_some_space_but_i_feel_like_ive_already/

I met up with her and things felt initially awkward, like we hardly knew each other. We decided to grab some dinner and we loosened up a little and kissed, then thanked me for giving her some space. She told me how she was getting stressed out with work and that she didn't want to take it out on me... Whether that's true or not is another matter, but I'll keep an eye on that.

We went to the event and everything was fine, like there was nothing wrong - we danced, laughed, kissed. That kind of annoying couple everyone hates. We went back to her place and were falling asleep when she cuddled up and half-asleep asked ""Why do you bother with me?"", in the context I read that as ""I'm acting like a dick lately, why have you not left me?"". She quit smoking for around a month and at times she was a bitch and cranky, but she seemed surprised that I stayed with her through that. I don't know if she'd come to expect that, at the first sign of adversity people jumped ship.

As we were lying there she kept telling me she loved me and cuddled up periodically, which was kinda cute. Morning came, and again, it was like everything was back to normal, gave me a kiss, told me that she loved me very much and went off to work. Text on her lunch break to ask how my day had been which I appreciated.

Things didn't turn out as bad as I was expecting (yet), but all the comments people have made are valid so I'm keeping my whits about me and holding my cards closer to my chest.

tl;dr       She seemed to have snapped out of it whilst she had her space. We're still together, for now. 

Thanks for all the comments and insights people have made. 

**Edit:** Wow. Well again, thanks for all the feedback and my apologies for not getting back to people sooner.

1349376581.0,98,self.relationships,10y79p,I (27F) am considering divorcing my (39M) husband.,cantusemyname,130,32,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10y79p/i_27f_am_considering_divorcing_my_39m_husband/,"This is pretty difficult for me to write considering how torn I am on the issue. But it’s something I think about every day and for that reason alone, I have to get it out. I’m going to leave out some details (exact locations, dates, etc)  because if anyone I knew were to read it, I’d be found out immediately and as of this moment, only one person in the entire world knows I have these thoughts. 

I have been with my husband for eight years. We’ve only been married for one, and in a long distance relationship for almost all of the previous years. It has been a bit over a year since I packed up and moved away from Canada, where I was born and raised and where my entire family resides. We went through a lengthy visa process, and we now currently live in the US. This is important, because I believe my homesickness is adding to our problems.

We have a few major issues in our marriage that don’t seem to be getting resolved. We fight. A lot. Once a week, on a good week. And I’m not talking about minor disagreements. I’m talking about screaming, crying, someone leaves the house angry kind of fights. They are never about anything important. They are about little disagreements getting blown way out of proportion and then they turn into arguments about everything we EVER argue about, if that makes sense. If he asks me a question and doesn’t like the way I respond (meaning my tone of voice or my actual response) then it all goes downhill. It snowballs so quickly that I struggle to keep up. 

To give a better example, our fight last week. He asked me a question two or three times in a row. I’m not sure if he didn’t understand my response or if he just wasn’t listening, but by the third time, I repeated my answer in an exasperated tone. It was over then and there. That small incident, my irritated tone of voice, turned into a screaming fight that lasted hours. It turned into me being a bitch, me never talking to him with any respect, me talking to him like I don’t even like him. And I sit on the couch in a daze because I’m thinking “What the hell just happened?” And these arguments go on for so long that they turn into arguments about other things that I thought were long forgotten. 

My husband is a very defensive person, who takes literally everything personally and I struggle to convince him that not everything is an attack against him. So those little arguments like the one above turn into him calling himself an asshole, saying he must be the worst husband in the world since I talk to him like he is, etc. If I ask him to clean the bathroom and he doesn’t, and I remind him the next day, he’ll say he must be a disgusting slob since I nag him so much. It feels like I cannot say anything to him without him thinking it’s a personal thing. The other day I was cleaning our kitchen, and I was getting frustrated with a stain that I couldn’t get out of something, and muttering under my breath about it. Nothing to him, nothing to anything, just a “what the fuck is this shit, why can’t I get this out?” kind of thing. And he told me to stop, because I was making him feel lazy, since he wasn’t helping.  Even though he asked if he could help and I said “no, but thank you”.

It’s exhausting. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t say things if I don’t think he’ll like what I have to say. I keep things to myself because it’s just easier. I never know what’s going to set him off on a self deprecating rant. No matter how many times I say “I’m allowed to feel this way about something, it doesn’t mean it negatively reflects you”… it simply does not register.  So I keep almost everything to myself if it’s not something 100% positive, but then in an argument, it all comes out and it’s just a mess. In his world, I am not allowed to be annoyed with anything that a) isn’t his fault or b) isn’t something he can fix. I am not allowed to simply be in a bad mood. If I am, it’s because of him. And if it can’t do anything about it, then he calls himself all kinds of names, pouts a lot, and eventually leaves the house.  And it’s every time. He screams, he paces, he calls me a bitch on occasion, he tells me I’m selfish but won’t tell me why when I ask why he’s reacting this way.

Our sex life is another issue. We rarely have sex. I don’t know why, but this is something we will both take responsibility for. I don’t initiate, he doesn’t initiate, so it just doesn’t happen. It’s not that we both don’t want it, because we do, we just never make the effort. And when we talk about it, we both admit that it’s a problem and we both want to resolve it but then nothing happens. He says I need to initiate to fix it, but I think that’s putting too much responsibility on my shoulders when it’s a problem for both of us. It’s like we’re both just sitting there, waiting for the other person to take control and do something about it and nobody does. 

He doesn’t even sleep in the same bed as me anymore. He says I go to bed too early, so he just falls asleep on the couch in the living room and never comes to bed. I’ve asked him repeatedly to sleep in the same bed as I do, and he will for a night or two, but then goes back to the couch. Kind of hard to initiate anything if “our” bedroom is only my bedroom and we don’t even sleep together. 

I also have trust issues. Without going into detail, I have reasons to believe he is not honest with me about a lot of things. I have, a few times, found out that he has been talking to other women. I have found online dating profiles that he laughs off and tells me aren’t serious. I have found him sexting other women. He has accidentally sent me sexually suggestive messages that were clearly meant for someone else because they were in response to a regular conversation. He tells me he has never physically cheated on me, but he likes to flirt and thinks it’s harmless. I’ve told him that it’s not harmless because it hurts ME, and it hasn’t happened in months, but the times it has happened stick with me because I don’t believe his explanations. 

I haven’t seen my family in a year, through no fault of anyone’s. It’s expensive, I can’t take time off of work for long enough to justify the plane ticket at the moment. And I know this is making me miserable and I know that our arguments can sometimes fall on my shoulders. He is all I have here. He has friends he sees on a regular basis but I have him. And that puts a lot of pressure on our relationship, because when it isn’t going well, I feel completely and utterly alone. Everyone I know and love is in another country and I can call them, but it isn’t the same.

Our arguments and the way we treat each other in general is making me want to leave. I can’t handle any more of his freak outs about nothing. I can’t handle his laziness. He’ll do a house chore if I specifically ask him to, but even then, it might take him a day or two. If I give up and do it myself, then he gets mad at me for not letting him do it and treating him like he’s a slob. I just don’t even feel like we’re husband and wife at this point. I feel like we’re two friends who are kind of sick of each other and just living under the same roof. We have our routine. Get up, go to work, come home, watch tv, go to sleep in separate rooms. Wake up, repeat. 

I feel like this isn’t what a marriage should be. Not a freaking year into it. It’s like we’ve been married forever and have nothing left to say to each other. That’s not to say we don’t enjoy each other’s company, because we do. I believe he is a good person, with good values that reflect my own, and I believe we both love each other very much. But I’m starting to believe that we were not meant to be married because our arguments never get resolved, and nobody does anything to fix anything. Things just fester and I think I’m starting to resent him for it.  Harmless things he does will annoy me simply because I’m not happy. But I don’t say anything, because I don’t feel like arguing anymore. 

I’m so torn because he is a good man. I love him, he loves me, we want the best for each other. But I don’t feel our relationship the way it is accurately reflects our feelings for each other. I feel like we’re just going through the motions. He says he is miserable. I am miserable but don’t say that I am. Then part of me believes I want to “give up” because I miss home and the idea of going home sounds wonderful to me. Part of me wonders if I just want a way out and I’m using our fights as an excuse. But then another argument happens and I say “I cannot do this anymore”… but then we give each other the silent treatment until it blows over and nothing gets resolved and we go back to our routine. It would be so much easier if he was an asshole, or if I didn’t love him, but he’s not and I do. 

I have no idea what to do. I’ve thought about counseling but considering his attitude towards anything that he does that might be criticized, I can’t see it going well. It may not be fair to already write it off before trying it, but from my experience, if he isn’t told he’s perfect then he throws a fit. 

Any advice?  I’m sorry this is rambly, but I don’t know how to accurately describe what’s happening to my relationship. I try to be objective. I try to see our arguments through someone else’s eyes. I try to see if I’m doing anything that’s setting him off on these rants, but I honestly don’t see it. I don’t see what I’m doing to be yelled at over something stupid like my tone of voice.

There are good days where I feel bad for even considering leaving, but then there are days when I think “Ok, I need to go, this isn’t going to work”… those days just go back and forth and I never do anything about it because I’m scared of making the wrong decision. I’m scared of what will happen if I do. I’m scared that I’ll leave and want to come back. I’m scared of crawling back home to Canada to the people I miss so much, admitting that I failed. Something needs to happen but I don’t know what anymore.

**Update:** I think it’s pretty obvious/inevitable that I broke up with him. We met in the lobby of our favorite museum and did the old song and dance – he said he was sorry, I said I never lied to him or gave him a reason to cheat. A highlight from our conversation:

Me: “Why did you do it?”

Him: “Well, I don’t see you that often.”

Me: “So I have to babysit you in order to make sure you don’t cheat on me?”

I told him that one of my friends is coming on vacation with me, and I won’t pay him back a single cent. He walked out of the museum. I checked my phone and saw that the girl had sent me another message – very lengthy, and going into a lot of detail about how my ex-SO’s friend introduced them, how they wound up getting drunk and going back to her place, etc. 

So I caught up with him outside the museum and told him to look at the message and then look me in the eye to tell me if it was true or not. He couldn’t; he tried to walk away. I blocked him. He said he didn’t want to argue with me; I said he can’t argue because he doesn’t have a leg to stand on – he just has to stand there and take it from me. He said he wanted to go somewhere else and talk, he didn’t want to be publicly shamed. I said, “This is New York f-ing City – there are people everywhere. And being publicly shamed is what you deserve.”

I feel like an idiot believing that we had a future together, that I was about to introduce him to my family. Thank you, Reddit, for giving me the courage to kick him to the curb. And what some of you have said is true: it’s not so much the cheating that hurts – it’s the fact that he lied and never planned on telling me.

Lastly, I told him I was glad he was moving to New Jersey (he’s moving there for work), because New York is my f-ing city, and he doesn’t deserve to be here.

He has a stable job, a place to live and we've been dating for about 4-5 months now. 

I've never thought of myself as the jealous type before, certainly not to the point of wanting my SO to cut off ties to friends. However, before my boyfriend and I got together, he and another girl arranged to have her come stay for a ""friends with benefits"" type thing. 
He and I got together, and that plan went out the window. 

This girl is struggling financially, and I know my boyfriend wants to help her out in any way he can. I've had a tough time swallowing my own jealousy, knowing she and he have had a sexual relationship before we met, and that she continues to try to cultivate it whilst we're together. 

Tonight as I spoke to him on the phone, he was telling me about all her financial struggles and I truly felt sorry for her. I suggested perhaps that he take her under his wing for a while, until she can get back on her feet. He paused and made a sort of coughing sound, before letting me know it ""might not be a good idea"". I asked why not, and he stated (confirming my own fears) that she still had romantic feelings for him. 

I asked whether or not he'd be able to control himself around her, and he went silent. I asked whether or not he was sexually attracted to her, again, silence. About a minute later he replied ""...I don't want her staying with me because it would jeopardise our relationship."" 

I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. I *know* I should appreciate that he was honest and even denied a friend in need to make sure he wouldn't do anything regrettable, but I can't shake that feeling of jealousy. 

What can I do? How do I tell him that it's inappropriate for him to be pining after a close female friend when he and I are together?  ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_sv5zk,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sv5zk/my_boyfriends_female_friend_has_romantic_feelings/,
1334328613.0,102,self.relationships,s7zkc,My boyfriend won't stop hanging out with the guy who raped my roommate.,xnrive,139,37,241,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s7zkc/my_boyfriend_wont_stop_hanging_out_with_the_guy/,"We're all college seniors (21/22 years old), except the guy who raped my roommate is more like 24 as he was on academic probation for a while.  BF and I have been together for ~3.5 years.  We were all close friends before this, now my roommate doesn't hang out with any of the boys.


*This all happened about 1.5 years ago.  The rapist was friends with my bf and his roommates for a while, when an indecent happened between him and my friend (who is now my roommate).  The guy probably does not consider himself to be a rapist, as although my friend/roommate said no verbally clearly and multiple times, she did not physically resist him until penetration, at which point she forced him off and kicked him out of her apartment.  She also later found out that he has genital herpes, which he didn't tell her.  She opted not to press charges although she had a very solid case (including rape kit), but has been in counselling and seems to be emotionally fine now.  Of course, she absolutely can't stand to be in the same room as the rapist.*

*After said incident, my boyfriend and his roommates all stopped hanging out with the rapist.  He probably doesn't consider himself to be a rapist as I said, and he didn't really know why everyone stopped hanging out with him.  Because of that, one of my boyfriend's roommates had a chat with him.  I don't know what was said, but after that chat (about 1 year ago), BF's roommate and the rapist were very friendly again.  My boyfriend and his other roommates continued to ignore the guy unless forced to interact with him.*


****italicized stuff is semi-relevant backstory... tl;dr of it is that my rooomate got raped by some guy 1.5 years ago, who everyone shut out for a while, but one of my bf's roommates started hanging out with him again 1 year ago ****


Anyway, now that ME3 has come out, my boyfriend is suddenly hanging out with the guy again.  It's a 4-player game, so my bf, his roommate, the guy, and a fourth friend all play together.  They don't know anyone else who plays so it HAS to be the four of them, or else they pick up a random online.  They're suddenly friendly again and it really bothers me.  Even when he isn't coming over, I can hear his voice over the microphone on the game and it really grates on my nerves, as I feel that he shouldn't be hanging out with this asswipe.  My boyfriend doesn't invite the guy over, but will now hang out with him whenever his roommate brings him over (whereas before he'd go into his room and not hang out with him).

I've tried talking to him about it, he seems to think that I'm overreacting and it happened so long ago that I shouldn't care much anymore.  I know my roommate wants to cause as little drama as possible, and she probably doesn't want anyone to confront the guy (bad idea anyway).  She previously said she was fine with them being friends with the rapist, but her actions have said otherwise as she now almost never hangs out with my bf or his roommate.  My BF thinks that because she said it was OK it was actually OK, IMO she just wants to avoid drama and doesn't want to control who people hang out with.

I don't want to tell him he can't be friends with this guy, but at the same time, what kind of person remains friends with somebody who rapes a friend of yours?  I'm not comfortable around him and it bothers me that my boyfriend can be buddies with him again, regardless of how long ago it happened.  

What should I do?  I want him to stop hanging out with this guy (or at the very least, not bring him over when I'm around), but I don't want to control who he's friends with or tell him what to do too much.

**tl;dr of the whole thing- boyfriend recently started hanging out with a rapist, doesn't think it's wrong as the rape happened 1.5 years ago**

EDIT- thanks for the advice everyone.  There's some debate over whether or not this is rape, what really happened, etc.  I really don't think that's relevant because I, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's roommate all believe my roommate's story.  Nobody doubts what happened, regardless of whether he was prosecuted or not, so it's not as if my boyfriend's coming at this from the viewpoint that maybe the guy is innocent (he doesn't think that all and was extremely upset with the guy when it happened and for a good while after).  Whether or not strangers on the internet think my friend is lying is hardly helpful to me, since nobody irl seems to think that as far as I know.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_s7zkc,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s7zkc/my_boyfriend_wont_stop_hanging_out_with_the_guy/,

I'm 21m. My SO is 23F, we've been dating for 3 years. My best friend is 22F, we've been friends since 7th grade.

My SO and I have been going through a rough patch lately. She moved 3 hours away for a job a few months ago and things have just gotten tensed between us. She came over yesterday for Valentines Day and, judging from what just happened, it seems like she just doesn't care about me anymore.

About two weeks back my friend gave me a picture she painted. She got new art supplies and it was the first thing she painted, and she said she thought that I would like it. And I did, it was really well done, but it meant a lot more to me than just that. I believe that was the first present I've ever been given (I grew up in a really poor family, so I never got birthday/Christmas presents, I didn't have a graduation party, and my SO has never bought me anything even though I've asked for something small like a card before), so I was really excited about it. 

I mentioned it, probably more than once, to my SO, but she never said anything about it.

Back to yesterday, she came over as planned. We talk for a bit nd I'm pretty happy because this is the first I've seen her in over a month, but she sees the painting my friend gave me (I had it hanging on the wall) and freaks out. She yells at me and tells me it's ugly and I should take it down. I don't really say anything until she calms down, and once she does she apologized.

I knew that things were kind of rough between us and I wanted to show her I still cared and thought about her, so I planned to make a special dinner.  I found a recipe for a meal that I know she likes that can be made within my constrains (only have a hotplate, toaster oven, and electric kettle) and I spent every dollar I had (literally) buying the ingredients at the grocery store.

I then spent almost two hours making it. When I was finally done and we sat done to eat. After taking like 3 bites she says it's gross and says something about how I don't care about her because I'm not taking her out on Valentines Day. I told her that I wanted to take her out but I just couldn't afford it.

Immediately after that she gets up and says that we're going to McDonalds. Whatever. When we get there, I'm not sure if she's expecting to pay for both of us or if she expects me to pay for myself. I didn't have more than $0.25 to my name, so I just didn't order anything because I didn't want to make her mad by asking her. Fortunately this didn't cause any more problems.

Things settled down again once we got home. I ate some of the meal I prepared then we just watched some movies and talked. I asked her if she could give me a couple bucks so I could buy groceries until I get paid (literally the only food I had in the house was the meal I made, spices, and ketchup packets). She kind of laughed it off and changed the subject. She stayed the night and planned to drive back early tomorrow (she has work at 9 today).

Then we both woke up at like 4AM. She gets ready to leave, and before she does, I ask her if she can lend me a few bucks again. This time she just totally ignored me and left. 

About two hours ago I realized that my painting was missing. The only thing that could have happened to it was my SO threw it away, or took it I guess. I've been texting and calling her, but she hasn't responded. I'm furious right now and want my painting back. I really feel like we may break up if she doesn't give it back asap. I can't even put into words how pissed off I am at her over all of this.

Any advice will be helpful. I have class soon, but I'll be able to read responses during my lunch break.

He was cheating on me. I did not expect this at all and am in disbelief. One of our mutual friends (more of my friend) informed me that he had been going out with a girl for the past 3 days. She saw him messaging her through his laptop and told me a gist of what their conversation was about. It was basically them pouring their heart out for each other, sending each other love songs, quotes, etc.


I confronted him over FB chat immediately, telling him that I couldn't believe what he did. He denied it at first, then admitted it, and apologized, felt bad, etc etc. The thing is, he doesn't regret it. He was honest with me and said that he use to like her when he was young, and didn't realize how strongly he felt about her until he met her up in Asia (She lives there and they met when they were in grade school. She came to visit U.S. once or twice and they hung out before we were together). He said it just ""happened"" (bullshit). He cheated on me 3 days ago and told me that he has been wanting to tell me but didn't know how to. I didn't even let him explain what they exactly did together because it was already enough. I couldn't bare to hear it.


He even had the nerve to Skype me 2 days ago and have a normal conversation (Although I can tell he was a little off) Also, he told my friend that he started to feel distant from me right when he left our hometown (in U.S.) and wanted to break up with me before he cheated. I know none of this is credible since he did not do anything that he said.


I just feel so hurt. I'm in disbelief. I seriously thought he was the perfect boyfriend. We had a healthy relationship... I trusted him with my whole heart. I could trust him to go club with his friends, go to parties, sleepover at his girl friends house, because I thought that he loved me so much and would never do anything to hurt me or disrespect our relationship in any way. Even the way he looked at me... I thought he was in love with me.


I've dated many guys in the past and I can safely say that he was (is, whatever) the only one I truly loved. He was the closest person to me.. Our personalities were like one. There were no red flags whatsoever.. I'm in shock. Its hard for me to eat, sleep, or do anything... And it hurts more knowing that him hooking up with her (and having feelings for her) on this vacation is worth more than 1.5 years of our relationship...


I hope that this does not scar me in the long-run.. I am already feeling so insecure but I am trying to be strong.


I just wanted to update you guys on the outcome of this whole situation. I'm also thankful for everyone who took the time to read my posts and post replies. I appreciate it.

Then I get kicked out of the bed and told to go sleep on the couch if I'm that disgusted by her.  She does this multiple times a week...

I packed up a lot of my stuff and I left today. My previous attempt to break up with her resulted me in agreeing on stuff I really didn't want but some how agreed on so I decided I would leave a letter. It has been more stressful than I could have imagined. I asked her to give us some time before she contacted me in the letter, but as soon as she realized I was gone she went hunting for me. She went to my grandparents house and asked if I was there and then cried. My grandparents told her that things would be okay and that she should give it some time and to text me. 

She called, but I left my phone on silent and in another room all day. I am afraid to listen to the messages. I don't want to hurt her and I want to make her happy, but I don't think there is anything I can do. I am paying for my half of the rent still and I left her the resources she needs to follow her dreams. I am tempted to text her and let her know I am fine and that she should move on, but right now I am silent. Maybe setup a time in a few days to sit down and get the rest of our things in order.

1355194734.0,98,self.relationships,14n69o,My stepmother thinks I'm a devil worshipper and is taking unruly actions against me.,,119,21,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14n69o/my_stepmother_thinks_im_a_devil_worshipper_and_is/,"About 2 months ago I moved into my dad's house as my parents are divorced and I thought it would be cool to get away from my mom and brother for a little bit. Throughout those two months I have been avoided like the plague and sometimes shot resentful glares from everyone except my own father. The members of this house are Me, 16 male, father 49 male, step mother 29 female, step mother daughter # 1 13, daughter #2 26 mo., daughter #3 4 mo., stepmother's mother above 65 somewhere. Her entire family does not talk to me or look at me, despite us all being part of a family and them having been married for 3 or 4 years. 

About 3 weeks ago, I asked step mom for movie money because my dad was out of town, step mom did not like this and sent me a brick wall of text outlining that she did not like me for two reasons - 1. I don't wash my own clothes. 2. I walk around the house sometimes in only boxers. 
her reasoning behind this is that it disrespects her that I do these things. I had no knowledge of anything I had done wrong before this besides the obvious hints. I fixed them regardless immediately.

2 weeks ago she confronts before I head off to school claiming that she ""knows I'm a devil worshipper"" and ""has found everything that I hide in the house that does not belong"". The purpose of these items is to ""pray tot he devil that my step mom and my dad break up."" These items don't exist. I go to church more than her. I don't care that they are married, for it has never affected me prior this incident really. Throughout the confrontation I was calm and collected, standing by my defense as having no knowledge of what she is talking about and that I have nothing against her, along with apologizing. Whenever I left she was still up in arms against and not willing to make amends. I said nothing of offense during said conversation in fear that it will prevent future positive relationships, however she did not show the same reserve of the tongue. 

From there it only gets worse as time progresses.

Throughout the past 2 weeks I have encountered several things she has done that makes me uncomfortable:

* Multiple times a day, mostly whenever I come downstairs or into the kitchen, step mom or step mother loudly pray that jesus is their savior and turn up their passion of the christ movie in the living room next to the kitchen. This movie has been played well into the double digits over the past 3 weeks. They have also done this when nobody is in the living room as late as 2 in the morning. 

* Step mom has placed multiple crosses hanging on the wall directly in front of the exit to my room.

* Step mom often checks my room for absolutely no reason during the day, I can tell because things are misplaced.

* Step mom stole my pillow, this one made me angry however I did not say anything. It was my favorite pillow. It was my softest pillow. I did not give her permission to touch anything in my room. I still do not know the whereabouts of my beloved.

* Whenever I am downstairs step mother also likes to loudly converse with her mother that she checks everywhere in the house for demon items because it is ""HER"" house and she has that right. (In reality, she has no job and has only lived here for 3 or 4 years, versus me going to this house 2 or 3 days of the week since it was bought by my (diligent) dad because my parents are divorced. 

* Today upon arriving home I noticed the remains of a spoon that was bent 3 times and broken that was placed directly in front of my computer. This spoon is significant because it was a ""devil worshipping"" item of mine.

* Step mom has called me a fatass a few times because I have eaten all of a substance. I didn't mean to because I didn't know it was something other than a luxury food that I was in the mood for. To give this some perspective I am 6'2"" and about 165 lbs. In the past two weeks I have only eaten 7 meals at this house. 


I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I don't know how to approach this problem because it is so unusual. I have been extremely tolerant and patient showing no signs of hatred or irritation/anger this entire time that I have been harassed. I am a nice person, I do charity work, I exercise, I watch my sister's kid often, and I clean up after myself very well. I cannot think of anything that caused this to happen.

This extreme isolation and resentment must not continue, but I don't know what to do. If it was up to me I'd put step mom in a mental institution. (It's important to note that step mom's mom was nice to me prior these last 6 weeks, even talking to me on occasions.) This is causing me great stress in addition to my numerous AP courses and just school in general. 

This is my first post in this subreddit and I don't know if I did everything write. Help me please.

**TL;DR - Step mom thinks I'm a devil worshipper, makes my life unnecessarily hard, stressful, and isolated.**

Edit: I've told my dad that step mom was all over me for silly things previously, he claims that he knows and ""sets her straight immediately."" It doesn't work. He allows the jesus crap because he is a devout christian. I'd also like to add women have been with my dad before solely because he is very well off financially and he already has to pay his ex wife money. I do not want to devastate my dad and cause a divorce because I'll be going off to college and I do not want to have to go to a lesser college because some Psycho Bitch (+1 to Brad_Wesley) gets money from him every other week.

Also, this sounds stupid, but I have a lot of pride about this. I don't want to move back to my mother's immediately and allow the leech to continue leeching. Something must be done, however I cannot think of a perfect solution.

Edit 2: I've asked to play baseball with my dad later today to talk about the issues. Also, There is a camera set up in my room for the time I am away at school today. 

Update: Shit hit the fan. 
I left my laptop camera on for the day, came home, laptop closed, journals ripped up, dad is angry at me because I ""drove her"" up the wall and she's scared. She denies everything. Pictures didn't help my case very much. Gathered necessities and laptop. Left. Dad's still angry at me. He said he'll ""speak with her"" about it. Won't do shit. My life is fucked.

I don't think my wife loves me anymore. We have been together for 10 years and married for 5. I was traveling a few months ago for a family funeral and she picked me up at the airport and we went to eat. During the meal she says she is unhappy and has been so for a very long time (even going back to before we were married). I was silent for a long time and just sat with the pit in my stomach. We left the restaurant and I ran across the street to buy flowers, which were received coolly. She hasn't gone into any specifics of why she just said that although she is not ""in love"" with me she still has some feels and would be willing to see a counselor. For TWO MONTHS I have called and emailed every individual counselor and larger therapy organizations I could find in Washington, DC to no avail. Things are cordial but cold at home, but we have opposite schedules and really only see each other once a week (I told her I would change my schedule even change jobs if needed, she said no.) I really need to find a counselor soon to help us communicate before we are faced with the inevitable. TL;DR! Dire need of marriage counselor in Washington, DC to help save my marriage.

[Edit] Most of the individual counselors have been part of a group (ie Women's Center, Whitman-Walker, etc) They are really ALL booked or Not doing couples therapy.) The rest have not returned my vm/ems.

[Edit] I understand our time together is limited (although I felt it was for the greater good, more money for off hour shifts, save for house and our own business etc), this limited time affects (50% I get that usage right) our travel to and from counseling. So we're trying to keep it close to where we live/work.

Brain is full of fuck.,PleaseDispose,137,41,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12x9ns/gfs_22f_iud_failed_shes_a_mess_im_28m_probably_a/,"I'm typing this out first because I have absolutely no idea what I'm even asking right now.  I'm also noticing that this may be one of the most unfortunate user names in reddit history.

Background: I'm 28, she's 22.  We've been together for 2 years 9 months and lived together for 2 years 3 months.  Marriage has been discussed and is something we're going to do once we work through our current financial issues.

We figured out pretty early on that we wanted a more effective form of birth control than condoms or the pill, so after some research we decided on a Paragard IUD.  As long as the body doesn't reject it in the first year, it has an effective rate of anywhere between 99.5% and 99.8%.  Two years pass and we have no issues, until two weeks ago when she got a wave of nausea that wouldn't go away.

Last week, we found out why. Currently she's in her seventh week.  She had the IUD removed, and it's thankfully not an ectopic pregnancy.  Still, there's still an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth and other complications for her.  We talked about things and we decided to abort, with an appointment scheduled for next week.

She's worried that if she goes through with it that I'd look at her as a murderer and that I'd think less of her and resent her afterwards.  I assured her that wouldn't be the case and that anything that happens would be because of *our* decision, so wouldn't dare hold anything against her.  Still, I don't think those thoughts are going to leave her any time soon.

She's also worried about denying the baby a chance to become something.  She looked at an adoption website and we both broke down seeing the stories of so many couples.  It just seems so fucking unfair that there are so many people who want nothing more than a child to call their own and here we are - who do everything possible to *avoid* having a baby - and we're stuck with one.  What's worse, I can't even bring myself to think about adoption because that would mean putting my GF at risk for complications, and if a doctor ever told me only one could be saved, I'm picking my GF 11 times out of 10.  Every time those worries come up, we discuss different options, but we've kept coming back to abortion being the best one.

I'm worried about a couple different things.  First, she self-harms. She used to cut herself a few times a week.  Once she moved in with me, we worked to get to a point where she goes 6-12 months between cuts.  However, she's already cut a couple days ago and I fear that if she does go through with the abortion, she'll think that she needs to punish herself and cut more.

Second, I don't know who I can talk to outside of anonymous internet ranting.  I haven't been able to spend much time with my friends over the last few months because of my work schedule, and it just doesn't feel right to jump back in and say, ""hey, how ya been?  Oh yeah, I'm aborting a child, let's talk.""  I'm not close enough to anyone at work to talk about something like this.  I don't want to put this on my sister because she just went through a miscarriage herself.  And my mom... I love her to death, but she's wanted grandkids for a while.  Even though I *know* she'd support me in any decision I make, I know that at least a part of her would be disappointed.

We're both at the point where we're hoping for a miscarriage because it means all of this would be out of our hands. (She said it, but I had been thinking it for a while.)  That thought comforts me... until I realize that I'm openly hoping for my girlfriend to miscarry, which reminds me how fucked up I am right now.  I don't even know what I'm asking at this point, reddit.  Just tell me something.  Anything.  Help.

Not sure what to think of the situation.,confusedthrowaway969,125,26,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ytnph/gf_hanging_out_with_a_dude_not_sure_what_to_think/,"Ill try to make this as short as possible without omitting anything important.

**tl;dr:**  So I recently left the country for about a month and upon my return found out my GF has been hanging out a lot with a guy we both know from work. Am I overreacting? Is it bad that I thing a girl in a relationship shouldn't be going on ""nights out"" one on one with single guy?

**Before I left** - We are in an awesome relationship, very much in love and happy. The guy is a mutual co-worker of ours. He is a few years older [me and gf are 18, he's 22] and has flirted with my GF before we were ever dating; I know that he at least has his eye set on her. In one instance, he was flirting really heavily with the GF and  after a conversation with her I told her that I think that it's not cool that hes so obviously flirting with her. So she knows I don't like him. Now, due to the nature of our job we are not allowed to disclose the fact that we are dating so this guy didn't know for a while. Recently the GF told me she did tell him that we were in fact dating. (I can explain why I think this actually may be a lie)

When I left on my trip, knowing that I don't like him, she called me to ask if it was okay for her to go to his party; this was during the first few days of my absence. Of course, I don't own my GF and I trust her completely so I say of course it's okay for her to go.... Now fast forward to me coming home from my trip; I find out a few interesting things. I find out that over my absence they have been hanging out a LOT [4-5 times a week] and what upsets me is the fact that she didn't tell me. Now my girlfriend claims they just hang out as friends, but, the type of things he asks her to do are really iffy and uncomfortably close to dates: They go get coffee, dinner, go to movies and cupcake tastings (don't even ask??). 




    
    **TODAY:** Call from GF ""I know you wont like what I'm about to ask you.... but [DUDE] wants to go to a movie is that okay?""
    
    Me: ""Are you inviting me with you guys or asking if you can go""
    
    Her: ""Oh... [pause] yeah I guess you can come.""
    
    Me: ""hold up a minute let me ask my parents if I can grab the car""
    
    We talk about something unrelated and the conversation ends.
    
    Several minutes later I get a text : ""So are you going to go?""
    
    ""Yep! Got the car :)""
    
    ""Oh never mind, he's actually going to go to the casino""
    




This conversation is messing with me a little, the fact that she intended to go alone with him, the fact that as soon as she found out I'm going he can't go all of a sudden are all bad signs in my mind.





Now for the interesting part: I believe my girlfriend actually does believe that they are hanging out as friends, and doesn't realize that what she's doing is not cool at all.



OR AM I JUST CRAZY AND SHOULD LET THEM CHILL. IM FREAKING THE FUCK OUT, I LOVE THIS GIRL. :)

Everything was going really well with our relationship until about a month ago. He asked me to move in with him (very soon in my opinion) and everything changed.

The first weekend that I had begun to move things in, turned into a five-day bender on behalf of his best friend and twin brother. They both stayed WAY beyond their welcome, and since neither of them have jobs, they were both up playing video games from dusk until dawn, yelling through their headphones and so forth.

Don't get me wrong, gamers: I love to play. I'm a huge fan of games like Uncharted and Skyrim, I'm very into puzzles and tons of quests to complete and so forth, it is actually something that my boyfriend and I bonded over, because I LOVE to just watch him play. That said, the same isn't exactly true for games like LOL, and while I normally wouldn't mind an evening of video games, I can't really participate with them from behind the scenes, and where things really came to a head was when I had to get up at 6AM for work, they didn't, and they had been up until about 5AM playing the game and keeping me up. This compounded by the fact that it was the fifth day in a row, I was quite tired and irritated with the whole scene.

The same day - while at the bf's soccer game with my sister and grandmother in tow, his best friend yelled at me upon first sight that he was going to 'punch me in the vag' for waking him up this morning (he is referring to me making 'too much noise' at 11AM as I got ready to leave, and interrupting his slumber). He yelled this in front of a crowd of people, and my grandmother, and believe me when I say that this is very 'par for the course' for this best friend and the crass way that he speaks to me. He is constantly telling me to shut up, and degrading me at every turn. He then proceeded to yell to all of his friends ""party at (my boyfriend)'s house! invite your friends!"" right in front of me, knowing that I was clearly not up for night number six of drunken screaming until 5AM with work the next day.

When I sat down and talked to the bf about all of this, he informed me that his best friend had a very different version of that story, and that essentially I was being accused of being a liar and making the whole thing up. This was where I drew the line. Despite profuse apologies for siding with his friend and accusing me of lying and manipulating, he has completely checked out of the relationship ever since. He doesn't invite me to do anything with his friends or family, and most recently when I surprised him with tickets to see Avengers together opening night at midnight like we had planned for weeks, he informed me that he was going with his friends and that essentially I wasn't really welcome to come.

It has been five days and we haven't spoken more than six words to each other, and he's been sleeping on the couch and attached to his computer the entire time. Time to tell him to kick rocks? I just moved in, what do I do? I don't even know if this is fixable at this point...

tl;dr Boyfriend's best friend is rude to me, comes over to the house we share together (we are 27 &amp; 28 yrs old) for days at a time to play games and when I ask him to keep it down nights before work tell the boyfriend I'm rude and lying about what he says/does. Is this fixable?

There are no kids and we don't plan to have any in the near future. We've been together for 6 years and married for 2.

Up until about 6 months ago, my husband played a video game called Runescape. He'd been playing it for 9 years and had put over 300 days of play into his character. I tried it but never played it after that week, but he really enjoyed it. About 8 months ago he started playing it a lot more and that really annoyed me for some reason.

He'd basically play it for hours and hours every single day. He still spent plenty of time with me and didn't change his work schedule, but he'd often wake up early just so he could play his game. And if he had free time, that was basically all he did. That really annoyed me so I asked him to play less. After that didn't work I just flat out told him I wanted him to stop playing. He agreed and just stopped playing.

I don't know what came over me. It's not like he was spending a ton of money on the game (it cost $5 a month). He didn't stop going on dates in order to play, and it's not like he avoided me so he could play his game. It was something he really enjoyed and I took it away from him because I thought it was in his best interest, and I was being selfish. And now I'm feeling really bad about doing so.

About a week ago I apologized to him, saying that it wasn't right for me to tell him what he can and can't do, and told him that he should play if he wants. He said he can't because he gave away all his stuff on the game right before he quit. Now I feel even worse about it, considering that probably took 9 years to get.

Is there anything I can do? He says he's not mad at me, but I can tell he really does miss playing the game. I mean, he doesn't even play any other video games. At all. This was the single one that he enjoyed and I took it away from him. I have my own vices that I waste time on and he doesn't get after me about them.

tldr: The title summarizes it well.

I'm not sure where to start. I'm M 25, wife is 24.

A few weeks ago, my wife found out that, before we were married, I had a brief encounter with one of her old friends. I was still dating my wife at the time, so, yes, I did cheat on her. That was five years ago and I never thought she would find out. 

Since then, I've been nothing but faithful to her. We're married now, and I wouldn't think of doing anything like that to her again. However, she is really upset about what happened between me and her best friend, and she seems to want to take the most drastic steps to insure that this doesn't happen again. She says porn is a ""gateway"" and that soon it will lead me to physical relationships with other women.

Admittedly, I have had a bit of a problem with porn in the past, but I think a parental control on my computer so she can monitor me is going too far.

Yesterday I moved my and our daughters things out. After reading all of your replies and considering my own happiness and the best interests of our daughter I explained to him that I couldn't do this anymore. Especially in light of all that I read about being codependant after a few people suggested that. I clearly learned that from my own mother who will do anything and everything for everyone else...even at the expense of her own happiness. I don't want to teach our daughter that that's normal.

I also found out that he was doing more than pot. (Though this was in the middle of packing my clothes. I had come to this decision before I found out he was in deeper than I thought.) He sold my Nikon and my kindle to buy drugs. I got everything of value out of the house along with our things. We're staying with my grandma and while our daughter took it very hard when we told her, she's doing quite well. I'm allowing him to come see her (supervised by myself or my mom), and I would bring her to play with him at the park or what have you. But he's not allowed to take her anywhere on his own. He's been clean for 3 days now. I won't deny her her father, but it will be on safe terms that he sees her. He has been very understanding of the rules I'm making about it. Says he's going to make it right.

We are in a safe and loving place and doing well under the circumstances. Yesterday was the single hardest day of my life. But today I woke up as if there were a new light. I didn't cry in the shower. I feel a bit more like my old self. I feel stronger.

Thank you, reddit. All of your advice and your clear opinions gave me the strength to do what I know was right.

She finds me and embraces me and then i am forced to engage in an awkward conversation.  It has reached the point in which i make sure to avoid her and go in opposite directions when i see her.

She has been off work for about 4 months, I encouraged her decision to leave her job as it was strenuous and didn't make allocations (lunch at correct times, a break occasionally, etc) for her pregnancy and we both worried it could negatively impact our unborn child. I since have been working some overtime but still making time for her at the cost of sleep (I have sleep issues so I wasn't giving up much there). 

Our child was born 3 weeks ago and I took two weeks off to help around the house, help care for our newborn and help take care of errands as best I could. I have been back to work for just over a week and it's really not going well. Her mom and sister has been helping this week and I've pulled two all nighters (and went to work the following day) to try to help her with sleep and to get some rest. 

The issue that reared it's ugly head is she has apparentally posted some not very nice statuses on facebook referencing ""I can't do this all by myself"" and ""(myname) went to bed an hour ago, this should be fun with no sleep and no help"" etc x infinity. 

I can tell that her interrupted sleep schedule is hard on her, I also know she is still healing and also dealing with hormonal imbalances following giving birth, but I've had so many people contact me and ask me why i'm not helping, or why I'm staying away from home (work, 8-5 sometimes later) and my favorite (Your not going to turn into a deadbeat dad like whatsisname are you). I do know that it's technically not anyone else's business but it kills me that I'm doing the best I can to help and provide for both of them, staying up all night and still working etc and more people by the day think i'm nowhere around. I don't need a pat on the back for doing what I'm supposed to as a husband and father, I would like to be projected accurately to our friends and family though. I also feel that me denying or trying to explain is an act in futility as these folks seem to be convinced somehow i'm not helping.

I tried to raise the issue to her yesterday after I cooked us a nice dinner and helped get the little one to sleep. I asked her why there is no mention of me helping and why do her updates seem to infer that she has no help (puzzles me as to why her mother/sister are not even mentioned). I also asked her if she were feeling depressed or blue (I'm concerned with post-partem). All questions which went unanswered or explained with ""I Don't Know"".

Has anyone in /r/relationships ran into their SO killing their character on Facebook? If so, how did you fix it? 

**UPDATE 1: - Thanks to everyone for the advice, also for some encouragement and the reinforcement that I was being a good father and husband. I wasn't asking for that but I do feel better after reading some of the comments. I will be talking to her this evening about these issues and I will be sure to bring up some of the points that you all have raised. I will also do some digging around on PPD and couples counseling. I definitely want to help and fix things as best as possible, as she is our childs Mother and my Wife. I will update again ASAP**

**Update 2: I disabled SSID broadcast on our home wireless and enabled MAC address filtering adding only my phone. I tried discussing with her, she said that she wouldn't come to me with issues and that she doesn't know why she posts those things online. I told her she needs to discuss PPD with her doctor next week and that if we couldn't communicate, we will never make it as a couple nor be successful parents. I let her I know I understood how hard things are for her, and that we both have experienced huge changes with the addition of our little one. I begged her to be more open with me with our issues and I would do my best to listen and respond as well as I could. I explained it was irrational to post passive aggressive notes to social media and expect it to fix real life issues. That's the just of it, summed up do to me being on mobile.**

**Update 3: In line with my explaination further down the comment line, I would like to explain why I disabled the internet (her access the first day, everyone's directly after, even my access, as i realized I abused it to escape from home life to a degree). Most folks whom commented explained she was possibly dealing with Post Partum Depression as well as some anxiety and other issues. These points made me think a little past my own concern and I became increasingly concerned with her well-being and the well being of our child. So, after striking out discussing the social media issues, realizing that she would continue to post things like she had because there is no accountability. No responsibility. If she posts it at 3:00 am I may not see it for hours or days, by then, it was old news to her. So, I figured if I complicated that avenue of venting, perhaps she would seek the next easiest, that being actually talking to someone personally about our issues. It took some time, and yes, she was pissed, but we've communicated more in the last 12 hours then in the last few weeks. She has discussed things with a friend, as well as a member of her family. Lastly, she has texted me consistantly today explaining her thoughts, ideas, and disappointments. We are working on our marriage now. Honestly, thats all I wanted. But, seems as long as a complaint or sympathy was only a click away, our marriage was slipping. I apologize if anyone feels this was extreme or controlling, honestly, I do love this woman, I had arranged and still plan on getting counseling for us, but at least my crazy idea worked to progress us in the mean time.

Her reevaluation will be based on me correcting my personal failings. The thing is I am working hard on addressing the problems that I have on my end. I am not perfect and recognize my faults, I don't even know who I am ultimately doing this for. I don't know if she really wants to get back together, or she is just stalling for time cause at the moment I have a lot of her stuff that I am sure she won't want to part with. 
Should I cut her off at the pass and tell her that it's over? We've been together more or less for 4 years. I don't want to throw all of what we've built away, but I can't see a way out at this point that doesn't involve a breakup. Also, what does on a break mean? Should I assume anything about that term? Are there ground rules in such situations? I just don't know how to move forward at this point. 

TL;DR GF told me we are on a break, I don't know how to proceed. 

Edit: Not a meth head, my biggest thing is I wasn't 100% self supportive over the last semester. She moved a thousand miles away leaving me with a just signed lease of a place I can't afford. She cut me off with the break, which is probably for the best so I can take responsibility for having my own place. 

Edit2: The long distance thing probably explains the June thing. She doesn't come up to see me all the time.

Final edit: Since Reddit is a bunch of gossipy hens (in the best way possible I assure you) I thought I would update you with my plans. She is coming up for work this month for a few days. I will let her come get some stuff then tell her it's insulting to me to give me such a ridiculous ultimatum. I don't imagine it will go very well. I can cover my place until the lease is up and I am taking our cat as payment for not letting her credit score go down in flames. I'm not gonna do this any sooner cause she doesn't reply to my texts all the time. Thanks for the advise, I am not that close with my friends in the area, she really was all I had to talk to.

Well /r/relationships..I did it, I took all of your advice and tho I was debating which route to take (you guys gave me plenty..thank you) I ultimately decided to just go with my emotion and my desire to Kiss him, the desire ive had since I was 14 like I said.

We were watching Game of Thrones as is our custom for Friday night, and I decided to throw caution to the wind and sit really close to him. So close our legs were touching, he didn't seem to mind/notice at first..until the sex scenes started happening (you know what im talking about GoT lovers). He started to smile and then looked at me and our eyes met, I don't know what came over me but I sat up a bit (hes taller) and leaned in to kiss him..I only went about  80% of the way and rather slowly to give him time to react if he didn't want to, but he leaned in and kissed me, soft and gentle for the first one then we erupted into a full blown make out session.

I'm rather disappointed but also very proud that he stopped and sort of backed away from me in disbelief, he told me that he wasn't sure this was a good idea, that he knew I was attracted to him but didn't want to put any sort of pressure on me with my family.  I told him I didn't want him to feel that way and that I wanted him. I tried to kiss him again but he wouldn't let me, he pushed me away gently and said that he wanted me to, but it was too complicated right now and that we should wait until he talks to my family about it.

It sort of turned into an argument (im sorry, my emotions were going fucking nuts) with me telling him I didn't care what they thought and that all I wanted was him.  He seemed hurt and told me family was the most important thing in the world..that he wanted me to talk to them first and he would be there to talk to them with me if I needed him to.

I don't really know what to do now..I feel like I have him, but I also feel like I put myself out there too much and seemed desperate, I am usually so level headed and a clear thinker so im also confused by my reaction.

Should I talk to them with him there? Or by myself..I did joke with my brother after my last update about how it would be great if his friend got to be his brother..but he thought I was talking about my sister and started laughing..I chickened out of telling him I meant me.

Feeling a bit hurt and confused?",throwwa,134,38,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15a2mv/i_20f_am_was_not_invited_to_a_close_family/,"Hi Reddit,

I'll have to give a bit of back story to explain the situation- 
I grew up with family 'X' and family 'Y', we all went to the same primary school would have pizza nights on Fridays and celebrate any big events together. We were always very close to family 'X' I grew up calling the parents my auntie and uncle and their children my cousins, our parents were best friends. Family 'Y' I don't consider family but grew up with anyway, the mother of this family passed away while the kids were quite young. 

My parents divorced when I was 15, the parents of family 'X' divorced several months later. We still kept in contact through facebook etc with the kids and I'd see the parents every now and then, but obviously the usual get togethers stopped happening. Our parents were still best friends and the mother and father of family 'x' still kept in contact, he was quite mentally unstable and she couldn't handle it. A couple of years later the father of family 'Y' and the mother of family 'X' got together, that was a little strange at the time. Earlier this year they became engaged. Several months ago the father of family 'X' committed suicide, this was absolutely devastating to everyone, we were there as the second family and went to the private burial and have spend a lot of time in contact. 

The wedding date is still set for mid January, mum mentioned to me that she was asked to cook for the wedding and mother 'X' asked if if i and my sister could help out, sure no issues, happy to help out. Then nothing was said for a while about it. It's only been this week that it's been bought up again ask mother 'X' wants me to cater for the wedding instead. I notice that mum's already got her invite to the wedding for her, her boyfriend and their son. I've not gotten one and have no details. I ask mum about it and she talks to mother 'X', me and my sister are not invited. From what I understand the reasoning is that- the wedding is just for close friends and family, her fiance doesn't want the deceased husband to be a part of it therefor none of my siblings or father are invited either. 

I'm struggling to wrap my head around this; I thought I was a part of the family or that I was more so than mums boyfriend and my half brother. I don't really understand why I would stir up any emotions of the deceased husband or why they'd ask me to be catering if that were the case. I feel really uncomfortable that I'd be serving food like a stranger and not actually be a part of the celebrations. 

My sister is still helping out which makes me feel like I'm being immature about this, as it's their wedding and they can invite whoever they want. On the other hand I feel like the implications are that I wasn't important enough to be a part of the actual wedding and that I'm an easy way to cut costs. also It's my birthday that weekend and I would've loved to be having a party but have held off for this. I don't know what to do, I was really excited for the wedding and now feel really deflated. I'm too emotionally caught up in this to see it reasonably, should I still be going?

TL;DR- family friends are getting married, i was asked early on to help with cooking and agreed, have later found out that I'm not invited to the wedding as it's for 'close friends and family only' my mother and her boyfriend and son are invited, not sure if I should go through with helping, or cancel and celebrate my birthday instead",,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,t3_15a2mv,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15a2mv/i_20f_am_was_not_invited_to_a_close_family/,

A few years ago, I started a two years program preparing students for selective schools (French system, nevermind). I befriended the guy, let's call him Max (18 at the time), and we would hang out with two other friends I made at the same time. A few months later, he started dating his girlfriend, let's call her Jen, who was in the same class.
They became very exclusive of everyone else, and spent all their time together, leaving no space for other people, so we stopped talking although we were in the same class. They stayed together for the two years of the program, and then were admitted to different schools, in two different cities.
A few weeks ago, Max started chatting with me on Facebook. It was the first time he spoke to me since the last time I saw him two years ago. He told me him and Jen were still dating, and I was truly amazed at their commitment to each other.


A few days later I saw her in the subway with another guy (we live in the same city). They seemed fery flirty, and then started kissing. It was obvious they were dating. She didn't see me though.


Now I really don't know what to do. Usually I would keep my mouth shut because this is none of my business, plus Max is not a close friend so I don't know if I'm in the right position to tell him. But I should mention here that Max spends a LOT of money in Jen. I always thought she took advantage of him (he's kind of wealthy), at least let's say I don't have the same conception of a relationship. Still, it's bugging me to see that he keeps buying her explensive clothes, taking her to restaurants, trips... for nothing. It's not like she cheated on him once, she is literally dating another guy at the same time.

So Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR : my friend is dating a girl for whom he spends a lot of money. She is dating another guy at the same time. Should I tell him?

The title basically sums it up. We've been dating 5 months. I care about my girlfriend (""Jane"") a lot, but I'm exhausted by how jealous she can be sometimes. 


I would say that 70% of my friends are girls, but my two closest friends are guys. The other day, Jane and I were together and a friend of mine walked by. I said hi to her like I do with all my friends, but later Jane said that my face ""lit up"" when I saw her and that I was obviously attracted to her. I denied being attracted to the friend (I am not) and tried to change the subject because this conversation has never ended well. 


She started a line of questioning.

Jane: In a hypothetical universe where you had never met me, would you have dated ""friend?""

Me: No.

Jane: But you obviously think she's pretty.

Me: Why does this matter? There are lots of pretty people in the world.

Jane: So you do think she's pretty.

Me: Do you think she's pretty?

Jane: Yes.

Me: Fine, she's pretty.

Jane: So you're attracted to her.

Me: No, please don't put words in my mouth.

Jane: Obviously you'd date her, and that's not okay with me.

etc...



I've never cheated on her nor would I. At the moment I don't see how these hypothetical scenarios could ever be good for a relationship. At the same time, I want to be sensitive to Jane's feelings. 


I have told her how I feel about this.


tl;dr: Girlfriend isn't comfortable with me being friends with attractive people. I am friendly but trustworthy and the questioning and suspicion is wearing on my patience.



**edit:** Thank you all for your comments. I'm going to have a heart to heart with her about this and how important it is. She has already acknowledged that it is a problem and she's promised to work on it. I'm not ready to give up on this girl. She's not crazy, she's insecure, and she has also treated me better in every other way than other people I've dated. She's generous, kind, thoughtful, smart, beautiful, and sincere. I'm going to do my part by telling her how I feel about her before she asks.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_t60nv,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t60nv/girlfriend_says_its_a_red_flag_if_i_have_any/,

The first year they were chatting online throughout the day, nearly every day, with him commenting on a lot of her FB pics.  After posting pics she would even ask him why he hadn't commented yet..  After a year of them talking privately, I eventually met her one night &amp; she sat on his lap when I went to the bathroom &amp; ignored me the whole night.  The 2nd time I met her she &amp; my bf disappeared in the bar for 20 minutes, leaving me &amp; her husband sitting there awkwardly chatting &amp; wondering where they went off to.. supposedly they were picking out music.  Her husband left her shortly after that (because of my bf &amp; her 5 other physical affairs with married men).  She &amp; my bf have still been chatting online for 2 years.  Last year I got upset (raging mad really) when he was commenting on her FB pics a lot again, &amp; he talked to her all night about it, for hours straight, with them laughing at me &amp; calling me ridiculous.  After admitting this was wrong of him, he told her he was going to cool off the chatting for a while, &amp; then (that day?) she sent pics of herself in costumes to his phone, as well as starting commenting on more of his FB posts, after blocking me from seeing them (because I told her she was disgusting on fb when she responded ""meh"" to the bf telling her my aunt just died).  

I then recently find out that my bf &amp; her had an emotional online affair during her marriage (just weeks before we were dating), &amp; my bf almost flew out to be with her at that time.  

We have had a turbulent relationship &amp; I recently went to talk to him when things were going well between us, saying that this chick in our relationship wasn't productive &amp; hurt my feelings.  I said I would have to leave if he didn't do anything about it, and when he said he wouldn't, I asked him to go to counseling with me then to learn how to deal with her being in my life (which he refused).  I see her as actively sabotaging our relationship &amp; not respecting our boundaries.

He's told her that he would never let me come between them, &amp; keeps thanking her for being such a great friend to him.  He claims that she's nothing more than a friend, &amp; in his defense I do have a lot of anxiety, but I went to a therapist &amp; they told me that he's putting her 1st, and that their relationship is in fact inappropriate &amp; damaging to us.  Thoughts?

*An additional piece is that his ex-girlfriend before me forbade him to talk to this chick as well, which he obliged to for years.   Consequently, the bf promised this woman that he would never let that happen again..

UPDATE: I GotTFO 6 weeks ago.  I stuck around for a few more weeks fantasizing that he would tell me he wanted me to stay &amp; work it out, but instead he just betrayed me further by escalating his ""friendship"" with his soulmate to extensive phone conversations bashing me even more.  During those last few weeks he also got back in touch with his ex-gf (begging for her friendship actually, lol), &amp; bashed me to HER TOO, lying to her that he wasn't 'allowed' to talk to her because of me (when in fact we mutually agreed she was being a bitch &amp; couldn't handle his new relationship yet).  At least it's good to know I'm not the only one he lies to.  =/  

Anyway, he blames me for the relationship ending, as expected, &amp; says I didn't want to be with him, or love him enough to stay.  It kills me that he actually believes this instead of seeing how long I *did* stay &amp; plead for him to work it out with me.  

I'm just trying to keep my head up &amp; readjust my life (different state, friends, career, living situation, dreams).  I've never been more in love with anyone in my life, &amp; really wanted him by my side.  Some days I just don't see the point in being happy if I'm not sharing it with him, but maybe I can eventually snap out of it, or perhaps this dull ache will stick with me.  I feel like an idiot for being so emotionally invested in someone I thought would fight for me &amp; declare his love for me from rooftops.  I'm sure there's someone out there who's courageous enough to be that vulnerable.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1338072251.0,,,True,t3_re01t,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/re01t/is_bfs_female_friend_damaging_our_relationship/,

Please help me.",porninduceded,129,28,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5glp/my_girlfriend_when_she_feels_even_remotely_hurt/,"First, these types of things do not happen very often in our relationship, but when they do, it's all I can think about for the next day or two. Everything else in our relationship is really good. We're both 29 (almost 30), we've been together almost 10 months, and we both feel like we are someday going to marry each other. Our relationship works very well most of the time. But...

She is very, very quick to move to ""defense"" mode when she feels even the least bit slighted or offended, even when no offense to her was meant. She can NOT handle any degree of criticism, even constructive criticism, which is honestly the only kind of criticism I would ever offer her. The other day, she came home from work in a huff, sat down next to me and told me ""you won't believe what happened at work."" I was prepared to listen to a story about how her supervisors had wronged her, how bad they made her feel, how shitty her job is, etc. Turns out, she was extremely upset because one of her opponents on Draw Something never correctly guessed any of her drawings. She read aloud a long rant she posted on Tumblr about how she can't believe he couldn't guess any of her drawings.

I immediately let my gut reaction spill, which was, ""...I think you might be overreacting to this.""

I guess that was a mistake, because then she started saying, ""Well I guess I should just delete my Tumblr, if all I do is overreact to everything."" She then started to delete her Tumblr app, which I told her not to do. She continued to pout for a while after, and I felt like a huge asshole. I also couldn't help feeling, however, like these were tactics a little kid would resort to. A complete dismissal of any modicum of criticism resulting in what was essentially, a tantrum.

I have an anxiety problem. I'm on meds for it. These kinds of things probably wouldn't ruffle the feathers of most, but I can't handle it. I feel like I need to walk on eggshells around her, not able to completely speak my mind for fear of these kinds of repercussions. The catch-22 for me here is, I can't bring up this problem to her, because she does not accept that perhaps she has a problem with getting defensive over little things, a trait which has come up on her employee reviews--which of course, she dismisses in an irate huff when she gets home to tell me about it. 

How do you give someone constructive advice, when they perceive advice as an insult and an offense?

TL;DR - My girlfriend has an extremely thin skin and cannot accept even constructive criticism, and quickly gets defensive and throws tantrums, crying when she feels even a tiny bit offended. HELP!

-------
**EDIT**: I greatly appreciate all of the advice, which seems to be split between talking openly with her about it, couples therapy, and downright dumping her. I think I'll try them...in that order. I don't want to leave her, at least, not if we can connect about this and I can stress how much this is hurting our relationship. If she refuses to acknowledge that she needs to work on the issue, I'll look into couples therapy, or at least suggest it. If she's absolutely intolerant of any of that stuff, I may have no choice but to tell her that it's just not working out.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_r5glp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5glp/my_girlfriend_when_she_feels_even_remotely_hurt/,

I have to start by saying this place has been enormousness help so far.  I've been avoiding doing this for some time because I feel a bit silly and would be embarrassed if anyone I knew found this.  But I'm at a point that I don't know what else to do.  


**The Incident**


We both went out to her companies Christmas party and I ended up leaving early because I had to work the next morning.  Around 2:30AM, I wake up to her hovering over me asking if I was sleeping.  She then slips into the living room to which I assume she is just getting ready for bed.  I could hear her mumbling, but I figured she was talking to one of our pets.  I continued to hear some strange noises coming out of the living room and thought my mind was just playing tricks on me.  After a few minutes I couldn't take the curiosity and walked out of the bedroom to find her on top of some guy, making out, with her bra lying next to her and both of their pants undone.  I flip on the light and yell the typical “what the fuck are you guys doing?” to her snapping back at me “What the fuck are you doing here!?”  “I live here! Who the fuck is HE!”.  I didn’t recognize the guy and asked if this was a coworker, and he responds with no, we met at the bar.  I told him to get the fuck out of our house and then I went back into the bedroom to put some god damn pants on.  I then came back out to them hugging/kissing in our back door way and them looking at each other like her father just busted her for sneaking her bf into the house.


He finally leaves and this is when I realized just how drunk she is.  She can barely stand up and has no memory of what happened 5 minutes later when I’m trying to get some answers.  She kept repeating that she didn’t do anything wrong and she doesn’t understand why I’m so mad.  


The next day, she doesn’t remember a bit of this and sounds just as upset about it as me.  


**The Aftermath**


Long story short, it’s been a few weeks since this as all happened and we’re still living together and working things out.  Things have honestly been great- better than ever- other than all of the serious talks and the cycle of anger, sadness and guilt we seem to be going through.  I’m over the initial shock of it all, although I can’t keep from replaying this night in my head over and over again.


I learned that she had been feeling trapped, and thought about breaking up for awhile, but didn’t want to hurt me (haha) and while she had never thought about cheating on me, she’s not completely surprised it happened.  But she immediately said she is over those feelings and that and just wants to be with me.  She is upset with herself and says she never wants to make me feel this way again.


I’m upset with her, but I’m madder at this random guy.  I feel like she got completely taken advantage of, and he straight up lied to my face about where they met when I confronted him.  She takes most of the responsibility, but seriously what kind of scumbag goes into another man’s home under these circumstances?  His response to her the next day was “Sorry I didn’t know you lived with your boyfriend” – yeah well, that doesn’t change much about the situation.  I feel like I can trust her to a point, but I can’t trust *these fucking guys*.  I admittedly wasn’t giving her my full attention lately, and this guy happened to give her what she needed for a few hours.  I can completely understand how this could happen.


I want to stay together.  I love this girl more than anything and I know I’m willing to forgive.  I can’t say that I’ve never been in the same place as she was, and have a number of close calls regarding my faith… 


**The Questions**


I’m just worried that we haven’t really expressed our sadness and anger completely. I’m worried that she’s being so nice because, once again, she doesn’t want to hurt me.  I’m worried that I only know about this one time because I walked in on it. I’m worried that our past is going to affect our future.  I’m worried that I’m over thinking everything and that’s going to end up putting stress on our relationship and things will never work out.  How do we express our selves safely without damaging anything else?  I’m I obsessed?


I asked her if after she gets off work tonight we can sit down and talk seriously about things, giving our self a chance to think ahead about what we want to say rather than letting it boil over in a wave of emotion.  I guess the reason I’m posting this is I’m hoping to get some insight from this wonderful community.   What could she possibly be going through right now? What should I believe?  What do I need to say to her at this point? What should I be feeling? 


*TL;DR* – Walked in on my drunk girlfriend en-route to fucking some other guy.  She doesn’t remember any of it.  She’s sorry and I believe her.  I’m willing to forgive, but can’t forget.  I'm worried.

edit:  Wow, ok guys.  First of all, thanks for all the responses.  Lots of shit I didn't want to hear, but I appreciate it. I know maybe I'm being more forgiving than I should be given everything, but can we take it easy on the comments?  Maybe I'm delusional, but I'm not an idiot.  I know how disrespectful it was, I have to deal with it on a daily basis.  You've helped reinforce my feelings that I shouldn't take ""I was blacked out"" as a response.  And if that's all she has, it's not good enough. Even if she remembers it or not, she asked a cab driver to drop her off at our house, walked up our stairs, unlocked our door and then immediately went in to check on me with this guy right behind her.  *shudder*",,False,,t5_2qjvn,True,,,True,t3_oa36q,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/oa36q/walked_in_on_partner_cheating_over_the_initial/,
