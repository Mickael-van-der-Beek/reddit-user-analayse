Then you've got cookies!,handsopen,237,22,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/17rk0h/got_an_old_banana_or_two_got_some_quickcooking/,"I found this recipe on the internet a while back, I can't remember where now. This is a great way to use up a couple of overripe bananas. All you need is a 2:1 ratio of ripe bananas to oats, like this:

2 bananas? 1 cup oats.

1 banana? 1/2 cup oats.

3 bananas? 1 1/2 cup oats. Etc.

The riper the banana, the better. It's perfect if it's covered in those brown spots. Probably not perfect if it's got fruit flies buzzing around, though.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray it with cooking spray.

Mash the bananas up with a fork or your hands. Pour in oatmeal. Mix it all together.

You can also add optional ingredients, like chocolate chips, cinnamon, raisins, nuts, WHATEVER. The possibilities are endless. Don't add too many, though - a handful is fine. I've found if you go overboard on the extra ingredients the cookies tend to fall apart.

Spoon onto baking sheet in cookie-sized lumps and bake for 15-20 minutes.

*Disclaimer: I will say that these are NOT terribly sweet. They won't taste like Chips Ahoy or Mrs. Fields, obviously. They taste like bananas and oatmeal (and whatever else you add in.) They're good enough for my sweet cravings, though, and you can eat half a batch of them without feeling guilty :)",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_17rk0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/17rk0h/got_an_old_banana_or_two_got_some_quickcooking/,

**EDIT:** You guys are AWESOME. This is a huge help for me. Thanks so much! I truly appreciate it.

**BACKGROUND**

I wrapped up graduate school about a year ago and now have the money and time to eat better.

But I haven't. I know I eat out too much, and I know I drink too much beer. (I don't drink every single day of the week, but maybe twice or three times a week, and 2-3 pints per go)

The fact that I'm an actual adult is starting to catch up to me, and I'm at a bit over 200lb. I'm fairly athletic but my sports are in off-season. With the help of /r/fitness I've started doing the Starting Strength program but the FAQ indicates (correctly) that diet is the single most important thing you can change to get in shape; exercise is secondary. (That said, I've seen incredible newb gains from the SS program; it's slow going but the results I'm seeing aren't in the weight loss but the ability to lift more.) I'd like to get this down to ~180lb or even ~175 by year's end. (I realizes this includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. I think if I get serious about this now, I can do it.) 

I'm living with a roommate still in graduate school so I only have half a fridge and freezer to myself. I'm willing to trash everything in my cupboards, fridge, and freezer and completely start over. Stocking a lot of veggies and fruit tends to turn into spoilage; I'm only one person and I get tired of salads over and over again in the race against the clock before stuff spoils. Fruit goes better but not by much, although I've started taking to freezing bananas and blueberries.

Here are my habits/pitfalls/other lifestyle choices that I've become cognizant about:

* I don't really like cooking. That's not true, actually I really enjoy cooking, but not when I'm the only person involved. I just find it to be such effort for a fairly measly payout. Yes, I can cook enough and eat the leftovers for days, but this gets tiresome.
* The cafeteria at my work is actually cheap and awesome. (But it's not as cheap as packing my lunch!) I tend to eat subs or salads and avoid the burger grill. When I'm in a rush on breakfast, though, I tend to just grab a egg/sausage/cheese on English muffin. 
* I try to eat whole wheat whenever possible. Bagels, bread, pasta, etc. Although I'm Asian so in a pinch I reach for jasmine rice. 
* My coworkers decided to keep their drawers full of chocolate, and there's a giant tub of pretzels for the community. I need to not snack. 
* The veg I tend to like to prepare for dinner typically gets sauteed or grilled. Asparagus, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions. I need to branch out more. 
* I eat too much red meat, which is apparently a pretty expensive way to get protein.
* When I eat breakfast at home, I tend to go with a bagel, cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Occasionally there'll be (Greek or not) yogurt mixed in with either bananas or strawberries, and/or granola. 
* I don't ever drink soda.
* There tends to be a sporting event my friends and I want to go see at least once a week, either live or on TV. (Right now it's MLS and CONCACAF soccer season, so this has been dominating.) I tend to eat bar food there. And drink at least a beer.
* I've committed to working out on the [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki) program. I've missed a day here or there but that's due to another exercise event (hikes, etc).
* I need to cardio more. I can run 3mi in 24-26 minutes without stops, but I haven't done it lately. Everything I've seen about Starting Strength says to essentially eschew cardio on off-days to avoid hurting the gains on lifting, but I haven't seen anything about how this helps or detract from weight loss.
* I work a 9/80 schedule - that is, 9 hours a day and every other Friday off. Assuming I sleep 8 hours a day (I don't and I should be) and my commute to/from work takes about a half hour each way (really it's more like 25 and 45), I have left around 6 hours per day. 

I've recognized that I need to change things up *now*, while I'm still young and it's relatively easy. I just don't really know how. I guess a lot of my end goal is lifestyle change, not just learning how to eat cheaply and healthily. But it's definitely a good start.

**MY QUESTION FOR YOU, /r/EatCheapAndHealthy**

I'm looking on tips for what to keep in my fridge, freezer, and pantry that's fairly quick to make. A lot of my problem, I think, comes from the fact that *I just don't know what to keep on hand* to make a meal fairly quickly, so I go for easy stuff like Hamburger Helper with random veggies thrown in. I think I ought to start meal planning so I don't run into this trap, but I need to be meal planning for all 3 meals. This is especially true for lunch, that way I don't get tempted to just run to the cafeteria or eat out with coworkers. Or breakfast, so I'm not tempted to just hit the cafeteria (or worse, hit the cafeteria *after eating some light at home because I'm still hungry.*)

Ive done tons of research on our menu and feel as though the general public needs to know the truth behind what our healthy and unhealthy sandwiches are.

First tip! There is this hidden secret between Sandwhich Artists called 'Gutting the bread' its when they use their finger to dig out all of the fluffy bread in the middle when the cut it before they put any of the meats on. It saves a decent amount of empty calories and you wont even notice when the meat and veggies are on at the end!

**Good and Healthy Sandwiches!!**

Turkey, Ham, Any of the Chickens, Egg and Cheese Omelette

**STAY AWAY FROM!**

Tuna Fish,(SOO MUCH MAYONNAISE IN THE TUNA), Cold Cut Combo, Meat Ball Marinara, BLT.

Another Good trick that few people utilize would be toasting the sandwhich with veggies or sauces on it, a good example would be having your meat and cheese toasted with green peppers, onions, and your favorite sauce all heated up. it tastes way better!

Also, the cookies at subway are like porn to me, so fucking good. There is no such thing as a 'healthful' cookie at subway, they are all like 250+ calories so don't get one unless you are craving, but another tip would be ask the person to microwave them for like 6 seconds, they don't mind and it turns any cookie into an orgasm in your mouth.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,1362958542.0,,,True,t3_1a18v1,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1a18v1/how_to_eat_fresh_at_subway/,

In my usual bowl:

* Chicken breast.  I bought a bag of frozen breast pieces (very, very few ingredients besides chicken), and that's what I've been using.  Want to use your favorite cheap chicken?  Go for it.  Want to use something else? I bet beef, tuna, or salmon would be good in this.  Vegetarian? Add some beans for protein.  
* Broccoli.  I just buy a bag of frozen broccoli and microwave what I'm going to eat, usually about a cup.
* Tomatoes.  I put one roma tomato in, just chop it up and put it in there raw.  Want to use cherry tomatoes cause they are on sale?  Cool.  Hate tomatoes? Don't put them in.
* Brown rice.  I'm lazy as shit and I buy a single-serving 60 second microwavable brown rice bowls, but rice is cheap as shit so this is a potential money saver.  Hate brown rice?  Use bulgar wheat, quinoa, white rice, or forego the rice all together to paleo-ify this meal.  
* Green pepper.  I will put half of one in there and put it in with the broccoli in the last 60ish seconds so that it can soften a little.  
* Marinara sauce.  I buy this horribly expensive shit called Rao's because it's super natural and delicious.  Like one better? Make it yourself? Do that.
* Flavor.  I used to put Red Hot in there, but now I'm putting Sriracha.  This meal can be a little bland, which is why I load up on the tomatoes and tomato sauce.  

The brilliant thing is that most vegetables will work in this.  I can imagine zucchini, yellow squash, green beans... hmm.  Basically buy shit that is on sale to make this as cheap as possible.

To actually make it, cook the cookables (chicken, rice, broccoli, green pepper) and throw it in a bowl.  Done.  With some careful planning this can be accomplished in ~10 minutes.

Wrap in tinfoil and bake for 15-20 minutes. Carefully take it out and let it cool for about five minutes before you dig in.

I once cut up a chocolate and caramel candy bar and filled the banana with that. It was seriously the best thing ever, so go crazy and fill it with whatever you want.

**What You Need**

* 1/3 lb spaghetti noodles
* 1 clove garlic, minced 
* 1/2 cup olive oil, divided 
* 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped 
* 1/4 cup of lemon juice
* 1 tsp parsley 
* 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated
* Pepper to taste

**What You Do**

1. Cook Spaghetti noodles how you normally would cook them. My boyfriend and I used some leftover, already made, plain spaghetti noodles.

2. In a large skillet, saute parsley and garlic in 1/4 cup of the olive oil over low heat. I sauteed for about 5 minutes, until my whole apartment smelled like garlic-awesomeness.

3. Turn heat to medium, and add the spinach to the skillet, cooking it until the stems are *almost* soft.

4. Keep the heat at medium. Add spaghetti noodles to skillet, mixing the noodles in with the spinach, parsley, garlic, and olive oil. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of oil to the top of the spaghetti and mix until the noodles are thoroughly coated in the oil and the spinach is evenly distributed throughout the pasta.

5. Turn the heat off. Add the lemon juice to the pasta, mixing so that the flavor is distributed evenly. Do the same with the Parmesan, making sure that there are no clubs or anything like that.

6. Add pepper to taste. Serve.

Like I said, I made this last night for myself and my boyfriend, and we both loved it. All together, the ingredients to make it cost about $2.18, with ingredients from HyVee and Walmart. It made about 3 good servings. We each had it for dinner last night and I had it for lunch today, so per serving it's about $.73, which is really cheap and good, especially for college students like us.

To add some protein to it, you could add some chicken cooked in the parsley/garlic oil, but we didn't have any and it was just fine that way it was.

Edit: Typos. After talking it over, changed amount of some ingredients, as I didn't actually measure when I made it. Also, fine: olive oil isn't good for you.

1376067577.0,146,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,1k1ais,Last night I made an amazing meal inspired by r/foodporn and aided by r/EatCheapAndHealthy. It is one of the most cost effective and still yummy recipes I've ever tried.,jentarvin,180,34,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1k1ais/last_night_i_made_an_amazing_meal_inspired_by/,"I saw the [drool worthy version](http://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/1jt8yy/after_3_grueling_hours_of_a_4_step_process_meal/) of al kabsa that [r/st1234](http://www.reddit.com/user/st1234) posted a few days ago on [r/foodporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/) and was inspired!

So I took a look at the [recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/al-kabsa---traditional-saudi-rice-and-chicken/) that was linked. I had mostly everything that was called for already in my pantry! However, dried limes were something I had only ever seen on food network. 

A quick amazon search revealed that [dried limes](http://www.amazon.com/AASAN-Dried-Lime-Whole-Amani/dp/B0036ZI2GU/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376065542&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dried+limes) were going to cost me at least $22 and leave me with more dried limes than I have any right to try to store in my tiny kitchen.  

My first reaction was to check with gourmet shops in my area. I assumed the cost per weight might be skewed, but I was willing to pay a little more per lime to pay less over all. I called no fewer than 4  bougie spice shops to no avail. And then I remembered the advice I had seen on r/EatCheapAndHealthy: Invest in spices, but to go to small international markets to find good deals. Figured it was worth a shot!

So I went down to [an AMAZING international market in my area](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shayan-supermarket-torrance) to see what I could find. And voila, [dried limes](http://imgur.com/a/2foCp) for 90% cheaper than I had seen them on amazon, and still more than what I needed! 

It got me thinking about how much this meal cost in general. After the initial spice investment, which could range you about $20 altogether for large bags of spices that would last awhile, the other costs are negligible. Rice, chicken, onion, 3 carrots, half a stick of butter, can of tomatoes, can of tomato paste and a few raisins. Roughly, $10-$12 (+ spices). I made this for my boyfriend and I last night, he's 6'7'' with an appetite to match his stature and we only went through a 3rd of it. So for an estimated $15 dollars (if you factor in the a little bit of spice cost every time you make it) one could easily get 6 servings of incredible food. That's $2.50 a serving. I'm going to freeze my left overs in travel size pyrex and have them for lunches next week. 

(Side note: it didn't take me 3 hours. It took me an 1.25 hours. I used fresh chicken breast tenders that didn't need to cook as long, and prepped the next steps while things were cooking.) 

**TL:DR** Save 90% on spices at international markets and make awesome food using spices and basic healthy ingredients and save money! http://imgur.com/a/2foCp

I stole the idea for this from /u/EdBuryn over in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ee97w/food_pro_tipslife_hacks_anyone/) thread on /fitness, but I tweaked it a little bit and I figured this subreddit would appreciate it. If you're used to good Italian home-cooking you might not like this, but I really loved it :)

Ingredients:

- 3 to 6 eggs (I use 5, it depends on how hungry you are)

- 1/2 cup pasta sauce (or homemade tomato sauce; I wouldn't recommend taking it directly from a can)

- 1/2 cup shredded cheese

- 1/2 tbsp olive oil

- salt, pepper, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:

- Add the olive oil to your pan or skillet. Heat up to low-medium (for me, 3-4 works well)

- Separate yolks from egg whites and place egg whites in a bowl

- Add egg whites to heated pan. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and Italian Seasoning. Add red paper flakes to give it a kick.

- Cover the pan and continue cooking for about 5 minutes (it's important to keep it covered)

- Add 1/2 cup of sauce to the pizza and spread it around evenly. Sprinkle the cheese on.

- Cover the pan and continue cooking ~2 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted and the bottom is mostly golden brown (see pictures)

- Serve!

- Calories: 340

- Fat: 15g

- Carbs: 13 (2g fiber)

- Protein: 36

(I based my totals on Great Value brand pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese. This pasta sauce was fairly high in carbs and had some added sugar, but I had it laying around so I figured I would use it instead of driving to the store and buying tomatoes.)

Cost: &lt;$2.00 (based on Wal-Mart in the South)

- Eggs: 0.84 (~$2 per dozen)

- Pasta sauce: 0.30 (~$1.50 per jar)

- Cheese: 0.62 (~$2.50 per pckg)

- Seasonings: minimal


You can always add more things to this dish like pepperoni, sausage, chicken, onion, green pepper, etc. I just made a very basic version since it was my first time trying this.

Tell us your favorite ways to make OATMEAL great.,loveshercoffee,146,24,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16xpfb/sunday_morning_breakfast_a_warm_bowl_of_oatmeal/,"Besides being cheap, oatmeal is healthy, easy to make and all kinds of versatile. It's perfect to warm up on a cold morning and is easy to taylor to almost anyone's taste by adding different fruits (fresh or dried) or maybe just a touch of honey, brown sugar or splenda and a bit of milk. 

**Moneysaving tip**: For those of you who like those little envelopes of instant oatmeal - you can make your own with exactly what you want in it for less money than you can buy it! 

The difference between steel-cut oats, old fashioned (sometimes called rolled) oats and instant oats is only in how much they have been processed. The less they're processed, the longer it takes to cook but thicker and chewier the finished oatmeal will be. To make your own instant oats, buy the large container of old fashioned oats or steel cut oats and whiz them in your blender or food processor for a few seconds. Put them in a little baggie with anything else you like on 
your oatmeal (powdered milk, cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, etc.) and it's ready to take with you. All you have to do is add hot water and let it sit for one minute - the same as with the expensive little pre-made packets. 

It's also super easy to turn oatmeal into granola which makes a great cold breakfast cereal with a little bit of yogurt or milk. The recipe I make is:

* 4 cups old fashioned oats
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 cup chopped almonds
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt
* 1/3 cup canola oil
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 tablespoon vanilla

In a large bowl mix oats, brown sugar, almonds, raisins, cinnamon, and salt.

In a microwave safe bowl heat canola oil and honey until warm, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla extract. Pour this mixture over the oat mixture and mix thoroughly until everything is completely coated.

Spread evenly on a parchment or silpat covered cookie sheet. Bake at 300Âº for about 20 minutes until slightly golden brown. Donât stir during baking. Cool completely and break into pieces. Store in an air tight container.

1356821261.0,118,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,15n7dh,Arguably the most under-appreciated and most versatile tool for saving money on groceries; The lowly mason jar.,loveshercoffee,134,16,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15n7dh/arguably_the_most_underappreciated_and_most/,"Bulk buying, cooking for yourself, growing your own vegetables, taking your lunch to work or school and proper storage to avoid waste are a big part of saving money on your grocery bill. And the common canning jar can do all of it.

They're cheap and available everywhere in the US; Where I live, usually between $8-$12 per case depending on size. A new case of jars comes with rings and lids.  A dozen lids and rings together costs around $4 and a dozen lids by themselves is in the range of $2. (You can't replace a Tupperware lid for $0.16!)

They come in many sizes ranging from one half-cup to one half-gallon so you can use them for everything from herb jars to storing bulk purchases of beans or rice. Since they're clear glass, you don't have to play âguess what's in the containerâ in the fridge or pantry. Food that comes in plastic bags can be spilled, become crushed or get stale â all things that can be avoided by transferring them to canning jars.

Canning jars are meant for high heat; You can bake in them and microwave them.

You can freeze food in them. Wide-mouth jars are even marked on the side with a fill-line specifically for the freezer. 

You can store dry goods in them. Brown sugar stays soft, cereal doesn't get stale.

You can refrigerate leftovers in them. 

Modern canning jars are marked with Imperial and metric measurements so they can double as a measuring cup.

A wide-mouth jar will accept a stick blender.  

[A small-mouth jar will double as a blender vessel on many brands of blenders.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaiHuqwRAko) 

They make excellent small-batch fermenters for home made hot sauce, sauerkraut, yogurt, pickles and kimchee. 

[You can grow sprouts in them.](http://www.simplynotable.com/2012/sprouting-in-a-mason-jar/)

You can drink out of them. There's probably a clichÃ© about âyou might be a redneckâ in there somewhere but honestly, broke college students should take note of [this.](http://www.blogher.com/turn-mason-jar-spillproof-cup-straw)  Also good for parents and people who like smoothies but don't want to wash an unnecessary number of dishes. 

You can eat out of them. Since we've already established that they're safe in the fridge, the freezer and the microwave, how about using a mason jar to take your lunch to work? [Or make a fresh salad in a jar.](http://www.thekitchn.com/salad-in-a-jar-make-a-week-of-lunches-173014) 

They make a good, [improvised double boiler](http://www.ehow.com/how_4963236_melt-chocolate-double-boiler.html).

This is breakfast, lunch, and dinner for myself and my husband. A little about us so you can understand our nutritional needs a little better: we're in our mid-twenties, both were obese but have been losing weight over the past year (nearly 100lbs between the two of us!), along with lifting to try to build some muscle. We try to keep our carbs fairly low, and our protein fairly high. We also eat paleo/primal and I have a cow's dairy allergy, so we have some substitutions to regular recipes. Feel free to use milk/cow's cheese/butter in place of our substitutions if you can, it'll save you some money! You could probably get a few of these things cheaper (specifically the chicken), but we have a happy compromise between cost and prep time. 

Grocery list:

15 dozen large eggs ($17, some of these are for our dogs though!)

1 gal farm-fresh milk, delivered ($11, my husband's splurge item)

1 kilo goat cheese ($17, my splurge item)

1 quart goat's milk ($4)

5# bananas ($2.50 or so)

5-7# sweet potatoes (garnet yams) ($5 or so)

5# smoked sausage or polska kielbasa ($14)

4-5# jalapenos, fresh ($4 or so)

5# onions, yellow or whatever's on sale ($2 or so)

1# bell peppers (or 4-5 if they're sold per each) ($3 or so)

1 bunch celery ($1 or so)

1# carrots ($1 or so)

5# boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs ($10 or so, we buy in bulk whenever there's a sale so this is usually cheaper, but I'm assuming someone will be buying all new stuff)

5# of whatever beef is cheapest, usually chuck roasts or flank steak ($12.50 or so, again, we normally buy in bulk whenever there's a good sale)

1 gal olive oil ($11)

6# can tomato sauce ($3)

6# can diced tomatoes ($4)

1# quinoa ($4)

1 bunch fresh cilantro ($.50)

Large bag frozen mixed berries ($6)

1# clam meat ($4)

1# shrimp meat ($4)

4# bacon ends and pieces ($5)

1 jar of pepproncini ($3 for a small one, $10 for a gallon jar which lasts us months)

$40 flex budget or so on treats like fresh fruit, salmon, etc, for stocking up on sale items, for picking up other veggies/items to try, for replenishing spices and other consumables, or for upgrading items higher up the list.


Breakfasts:

Eggs. Lots of eggs. Either fried in a lightly oiled pan, or scrambled with a milk. Add goat cheese, herbs, Tabasco/Frank's Red Hot/Tapatio/Sriracha, whatever keeps them from getting too boring! Serve with [sweet potato hash](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/18hak8/whole_foods_wednesday_sweet_potato_hash_and_fried/), or bacon, or a banana, or maybe even some smoked sausage/kielbasa.

Lunches:

Lunches are usually more of a snack for us than a real meal. Smoothies made with banana and frozen berries are common, and so are roasting veggies, baked jalapeno poppers, and baked sweet potato fries. Our fallback for when we're hungry and lazy is cooking up some bacon or sausage/kielbasa.  

Dinners:

Here's where we shine! Dinner is bonding time, and I try to make the meals worth savoring. Our kitchen currently smells of my [Italian style chili](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/17y22h/italian_style_chili_paleo_slowcooker/). There's also [regular chili](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15l0ha/chunky_chili_slowcooker/), [chicken stew](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jlg1/simple_chicken_stew_paleoslowcooker/), [beef stew](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jsyr/simple_and_cheap_beef_stew_slowcookerpaleo_option/), [Hardtoremember's clam chowder](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16wh9c/home_made_clam_chowder_is_easy_and_yummy_soupy/) (I substitute sweet potatoes for the regular, and goat's milk for the evaporated milk), [chicken and quinoa soup](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15s0rx/chicken_quinoa_soup_slowcooker/), and the everpresent roasted veggies/poppers/lazymeal options from lunch. All of these dinner options listed above make at least 4 servings, if not 6+. I'm the type to get bored with a recipe after a few weeks, so these all get swapped out for others every couple of months, when my tastes change or when I find better things to make. These are just our current rotation!

I hope this helps some people out some! We spent this much, or MORE, eating like garbage and getting ourselves fat and unhealthy, and we thought we were getting the best bang for our buck. How wrong we were!

We shop at WinCo, Cash &amp; Carry, and Ranch99 Market. We also have a food processor, chest freezer, and a meat grinder. Most of our meals are cooked in a crockpot, with the majority of the rest being stovetop meals. If you have any questions, please ask!

1.5 cups of cooked rice

1 Large chicken breast, diced

1 granny smith apple, diced

1 medium sized yellow onion, diced

The rest I didn't really quantify:

Sriracha sauce (enough to the point where I could smell if off the food, while frying)

Vegetable oil

Chili flakes

Garlic powder (or real garlic works too, I suppose)

Start off by cutting the chicken breast into tiny pieces and bake it until it was done with a coating of oil, chili flakes and garlic powder.

Boil the rice while the chicken is baking

Throw the rice into a freezer for a few minutes to cool off while heating a large pan with an oil to Sriracha mixture (about a 4:1 mix if I had to mind's-eyeball it.)

Once the pan is heated put in the rice and onions in and lay on a bit more Sriracha.

Once the rice is nice and colorful put in the diced apple and chicken.

Keep tasting it every 3 minutes or so. You'll know it's done when the onions are caramelized and the sweetness of the apple is subdued but not gone.

I have the palette of a little kid. Actually, my kid eats more things than I do. I hate everything green. Corn and sweet potatoes are pretty much the only veggies I'll eat and sweet potatoes kind of annoy me. My food doesn't cost much, but it's not healthy.

My GF isn't finicky like I am but doesn't have many ideas for dinner, either. She's open to a lot of things, as long as it is relatively healthy. She often has chicken and rice and veggies, or veggie pasta with like stir-fried peppers and onions and diced tomatoes. For lunch sometimes she has a turkey sandwich and she pretty much does snacks for the rest of the time she's hungry. That doesn't sound expensive, but I could easily spend like $100.00+ a week on just her. A bag of frozen veggies that she'll usually finish is $2.50, box of rice is $2.00, add half a pepper, onion, tomatoes, etc and it starts to add up for just one maybe two meals if there's leftovers. Our son usually eats what she does.

We are lousy cooks, disorganized and don't like to eat the same things at all and it's driving us crazy. ""What do you want for dinner?"" ""I dunno, what do you want for dinner?""

If eggs and bacon every morning aren't your thing, my apologies... but this is a great easy, cheap, meal that you'll always have time for. 

[This picture pretty much says it](http://i.imgur.com/ui0ilkm.jpg)... but I'll go into the process anyway. 

Ingredients: 

4x packages of english muffins. I use the lite variety of grocery store brand. ~$10-12

2x packages of bacon (I like apple-wood smoked, uncured, &amp; peppered, but that's just me) ~$10-12

24 Eggs

24 Slices of cheese (optional)

----

Proceedure: 

* Cover large baking pans with tin-foil (optional)

* Cut all bacon in half, and lay out on baking pans (make sure these pans have a lip around the outside or you're going to have a bad time)

* Follow baking instructions on bacon package (usually 350-400 for ~10 minutes) 

* Start toasting english muffins (optional, but recommended)

* Cook your eggs however you like them. I do recommend cooking them fully, though.

* Once everything is done cooking, assemble sandwiches. One english muffin, one egg, two half-slices of bacon, cheese if desired.  

* Wrap individually in saran wrap

* stick them in the freezer.

----

Reheat in microwave ~1:00-2:00 depending on the microwave. Eat.

When all is said and done, these each cost a dollar or less, they taste awesome, and you have no excuses for skipping breakfast. If you're running late, just grab one on the way out the door and heat it at work. Or better yet, take some to work and leave them in the freezer there.

* 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour ($.20)  


* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning ($.05)

* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning ($.20)

* 1 (3-pound) boneless chuck roast  ($5.20)

* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil ($.10)

* 1 medium yellow onion, large dice ($.50)

* 2 tablespoons tomato paste  ($.50)

* 1 cup dry red wine ($1.00)

* 4 cups (1 quart) low-sodium beef broth ($.50, I just use bullion cubes)

* 2 bay leaves (not necessary $.10)

* 4 fresh thyme sprigs (not necessary $.15)

* 3 medium carrots ($.35)

* 3 medium celery stalks ($.30)

* 4 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds) ($.75)

* 1 cup frozen peas ($.50)

INSTRUCTIONS

Place 1/4 cup of the flour and the measured salt and pepper in a
large bowl and whisk to combine; set aside. Trim the roast of excess fat and sinew and cut it into 1- to 1-1/2-inch cubes. Place the meat in the flour mixture and toss to coat; set aside.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Shake off the excess flour from about one-third of the meat and add it to the pot. Cook, stirring rarely, until browned all over, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining meat in 2 more batches; set aside.

Add the onion to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stir to coat the onion, and cook until the raw flavor has cooked off, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Sprinkle in the remaining tablespoon of flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until the raw flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute. Pour in the wine, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, and cook until the mixture has thickened, about 3 minutes.

Return the meat and any accumulated juices in the bowl to the pot. Add the broth, bay leaves, and thyme and stir to combine. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1 hour.

Cut the carrots, celery, and potatoes into large dice and add them to the pot (peel the carrots and potatoes first, if desired). Stir to combine, cover with a tightfitting lid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables and meat are knife tender, about 1 hour more.

Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme stems. Stir in the peas and simmer uncovered until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.

On top of being a full-time student, I am going to be working near full time with a very small food budget (About $150 a month). I'm hypoglycemic so often my biggest problem is buying a ton of snacks during my day which ends up costing lots of money. So, my task for you, my dear fellow redditors, is to show me your favorite breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack recipies.

I love the idea of making things in bulk because of how busy my life will be next year, but also because it does tend to be cheaper. I believe I will be furnished with a crock pot, rice cooker, and I have a ton of brownie sheets (because my family loves ~~me~~ brownies).

So, hop on and give me all you've got, I appreciate it! 

(Please ignore spelling mistakes, I'm writing on a Norwegian system, so everything has a red line under it.)

EDIT: It occurred to me that maybe not everyone knows what hypoglycemia is. To make it short, it's a low blood-sugar disorder. I produce too much insulin and without a steady intake of sugars I can become very weak, and my ability to think and process is severely diminished. It's alleviated by consuming food, carbs are a quick solution but fats tend to keep the symptoms at bay longer.

They can be found in pretty much any moderately hippy grocery store in 1lb bags and usually sell for about $0.5-1/ounce.  

    Ingredients

    5T chia seeds (~2.5oz)
    1 13.5 oz can of coconut milk (or any nut milk)
    2t sugar (may be substituted with maple syrup or honey)
    2T cocoa powder or raw cacao
    .5t vanilla
    pinch of salt

1/3 bell pepper sliced thin

1/2 avocado mashed (eat the other half!) ($1.50)

A little sour cream

All you have to do is pan fry the salmon with a little salt and pepper for a few minutes on each side being careful not to over cook. When done put on a cutting board and break it up into pieces. Now just build your wrap with your salmon, onion, tomato, bell pepper, avocado and sour cream (just a little) on the lettuce, with hot sauce if you like. It's a very fresh and green tasting meal.

THE TL;DR: cook large amounts of meal components every week or two.  freeze sauces in ice cube trays, freeze cooked pasta, rice, meat, and veggies on a baking sheet and break up a lot while it freezes so they don't stick together.  also can freeze soup in ice cube trays.  round out with homemade bread, salads.  control macros with psyllium husk fiber and unflavored protein powder.  this method means you save money by being able to shop in bulk and use everything up and having to clean less dishes by cooking large amounts. save time from washing dishes, and cooking full meals every night.

THE FULL POST:

If you're okay with having a similar format for all your meals and have time to devote to doing mass cooking at this scale, this works well.

STEPS:

SAUCES: I make a different sauce every few days or so to replenish the stock--white clam sauce, pesto sauce, homemade marinara, Asian black bean sauce, sriracha honey sauce, pad thai sauce, tikka masala sauce, curry sauce, mole sauce, etc, and anything else I'm in the mood for. I then freeze them in ice cube trays and pop them into the appropriate labelled bag.

CARB: At some point I'll make a ton of rice, pasta, or Asian noodles. For the pastas, I'll twirl a fork in the pasta to make a pasta nest, and freeze these on cookie sheets (if you've ever gotten a Bertolli's meal with the longer pastas you know what I'm talking about as far as nests--they should be around 1.5-2 inches in diameter). For the rice, I just spread it over the baking sheet, let it freeze about halfway and then break it up into small pieces, and let it finish freezing. If you like the pasta shapes (my personal preference is for long pasta) you can freeze them similar to the rice, just in a flat layer on a baking sheet and break them up as much as possible during the freezing process to keep them from forming into chunks.

PROTEIN: Next, I cook up a bunch of meat, seasoned only with salt and pepper. Usually chicken breasts, chicken thighs, whatever cheap cut of beef I can find (usually stew meat), shrimp, sometimes bay scallops, pork tenderloin or pork butt/shoulder (use crockpot for butt/shoulder), and salmon or another fish. I cut them into small pieces and freeze them on a flat baking sheet so that they are not touching and do not freeze into large blocks. Be careful not to overcook them--they should just barely be done, since they'll cook more later.

VEGGIES: I then do the same thing with fresh vegetables (it's easier to just use the steamer veggie bags, but that ain't frugal!). I'll choose whatever is seasonal, and try to mix them up by what they will work best with--red and yellow peppers, green beans, and broccoli for Asian meals, asparagus, cauliflower, and mushrooms for Italian style food, etc etc. really depends on what I find in the grocery store. I don't actually fully cook them, just dunk them briefly in boiling water. They finish cooking when you unfreeze them and cook them with everything else.


Once you've got it all bagged and labelled you're done. Every night I just toss a few cubes of the sauce in a pan with a couple chunks of frozen pasta or rice, some protein, and some veggies.
This is really regimented cooking, designed to stretch your budget as far as it can go, allow you to use up bulk purchases at discount prices, and whittle down your cooking time little by little, so it might be overkill for most.

Of course, it doesn't take that much time to cook pasta or rice, or make veggies, or saute some chicken breast, but I also want to minimize the number of dishes and steps I use. One pan and one spatula every night, and instead of having to rewash a pot several times every time you cook pasta, I just make a ton at once so it's just one big pot to wash. I put down a sheet of aluminum foil on the baking sheets that I'm freezing on so they don't have to be washed.

Also, you can't really do it all in one day unless you have an enormous freezer, but it's a good weekend activity after you go grocery shopping! It's also great for last minute entertaining, since you've already got a ton of food and just need to heat it up. You'll just have to replenish your stock afterward!

Also, in case you don't want the same format meal, you can freeze soups in the ice cube trays so that they'll defrost in the microwave faster and you can store them for a long time. Great for nights where you want to just microwave something.

I will also help spread these meals further by making my own healthy no-knead bread.  There are plenty of no-knead recipes out there, just swap out white flour with whole wheat flour, and add whole grains--rye, flax, oatmeal, spelt, etc.  also try including sprouted grains, there are instructions online for how to sprout grains!

I'll also make salads with apple cider vinegar as the only dressing, or I'll toss in salad leaves to the cooking meal at the last minute so they don't wilt too much and are still crisp.  I usually use spinach, cabbage, a cheap normal-type leaf if I can find it (romaine or something), or occasionally kale.

Additionally, if you're trying to up your fiber and/or protein intake, I would pick up some psyllium husk fiber (can be added in small amounts to pretty much anything, including the main meals above or the bread.  maybe not the salad though.)  I would also pick up some unflavored whey protein and/or casein protein and/or a mix.  I get mine from:

http://www.musclefeast.com

Prices are on par with optimum nutrition (whey's a little more expensive, casein's a little less expensive), quality is good it seems.  can add this to the bread as well, or to the cooking meal although I would mix it with a small bit of water first to make a paste so that it doesn't clump in the sauce.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_15qbou,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15qbou/if_youre_into_cooking_and_freezing_in_advance_try/,

The other day, someone posted their black bean quesadilla, which inspired me to try something. And this is what I came up with. It's a recipe that's pretty good on its own, but also serves as a base for experimenting &amp; adding stuff.

**MAKES APPROX. 2 SERVINGS**

* Vegetable/canola oil
* 2 medium-sized potatoes, peeled
* 1/2 yellow onion
* 1 tomato. I used a vine tomato, but a couple of roma tomatoes would be good too
* Tortillas of your choice. I prefer small corn tortillas.
* Shredded cheese. Store-bought ""Mexican"" blend stuff is fine.
* Salt &amp; pepper

1. Dice the onion &amp; tomato. Peel &amp; dice the potatoes. The smaller you dice the potatoes, the better. A big grater would be good here, but I didn't have one &amp; I felt lazy.

2. Heat a pan over medium heat &amp; add about 1 tbsp. of oil. Throw in the onion &amp; cook for about 2 minutes, until it's really fragrant.

3. Throw in your potatoes &amp; cook for about 2 minutes. Add in the tomatoes, season with salt &amp; pepper. then cook for another 5-6 minutes or until the potatoes are done &amp; the tomatoes have completely disintegrated.

This is where you can (and should) experiment with adding other ingredients. While you can keep it as is &amp; probably get a decent meal out of it, it's also kind of boring. So add in other vegetables &amp; spices of your choice. I added some oregano, red pepper flakes, and a tiny bit of turmeric. If you have some round steak, you could slice it really thin, fry it in another pan for a few minutes, then add it in. Or add beans. Or chop some red peppers. It's a very Bob Ross recipe. Happy potatoes.

4. Once everything's done cooking, remove it &amp; set it aside. Take a minute and appreciate how pretty it looks. Then clean your pan.

5. Heat the pan again, then throw in your tortilla. Spread some cheese on the bottom, pile some of this potato mess on top, sprinkle more cheese, and fold the tortilla over. If you're using 2 small tortillas, put the second one on top &amp; press down on it with a spatula for a minute. Cook until the tortilla is golden brown, then flip. Serve with sour cream, guacamole, Cerveza Pacifico Clara, etc.

It's a really simple recipe, but it's filling, cheap (this will all cost you maybe $2/serving; probably a lot less), and won't kill you. I'm pretty happy with it.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_1i39np,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1i39np/potato_onion_quesadillas/,

I did this 3 1/2 years ago with a bunch and have been eating off of them since, just trimming what I need off the top.

They do so well, in fact, that I just picked the first one I planted 3 1/2 years ago. It was behind the tree and went unnoticed for quite a while, until my wife caught a glimpse. It was almost 4 feet tall! When yours starts to flower just cut the flower off.

This one is absolutely delicious, and relatively simple to boot! I used my George Foreman grill because the weather doesn't permit me to grill outside.

**Grilled Avocado and Spicy Chicken**

Ingredients:

3 lemons, juiced

1/2 onion, quartered

1/2 red bell pepper, seeds and membranes removed, quartered

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs

1/2 cup honey

1 Tbsp. ground Aleppo pepper** or cayenne pepper, or less to taste

4 bell peppers, a variety of colors is best

Olive oil

Garlic salt and pepper, to taste

2 ripe avocados, seeded and peeled


Directions:

* In a blender, purÃ©e 1/3 of the lemon juice, onion, and red bell pepper until smooth. Pour into a 1-gallon-size zip top plastic bag or large shallow dish. Add chicken breasts, turning to coat. Marinate for 45 minutes.

* In a small pan over medium heat, combine honey, garlic and lemon juice. Stir in Aleppo pepper a little at a time until desired heat level is reached. Set aside. The glaze will thicken as it cools.

* Heat the grill to medium heat. Remove chicken breasts from marinade and discard excess marinade. Grill chicken on both sides until cooked through. (Cooking time will vary based on the heat of the grill and the thickness of the chicken.) Lightly glaze the chicken on all sides with the reserved honey glaze and remove from the grill. Tent with foil to keep warm.

* Meanwhile, when chicken is about half cooked, coat the mini bell peppers with A small amount of olive oil and sprinkle with garlic salt and pepper. Add peppers to the grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides and tender, about 12 minutes. (If chicken breasts are very thin, start the peppers earlier.)

* While chicken is resting, slice avocados into 4 slices per half. Sprinkle with lemon juice and place on grill. Grill slices for 2 minutes per side, and then brush them lightly with the honey glaze.

* Top chicken breasts with grilled avocado slices and place grilled mini peppers alongside. Serve with remaining honey glaze.

**Aleppo pepper can be found at Middle Eastern markets and specialty grocers. If not available you can substitute ground cayenne pepper. Add just a little at a time to the glaze until it reaches the desired level of spiciness.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_18wexc,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/18wexc/whole_foods_wednesday_grilled_avocado_and_spicy/,

My husband and I came up with it after visiting a food truck that made comfort food egg rolls i.e. deep fried egg rolls filled w/ mac and cheese (and many others!). To make these healthy, we DID NOT deep fry, but baked them and altered the ingredients. They are filled with a chicken sausage, green peppers and onion. I'm not a huge fan of chinese food egg rolls...

Recipe:

- Preheat oven to 400 F

- Dice sausage (mine was precooked, so here you should cook it if it isn't) into small chunks. I cut the sausage in half, then each half into 4 thin slices, then cut that horizontally to get tiny pieces. I used chicken andouille sausage (all chicken, all natural).

- Heat 1 cup each of frozen, diced peppers and onions.

- Mix sausage and veggies. 

- Load and fold into egg rolls.

- spray cookie sheet/baking pan with nonstick spray

- play rolls on pan and bake until crisp (You have to watch it. It took mine about 15 min, but I'm sure it depends on several factors so just keep an eye on it.)

You get a crispy snack for 85 cal per roll! And they're about $0.54 each. That may not be super cheap, due to the price of the chicken sausage, but you can alter it to use cheaper meat. The sausage was a dollar a link (but it's really good...). Also: the veggies are frozen and you can freeze left over egg rolls (this is a pack of 20) for up to 2 months so there's really no waste.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_1fymiz,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1fymiz/chicken_andouille_sausage_pepper_and_onion_egg/,

We make this at home every other week during the cold months. 

One whole chicken (only about $4)

3 carrots (chopped)

3 stalks of celery (chopped)

1 onion (chopped)

1/2 teaspoon of each: salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. 

1 teaspoon of each: parsley and basil. Also, saffron if you have it.

1/2 bag of egg noodles. 

1 cup of white wine if you have it.

For the stock:

In a very large pot full of water (just over the top of the chicken) keep the chicken on a low boil for around 3 or 4 hours (this is where I add the wine) then remove and set aside the chicken to cool. Strain off the stock into another pot and put on the stove on low heat. You can skim off the fat if you want but I think it makes it taste better. We also usually set aside about 4 cups of stock to use in other things such as spaghetti sauce.

Now on to the soup:

In a small frying pan saute (in butter) your chopped vegetables with your spices. Add the vegetables to the stock and turn to medium. Remove the chicken skin and separate the chicken from the bones and chop to desired size. After you  add the chicken to your stock you should have enough left over for chicken sandwiches. 

Leave on a low boil for about 20 minutes and then add your noodles. Once they're soft, it's done and you should have enough for about 8 large bowls of soup and 3 or 4 chicken salad sandwiches! You can also freeze what you're not going to eat for later.

- 1-1/2 lbs. Angus Beef sirloin, sliced thin  
- 1 head Napa cabbage, shredded  
- 1 cup scallions, chopped  
- 2 3oz. packages plain ramen noodles, crumbled &amp; toasted  
- 1/2 cup sesame seeds, toasted  
 
**Marinade**  
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce (or reduced sodium soy sauce)  
- 2 tbsp. red wine, red cooking wine or sherry  
- 1 tbsp. light brown sugar, packed  
- 1 tsp. sesame oil  
- 1 clove fresh garlic, crushed  
- 1/8 tsp. ground ginger  
 
**Dressing**  
- 1/2 cup sugar  
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar  
- 1 cup extra virgin olive oil  
- sesame oil, dash  
  
**Directions**  

In a medium bowl, combine all marinade ingredients. Add beef and mix until well coated. Cover and allow to marinate for 20 minutes (or longer of course) in refrigerator. In a small bowl, combine dressing ingredients until well mixed. Cover and set aside.

Remove meat and discard remaining marinade. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes or until meat no longer pink inside.

In a large serving bowl, combine cabbage, 3/4 cup scallions, noodles and sesame seeds; toss lightly. Spoon beef over salad. Pour dressing over salad immediately before serving and garnish with remaining 1/4 cup scallions. 

*Note:* To toast ramen noodles and sesame seeds, preheat oven to 400Â° F. Place crumbled noodles on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove when golden and crispy. Then toast sesame seeds for 4 to 5 minutes, shaking pan occasionally to toast evenly. 

Enjoy!

Add the sugar to the water in a sauce pan. Place on medium heat. While the water is heating, zest your three lemons. I use a microplane grater.

*don't over zest your lemons. You should only be zesting as far down as the rind is yellow. Don't zest the white rind as it's bitter and makes for unhappy lemonade

Add the lemon zest to the water and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Juice your three lemons

The sugar should be fully dissolved now

Take the sugar / zest mixture off the stove. Run through a fine mesh strainer. Add 4-6 cups of cold water to it. Add in your lemon juice. Cool and enjoy!

Better idea!! 

Buy a package of paper lunch bags ($3-$5 depending on quantity) and a giant tub of loose popcorn kernels. (the kind you'd use in an air-popper) $10 in popcorn from BJs has lasted me months and I still have half a container left.

Put some kernels in a paper bag, crumple or fold the top to keep your popcorn contained, stick it in the microwave and push the popcorn button. 

Experiment with the quantity of popcorn to time ratio until you get it right. (protip: you need fewer kernels than you think)

Believe it or not, the plain popcorn will pop in the microwave by itself. You can then top it with whatever healtyish additive you want. I like to melt a reasonable amount of butter and put that in there and top it with a pinch or two of garlic salt..... but feel free to experiment.

Enjoy!!

Eggs have received a bad rap in the past, but one large egg has 13 essential vitamins and minerals, about 6 grams of protein, and only 70 calories. A dozen eggs costs around $2 ( I get mine for 90 cents), so at 16 cents a serving, they also make an economical addition to your breakfast.

You may not have time to scramble eggs in the morning, but you can freeze them the night before to save time. I was skeptical at first. After all, freezing scrambled eggs did not sound very tasty. But I learned that reheated frozen eggs actually taste wonderful.


It only takes two minutes to scramble an egg in the microwave. If you want to avoid the cholesterol found in the egg yolk, you can also use egg whites, available in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.

Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil

1 pound turkey sausage

1 green or red sweet pepper, chopped

1 small onion, chopped

12 large eggs

1/2 cup 2% milk (optional)

1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper

cheese, shredded

salsa (optional)

12-14 medium sized tortillas



Directions

In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and add the turkey sausage, pepper, and onion.

Break the sausage up into tiny pieces and brown the sausage until completely cooked, and peppers and onions are soft. Set aside.
    
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until combined.
    

Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of butter and melt all over the pan. Add the eggs and scramble until cooked through.

Warm the tortillas in microwave per the package instructions.

Layer 1/2 cup scrambled eggs, 1/2 cup cooked sausage and peppers mixture, 1-2 tbsp shredded cheese, and a little salsa on a warmed medium-sized tortilla. Fold up into a burrito.
    
Place each burrito on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and flash-freeze in the freezer for at least 60 minutes. Wrap each burrito in foil and store in a freezer bag in the freezer.
    
When ready to eat, remove foil, wrap in a paper towel and microwave for about 60 seconds or until warm all the way through. Breakfast is served!

I started thinking of ways to dress it up, and here's [today's recipe](http://i.imgur.com/wF5v1h.jpg).  Granted, there's nothing really revolutionary about adding stuff to oatmeal, but I thought I'd share anyway (first post to this sub!). 
 
#1c water
#1/2c oats
#2 Tbsp golden raisins
#2 Tbsp unsalted sunflower seeds
#Splash of milk (we had eggnog, so I used a splash of that today)
#Sprinkle Cinnamon and/or nutmeg (I also use a little ground clove sometimes)
#2 Tbsp honey, brown sugar, molasses, OR maple syrup (We had some awesome nutmeg syrup left over from a trip to Grenada last spring, which is amazing in oatmeal)
#Tiny splash of vanilla extract

...
#A 16oz bag of unsalted sunflower kernels will last you forever and run around $4-6.  A 14-16oz box of golden raisins is like $3-4.  I like to [premix these and store in a container](http://i.imgur.com/VqW7kh.jpg) for easy access. You should be able to get enough for 20 servings of this mix for around $7-10.  Then, add oatmeal and whatever ingredients/spices you have laying around, really.  I'm just eyeballing this but if you include the milk and spices, I think each serving is under $1.50 or $2, and even less if you tend to buy in bulk.

______

#**Other variations/add-ins:**#
#Dried cherries
#Dried cranberries
#Crushed walnuts
#Crushed up banana chips (or, blend aging banana with milk for a puree to mix in) 
#Steep boiling water in a fruit tea, apple-cinnamon, or a fruit-green tea blend before adding oats; Add fresh or dried berries for added taste/texture.
#Peanut or almond butter (crunchy or smooth), with or without fresh banana slices
#Blueberries (Fresh, OR mash them up and saute with a little butter and honey before adding).  You could also do this with apples or strawberries...I love sauteed apples. 
_____

#Some variants are not as frugal (or nutritious) as others, but typically you can get some big bags of dried fruit or nuts on the cheap that should last a while.  I like the sunflower &amp; raisin combo because the seeds add an extra flavor and are filling, and the raisins allow me to add less sugar but still enjoy a sweeter taste.

green peppers,
cheddar cheese,
chicken breast,
Lean Ground Beef,
whole brown rice,
Black Beans,

Tortillas,
Pasta Sauce,
Pasta of your choice,
Butter/Margarine,
Bag of Spinach,
Tilapia,
Eggs,

With these you can do baked potatoes, multiple types of pastas, make your own alfredo sauce, do baked chicken, lemon pepper tilapia (if you have enough spices). Omelettes.

Even if you're not really a baker, these are definitely worth it. AND because some of the ingredients that make cinnamon rolls extremely creamy and gooey have been swapped out for less diabetes-inducing, artery clogging things, they're something you can have once in awhile without worrying about coming back to kill you.

Dough:

* 1/2 C. milk
* 1 T. yeast
* 1 C. whole wheat flour
* 1 C. white flour (+ about 1/4 cup for kneading)
* 1/4 C. brown sugar
* 1/2 t. salt
* 1/4 C. pumpkin puree
* 1 egg

Sift together the salt, flours and yeast and set aside. Beat together the sugar, pumpkin and egg. Warm the milk and add it to the pumpkin mixture. Add the flour mixture to this about 1/2 C. at a time, beating it until it's totally free of lumps. When all the flours are added, knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until it's smooth and a little damp feeling but doesn't stick to your hands. Put the dough in an oiled bowl, set it in a warm place and let it rise to double.
 
Filling:

* 1/4 C. applesauce
* 1/2 C. brown sugar
* 1 T. cinnamon

Punch the dough down and roll it out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the applesauce over the dough. Sprinkle on the brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll up the dough tightly and pinch the edge down so it stays rolled up. Cut it into 12 using a really sharp knife or a piece of thread so they don't squich down. Place the rolls in a lightly oiled baking pan and cover loosely. Place them in the fridge for 6 to 8 hours - overnight is fine.

Icing:

* 3 C.  powdered sugar
* 1/4 t. vanilla
* 2 T. milk

Remove the cinnamon rolls from the fridge and let them sit on the counter while you preheat the oven to 350F. Remove the cover and bake for approximately 30 minutes. While the rolls are baking, mix the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. Add more milk if needed to get a consistency you like. Spread or pour the icing over the rolls as soon as they come out of the oven.

I personally didn't think this sounded difficult and joined in. I'll have to budget a certain amount for veggies and meat each week. I'm thinking some clearance rack meat and veggies in a slow cooker for stew will be many meals and relatively cheap.  

Also different meat and veggies mixed with pasta, rice, or eggs is a tasty healthy meal right there and not too expensive. I always cook enough for a leftover lunch or two, also.

My question to you is how you would plan this out and what foods you would get to not exceed a $150.00 food budget for the month while still eating cheap and healthy?

6 lbs. uncut chicken wings 

FOR THE RUB
2 tbsp. Smoked Paprika
4 tsp. onion powder
4 tsp. coriander 
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 tsp. crushed red pepper
2 tsp. brown sugar
salt
fresh-ground black pepper

FOR THE SAUCE
1 cup Frank's RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce
1 cup good quality barbecue sauce
1 tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
4 tbsp. Sriracha hot sauce (optional)


1. For the rub: Combine spices in a large bowl, adding salt and fresh-ground black pepper to taste. Toss the wings in the spice mixture, and let wings sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 

2. Arrange wings on wire racks set on sheet trays. Place the wings in a cold oven and set for 275Âº. Cook for 30 minutes, until the fat begins to render and drip down onto the trays.

3. Raise oven temperature to 475Âº. Continue to cook wings until golden brown and crispy, about 30-45 minutes more, rotating the trays and flipping the wings halfway through the cooking. If the wings are not crispy after 45 minutes, run them under the broiler until crispiness is achieved. After the wings are crispy, let them cool slightly. Cut chicken into wings and drumettes, if desired.

4. For the sauce: Mix hot sauce and barbecue sauce together. Pour half the sauce around the edges of a large bowl.  Add the wings and toss to coat, adding reserved sauce as necessary.

Add to a pot
- 2 c water
- 1 tbsp olive oil 
- 1/2 - 1 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 c orzo, farro, brown rice, or any very small pasta/barley
- 1/2 a white onion, sliced in half once more, then sliced thinly in halfmoon shapes.
- 2-3 garlic cloves, sliced very thinly
- opt. 1 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)

Put all ingredients on the stove. Bring to a boil, then simmer 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat, add 
-1/4 c basil or 1 c kale/any leafy green (so it just barely wilts)
- opt grated asiago or parm cheese. 
- a few turns of black pepper and salt, if you're so inclined.

This dish gets a really lovely glutenous, saucy texture, flavored by tomato and onion. This is oddly addicting. The tomatoes just pop in your mouth with lovely hot juice. Yes. I said that. It's also great cold or lukewarm!

My husband has a man-cold, and to quell his hunger for both delicious food and nostalgia I made up a recipe last night. It was a huge success, so I want to share it with everyone!

Ingredients:

One batch [pollo asado](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15ojnt/pollo_asado_or_chicken_tacoburrito_meat/) with an additional 2 teaspoons onion powder, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper, 1 teaspoon dill weed, 1 teaspoon parsley, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder (~$3)

1 quart chicken broth (free if you make your own!)

1 teaspoon chicken bouillon [(I use this brand)](https://www.superiortouch.com/retail/products/better-than-bouillon/organic-bases/38/organic-chicken-base) (trivial)

5-6 stalks of celery (~$.40)

1 medium onion (~$.30)

1 cup quinoa (I used a mix of regular and red to make it look fancy) (~$.50)

2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:

Make the chicken according to the other recipe. Try to get the brunt of the spices right onto the chicken, it makes for a nice effect. Once that is finished cooking, shred it with two forks and add the chicken broth and extra bouillon.

Preheat your oven to 400F. Cut your veggies into bite-sized pieces, toss in a pan with the olive oil, shake to coat, and roast for 30 minutes. When they are done, toss them into the slowcooker with the chicken, and add the cup of quinoa. Turn the slowcooker to high and cook an additional hour and a half. 

This makes 6-8 servings for about $5! Try to finish within two days lest the quinoa get too mushy (unless you like that like I do).

Does anyone know how quinoa freezes?

So quick backstory, my Grandma was my nanny (watched me after school with my other cousins) and she grew up poor, had five kids by the time she was 22, and raised them on mostly one income, so yeah, she kicks butt when it comes to eating cheap and healthy.  One of my favorite meals she made was one she called ""Poor Man's Meal"" because it basically just consisted of eggs plus whatever you have in your kitchen that is about to go bad.  Yeah the ingredients changed, but I always remember it being bomb and absolutely delicious, so now that I am a students and living on scraps, this has become one of my favorite meals to try and get all of my nutrients, plus afford to live.

Here is one example of an egg scramble/Poor Man's Meal I just made this afternoon for my boyfriend and I.


* 5 eggs ($0.80)
* Half an onion ($0.50)
* Mushrooms ($0.50)
* 1 Avocado ($1.25)
* Salt, pepper, olive oil, hot sauce (Not sure on price since I buy in bulk on these items and they last forever)

Just heat the onions and mushrooms in olive oil and some salt and pepper until they have cooked down a bit.  Add the eggs and once theyre about half down, add the avocado!

Of course I smothered it in hot sauce, and it was delicious plus incredibly filling for the both of us.

I also like to add some potato and green onion when I cook this meal and maybe some meat if I can afford it.

I had a ""healthy-eating"" streak at some point where I ate a lot of chopped vegetable-chicken combo, always fried and spiced with curry and stuff, but it got insanely boring after a few weeks, to the point where I can't even eat it anymore.

I would eat much more fruit than I do, but it's very expensive in Denmark, and I can't afford it more than as a luxury.

I've been looking here for advice, but it's a huge jungle of things, and I need to start out simpler.

I have access to fridge, freezer, microwave, all the stuff. Not a slow-cooker though. I'm not very good at eating remains either ... something about leaving it in the fridge, dunno. It just makes me feel bad for some reason.

I eat fairly well, most of the time (it's hard to cook all your own meals when working full time, going to school, and volunteering as a firefighter).  

On an ideal day, I get up at 5:30 and go to the gym from 6-7am.  I will grab a high-protein breakfast item (egg-white wrap, etc) from the gym's cafe if it's on special that day or I'm running behind.  Otherwise breakfast is usually some combination of oatmeal, fresh fruit, and yogurt/cottage cheese.  Lunch can range from salmon and orzo to grilled chicken to chili or even a burger.

During the day, I work in an office doing computery things.  Deadlines and the nature of the work can make it hard to eat properly.  I like to keep a fair amount of food at the office for grazing purposes, and I'm just curious what the best options might be.  (I have a nalgene bottle and usually drink 1-2L of water a day)

I have or have had the following in my desk drawer over the past 12 months:

* [Protein Bars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RD8EJI/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) - not the best, but I'm not a body builder.  Mainly eat these on mornings when I haven't had time to get a proper breakfast in after a workout.
* Raw Walnuts, [Cocoa Roast Almonds](http://www.amazon.com/Emerald-Cocoa-Almonds-Chocolate-Canister/dp/B001EQ55RW/), Macademia Nuts - I try to eat the nuts pretty sparingly.  At most a handful a day.  They're fatty and also super expensive.
* [Peanut-Butter Filled Pretzels](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Health-Peanut-Butter-Pretzels/dp/B000LKTPCS) - Also try to limit the intake, they are SO GOOD.
* [Kashi Dark Chocolate and Coconut Granola Bars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPMN2/) - only 120 calories per, 7g of sugar.

Clearly none of these are super-healthy, but I like to think they aren't terrible options for keeping one's metabolism up during the day, and most of them ensure that I'm getting adequate levels of protein.  I'd like to incorporate some better choices if possible, so I'm turning to you guys for ideas.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_19ewf3,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/19ewf3/healthy_snack_foods_for_the_office_xpost_from/,

Wrong. You'd be surprised at how many people I know who can not make the simplest of things. Luckily, this is incredibly easy for everyone!    
Ingredients:    
1 Onion (your preference)    
1 Green Pepper (or yellow, red, doesn't matter. Your preference!)    
Broccoli    
1 pound of Chicken    
Olive Oil    

Ok, let's break this down.    
First things first- You do not have to use the entire pound of chicken. But if you do, I insist you use an entire onion, pepper, etc, as you will want it for the flavoring. You can proportion it this way: 1 pound = 1 veggie, so on and so forth    

    
Alright, slice the chicken super thin. You can dice it if you want, but ensure it is in small pieces.    
Trow some olive oil in a skillet, put your chicken in it.     
Cut up your veggies how you wish, i prefer diced onions and chopped broccoli and my green peppers however I feel.    
Ok, everything is ready.    
Put your olive oil in the skillet and make it hot!    
Then toss the chicken and veggies in and sizzle away. Be sure to stir (hence the name :D)        
Add spices, I like Cayenne pepper, chili powder and a dash of garlic powder. Make sure it's all unsalted, or only one salted. Spices with salt can really ruin a meal if you salt it too much.    
Throw in some Tobasco sauce for good measure (the little bottle is for cooking).    
Stir, allow the chicken to cook all the way through and voila, you have deliciousness.    

A few things I like to do is this, fry up a tortilla shell, get some shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and now you have a chicken taco. You can throw lettuce, tomatoes and a bit of sour cream on it at this rate and have a taco that rivals any Mexican restaurant.    
Also of note, if you're going for a taco, you may want to skip on the broccoli. But I love vegetables.

I don't agree with everything she says (she doesn't have enough evidence for her medical claims) but the stuff she says about nutritional needs is different than the usual carbs-protien-fat way of looking at food.

The diet itself uses a lot of very inexpensive foods.  At least they're cheap in my part of the world.

I am already slim), I wonder if I can even manage to do Vegetable juicing without spending tons of money? Would I be able to effectively juice (nutrition-wise) one ""juice-meal"" per day with roughly 30 â¬ (~40 $) per *week*, or is juicing more expensive?

The bread crumbs is where I sort of improvised since I forgot to buy them so I toasted a piece of bread and crumbled it. 

I halved the peppers and scooped out the seeds. In a bowl I mixed the cream cheese and goat cheese. Then I spooned it into the halves. I dipped them in bread crumbs and then baked in the oven at 375 for about 17 minutes.

Iâm hoping to improve my quality of life in several ways, and all at once; economically, nutritionally, practicallyâ¦ and all among the deliciousness. So it goes, Iâve been looking into doing something that I did back in collegeâ¦ and now so much better than I did back then. The base notions are, as follows:

1.) Purchase some really tasty rice in bulk (preferably Jasmine rice and/or Basmati rice and no more than a 10 - 25 pound bag of rice at a time) ~ I hope to purchase online or from a local Asian food store

2.) Purchase dried beans in bulk (again, no more than 10 â 25 pounds, and perhaps a mix of dried beans) ~ the bulk purchase of beans is not an absolute need, but may or may not be useful from an economic standpoint for orders online, of course

Soâ¦ why the post here?

There are many thousands of rice and dried bean products available online, from grocery stores (of course), and from countless vendors around the world. My hope is for feedback from the vast and awesome base of experience among reddit in this regard. I plan to buy chicken in bulk, cook it up, portion and freeze it toward adding later as well.

I seek the best products, at the best price, based upon experience. The cool thing is these two components make for an (almost) ideal base for eating and living well.

So, redditâ¦ what yah got? Products, recipes, best practicesâ¦ even your favorite rice cooker? Any notion is welcomed and appreciated.

**Puerto Rican Tostones (Fried Plantains)**

Ingredients:

5 tablespoons Olive oil for frying

1 firm green plantain, peeled and broken into chunks (or cut diagonally)

3 cups cold water

salt to taste

Directions:

* Heat the oil in a large skillet. Place the plantains in the oil and fry on both sides; approximately 3 1/2 minutes per side.

* Remove the plantains from the pan and flatten the plantains by placing a plate over the fried plantains and pressing down.

* Dip the plantains in water, then return them to the hot oil and fry 1
minute on each side. Salt to taste and serve immediately.

* If you fry them until they look brownish, you've 
overdone it. Go for the crispy golden look.

**Oven Baked Sweet Plantains**

Ingredients:

4 very ripe plantains (when the skin is yellow with spots of black)
cooking spray

Directions:

* Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Coat a nonstick cookie sheet with cooking spray or olive oil.

* Cut the ends off of the plantains and peel. Cut each plantain on the diagonal into 1/2 inch slices.

* Arrange in single layer and coat tops with cooking spray. Bake, turning occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until plantains are golden brown and very tender.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_180l1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/180l1n/whole_foods_wednesday_plantains/,

I also add a can of Grabanzo beans.

I bring it to a simmer and then add the tilapia fillets.  I've also used cod (which works well).  I think shrimp would also be really good, but I haven't tried it yet.

I let it simmer until the fish is cooked all the way through then turn it down to low and eat!!

last night i made curry for the first time and it was a huge success! i used this recipe as my jumping off point. i did have to make quite a few alterations though (lack of ingredients mostly) so you can adjust this to however you want. 

1. i didn't have red curry paste. ~~i used three tablespoons of yellow curry powder~~ you should use four, as PyroPhan suggested. 

2. you don't have to use chicken breasts. just use whatever you have. if you really want it to taste good, you have to let it simmer for at least 45 min anyway. don't worry too much about undercooked chicken. 

3. i didn't use 1 1/3 cups of coconut milk. that's a LOT of coconut milk (almost an entire can). i used a little more than half of a can. you can use reduced fat coconut milk to make it healthier.

4. i added about 1.5 tablespoons of greek yogurt. 

5. didn't add the can of tomatoes. now that i think about it, i feel like that would have changed the flavor. 

**SPICES**

okay so here's where i really deviated from the recipe (except for the basil). i kind of just guessed and began throwing together herbs. i probably did 1.5 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of tumeric and dried ground ginger (each), a sprinkle of ground nutmeg and ground cloves, 1 tsp of smoked paprika and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. you might want to use less/more of the spices depending on how you like your curry.

What you'll need:

1 large can of whole tomatoes (about $1.50)

2 teaspoons basil and parsley (add as much as you like)

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon paprika

1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Salt and pepper to taste

1 crook neck squash (about $1) (chopped)

1 pork roast (about $5)

The sauce:

Put one can of stewed tomatoes in the blender with salt and pepper and spices listed above and blend until smooth.

Lets get started:

In a large pan heat up your oil (medium high), salt and pepper the roast and put in the pan fat side down, brown and flip. Once you've browned the bottom add the tomato,  onions and garlic and brown. Once your onions are translucent add the chicken stock along with the sauce and mix. Turn down to simmer and cover for 2 hours. After two hours add the potatoes, zucchini and squash, and let simmer another 45 minutes or until the potatoes are cook. You'll probably have left overs for lunch tomorrow!

I'm trying to convince them that paying the $20-50 for a hotel suite with full kitchen is better than eating out every day. I have a feeling this means I'll be in charge of the food (and cleaning) for the weekend. So I'm looking to put together a menu/price list to present to them.   This means:

* Meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner (more specifics later)
* 8 people, possibly 1-2 more.
* 1 diabetic (who cheats often, but I will try to accomodate him, no idea about that though?)
* 2 other very typically healthy eaters
* Aiming for under $10 per person per day (and much less if possible) (Note: I'm in BC, Canada. Prices for dairy and some fresh produce are inflated here. Anything that can be out in the trunk of a car for ~5hrs, I will buy cheaper at home, meats and dairy would likely be bought at the destination.)
* Prefer minimal uses of dishes, so one-pot or crockpot meals would be good
* I would consider something that I can make a week ahead of time, freeze, and cook in the oven (casserole? Not sure what they're called), though I'd only do one of these (because of cooler space for the trip up).
* Trying to use very similar ingredients, or re-use any leftovers in the following breakfast. Basically trying to use up everything we buy. Spices would be excluded as I'm sure we can pack those from home.
* Nothing too extreme in taste, nor heavy in the stomach (especially breakfast and lunches) because of motion sickness and such. Prefer healthier options vs. something fried.
* Lunches we may be able to do on a BBQ, but otherwise would need to be pre-prepared and eat cold (prefer this over BBQ, we'll be busy).
* Quick to make. 30 minutes or less total is ideal, anything more than an hour (prep+cook time) is a no.
* This will be in early October, weather in the area is variable, usually warm sunny days and colder nights, with some possibility of rain.

As for how many meals/what days:

* Thursday afternoon snack (might be able to skip this)
* Thursday dinner likely after 9pm (yeah...)
* Friday breakfast
* Friday lunch, may be a good day for BBQ *IF* we bring the BBQ, would prefer to plan for cold-packed.
* Friday dinner, again after 9pm (that's why we want them to be quick, light, and filling)
* Saturday breakfast (must be quick, like 10mins, or prepared the night before)
* Saturday lunch - definitely cold-packed.
* Saturday afternoon snack, again something cold-packed (an assortment of fruit that's easy to grab and eat while doing other things might be best?)
* No Saturday dinner needed.
* Sunday breakfast.

So can you guys help me come up with some creative dishes to serve to meet all of this?

1. Thaw one loaf of frozen bread dough
2. Flatten into a rectangle
3. Spread butter thinly over the top (I use Country Crock which has less calories)
4. Sprinkle brown sugar thinly over the butter
5. Roll into a log and then cut into sections
6. In a 13x9 pan, cover the bottom with brown sugar
7. Pour in 1/2-3/4 of a half pint container of whipping cream
8. Place your cut up rolls into the mixture and let rise for an hour
9. Bake at 375 for 25 min (give or take 5 minutes) until the tops are golden brown
10. Cover a cookie sheet with tin foil, place it upside down on top of the cake pan, grip the cake pan, and flip it over so the cake pan is now facing down
11. Carefully remove the hot cake pan and enjoy!

PS: You can also throw a little cinnamon on after step 4!

Welcome to our first [Gardening Tuesdays],hardtoremember,40,5,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16ngm9/gardening_is_the_cheapest_food_you_can_get/,"Welcome to our first gardening Tuesday! I just wanted to start out with my experience with gardening as someone who had never grown a thing in my life until 3 or so years ago. I only started as sort of a hobby to make my all rock yard green for my wife. I had the sudden thought, ""why not grow things I can eat instead of things that just suck up water?"" Little did I know how rewarding it would be. 

There is an initial cost for the soil and seeds but it depends on how much you want to grow. I always go over board and spent around $100, then I used bricks and stuff we had piled in our yard to build the raised beds. I started with basil, tomato, hot peppers, zucchini, radishes and sunflowers to attract bees. Well, it absolutely exploded until fairly quickly I had more than we could eat, and once they started producing I was hooked!. After building the gardens it was pretty easy; plant stuff, water it and let it grow! Now you'd think it would be hard to grow things in the desert but after adjusting the water everything was a go.

Just to give you an idea of what you can get out of a few seeds from a 99 cent pack, each tomato plant produced anywhere between 100 and 250 or so tomatoes. Our cucumbers and hot peppers produced hundreds and hundreds, so many that we learned to pickle because we couldn't give enough away. That first year we were at the point where we hardly had to buy produce at the store, if at all. Now we've easily tripled our garden and use it as a hobby for me and my wife to do together, giving vegetables to our friends, neighbors and local soup kitchens. It may seem a bit daunting at first but once you start doing it and once you start walking outside to pick your dinner, you'll be absolutely hooked!

I'm looking forward to more threads and talking about my successes and failures, to hopefully inspire you to start growing your own food.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_16ngm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16ngm9/gardening_is_the_cheapest_food_you_can_get/,moderator

Ingredients: Three limes, three lemons, 3 cups of water, 1 1/2 cups sugar
Prep: Zest your lemons and limes. Be careful not to zest too deeply as the white part under the skin is bitter in both the limes and the lemons. Set the zest aside. Juice the remaining lemons / limes. Set the juice aside.
1. Bring three cups water to a boil. Add 1 1/2 cups sugar and stir until sugar has dissolved.
2. Lower the heat and add the zest from the lemons and limes. Simmer for 10 minutes
3. Remove the syrup mixture from the heat and add the lemon / lime juice. 
4. Filter the syrup through a fine mesh sieve.
5. Cool. Syrup can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Adding a pinch of ascorbic acid will lengthen the shelf life, but this syrup never lasts that long in our fridge :)

In my past job, I collected many vegetable-centered recipes designed for people on a severely limited income.

These recipes have been gleaned from all over the internet. I hope you find a few that you enjoy!

For breakfast, try some [apple pie oatmeal](http://www.familyfeedbag.com/2011/04/apple-pie-oatmeal.html) which is just as luxurious and not as sugary as it sounds. Apples and oatmeal are always pretty inexpensive. Experiment with other fruits that are in season!

[Roasted Carrots with Cumin](http://markbittman.com/carrots-and-cumin-2-ways)--Enjoy either as a hearty, inexpensive side dish, or a delicious, thick soup. Use vegetable broth to make it veg/vegan.

If beans and veggies are your style, try [Black Bean and Rice Soup with Lime and Cilantro](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2006/12/black-bean-and-rice-soup-with-lime-and.html) or [Ratatouille](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2008/03/ratatouille-0-pts.html).

[Mac and Cheese style Cauliflower](http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/mac-and-cheese-style-cauliflower/)--Yes, mac and cheese is inepensive in it's pre-packaged form but for someone who is trying to maintain health on a limited budget, try using cauliflower to limit your carb intake and get some extra vitamins into your diet.

Chilis can be the mecca of inexpensive, hearty meals. Cook in bulk and save it for later, or use it to feed a large group for very little money. Here's a [vegeterian chili](http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/vegetarian-quinoa-chili/) with quinoa, and here's a great [low fat chicken chili](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2008/11/crock-pot-chicken-taco-chili-4-pts.html). Use dried beans instead of canned for lower sodium content and more savings.

[Vegeterian lettuce wraps](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2012/02/vegetarian-lettuce-wraps/) are great for low-carbers out there, especially if you live near an Asian market. Tofu will otherwise be in your produce department. (The rumors aren't true! Tofu isn't always a flavorless ingredient. Expereiment!)

For someone who is neither vegetarian nor low-carb, try [Confetti Chicken pasta](http://bakecakery.com/2011/04/13/confetti-chicken-pasta-recipe/). Use whole grain or brown rice pasta for more fiber (keeps you feeling full longer). Don't be afraid to experiment with the veggies in this one; it's a really flexible recipe.

Stir fries are something EVERYONE should have in their repoire. Try this  [peanut chicken stir fry](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/peanut-chicken-stir-fry?ecd=soc_pt_030112_pm) (ignore all the fancy, specific items. Use what you've got; all the veggies are inexpensive). Use quinoa or brown rice as the filler; great protein and fiber options for little money. Here are [six stirfry sauce recipes](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-various-stirfry-sa-97698) so that you don't get bored. Use any meat or tofu in any sauce. It's hard to go wrong with stirfry.


I have many, many more recipes. If there's an interest I can work on putting together more lists, but I think that's enough for now.

Has anyone noticed that jars and cans of pasta sauce often contain about 5 or 3.5 servings?  But whether you buy jarred sauces or make your own, you're still going to have some left over at some point and it's probably not going to be enough for a meal. Instead of throwing it away or shoving it in the refrigerator until it goes off, you can use it in other ways!

For marinara-type sauces:

* As a dip for fries/breadsticks/cheese sticks
* Instead of ketchup in meatloaf
* As a topping for omelets
* As a topping for burgers
* Make mini pizza

For cheesy sauces:

* As a dip for fries
* Poured over vegetables
* As a topping for chicken
* In a casserole

Of course, you can also freeze it! If you're always needing just a little bit of sauce for something, freeze it in ice cube trays or a muffin tin. When it's solid, put the cubes in a tightly sealed freezer bag and thaw only what you need at a time.

**What you'll need:**

1 lb hamburger (about $4)

1 clove garlic

1/2 onion (about 20 cents)

1 regular can of whole tomatoes (75 cents)

1/2 small tomato (25 cents)

1 cup rice

**How to make it:**

Prepare your rice according to the instructions on the package. You can substitute some of the water for chicken stock for more flavor.

In a frying pan brown the hamburger with salt, pepper, diced onions and garlic. Break apart the hamburger while you're cooking so it's all in little pieces. When done drain of the fat and put the hamburger in the bottom of an 8x8 pyrex baking dish. Blend your tomatoes until smooth and pour over the meat. Now put your rice over the top of your hamburger and 6 or 8 thin slices of tomato and onion on top to finish it off. Bake at 350 until the top starts browning (20-25 minutes) and you're done!

Remember to let it cool down for 5 to 10 minutes before serving or you WILL burn your mouth.

Post your favorite ideas!,loveshercoffee,34,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/182d1f/thursday_doover_what_to_do_with_leftover_mashed/,"One of my favorite ways to use up mashed potatoes is to make potato pancakes. If you've never had them before, they're not ""puffy"" like a traditional pancake, so technically they're probably more like a fritter except they're not deep fried. Anyway, they're delicious.

For the basic pancakes, mix together:

* 1-1/2 C. mashed potatoes
* 1 egg
* 2 - 3 T. flour
* 2 - 3 T. milk

There's a little guesswork involved here because it depends on how wet or dry your potatoes are to begin with. You want this to be sort of spoonable, not runny enough to pour but not quite thick enough to make balls of dough by hand. Add the milk only if needed to get it to the right consistency. 
 
For the super-delicious part, just mix in finely chopped onions, garlic, cheese, chilis, bits of ham or bacon or whatever you have. 

These are cooked on a griddle or frying pan over medium heat with just enough butter or oil to keep them from sticking. They take about 5-6 minutes on each side, but they're done when they're firm and hot in the center. If you like a crisper crust on the outside, knock the heat up a notch.

I like these as a side with dinner just like any other kind of potato, but my son likes to stuff them with all the fixings of an omelet and then eat them with salsa.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_182d1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/182d1f/thursday_doover_what_to_do_with_leftover_mashed/,moderator

Every ingredient is easily substituted.",jedi123,35,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/17wpbe/quick_egg_drop_rice_lowcalorie_cheap_meal_for_one/,"I came up with recipe to get rid of some leftovers.
*Ingredients:*
-1/4 cup dry rice 
-1-2 eggs
-1 cup water
-1 cube chicken bullion
-1 pack frozen veggies of your choice, broccoli florets work well (steam in bag--could also use leftover steamed vegetables, or 1 can if that's available)
-Ground ginger, salt and pepper, and other spices
*Instructions:*
1. In one small sauce pot, mix rice, water, and bullion, and bring to boil.
2. Once water boils, turn burner down to medium low, where the broth still simmers. Add spices and stir rice once, then crack 1-2 eggs directly into broth. Don't stir right after adding eggs, you will end up with egg completely emulsified and unable to differentiate tastes. Cover pot with lid, and set a timer for 15 minutes.
-While rice and eggs are cooking, microwave steam-in-bag/leftover veggies. If using canned, rinse veggies and add to pot.
3. After vegetables of choice are cooked, portion out the amount you want into bowl and put any remaining veggies up as leftovers. Once timer is done, stir egg-rice mixture, making sure eggs are cooked all the way through (you may want to stir half-way through timer). Dump the entire content of the pot into bowl, and eat! **Extremely filling, and and entire semi-balanced meal in one container!**
*Suggestions:*
-Use pre-cooked chicken, beef, pork instead of eggs
-Beef bullion instead of chicken, or plain water(adding flavor later)
-Soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, hot sauce.

*Low calorie (example, differs according to your preferences):*
1 serving rice=160 calories
2 Eggs=140 calories
2 Servings broccoli=60 calories
Chicken bullion=5 calories

Better for you than ground beef, although I don't know how cheap it is... Based on a recipe from epicurious. Makes at least 8 servings.


1 cup chopped onion, divided ($1.39)

1 tablespoon olive oil (small)

1/2 cup bulgur wheat (this and quinoa together ~$2.50)

1/2 cup quinoa

2 cups water

1 can black beans (~15 ounces), rinsed and drained (~$1.50)

1 can kidney beans (~15 ounces), rinsed and drained (~$1.50)

3 tablespoons soy sauce (small)

3/4 cup walnuts (~2 1/2 ounces) ($2.50)

3/4 cup pecans ($3)

4 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped (small)

1 cup packed cilantro sprigs ($1)

1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (small)

1/2 teaspoon cayenne (small)

* Brown onions in oil
* Add water and quinoa, simmer for ~5 minutes
* Add bulgar, continue simmering until water is completely absorbed
* While that is simmering, toast walnuts and pecans lightly
* Mix everything in very large bowl
* Throw everything into a food processor, process into ground beefy texture
* Form into burger patties
* Pan fry in a tiny amount of olive oil

When I do it, I also add vegetables that I have around. Often kale and shredded/drained carrot. When doing this, I add them with the water so they can swap flavors a bit with their surroundings.

Proportions are also pretty variable. Don't have quinoa? Use all bulgar wheat. Hate black/kidney beans? Substitute with kidney/black or pinto beans. Pecans too expensive (can be pretty ridiculous sometimes)? Use all walnut. I use 4x the cayenne, but some might not like that.

Serve with avocado, spicy sprouts, cheese, lettuce, stone ground mustard (whatever condiments you want) on burger buns. I normally make sweet potato fries to go with.

Pro-tip: Eat half of it as burgers, then mix in a package of taco seasoning. Eat in tortillas as tacos.


EDIT: Formatting

EDIT: Added pricing based on buying online from a large (expensive) grocery chain. Rounding up for the spices and whatnot, it costs about $12 for 8 servings. At this same grocery, ground beef costs $4.50 a pound. Assuming you use one serving of this to replace 1/4 pound of beef, it costs 1.33x as much ($12 for 8 servings/ $9 for 8 servings) as beef.

I recently lost a recipe for an easy-to-make, one-pot-wonder meal containing the above. From memory it went something like: 

1. Boil borccoli and pasta then remove from pot

2. Save one cup of the pasta/broccoli water

3. Fry a bit of garlic in olive oil in the pot

4. Return broccoli and pasta to the pot

5. Cook at low temperature, throwing in tons of parmesan, black pepper, chilli flakes and the pasta/brocolli water.




That's roughly it but I tried making it the other day and it didn't turn out as well as it had previously. Suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong?

(300 calories for a complete dinner),nerdologist,35,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/17r2xt/help_me_perfect_my_cheap_and_healthy_spinach/,"These days this is my go-to for a light dinner or brunch, high in protein and fiber, and very quick to make.   Even if I am bleary-eyed in the morning or famished when I get home from work, this recipe is so fast and easy I can still do it without a problem.  Just two bowls and a pan, plus a spoon, a fork, and a spatula to clean-up.

**Healthy Spinach Pancakes**

Prep time: 10 minutes, cook time 10 minutes

For one serving (300 calories): 

1/4 cup whole wheat flour     
1/4 tsp baking powder    
2-3 pinches salt     
2 Tbsp plain yogurt (I use Greek, 2% fat)     
1 egg, beaten     
28g mozzarella cheese, shredded    
1/4 cup chopped frozen spinach, thawed and drained.        
Pan spray for cooking

The yogurt and eggs are mixed together until they are custardy and uniform, then the spinach and cheese are folded in and added to dry ingredients, which have already been mixed separately in a larger bowl.  A little water is often necessary to get it to the right consistency, like cake batter.  They are cooked in canola oil over medium heat (turn when bubbles break on the surface, brown on both sides).  You can make it with half the cheese, and knock off 40 calories.

Makes about 8-10 silverdollar-sized pancakes

These are already pretty darn good, but I definitely think they could be better, they need a punch.  Curry powder?  Fresh basil?

The great thing about the recipe now is that this can be made with pantry staples and long lasting fridge staples, so I always the have the ingredients around even if i haven't had a chance to shop.  It's also very fast to make, and if I can keep it that way it would be great.  I've thought about adding sauteed onion and/or mushrooms, but the slicing and sautÃ©ing adds a lot of extra time and mess.

(If anyone is interested, I have a sweet version of these pancakes as well that is farther along in the research and development process and has been beta tested by my boyfriend with excellent results.)

Thanks!

Salads are always overlooked, and it's a shame. Aside from not just being 'chick food', there are a lot more options than most people consider when one thinks salad. Here are two I particularly love on a day when I'm in the mood for a bowl of greens.

**Cran-walnut salad with grilled chicken**

A large bowl of organic spring salad mix (~$.50)

A handful of dried cranberries (apple-juice sweetened preferred) (~$.50)

A handful of walnut pieces (~$.50)

1-2 chicken breasts, grilled on a George Foreman grill, sliced into strips, and cooled (~$1)

A handful of crumbled goat cheese (~$.75)

Dressing of your choice (I often have it dry)

Directions:

Add everything in a bowl and toss to mix. Serve with your choice of dressing. You could also add in more goodies like mushrooms, olives, bacon bits, etc.

Here are a few dressing ideas, should you want to try making your own!

**Raw Apple Cider Vinegar Dressing**

Ingredients

1 cup Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (you can substitute Balsamic Vinegar as well)

2 cups olive oil

salt and pepper

minced garlic (1-3 cloves)

1 t thyme

1 t basil

1/2 t onion powder

 t dry mustard (optional)

Directions:

Put the lid on the jar and give it a good shake. Store in refrigerator.

**Italian Dressing Mix**

1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1 Tablespoon onion powder

2 teaspoon oregano

1 Tablespoon dried parsley

2 teaspoons sea salt

1 teaspoon pepper

1/4 teaspoon thyme

1/2 teaspoon dried celery flakes

Directions:

Shake ingredients together and store in an airtight container.

To make Italian salad dressing: Mix 2 Tablespoons dry mix with 1/4 cup vinegar (I prefer red wine vinegar), 2 teaspoons water and 1/2 cup olive oil.

**Ranch Mix**

1/8c onion powder

1/4c parsley flakes

1/8c dill weed

1 tbsp garlic powder

1 tsp coarse ground black pepper

1 tsp sea salt (optional)

Directions: 

Mix together and store in an airtight container.  

To make Ranch dressing: Mix 2 tablespoons dry mix with 1 c buttermilk (or, 1 c milk with 1 tbsp vinegar/lemon juice) and 1 c [mayonnaise](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jvex/healthier_homemade_condiments/), sour cream, kefir, or yogurt. 

The second salad is a twist on a favorite when you're avoiding extra carbs. Simple, delicious, and nutritious! 

**BLT Salad**

Ingredients: 

A large bowl of organic spring salad mix (~$.50)

1/2lb bacon, cooked, drained, and cooled (~$.75)

Approx. 1 c cherry/grape/chopped tomatoes (~$1)

1/4c [mayonnaise](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jvex/healthier_homemade_condiments/)

First, I an not talking about the grocery chain of the same name. I am talking about natural foods that are not (or are only very minimally) processed. Deciding what a whole food is is sort of an arbitrary call, but the main thing to keep in mind is we are looking for foods that don't have additives and don't need much processing to be edible. If it grows in the ground, flies in the air, swims in the sea, or eats any of the above, it's probably a whole food. 

In this first installment, I would like to keep things easy and also introduce you all to an amazing vegetable that is an excellent addition to anyone's cheap and healthy diet. It's called an Okinawan sweet potato, a tuber indigenous to Japan that has a beautiful purple flesh.

One cup of Okinawan purple sweet potatoes has approximately 140 calories, 2 g protein, 32 g carbohydrates, 4 g fiber and less than one-half gram of fat. A serving also contains 30 g, or one-half your daily Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin C, 19 mcg folate and traces of other B vitamins. Minerals include 271 mg potassium, 29 mg calcium, 37 mg phosphorus, 17 mg sodium, 13 mg magnesium, and traces of iron, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium. The purple pigment contains high levels of anthocyanin, an antioxidant.

Now, for the recipe! 

Okinawan sweet potato and beef stew

Ingredients:

1lb Okinawan potatoes, cubed ($2)

1lb beef stew chunks ($2.50)

1 cup beef bone broth (free if you make it yourself!)

Directions:

Add all of your ingredients to your slowcooker on low for 4-6hrs. Enjoy! Serves 4

You could always add carrots, onions, celery, etc, but for an introduction you should try them as close to a main as possible.

Here's the projected nutritional content, but I think we made ours healthier than this: 

Cal 490, Fat 8g, Sat Fat 1.5g, Chol 110mg, Carb 62g, Protein 44g, Fiber 2g, Sodium 1410mg 

Here's the recipe via Yahoo: http://shine.yahoo.com/shine-food/general-tso-8217-chicken-tastier-more-healthy-takeout-214300486.html

I know looking at the ingredients list that this recipe couldn't possibly be cheap- for me it was, though, as I already have a great spice rack with all of the spices, and I keep soy sauce handy. All I really had to buy was the chicken and the hoisin sauce! 

Additionally, the recipe calls for corn flakes for the ""batter"" (YES, this really works! I had never thought to do this before!), but I didn't have those- I had some Special K honey corn flakes. This turned out to be a GREAT substitution, as it gave the chicken a crunchy, sweet taste. I think you could probably substitute any corn flake type cereal here, even fiber ones, or health-nut ones if you'd like.

Finally, I didn't have a rack to put the chicken on. Instead, I took a lipped pan, like [this one](http://iweb.cooking.com/images/products/enlarge/631878e.jpg), lined it with aluminum foil, and put the chicken right on the aluminum, no oil needed (so I cut out the veggie oil/canola spray oil in the process). That made cleanup a breeze, too.

I made this for two people, and we had a salad with this chicken. We had enough left over to eat dinner the next night (I made rice the next night).

Not having to make food when you wake up is a glorious thing.

Ingredients:

6 tbsp oats

1/4 c soy milk (or milk, rice milk, almond milk, etc)

1/8 c greek yogurt

1 tsp sweetener (sugar, Splenda, honey, syrup, jam, etc)

1/8 c fruit/goodies (1/2 banana, chocolate chips, blackberries, etc)

2tsp chia seeds (optional)

Directions:
Measure all ingredients into a container (I prefer using half pint mason jars, they're the perfect size) and shake to mix! Leave in fridge at least 4hrs, preferably overnight. They keep in the fridge for about 3 days, so try not to make more than you can finish in this time frame. 
The flavor combinations are only limited by your imagination and your tastes! Some of our favorite combos are 


* apple cinnamon (1/8c apples, 1tsp sugar, 1/4tsp cinnamon) 
* peanut butter banana (1/2 banana and 1tsp peanut butter)
* strawberry banana (1/2 banana and 1tsp strawberry jam)
* blackberry honey (1/8c blackberries and 1tsp blackberry honey)&lt;-- my favorite
* pineapple (1/8c pineapple chunks and 1tsp pineapple juice)
* Nutella (1/8c chocolate chips and 1tsp Nutella)
* PB&amp;J (1tsp jam, 1tbsp peanut butter)
* berries and cream (1/8c berries of choice, 1tsp honey, 1/4tsp vanilla extract)
* and the list can go on forever!

Also, a note about chia seeds: they are protein-packed little miracle seeds! They have virtually no taste, are packed with nutrients, and are very filling. I seriously cannot even tell they're there when I eat the oatmeals, and going into it I was afraid I'd not like them because of it.

I recently got married and moved to Manhattan with my husband. As expected, everything (including food) is a bit more costly here, and I am trying to find ways to optimize our grocery spending. While we have let ourselves be very lax over the summer due to weddings, moving, and extended bouts of travel, we want to return to our earlier healthy eating habits while keeping to our budget (all that summer fun wasn't cheap!). 

Complicating factors are our combined dietary restrictions: no shellfish, no meat (chicken and fish ok), no wheat, no non-fermented dairy, no quinoa, minimal eggs and minimal starch/sugar. We also have limited storage space, so I find myself grocery shopping 2-3 times/week. In the winter, I would be making stews and casseroles that meet our needs, but they seem out of place in the summer. We can't just eat grilled chicken salad every night! I'm aiming for a budget of $300/month for both of us.

I'm planning on making this on Sunday and taking it with me to eat throughout the week. I haven't priced it all out, but I know one batch will give me at least 5 servings so it'll be much cheaper than eating out while I'm there. Anyway, here's the recipe:


* 1 lb ground turkey
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 onion (I prefer yellow)
* 3-5 cloves garlic (chopped) 
* 1 green bell pepper (diced)
* 1 red bell pepper (diced)
* 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can crushed/diced tomatoes, with juice
* 1 chipotle chile en adobo, coarsely chopped, with 1 tablespoon sauce 
* 2 cans of kidney beans drained (chef's choice so I used dark red)
* 1 can of tomato paste (4 oz)
* 1 can (12 oz.) beer (any beer will do, I use Corona or Blue Moon, whatever I have on hand)
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika (optional)
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* salt &amp; pepper to taste


Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 

Add the onion, garlic, peppers, salt, and chili powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. 

Stir in the tomato paste and the chipotle chile and sauce; cook 1 minute more. 

Add the turkey, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and cook until the meat loses its raw color, about 5 minutes. 

Add the beer and simmer until reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. 

Add the tomatoes along with their juices and the beans; bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 10 minutes. I sometimes like to turn the heat down and simmer for up to 30 minutes. It just depends how much time you have. 



I usually don't garnish with anything, but I eat it with tortilla chips. Now all I need is to figure out how to transport it in a smaller container to the work site every day. I'm thinking maybe mason jars.

1 mushroom [optional]

1 or 2 cloves of garlic [to taste - 20 cents?]

1 small bunch basil [$2.50-ish]

1 teaspoon parsley

In a large bowl add diced basil red onion and tomatoes, then add finely diced garlic and mushroom. Add your salt, pepper, parsley, oil and balsamic vinegar to taste. Remember, don't be afraid of the vinegar, it's what really what pulls the whole thing together. 

**Onto the bread:**

Place the bread on a cookie sheet with the cheese on top and put it in the oven at 350 until the cheese turns gold on top.

Put your bread on a plate and simply spoon on as much bruschetta mix as you like. You can even add other things like scallions, shrimp and even chicken to this for something a little different too. (*It's REALLY good with shrimp.*) You should have some left over, so eat until you're stuffed!

Turn heat down to just above low and whisk often. After simmering and whisking for 15- to 20 minutes, your pasta should be done and you're ready to have some pasta with Alfredo sauce. It tastes way better than out of a can, there are no preservatives, it's very filling and you'll also likely have leftovers.

Basically, her parents moved away from their family home but need her to stay there at that address. They pay utilities/mortgage and send her $200/month for her expenses so she doesn't die (because we can't get jobs around here, and them forcing her to stay here is basically prolonging our suffering).

That $200 needs to cover gas (she has a huge 12 mpg truck and a rotting/broken-down car that requires premium gas), food, supplies/household goods, clothes, etc.

I don't have a job either. I've been having help from my parents to survive too (staying at home but spending prolonged visits to my girlfriend's house).

There are a ton of different ways to make primavera, basically you can use almost any vegetable you want and it will be good. So add or subtract as you like! Mine is pretty simple but my main point is to show others how easy it is to make.

What you'll need:

3 tomatoes ($1.50)

1 bell pepper ($1)

1/2 onion (20 cents)

2 cloves of garlic (?)

1 crown of brocolli (around 75 cents)

2 regular boxes of spaghetti ($2)

Basil, oregeno, parsley, salt and pepper.

1/2 cup each white wine and chicken stock (to taste)

How to make it:

Start your pasta so it will be done before you start the veggies.

Cut your tomatoes, onion and bell pepper in half and slice thinly, mince the garlic and chop your broccoli into small bite size pieces. On high, once your oil is hot (in a large pan) add the broccoli, onion, bell pepper, and garlic and after about 1 minute add the tomatoes. When the veggies start looking a little limp add the wine and cook off the alcohol.(When you can no longer smell the alcohol) Now add your chicken stock, toss the pasta into the veggies and you're ready to eat!

Chicken or shrimp are both very good in this too.

PS. I'm guessing on the amount of noodles, I always make way too much and end up taking pasta in butter to work.

Note: I don't measure things, as I tend to work with what I have laying around. To stretch this dish out, and if you don't mind carbs, you can always steam up some rice. Requires two cooking vessels - a pot for the lentils and a pan for the other bits. This is a good winter recipe, as the greens are cheap and fresh. It is very flexible, it can be more of a stewed dish or a soup. Whatever you're in the mood for.

Directions: 
Lentils+bay leaf in a pot + water. Bring to boil

While lentils cook, cut up garlic and onion and place in pan + oil. Apply light heat. Cut up kale, and then add it to the pan. Let the kale cook down a bit. When the kale looks like it is almost cooked to the point that you are interested in eating it (if you aren't familiar with kale, just test until it gets to an edible and pleasing consistency), add the optional tomatoes - personally I don't add much, just enough to give a bright flavor. 

Lentils should be about done by this point. You can either drain the water and add them to the pan, or you can leave the water and add the pan contents to the lentil pot. Place it in a bowl. Salt and pepper to taste. When you are just about to eat, juice the fresh lemon and drip it all over the top, or just cut up and squeeze the lemon over the top. I usually use half the lemon on the food, and add the other half of the lemon on my water.

BTW Fresh greens are super easy to grow, and you can grow meyer lemon trees in containers. I have a very sensitive vegetable-based palate and find it delicious, nutritious, and cheap - it got me through college. Alter as you like!

It's not hard, per se, but tedious. It's pretty cheap if you're willing to do the labor though!

**Sushi rice**

1 cup rice, short grain is best, but I've always used long grain with no issue

2 cups water

3 tbsp sushi rice vinegar [(I always use this brand)](http://www.giantunion.com/image/product/1500659_Vinegar_Mizkan_Sushi%20Vinegar_12x24oz.jpg)

If you are blessed with a rice cooker, add your water and rice and let it do its magic. If not, I will tell you an idiot proof method. Add your rice and water in a pot (have a lid handy). Once it reaches a boil, turn it down to low and cover it. DO NOT REMOVE THE COVER UNTIL IT IS FINISHED. Let it boil on low for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat with the cover **ON** and let it set another 10 minutes. 

With either of these methods, when the cook time is up, add 3 tablespoons of sushi vinegar to your rice and gently fold it with a flat (preferably bamboo) spatula. The key is not to 'mix', but to fold, so you don't crush your grains. Once well combined, you are ready to make your sushi.

**Sushi assembly**

Lay out a sheet of nori (very cheap if you can hit an Asian market, about $.10 per sheet) and take a small container of sushi vinegar for your fingers, and get comfortable at a table. Place some rice into the middle of your sheet of nori, then wet your fingers with the vinegar. Carefully pat your rice down onto your sheet, aiming for a thickness of 1/4"", and be sure to leave 1/2-3/4"" of plain nori at one end to seal. The rice will begin to stick to your fingers throughout this process, rewet your fingers with the vinegar whenever necessary. The rice needs to be hot, so this will suck if you have low heat tolerance like me. Once you have your sheet prepared, lay down a line of filling about 1"" from the edge opposite of your sealing edge (the uncovered nori needs to be the outer edge!). Clean off your fingers on a wet paper towel, and very carefully roll up your sushi, trying to keep it as tight as possible. When you hit your plain nori edge, set the roll down with this as the bottom and allow it to seal by absorbing moisture. Leave this sit for at least 10min, then cut with the sharpest knife you have. Clean the knife between cuts to keep it from sticking or uglying up your handiwork.

**Filling suggestions**

* Salmon and cream/goat cheese: Philly roll

* Crab meat and cream cheese: I don't know if this is a real roll, it's just delicious

* Crab/salmon/tuna with avocado and cucumber: California roll

* Teriyaki salmon or chicken slices and cream/goat cheese: also a creation of mine, freaking delicious

* Anything else you think would be good! Savory is better than sweet, but the sky's the limit! I don't know that many traditional rolls, but Google is your friend :3 

* Edit: [Here is a fantastic source for more variations and fillings to build off of this base recipe with!](http://www.sushimonsters.com/tutorials-start-types-maki.php) Thanks to /u/Geekette_Minx

I personally have never made sushi with raw fish because I wasn't comfortable with my sources, but you can get sushi-grade fish at Asian markets, along with roe if you like to add that to the mix. Inside out rolls are a pain in the ass though, and weren't worth the trouble in my opinion.

The ingredients are shared over the whole week so hopefully you have very little waste at the end of the week. And most of the ingredients are fresh, seasonal veggies.

Last week, for instance, the entire week's worth of fresh 20 meal components (plus eggs for breakfast &amp; extra fruit) cost me less than $50. And there were tons of leftovers for lunches for myself and my husband. I just happened across a groupon for a year's subscription, so I snagged for about $30 for the whole year.

It's very easy to make in bulk and store up to eat throughout the week.  It's not *super-*healthy, but it is a cheap and low-calorie way to satisfy those meat-and-carb cravings.


Ingredients:

*  3/4 cup white rice
*  1 can turkey SPAM
*  Teriyaki sauce
*  4 sheets Nori Seaweed (the kind in larger, 5""x6"" sheets; available at pretty much any Asian grocery store)

Directions:

Start cooking the rice in your rice cooker.  Uncan the Spam and cut it into 8^ths (cut horizontally, so that the slices end up longer than they are wide).  Put the Spam slices into a frying pan to brown them on both sides; it's pre-cooked so you don't need to cook it all the way through.

Once everything's done cooking, it's time to assemble the Musubi.  On a flat plate, place a sheet of plastic wrap.  Cut a sheet of Nori in half (you can just crease it and tear) and place it on the plastic wrap so it's wider than it is tall.  Then, place a slice of Spam on the nori so that it's taller than it is wide (so together, they kind of make a + ).  Drip about 1 tbsp teriyaki sauce on the spam, then scoop 1/8^th of the rice on top of that.  Lastly, wrap the nori around so it ""hugs"" all the other ingredients, then wrap the whole deal up with plastic wrap.  [Here's an idea of what the finished product should look like](http://i.imgur.com/mXTF8tI.jpg) for reference.

If you happen to have a mould, you can make them look nice and perfect-shaped like the ones in the picture.  If not, you can still make them; they will taste just as good, but not look quite as nice.

You can eat them right away or put them in the refrigerator for a couple days and just heat them up in the microwave when you want one.

Ingredient  |  Calories   |  Price
:--:|:--:|:--:
SPAM|  480| $2
Rice|  507 | $0.30
Nori | 40 | $0.40
Teriyaki sauce| 120 | $0.50
Total |1147 | $3.20
Per serving | 144 | $0.40

Variations:  You can use whatever variety of Spam you want, but Turkey is healthier than the other kinds (even the ""Lite"" Spam).  You could even put some other meat on there like some boneless chicken.  I've tried making this with white rice, brown rice, and sticky rice.  I really recommend that you don't use brown rice; it tastes pretty wrong.

Legend vs. Fact



One of Americaâs fondest legends is that of Johnny Appleseed, a folk hero and pioneer apple farmer in the 1800âs. There really was a Johnny Appleseed and his real name was John Chapman. He was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1774. His dream was to produce so many apples that no one would ever go hungry. Although legend paints a picture of Johnny as a dreamy wanderer, planting apple seeds throughout the countryside, research reveal him to be a careful, organized businessman, who over a period of nearly fifty years, bought and sold tracts of land and developed thousands of productive apple trees.


His adventures began in 1792, when John was eighteen years old. He and his eleven-year-old half brother, Nathaniel, headed west, following the steady stream of immigrants. In his early twenties, John began traveling alone, which is how he spent the rest of his life. Nathaniel stayed behind to farm with their father, who had also immigrated west. John continued moving west to Pennsylvania. From there he traveled into the Ohio Valley country and later, Indiana. He kept ahead of the settlements and each year planted apple seeds farther west.

He always carried a leather bag filled with apple seeds he collected for free from cider mills. Legend says he was constantly planting them in open places in the forests, along the roadways and by the streams. However, research suggests he created numerous nurseries by carefully selecting the perfect planting spot, fencing it in with fallen trees and logs, bushes and vines, sowing the seeds and returning at regular intervals to repair the fence, tend the ground and sell the trees. He soon was known as the âapple seed manâ and later he became known only as âJohnny Appleseedâ.

Over the years, his frequent visits to the settlements were looked forward to and no cabin door was ever closed to him. To the men and women he was a news carrier; to the children he was a friend. He was also very religious and preached to people along the way. His favorite book was his Bible.

He made friends with many Indian tribes and was known to have learned many Indian languages well enough to converse. He lived on food provided by nature and he never killed animals. Though appearing poor, he was not a poor man. He accumulated more cash than he needed by selling his apple trees and tracts of land. He never used banks and relied instead on an elaborate system of burying his money. He preferred to barter and trade food or clothing rather than collect money for his trees. It was more important a settler plant a tree than pay him for it.

Johnny Appleseed is described as a man of medium height, blue eyes, light-brown hair, slender, wiry and alert. Folklore has also described him as âfunny lookingâ because of the way he dressed. It is said he traded apple trees for settlerâs cast-off clothing. He was known to give the better clothing to people he felt needed it more than he. This could be why legend says he wore only coffee sacks with holes cut out for his arms as clothing. He rarely wore shoes, even during the cold of winter. It is said he could walk over the ice and snow barefooted and that the skin was so thick on his feet that even a rattlesnake couldnât bite through it. Another legend says he wore a mush pot on his head as a hat. This is unlikely since pots of the time were made of heavy copper or iron, but it is more likely he wore someone elseâs castoff hat or made his own out of cardboard. He rarely sought shelter in a house, since he preferred to sleep on bare ground in the open forest with his feet to a small fire.

In 1842, Johnny made his last trip back to Ohio after spending 50 years walking throughout the countryside. While there, he moved into the home of Nathaniel, the half brother with whom he began his remarkable journey. On March 18, 1845, he died of pneumonia at the age of seventy-one. He was visiting his friend, William Worth, in Indiana. Legend says it was the only time he was sick in his whole life.

1361117257.0,24,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,18p1ap,[SUNDAY MORNING BREAKFAST] Make your own HONEY WHEAT BAGELS,loveshercoffee,27,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/18p1ap/sunday_morning_breakfast_make_your_own_honey/,"I failed at homemade bagels about a half-dozen times, fooling around with different recipes and techniques until I found a way to do it that came out the way I like them. These are dense and chewy inside, soft on the outside and have just a little sweet-nutty flavor.  

**Honey Wheat Bagels**

* 2 cups white flour
* 2 cups wheat flour 
* 1 pkg yeast 
* 1 1/2 cups warm water 
* 3 Tablespoons honey 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

In a mixing bowl, soak the whole wheat flour in 3/4 cup of water and cover with plastic wrap. Let it set at room temperature for 4+ hours or overnight. This is actually an optional step but I've found it helps prevent some of the grittiness you sometimes get with whole wheat flour. 

The next morning, add the remaining 3/4 cup water, yeast, honey and salt. Mix in the white flour about 1/2 cup at a time and knead it until you've got a smooth, elastic dough. Cover it again and let it rest for 10 minutes.  

Divide the dough into twelve equal parts and shape into fat disks with about a 2 inch hole in the center. Lay each bagel on a lightly oiled baking sheet and let them rise for 20-30 minutes. 

Bring a pot of water to boil. Slide a few of the bagels into the boiling water; they should float within about 30 seconds. How many you boil at a time depends on the size of your pot. You don't want it overcrowded. Allow them to boil about 2 minutes, then flip them over and let them boil another minute or two. Remove the bagels and let them drain without touching each other. 
 
Once all of the bagels are boiled and drained, put them back on the baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes at 375 F. until the tops are golden brown.

I'm a sucker for cream cheese on a bagel but when I quit smoking 5 years ago I started substituting greek yogurt because I needed to drop some weight from my fat ass and no matter what, I'm not giving up breads! Now that we're getting into spring, I'm getting excited to slice a couple of strawberries on them as well.

Does anyone else around here love a good bagel? Even if you don't make them yourself, what do you like to put on them?",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_18p1ap,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/18p1ap/sunday_morning_breakfast_make_your_own_honey/,moderator

He makes it, then sticks it in the fridge and we eat it cold for several days. It definitely could be cheaper by 1) buying dried beans instead of canned, 2) excluding chicken or avocados since they can be expensive. Anyway, we love it for lunch!


* 1 1/2 cup dry quinoa
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes (each cut in half)
* 1 can black beans
* 1 small can corn
* 1 avocado
* 1 green or red pepper diced
* 1 boneless skinless chicken breast (cut in cubes)

""Dressing"":
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar

Seasonings to taste:
* cumin
* cayenne pepper
* Tabasco Sauce
* salt &amp; pepper


He makes the quinoa on the stovetop. He seasons the chicken (salt, pepper, any spices you like) and cooks it on the stove. While that's cooling, he dices the pepper, tomatoes, and avocado, then rinses off the corn and beans, and puts them in a big bowl. He dices the chicken, adds it to the big bowl, and then mixes in the oil and vinegar. He spends a minute adding seasonings and tasting it. And no, I don't usually help.

SO GOOD. I made up the recipe after having them at a friends. It's super cheap too. And, though it uses some oil, pretty healthy. I ate two and feel a bit too full, but they were all I had for dinner. So that's about 4.50 or 5$ for 4 servings, or 1.25/serving. 

1 sweet potato, cut into small cubes. (about 75 cents)
2-3 cups black beans, cooked (about 50-75 cents if dry, 2$ canned)
about 4 oz cheese, grated. I used habenero. (1$)
1 jalepeno, cut up (negligible.)
about 1 or 1.5 cups corn, maybe a little more. (50 cents, frozen)
8 tortillas (1.50, store brand wheat tortillas).
oil (.50? negligible?)
a teaspoon or so cumin
salt


put a little oil in a pan and sautee the sweet potato until it browns and softens. Can cover pan to hasten, could steam to avoid using oil. Add cooked beans, corn, jalepeno, cumin. Let everything get hot. 

Meanwhile, grate the cheese. Microwave or otherwise heat the tortillas a tiny bit so that they get soft and fold easy. Get a baking sheet ready with a couple of paper towels on it to hold the burritos when they get done. 

After the bean mixture is hot, turn it off and make the burritos. I put just a bit of cheese (remember, you have 4 oz for 8 burritos) in the middle of the tortilla, then two or three wooden spoonfuls of bean stuff. Fold them nicely, folding the ends in before you are done folding it around, so that it is all tucked in. I used a couple of tooth picks to make sure they stayed rolled up. 

Put a centimeter or two of whatever oil (canola here) you are using in the bottom of a heavy pan, I like cast iron. You don't need a ton of oil here. Heat it over med, if it's smoking like crazy it's too hot. Put the burritos in as many as will fit at a time. The sides will brown quickly, so watch them, and be ready to roll them to let the exposed sides brown. When they are done, put them on the paper towels. 

I strain and save the oil for next fry use. Don't use a ton of oil in this, there's no need, it's not deep frying, it's more like barely more oil than sauteeing.

Tips: Don't use frozen hash browns, double the recipe and use a whole potato and a whole onion. Onions are so delicious when they've been browned.

Do this three times more, then strain through a cheesecloth to remove all of your trimmings, which can now be discarded (or added to a compost heap). You can now freeze or use your stock!

Yes, I'm an adult, why do you ask? 

Anyway, I loved them. I was so excited to incorporate them into my tacos at home because they were always on sale and I figured I could make them a little bit healthier. I went out and bought a couple cans, cracked one open to cook and was immediately assaulted by an ungodly stench. It was a mix of old produce and cat food, and tasted worse than it smelled. (Yes I know what cat food tastes like, I have three older brothers.)

But I wasn't deterred. I tried again, hearing that restaurants typically use lard or shortening to flavor the beans. I tried both. The results varied between pork flavored cat food and greasy, ugly cat food. To top it off, I found out Taco Bell doesn't even use lard. I found this problematic as I am a pescatarian and was willing to let up in exchange for the at-home taste of such godly deliciousness. 

Why do these things smell and taste so god awful? You go to Taco Bell and you can get an endless shower of savory, creamy, not too strongly flavored and hearty smelling bean deliciousness.

Some of my variations, what are some ways you could customize this?",spyyked,25,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1h45ap/baked_chicken_with_rice_and_veggies_cheap/,"posted this on another thread and I thought it would go over well here too.   I love this ""recipe"" because I don't have to make up new grocery lists every few days or argue with the missus about what we should be having for dinner.  

I loathe looking up healthy recipes.  It seems like each recipe I find has anywhere from 10-20 ingredients.  These ingredients usually are at least $1.50+ and I might only get 3 or 4 servings out of the whole recipe.  It's too complicated, very specific, too many dishes, too much prep/time, and way too expensive.  This is my go-to recipe for probably 80% of my meals.

you'll need:

walmart brand rice cooker: $20
baking sheet: $10

Food part:

bulk boneless skinless chicken breast at sams club: $1.88/lb. 6lbs/$12

white long grain rice: 5lb/$5 (i need to find it cheaper)

bag of frozen veggies in steamer bag: ~$1.50/bag

premixed seasonings from the grocery store: just got on sale for $1/bottle

cooking process:

preheat oven to 350. put chicken on baking sheet (use foil for easy cleanup). hit that chicken with the seasoning. put in oven for like 40 minutes. plug in rice cooker. put 2 cups dry rice in one bowl and 3.75 cups water in the rice cooker. fill the rice bowl with water just to cover the rice and give it a quick spin with your finger to get the excess starch/dirt off. I usually do that twice. dump into rice cooker and set to cook. rinse the bowl to be a container for when the rice is done cooking. go watch an episode of scrubs on netflix. take chicken out of oven when it's done. toss bag of veggies in the microwave, set for 5 minutes. get the rice out of the rice cooker. put the rice in the big bowl, put the rice cooking pot in the sink to dry (for easy cleanup tomorrow), and put the rice cooker away. start cutting up your chicken until the veggies are done. make a plate of chicken, rice, and veggies.

here's how many servings i usually get out of each cooked part:

rice: 6 servings. I havent calculated the cost of this but it's pretty low.

veggie bag: 3 or 4 servings. $.50 per serving at most.

chicken: 7 or 8 servings. ~$1.50 per serving.

total cost is probably somewhere around $2.25/serving and you're eating a good quantity of very tasty highly nutritious food. The only dishes you need to clean are the rice pot (super easy) and the baking sheet (super easy if you use alum foil).

also this is a very good starting point recipe. I've turned it into soup by adding a box of chicken broth or some ramen. Add bbq sauce to the chicken and shred it for tasty sammiches. Curry if you want. stir fry the precooked meat with the veggies instead of microwaving them.  I've got a gas grill for cooking the chicken sometimes.  

What are some of the ways you can think to edit this recipe to make it more versatile while keeping the cost down and keeping it simple? ",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_1h45ap,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1h45ap/baked_chicken_with_rice_and_veggies_cheap/,

* 1/3 cup fresh lime juice
* 1/4 cup olive oil

* pinch of salt
* 1/8 teaspoon ground red Cayenne pepper (or more to taste)
* 6 green onions

* 1 red bell pepper, chopped
* 2 tomatoes, chopped
* 1 bag tortilla chips
* Some shredded cheddar or mexican cheese

**Directions**

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
* Put the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, Cayenne pepper, green onions, cilantro, and chilies into a small food processor for about 15-30 seconds. Let it sit.
* Spread chips on a baking sheet and put cheese over then, covering evenly to taste. Put these into the oven while to do the next step.
* Chop up and mix the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Pour the sauce mixture over the top and gently fold the bean salad together (you don't want to hurt the avocado!).

I've always got some leftovers of one or the other. At least the sauce can be frozen but the pasta either has to get used in a few days or it's done for. 

I usually improvise a salad as a side to a meal later in the week. What works great about that is that everything goes into it in little dabs, so you never really have to plan ahead and can toss in whatever you've got!

For a macaroni kind of salad, I use mayonaise jazzed up with a little garlic powder, sugar, vingear and salt and pepper. (Miracle Whip is easier, though!) Chopped onions, pickle relish, celery, diced egg, peas, red or green peppers - even tuna goes in this.

If I've got a larger shell pasta or rotini I make a deli-style salad with a 50/50 mix of ranch dressing and mayonaise then add things like thinly sliced carrots, bits of broccoli, sliced black olives, celery and onions.

For the truly simple, Italian-sytle pasta salad I like to take a plain Italian salad dressing or vinegarette and whisk it with some basil, a pinch of sugar and parmesan cheese. This is great tossed with leftover spaghetti and if you originally had salad on you pasta night, throw in the last bits of cucumbers, tomatoes, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, olives, onions and other toppings you had leftover!

Is it even possible?,TheYogi,37,16,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15mjuz/eat_cheap_and_healthy_is_it_even_possible/,"I love this Reddit and appreciate it being created.  Thank you to the creators and moderators.  My question here is sincere.  It is possible to eat cheap AND healthy?  I personally don't feel it is.  I say this because I am a, ""Better than organic"" small scale farmer.  I do not use any pesticides or herbicides on my plants (even organically approved ones), I am militant about adding the necessary macro and trace elements to the soil to ensure that the plants are healthy, taste good, AND pass on their nutrients to you.  My chickens are allowed to truly free range and forage but I only have four because chickens are heavy foragers and my, ""Food forest"" is not yet mature enough to handle greater foraging than that.  I do not feed my chickens corn so as to limit the amount of arachidonic acid passed on to you and to improve the n3-n6 fatty acid ratio.

All of our food is picked at maximum ripeness (for fruit) and the veggies are picked that day, or even better, you pick it yourself.

NONE of this results in, ""cheap"" food.  But the food my farm produces is nutrient dense and very healthy.

I could utilize synthetic fertilizers, I could utilize herbicides, and I could utilize the bare minimum of trace elements and greatly improve my margins.  I could even utilize organic standards and the food I produce would be nowhere as healthy.

Let's look at just one of the many essential nutrients we need.  [This page showcases foods that are high in magnesium](http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) and the RDA for your sex and age.  Add up the foods you eat that are high in magnesium and get your daily total.  Then look at the RDA for magnesium.  The vast majority of you are likely getting nowhere near enough magnesium in your diet.  Considering magnesium is known to take part in at least 300 metabolic reactions in the body, this isn't good.  And when I visit farms and small private gardens around where I live, I can assure you many soils are deficient in magnesium so those numbers for those foods are often lower.  And magnesium is one of the EASY elements to get into your soil in sufficient quantity.  What about the calcium (ca), boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc?  If the plants aren't getting all the minerals they need, I assure you that you aren't getting all the nutrients you need either.  And as such, you are not eating healthy.

I would like to help redefine what is healthy food and healthy eating.  Unfortunately, until many more farmers and gardeners start to learn how to produce truly healthy food and we move away from our usual diet of annuals, really healthy eating isn't going to be cheap.  In fact, I would argue that the diets of most of you are in fact expensive when you add in the health care related costs and time off of work due to disease.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,1356794731.0,,,True,t3_15mjuz,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15mjuz/eat_cheap_and_healthy_is_it_even_possible/,

1366963933.0,19,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,1d55jx,Basic Green Curry Recipe,kabukistar,20,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1d55jx/basic_green_curry_recipe/,"Here's a basic green curry recipe I like to use.  You can mix and cook everything in one frying pan, and a single batch will last for many, many servings.

Ingredients:

*  About 1 pound ground meat (I prefer turkey, but you can also use beef)   

*  1 medium onion   

*  1 can water chestnuts, sliced    

*  4 Tbsp green curry paste (I use this ""Chef's Kitchen"" stuff because it's cheap, but you can use whatever.)   
*  1 can coconut milk   
*  Optional: 1 green or red pepper 
*  1 cup uncooked brown rice 

Directions:

Start cooking the rice first, then put the meat along with the curry paste into a frying pan on medium heat.  While it's cooking, dice the onion and pepper.  Stir the meat around as it cooks so it doesn't form large clumps and cooks evenly.  Once it looks mostly browned, add the pepper and water chestnuts.   Stir them around a cook for another 10 minutes or so and then add the onions (adding them sooner will cause them to be mushier once its done).  About 5 minutes before the rice is finished cooking, add the coconut milk and turn the frying pan down to low.

When the rice is finished, scoop some into a bowl and then use a spoon to scoop some curry paste on top of it.  Voila.  

This is a fairly mild (but still flavourable) mix.  If you think it needs more kick, you can add more curry paste, or  top it off with some sriracha, or chop up a bouillon-cube sized chunk of ginger to mix in at the same time as the peppers.

You can just keep it in the fridge (it keeps better if you keep the rice and curry separate).  I've kept it for about a week without going bad.  It provides about 6 large bowls of curry.

*5 Table Spoons pesto sauce
*1/2 can diced tomatoes
*1 box whole grain pasta
*1 breast from the roast chicken (cut down into smaller pieces)

This is an amazing dip for strawberries or other fruit.  I've successfully made it with sugar substitute, if you're into that kinda thing.  Never tried it with dairy substitute.

Chocolate pudding

1/4 - 1/2c sugar (to taste)
4-5 tbsp cocoa powder

3 tbsp cornstarch

2 pinches salt

2 1/4c milk

1-2tbsp rum
OR
1/2 tsp vanilla
OR
1/8 tsp peppermint extract

Combine the cocoa, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a big, microwave safe bowl. 
Gradually stir in the milk until smooth.  (PROTIP: this is easiest if you add about 1/2c milk all at once and stir until it's a thick paste, then add about another 1/3c milk and stir until smooth, then add another 1/3c milk and stir until smooth... once you have a fairly thin mixture, you can add all the rest of the milk and stir it in easily - no lumps.)
Microwave on high for 2min.  Stir.  
Microwave for another 2min.  Stir.  
Microwave for another 2min.  Stir.  
By this point if should be thickening.  Now microwave in 1min increments, stirring after each minute and watching carefully to make sure it doesn't boil over.  It's ready when the texture is slightly thinner than pancake batter.  
Remove from microwave and stir in rum or vanilla or peppermint extract.  Rum is best IMHO.  A lot of the alcohol evaporates when it hits the hot pudding, so even 2tbsp doesn't make it too alcoholic.

Pour into one big dish or 4 smaller dishes and refrigerate.  If you don't like pudding skin, press plastic wrap or parchment paper directly onto the surface of the hot pudding right after pouring.  

If you don't like microwaves you can make it on the stovetop.  Cook over medium heat and stir constantly.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_16wv65,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16wv65/10minute_chocolate_pudding/,

On Sunday I made brown rice and beans. Tomorrow I'm going shopping for frozen veggies. My work lunch for the rest of this week will consist of those three ingredients, plus seasoning. Total cost of ~1.50 per meal.

Tomorrow I am also purchasing chicken that I will cook. So my dinners will be (frozen) veggies, chicken and rice with seasoning. Will probably end up substituting the chicken and rice with 2 eggs for one meal. Cost range of 1.50 - 2.50 per meal.

I was thinking of changing things around a bit, I can cook pasta and have that with veggies. But I'm only cooking for myself, I don't want my food to spoil before I have a chance to eat it.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_1byu2s,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1byu2s/what_meals_have_you_planned_for_this_week/,

I've recently stumbled upon these awesome flatbreads which have awesome nutrition and are a decent size! 150 calories for the ENTIRE flatbread, 27g of carbs (which is pretty low given the size), and 7g protein! I would say each flatbread is around 13-14 inches in length and 4.5 inches wide (saying this off the top of my head based on my memory. No I was not measuring bread in my kitchen hahaha). They work amazingly well to make nutritious personal pizzas or just as flatbread sandwiches if I cut them in half. Love love these things!



The only not awesome thing about these flatbreads is the cost. On Amazon the price for four packs of six is $26.49. Tack on the $8.45 shipping costs and the total cost comes to $34.94 which becomes $8.74 per pack of six, around $1.45 per single flatbread which to me is a tad pricey :\



Do you guys know of any similar type of products or recipes for similar products for a more reasonable price? While I may love these things my starving college drained wallet doesn't womp :[ Any help would be very much appreciated!

Edit2: Found an even better option!! I found these Whole Wheat Roll Ups by Damascus Bakeries! They're bigger than the Flatout Flatbreads, 110 calories for the entire roll up, 10g of protein and only 17g carbs with 7g of fiber! That means 10 net carbs :D And the best part?

I am getting in the habit of eating food that is much healthier for me, but it's difficult for me to change my habits. 

I'm a decent cook and I am confident with asparagus. I steam it, saute it, bake it, pop it in hashes, season it various ways, eat it plain and raw... I love asparagus. Even when it is expensive and out of season I buy it several times a month. If every green vegetable was as delicious, I would struggle a lot less with my eating habits.

However... every green vegetable is not that delicious. There are others that I tolerate just fine (broccoli, peas, green beans), but I don't relish or crave them the way I do asparagus.

Are there any vegetables with a flavor or texture similar to asparagus that I could use as a jumping-off point? Are there any recipes or cooking styles with broccoli, peas, or green beans that you recommend? I am a bit at a loss with how to cook those, even though I logically know that I should just try doing the same things with them that I do with asparagus.

Most of the time it's stripping the remaining meat from a whole roasted chicken, but really, I do it with pieces of fried chicken and it works just as well.

One easy dish to make is chicken pot pie. And really, the more leftover veggies and things you already have from the previous couple of days, the easier it is!

Veggies need to be cooked before they go in the pie, so truly, stuff from the fridge is great. Proportions don't really matter, either. If you've got a whole cup of peas and only a quarter of a cup of corn, that's fine! Use what you have. I like onions, so I dice and sautee some, and since I've got the frying pan out, I dice up a carrot or two, a stalk of celery and maybe a potato. This is excellent to make at the end of the month when the pantry only has one or two of each thing left.

If you've had a nice, glossy gravy with your chicken, just thin it down with a bit of milk, broth or water, throw your softened vegetables and chicken in and pour it in a casserole. If you've not got gravy, make one in the pan where you sauteed your vegetables and you'll get tons of flavor. 

As for the ""pie"" part, I make a pie crust and lay it over the top. Biscuit dough works just as well, as do leftover mashed potatoes spread over the whole thing. Since everything inside is already cooked, this only has to bake long enough to get hot all the way through and finish off your topping. 

In somewhat of a twist on this, if you prefer the taste of chicken a'la king, add a few sliced mushrooms and chopped red or green bell pepper. Make a white cream sauce instead of gravy and get it all hot right on the stovetop. Serve it over rice, biscuits or toast!

Pop your carcass in a 400F oven for 15-30min, keeping an eye on it and pulling it out when the bones start getting browned. 

At this point, you can either do a reduction stock in a stock pot on the stove, or proceed with a slowcooker. I've done both, and was happy with the outcome of each of them. Put your bones into your chosen cooking device and add 8c of water. If slowcooking, put it on low for 8hrs or overnight, if reducing on the stove, simmer on low, reduce to 6c, refill to 8c or your original start level, then repeat this process three more times.

1356649062.0,16,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,15jitv,Growing your own Russet potatoes,PabstyLoudmouth,16,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jitv/growing_your_own_russet_potatoes/,"First a bit of background- Russet potatoes are the most widely cultivated potato variety in the United States. Also known as Idaho potatoes and Burbank potatoes, homegrown russet potatoes make delicious homemade French fries and mashed potatoes. This cool-season crop is well-suited for the growing conditions and cooler weather found in the western United States. Growing russet potatoes in your home garden is satisfying and easy to do since this vegetable crop requires little maintenance.


1

Determine the last expected spring frost date for your area. Plan to plant your russet potatoes about 21 days before that date.

2

Cultivate your planting area to break up any hard soil, keeping your rows about 3 feet apart. This potato variety prefers well-draining, loose soils with plenty of organic matter.


3

Mix nitrogen-rich fertilizer into the soil. Apply approximately 3 pounds for every 100 square feet. Water the treated soil and apply organic mulch.


4

Purchase certified russet seed potatoes from your local garden center or nursery. Cut the potatoes into 2- to 4-ounce pieces, making sure that each piece has at least one eye. Store the freshly cut pieces at room temperature in a dark, humid place for one to three days to give the cuts time to dry before planting.


5

Plant each potato piece about 3 inches deep with the sprouts pointing up. Space your potato pieces about 12 inches apart, covering each piece with soil.


6

Add about 3 more inches of soil once the potato plants start emerging. Apply a layer of organic mulch to help maintain soil temperatures and to prevent weeds from growing.


7

Water your potatoes once or twice a week when the soil feels dry to the touch. Russet potatoes have shallow root systems so they only need a light watering to maintain constant soil moisture.


8

Monitor your russet potato plants for disease and pest problems. Potatoes grown in foggy or moist coastal climates often suffer from late blight, which can be treated with a fungicide. Control common pests such as snails, potato tubermoth and aphids by sprinkling nontoxic diatomaceous earth around the affected potato plants.


9

Harvest your russet potatoes after the plants have died back. Wet down the soil first to make removing the potatoes easier. Pull out the potatoes by hand for the best results. Store your potatoes in a dark, cool place.

This recipe is fantastic for this purpose! A little carb heavy so not very keto-friendly, but it's an extremely hearty soup and a freaking edible bowl! How cool is that?



**Beet Soup in Roasted Acorn Squash**

Ingredients:

For roasted squash

* 8 (1- to 1 1/4-pound) acorn squash

* olive oil

* salt (optional)

For soup

* 1 large red onion, chopped

* 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil

* 5 medium beets (2 pounds without greens), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

* 1 red apple such as Gala or Braeburn, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

* 2 garlic cloves, minced

* 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth

* 4 to 5 cups water


Instructions:

Roast squash

* Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

* Cut off ""tops"" of squash (about 1 inch from stem end) and reserve. Scoop out seeds and discard. Cut a very thin slice off bottoms of squash to create a stable base. Brush ""bowls"" and tops all over with oil and sprinkle salt inside. Arrange squash bowls, with tops alongside, stem ends up, in 2 large shallow baking pans.

* Roast squash in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until flesh of squash is just tender, about 1 1/4hours total.

Make soup while squash roast

* Cook onion in oil in a 5-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add beets and apple and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.

* Add broth and 4 cups water, then simmer, uncovered, until beets are tender, about 40 minutes. 

* PurÃ©e soup in 3 batches in a blender until very smooth, at least 1 minute per batch (use caution when blending hot liquids), transferring to a large bowl. Return soup to pan, then season with salt and pepper and reheat. If soup is too thick, add enough water to thin to desired consistency.

* Serve soup in squash bowls.

*Yes, I know the oil isn't really a whole food, you can use butter/ghee to get closer to whole than oil but I have an allergy so I cannot.*",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_16ocl5,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16ocl5/whole_foods_wednesday_beet_soup_in_roasted_acorn/,moderator

Does that mean a cooked meal instead of a sandwich?

Here is my diet:

- I can't eat out (obviously)
- I eat lots of fruits
- I drink only water (and milk of course)
- I eat whole grain bread
- I cook macaroni &amp; spaghetti sometimes (with basic sauce)

... what else should/could I do?

On weekends, I grab myself a cooked meal at Whole Foods, but what should I do during the week? I can't live off sandwiches and Nutella. My health is not good at all (those positive stuff (fruits, whole grains), I only started doing recently) and I need to change my eating habits but in a way that does not involve eating out and does not need a housewife and everyday cooking - cuz I have classes everyday :) 

Any help will help, because basically, now that I'm trying to live healthy, it's exhausting to try and think what the hell am I gonna eat tomorrow and day after that, and after that...

Until recently, I basically only ate bread with Nutella and milk for almost a year with occasional pasta and pizza. The only positive thing I can remember doing, was running almost everyday - I tried to not let my diet kill me :)

1363836331.0,12,self.EatCheapAndHealthy,1aplyo,I've been doing keto intermittent fasting for maybe $70/month and lose ~1lb per day. Thought I'd share.,EpicSchwinn,22,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1aplyo/ive_been_doing_keto_intermittent_fasting_for/,"Granted, this is only my method. I'll be honest, there are probably healthier and easier ways. It's worked for me, however. I had a 1 day keto flu and I'm a month in with very positive results. I feel great, my clothes are falling off of me, my skin is clearing up, all around I'm experiencing positive results.

* Intermittent fasting. Condition yourself to only need dinner. I only eat meals after workouts in the evening. Sometimes I'll eat breakfast, but that's when I'm feeling frisky or know I've gotta lot of stuff to do today. If I eat lunch, I make sure it's a late one so I don't have to eat dinner or maybe snack a tiny bit that evening if anything.

* Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast (BSCB). 3lb bags are like 7 bucks at Wal-Mart. BOOM. Marinate and tenderize them in Siracha, Frank's and chili powder. SPLOOSH. Tired of Siracha? Try them with Sweet Baby Ray's instead. HNNNNGGGG.

* Frozen veggies are cheap and easy. Wal-Mart has some packages you can steam in the microwave in 7 minutes. Learn to enjoy broccoli. Brussels Sprouts are pretty damn tasty too. No corn or potatoes, avoid just about every vegetable that's not green.

* You don't need milk or juice. If you absolutely require milk, almond milk is my jam.

* Canned spinach all day. Really cheap, healthy, add in some hot sauce and DAMN.

* Spam. If it was good enough for your grandfather through occupying the Pacific, it's good enough for you. I use spam instead of bacon sometimes to mix things up for breakfast. Or SLTs, mmmmmm. I use my grandmother's Lodge cast iron skillet, so sometimes I imagine the pork in my Spam is reuniting with its ancestors.

* KALE KALE KALE KALE KALE. Kale is so important I want to punch you in the mouth. It cures cancer. Eat it. Think you're done? Eat more of it. Kale salad, kale chips, kale on kale, all kale everything.

* Great Value everything.

* Water. I don't drink anything else and I force it down my throat. 2-4 liters a day. I use a 1L Nalgene bottle, best water bottle I've ever owned hands down. I once dropped it from chest height and it bounced back into my hands like a basketball, no scratches. Also doubles as the perfect backpacking/camping companion for its durability and capacity.

* If you get tired of water, check out those Crystal Light packets. Arizona makes an Arnold Palmer one that has 5 calories per quart. I make a pitcher of that and it's my leisure drink sometimes.

* If you're going to be consuming alcohol, steer clear of the beer. Liquor + diet soda is your friend here. For the bottom shelf, you can't beat Evan Williams and Diet Sun Drop. Then again, I'm a Southern boy so YMMV.

Here's my shopping list:

* BSCB

* A bunch/stalk/thingy of Kale

* Lettuce, I use iceberg as my lettuce wrap on sandwiches.

* Tomato (don't eat a bunch of it though, it's one of keto's gray areas)

* Cans of spinach

* Can or two of Spam

* Potted Meat (most people hate it, I don't mind it actually)

* Pastrami (watch the carbs, preservatives can add up like crazy) or whatever lunch meat you like.

* Butter

* Bacon

* Eggs

* Shredded cheese

* String Cheese

* Whole Cottage Cheese (SUPER fatty and on keto you need nearly 2/3 of your calorie intake to be fat)

* Trident gum (watch out for other brands, some use artificial sweeteners with carbs)

That'll get me through 2 weeks. When you get tired of chicken, maybe swap in some ground beef. Only caveat is that it goes bad kinda fast, so it's hard to by a value size just for yourself unless you make hamburger patties in advance and refrigerate them for later use.

Explaining keto in 5 minutes isn't the best idea so I'd check out /r/keto if you're serious about it. It is a radical change for your body, you'll have a lot of effects. I think of it as pushing your body to its dietary limit. For instance, I have to keep my sodium intake in check. Too much sodium and too little water means my kidneys start hurting. Too much water and too little sodium, I start feeling woozy and have to drink some chicken broth or something to feel better. Ultimately, you have to listen to your body. I tried to get by on keto at first with less food than this. I ended up with flulike symptoms and if I had kept it up I would've been in the hospital for malnutrition. And in the same vein as nutrition, I take a flinstones multi every day, it doubles as a nice treat!",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_1aplyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1aplyo/ive_been_doing_keto_intermittent_fasting_for/,

* 2lbs Potatoes
* 2/3 cup Butter or Margarine
* 2/3 cup Flour
* 1/2 Gallon Milk
* 1 bottle Hormel Real Bacon Bits (3oz)
* 1lb cubed Ham
* 1-2 tablespoons chopped Chives
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 cups finely shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese


Bake potatoes and set aside to cool. I personally microwave them to save time. While potatoes are baking/cooling, heat butter in 6qt soup pot on medium-low heat. Once butter is melted, whisk in flour a small amount at a time to avoid lumps. Once all flour is added, slowly add milk, whisking constantly. When all milk is added, add salt and pepper, and continue heating on medium-low, stirring occasionally until mixture thickens. While waiting on the milk/butter/flour to thicken, cut potatoes into 1/2""-1"" chunks. Add potatoes once mixture has thickened. Add bacon bits, ham, and chives and continue cooking until potatoes have broken down and soup has thickened considerably. Stir in cheese thoroughly and serve.

This is a modified version of one I found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12mh6p/hangover_soup_potato/). Their version calls for less milk, which ends up far too thick for me, no ham, and serves with sour cream. It tastes fine without it, but the sour cream does add a slight tang if you want that. It also calls for cooking your own bacon, but bacon is getting pretty expensive now and the bacon bits were considerably cheaper for the same effect.

I know some might consider this unhealthy, but it's a far better option than what I can get at work, and is filling.

Mix dry ingredients together. Add milk, egg, vanilla and butter. Beat until smooth. Drop by ladel-ful into hot oiled pan. Tip batter around to make a thin coating. Cook about 90 seconds until the edges start to look dry. Flip and cook 30 seconds more.

My sons were lovers of bananas so I'd slice them and warm them in a pan with just a tiny bit of butter and brown sugar and fold the crepes around them.

I often bring this dish to pot lucks so I have something simple and healthy to eat and it is always a hit.  I also recommended this recipe to someone whose kid is a picky eater and for some reason the kid loved it.

This dish can be a complete vegetarian protein meal on its own, but also goes well as a side with chicken or fish.  

Approximately 2-4 servings as a side dish

1/2 cup White Quinoa    
1/2 cup Red Quinoa    
(or 1 cup White Quinoa)    
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth or bouillon    
3/4 cup frozen peas, defrosted    
3/4 cup canned chick peas    
Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste    
Lemon or lemon juice (optional)     


1) Put broth in a sauce pan and heat to bring it to a boil, add enough salt and pepper that the broth is very tasty.

2) Rinse the quinoa -- this needs to be done thoroughly to remove the bitter saponin on the surface.  Place the quinoa in a large bowl and fill the it with cold water.  Mix thoroughly until the water is cloudy.  Pour off the water (not all of it or else you will lose a lot of grains as well).  Repeat until the water is clear, about 3 or 4 times. [Quinoa these days often comes ""pre-rinsed"" check the package].

3) Place the rinsed quinoa into boiling broth and turn down to simmer for 20-25 minutes (when all or most of the liquid is absorbed).

4) Defrost the peas --  place frozen peas in a bowl and run hot water over them.

5) Add the peas and chickpeas to the hot quinoa while it is still on the stove and stir.

6) Add additional salt and pepper to taste, and a squeeze of lemon juice if you like.

Variations: This dish can be served cold as a salad,  with a dressing made of olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and add chopped cucumbers and tomatoes. .

A nice, sweeter variation is to make the pilaf with orange juice rather than broth and add golden raisins and slivered almonds rather that the peas a chick peas.  Also great with chicken and even pot roast.  Big crowd please at a seder.

I really want to start bringing my own lunch, and I was hoping y'all could help me out!

* Cheapness: I'm currently paying $10/week, or $2/day, in the line. It will only be worthwhile to my mom if I can keep it in that price range, or even lower.
* Time consumption: I won't have time to do much in the morning, except throw it all in a bag. Any prep/cooking would need to be done the night before, better yet, preparing multiple lunches at once in one night.
* Portability: I have to carry way too much stuff with me during the day, so it'd be best if my lunch was small. I'd rather avoid using chill packs, if at all possible. For example, the salads-in-a-jar look great in that realm.
* Heating/cooling: I do not have access to a microwave at school. Again, I'd like to avoid chill packs. So that excludes some meats, dairies, etc.
* Food preferences: I'm really open to most foods. I am not fond of cucumber. Foods like PB&amp;J sandwiches aren't really my cup of tea either. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I need easily accessible, healthy foods from the average supermarket. I just got back from Peru, and fell in love with quinoa. Found it in the states, and I'd love to incorporate that into some meals. (Just made quinoa pudding. YUM.)

So what's your favorite healthy pizza toppings?

Crust recipe:

This recipe isn't an exact science. I generally just throw the approximate ingredients together without using measuring cups, and it has always come out lovely. But, the first time you might want to use measuring cups so that you get a feel for it.

1 tsp sugar

1 tsp instant yeast

1 cup warm water

.

1 tsp salt

2 Tbs oil (I like olive)

3 cups flour

1. Mix sugar, yeast, and water, let sit for a minute or two.

2. Dissolve salt, and mix in oil and 2 cups flour. 

3. Gradually knead in the last cup of flour until the dough is no longer tacky. Add a bit more if you need.

4. Knead for about 5 minutes on a floured surface, add more flour if needed (it shouldn't be tacky!)

5. Optional (but highly suggested): let sit for 30 minutes-2 hours in a covered bowl, allowing the dough to rise. Knead again for a minute before continuing to 5

6. roll the dough out to your desired thickness, and precook for about 5-10 minutes at 450ÂºF (230ÂºC), depending on the thickness. Let it get ""golden""

What you'll need:

4 cans red beans (about $3.50)
- you can use regular dry beans if you like

1 store brand smoked beef sausage (around $3.50)

1 small can of diced tomatoes (around 75 cents)

1/2 onion

2-3 cloves garlic

1/2 cup chicken stock

1 cup rice

In a large frying pan add some oil, chopped onions and finely diced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon or so of each; garlic powder, paprika and parsley. Then add 1 teaspoon of chili powder and red pepper (You can add more or less of the hot stuff depending on your taste). I sometimes add a little cumin too. cook until translucent and then add your chopped sausage and brown it. You can also add bell pepper and hot pepper if you have some on hand.

What you'll need:

1 package of 4 Naan bread (so awesome as dough) (around $2)

1 small package of mozzerella (about $4)

1 small package of pepperoni (about $2.50)

1 large can of whole tomatoes (around $1.50)

Whatever other vegetables you want that you already have on hand.

The sauce:

Put one can of stewed tomatoes in the blender with salt and pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of each; basil, garlic powder, parsley, paprika, and red pepper flakes and blend until smooth.

Building your pizza:

First put your naan on a cookie sheet (it'll take 2 if you're serving 4 people)  then add your sauce, slice your cheese about 1/4 inch, add pepperoni and whatever you want on top of that! Bake it at 350 until the cheese starts to brown and remove from the oven. REMEMBER to let it cool for 3 or 4 minutes before cutting or it will be soggy.

Note:

I use naan bread for two reasons, it's really good to use for pizza and it saves me 2 hours that I don't always have to make pizza dough.

Same concept, a toaster and a microwave oven, just done manually. It's healthier as it you don't need to add oils or butter to it (you *can* add butter if you want, but it's not required).

1. Bread in the toaster!
2. Start peeling off the plastic of the cheese slices (1 or 2)
3. Golden cripsy toast pops up
4. Take out one slice, put the cheese on it, quickly!
5. Take out the second slice, lay it over the other, it's important to do this part quickly.
6. Smoosh it down, press them in to each other. The heat from the just toasted bread will start to melt the cheese, filling all the pours of the bread.
7. Pop it in the microwave for about 18-22 seconds depending on microwave (anything over that and all the goey cheese that pours out the sides will burn)

That's it! Takes practically no time at all, it's cheap, easy, fast, and better for you than making it the old fashioned way due to the lack of butter/oils/fat/grease.

I am a nursing student who is currently doing a community project with 5 other students to combat obesity rates in a low income primarily Hispanic community.

At this fair, we're planning to hand out grab bags full of groceries to make one recipe, that is fundamentally Hispanic. We wanted to use brown rice instead of white rice (it lowers the incidence of diabetes) and make it as healthy as possible.

Total cost is ~$9 where I live with the spinach and chicken being the most expensive parts. If you have to buy maple syrup it can be more expensive, but the recipe only uses 1/4C so you can make it several times with a single bottle.

Minus the cook time for the rice, I can have this dish ready in 15 minutes.

**Ingredients**    
1 Tbsp butter    
1/4 cup real maple syrup    
1/2 cup dried cranberries    
2 chicken breasts    
2 cups uncooked brown rice    
6 oz baby spinach (~5 cups)    

**Directions**    
1. Cook rice using your preferred method    
2. Trim and grill chicken. Cut grilled chicken into cubes (~3/4"").     
3. Add butter and maple syrup to a large skillet over medium heat. Add cranberries and cook 1 minute. Add chicken and cook 1 minute. Add spinach and cook until wilted (~2-3 minutes)    
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine rice with contents of skillet. Toss to mix.

**Substitutions/Alternatives**    
- Use arugula instead of spinach. This adds a little more bitterness to counter the sweetness. You can also do a spinach/arugula mix.   
- You can use white rice instead of brown rice if you prefer that.    
- Wilting the greens is optional. I find that it tastes better but you're free to add them as-is.    
- If you don't have a grill, baking the chicken at 350F for 25-30 minutes also works.

It's kind of like a variation on hoppin john that uses breakfast sausage. It's one of those things that goes on sale for super cheap pretty regularly, just picked up two tubes of jimmy dean for buy one get one. Might be possible with pinto beans too if you really want to be cheap. Or you could increase the amount of black eyed peas to cut down the cost, but at 1$ for a super filling meal i found this ratio satisfactory. Also a great way to make something healthier is to reduce sodium, feel free to use less bouillon, but at least add some salt for boiling the peas. If you REALLY prefer healthy over tasty, cook the onions and sausage separate and drain the sausage after cooking.

1lb black eyed peas 

1lb breakfast sausage (either a tube or individuals)

1 red onion

2-3 tbsp chicken bouillon

cajun seasoning if you like

Let the peas soak for most of the day. I recommend draining them once or twice during the day as the water gets visibly dirty, but probably not necessary. 

Start up some boiling water (about 3x the volume of the peas)

Chop up the onion, and break down the breakfast sausage like you would ground beef for a taco. Throw both of these in a frying pan and cook on medium heat, continuing to chop the bigger pieces of meat down with a spatula. If you would like to add cajun seasoning go ahead and throw it on the sausage at this point, be careful though as the chicken bouillon adds a lot of salty flavor as well. I found this timing perfect, onions turn translucent right as the sausage is done and absorb all that yummy fat. This took a little less than half an hour for me, if you would rather brown quickly, adjust your bean cooking time accordingly as they require about 2 hours.

After the meat/onions is browned/cooked, add it to the boiling peas and let simmer for an hour and a half. If you would rather have little broth (like me) boil fairly vigorously.

    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

    3/4 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips

    1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

    1/2 cup dried cherries, coarsely chopped

    3. Spoon some cookie dough into each muffin cup, so dough comes just to tops of cups (cookies won't rise much).

    4. Bake until cookies are golden around edges and just set in center, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove tin to a wire rack and let stand 5 minutes before removing cookies to cool completely on rack.

Note: Switch the add-ins. Try other fruits, like raisins, currants or chopped dried apricots, instead of the cherries in this versatile recipe. Or toss in dried cranberries and either regular chocolate chips or chopped white chocolate. You can also substitute pecans, almonds or hazelnuts for the walnuts. Chopped macadamia nuts work well, too, especially with white chocolate. Toffee bits and pecans make another great combination.

(Feeds 4 for under $10),hardtoremember,12,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jlpi/braised_chicken_with_potatoes_and_zucchini_recipe/,"This is one of my favorite things to make and incredibly simple, yet elegant. Serves 4 for under $10!

1 pack of 4 chicken thighs ($4 to $5)

3 potatoes (about 75 cents)

2 regular zucchini (about $1.50)

1/2 onion (about 50 cents)

2 to 3 cloves of garlic

1/2 stick of butter

Braised chicken:

Spice your chicken with garlic powder, basil, parsley, salt and pepper. Heat up your oil nice and hot and place chicken skin side down in the pan to sear it off. After about two minutes the skin should be browned and you'll want to turn it over and sear the bottom for about 1 minute.

Now you either add 1 1/2 cup of wine, chicken stock, or water (if you add wine keep it on high for about 2 minutes) and turn the burner down to low. Then cover the pan and let it cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 

Potatoes:

Wash and cut up the potatoes, onion, zucchini (rough) and dice the garlic. Line a deeper pan with aluminum foil, put in your vegetables and butter and spice them with salt, pepper, dill and parsley. Add about 1/2 cup of water in the pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil and put them in the oven for about 1/2 hour at 400 degrees. 

The chicken comes out so tender and juicy that you won't even need a knife!

I've been feeling blah about what I was cooking and eating, and we've not been getting nearly enough vegetables. My 6 year old went on a bit of a veggie strike, and I just wasn't up to fighting itâ¦.until now. 

But with your help, I'm so on top of it this week!

Last night I invited my kiddo into the kitchen to help me make the Chermoula sauce and carrot soup from [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1f311m) post. Tomorrow we'll have poached fish with the leftover sauce. And because she helped make the sauce, my kiddo eats it. 

Tonight I made the same Veggie Lasagne BÃ©chamel that I contributed as a comment in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1f5exx/any_good_recipes_that_can_be_made_in_bulk_are/) post. While I was prepping veggies, I chopped extra cauliflower and zucchini, steamed and pureed them. I doubled the amount of bÃ©chamel sauce, used what I needed for this recipe, then combined the cauliflower puree with the rest of the sauce and tucked it away in the fridge. I'll use it on Wednesday to make whole wheat mac &amp; cheese and my kiddo will never know the veggies are in there. 

I threw a couple of sweet potatoes in the oven to bake beside the lasagne tonight, and I'll scoop them out and add them to sautÃ©ed onions and black beans with cumin and cilantro to make a burrito filling for whole wheat tortillas for Thursday. 

Lunches this week are leftover lasagne and salad for my partner and I, and tofu sticks and strips of bell pepper, celery and carrots to dip in peanut sauce for the kiddo. 

Plus chocolate muffins from a recipe by The Sneaky Chef that includes whole wheat flour, flax seed meal, and pureed spinach, kale and blueberries. And they're super good!

Thanks for all your inspiration! Thanks to you all, I'm back on track, cooking with a wide variety of veggies, saving money by eating at home and not letting anything go to waste. Whew!

I'm looking for some specific advice. I've recently been told that I must restrict my diet because my GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is getting pretty horrendous. This includes cutting out tomatoes and onions which I have in nearly every meal. I have a  few other recipes but am getting very quickly tired of veggie soup, salad, stir fry and chicken/lamb/beef cassarole. I eat mostly vegetarian but have meat maybe once or twice a week. I LOVE cheese. is16 kindly suggested asafoetida to me for the onion flavour but I mostly used onions to bulk out meals because they're cheap. 


I am disabled, so can't do anything that requires fiddly prep work, but I do have a food processor with slicing and grating attachments. I can't do anything that requires lugging about full pots, I use small pots or fill with a jug whilst they're sitting on the stove. 


I'd really appreciate any advice, I'm on a very tight budget atm. We don't have a cheap farmers market but I can get veg pretty reasonably at a discount retailer. Many thanks in advance. 

Foods I can't have:
* Any kind of citrus fruit
* Anything spicy
* Anything high in fat (including fatty meats, like bacon *sobs*)
* Tomato
* Onion
* Mint
* Butter
* Alcohol
* Caffeine
* Chocolate


Foods I can have in moderation:
* Low fat versions of fatty foods
* Most other fruits (apart from apple and banana, which I can eat lots of)
* Cheddar cheese
* Garlic
* Fried foods

I'm sure many people donate it to local farms or use it to fertilize their gardens, but if you have some to spare, this is a really easy bread recipe that uses the spent grains. 

Ingredients:

1 cup warm water (roughly body temperature)
1 package bread yeast
4 TB sugar
2 cups spent grains
2 TB vegetable oil
1 TB salt
3 to 3 1/2 cups flour (wheat or all purpose)

Directions:

1.  Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar; stir vigorously and wait to proof.
2.  Add spent grain, oil, salt, and 1 cup flour.  Mix well with a wooden spoon.
3.  Slowly add 2 to 2 1/2 cups flour, or enough to make dough stiff (this will vary based upon the type of spent grains you use and how dry they are).  Knead for several minutes, then cover with a clean dishtowel that's been run under hot water (with the excess water squeezed out). 
4.  Let rise for several hours, until doubled.  
5.  When the dough has doubled in size, punch it several times then divide it into two loaves.  Place dough on a greased pan and cook for 20 minutes at 425 degrees F, THEN reduce the temperature to 375 and cook for another 20-25 minutes.  Enjoy!

They're cheap, they're delicious, they keep well and they're a good non-meat source of protein. 

So you made up your first big ol' pot of beans and the first thing you think is, ""Damn, that's a lot of beans."" They're deceptively small when they're in the bag, aren't they? 

There are probably more kinds of beans than I can name but for our family, the beans I'm most likely to have leftover are pintos. And that means refried beans! I went 30 years of my life thinking there was some kind of magic in making refritos and never bothered to learn otherwise. Now, they're part of our regular meal rotation and I'm never going to buy the canned ones again. 

About once a month throughout the fall/winter, I made ham and beans. It's always on a Friday because, well... beans. But also because we're football freaks and the following Sunday is absolutely going to be Mexican food while we watch, so it's a perfect setup to use up the beans. 

Contrary to popular belief, refried beans aren't actually fried; they're mashed. And that's it. The entire process is nothing more than reheating the beans, draining off the liquid and mashing them up. A potato masher works great because you can get them as smooth or as chunky as you like. If they look a little too dry, you can add some of the cooking liquid back into them. A dab of butter or margarine (or bacon grease!) will work as well, though probably not as good for you.

Now you've got nice creamy beans to eat as a side with tacos or as a filling for a burrito. They're still cheap, they're still healthy and they're completely different from what you had the day before!

If you've truly gone overboard when you made them in the first place and now have leftover refried beans, I give you the recipe for an amazing bean dip:

* 1-1/2 cups refried beans
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
* 1 to 2 Tablespoons fresh, chopped jalapeno

Stick it all in a food processor or blender and whiz away. This really tastes better if you make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. If you salted your beans before - or if you cooked them with ham or bacon, you'll want to leave out the salt when you make the dip.

What do you all do with your leftover beans?",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,t3_176thk,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/176thk/thursday_doover_what_to_do_with_leftover_beans/,moderator

These methods will be better for you and not as expensive as nice pizza from a nice restaurant.

First, we start with a traditional dough.

**Pizza Dough**

Dough recipe makes enough for two pizzas

Ingredients:

2 1/4 teaspoons fast rising yeast (trivial if you buy in bulk)

1 teaspoon brown sugar (~$.05)

1 teaspoon salt (trivial)

2 tablespoons olive oil (~$.05)

1 teaspoon garlic powder (trivial)

1 teaspoon onion powder (trivial)

1 1/2 cups warm water (free)

3 1/2 cups flour (~$.50)

Directions:

* In large bowl, dissolve yeast and brown sugar in the water.

* Let sit for 10 minutes.

* Stir the salt, oil, garlic powder, and onion powder into the yeast mixture.

* Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour.

* Turn dough out onto a clean, dry surface and knead in more flour until the dough is no longer sticky.

* Place the dough into a well oiled bowl, and cover with a cloth.

* Let the dough double in size.

* Should take about 1/2 hour if in warm spot.

* Punch down and let rest a minute.

* Roll out, and prepare your favorite pizza.

* I use a pizza stone sprinkled with a bit of corn meal.

* Once I have the dough shaped I bake it plain for about 5-10 minutes, then pull out of oven and add toppings, just seems to work better every time.

* Bake in preheated oven 425 degrees until the cheese and crust are golden brown, about 20 minutes.

OR

Follow the directions on your bread machine and toss everything in there together and let it do the hard work. Cook the same way.

For toppings, the sky's the limit here folks! Make a traditional pepperoni pizza, or use a white sauce with spinach for a white pizza, or barbecue sauce and chicken for a BBQ chicken pizza, or Frank's Red Hot and chicken and celery for a buffalo chicken pizza, or Tapatio, onions, tomatoes, and ground beef for a taco pizza (top with shredded lettuce after baking), or whatever else you can dream of!

For those of you who cannot have wheat in your diet, you have to get a little more creative. You could do a ['meatzza'](http://paleofriggendelish.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/meatza/), but that's kind of too expensive for my liking. We do a cauliflower crust!

**Cauliflower Crust Pizza**

Ingredients:

1 cup cooked, riced cauliflower (~$.50)

1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, goat cheese crumbles, or any other cheese substitute (~$.75-$2)

1 egg, beaten (~$.10)

1 tsp dried oregano (trivial)

1/2 tsp crushed garlic (trivial)

1/2 tsp garlic salt (trivial)

olive oil (optional) 

pizza sauce, shredded cheese and your choice of toppings* (varies)

Directions:

To ""Rice"" the Cauliflower:

* Take 1 large head of fresh cauliflower, remove stems and leaves, and chop the florets into chunks. Add to food processor and pulse until it looks like grain. Do not over-do pulse or you will puree it. (If you don't have a food processor, you can grate the whole head with a cheese grater). Place the riced cauliflower into a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 8 minutes (some microwaves are more powerful than others, so you may need to reduce this cooking time). There is no need to add water, as the natural moisture in the cauliflower is enough to cook itself.
One large head should produce approximately 3 cups of riced cauliflower. The remainder can be used to make additional pizza crusts immediately, or can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.

To Make the Pizza Crust:

* Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
* In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup cauliflower, egg and mozzarella. Add oregano, crushed garlic and garlic salt, stir. 

* Transfer to the cookie sheet, and using your hands, pat out into a 9"" round. Optional: Brush olive oil over top of mixture to help with browning.

* Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes.

* Remove from oven. To the crust, add sauce, toppings and cheese. 

* Place under a broiler at high heat just until cheese is melted (approximately 3-4 minutes).

* Enjoy!

*Note that toppings need to be precooked since you are only broiling for a few minutes.",,False,self,t5_2vvpi,1356747521.0,,,True,t3_15lrqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15lrqm/several_variations_on_pizza_paleo/,

If you have a back yard or a sunny area in your house you can put some potted plants in, growing oregano, rosemary really easily and all three are kind of hard to kill. Actually, the oregano and rosemary are almost impossible. We started drying our herbs when we realized that there was more than we could use or give away before it freezes. 

All you need to do is tie it up and hang it upside down from something for a couple of weeks and it should be dried enough to put in containers to be used. The flavor is many times better than anything I've bought dried and it really kicks up your food a few notches. Plus you'll get to eat what you grow.

But no one will care if you make it in the afternoon or evening.

You will need:
1 frozen banana, sliced
1 tbsp Greek Yogurt (I use plain)
1/2 cup Unsweetened almond milk (or the healthy milk of your choice)
1 tbsp peanut butter
A couple handfuls of baby spinach (raw)
A Blender

Simply mix these ingredients and blend until thoroughly liquefied.  The amount of spinach will vary; I typically just pack it in the remaining space in the blender.  The outcome is an incredibly nutritious shake, but the only thing you'll taste is the peanut butter.  This is a great way for me to get my daily dose of Greek Yogurt in without actually having to taste it.
