We've gotten some inquiries toward us that referenced contact from a local viewer/reader/etc., so people are at least getting interested. Keep it up!**

Inspired by this recent post [""I work in news and this is how you stop SOPA""](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ngd4r/i_work_in_news_this_is_how_you_stop_sopa/), we are doing everything we can to contact both local and national media to raise awareness of SOPA. We are reaching out to the media contacts we have and are already having some small success, but we need your help.

Now that the committee vote has been delayed until January, we are focusing on local press. It's absolutely critical that we raise awareness of SOPA/PIPA and the devastating impact they would have on all manner of small businesses that rely on the internet to sell and market their goods and services.
Here are some things that would help our efforts:  

* Legal and technology experts who could talk about the impact of SOPA to media, especially to local press.  
* Small business owners who would be negatively impacted by SOPA (almost anyone selling anything online, or reliant on online advertising). We're specifically looking for people who've made money online with an etsy store, or a successful kickstarter, etc.
* Contacting local press directly. Here is a short blurb text that you can customize: 

---

The internet is THE job creation platform of the 21st century because it allows local small businesses and entrepreneurs to efficiently sell their goods and services across the globe. Two bills now pending in Congress—the PROTECT IP Act of 2011 (Protect IP) in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House threaten to undermine that platform by denying business owners that use the internet the right to due process of law.

Unfortunately, most people and small business owners are not even aware of SOPA &amp; PIPA, much less the threat they pose. These days the internet impacts just about every business, and it's important that local business owners learn more about how Congress may further regulate the internet.

Here is an open letter from prominent tech entrepreneurs, including the founders of google, Twitter, Youtube, Huffington Post, Craigslist, Yahoo!, paypal, and eBay:
http://dq99alanzv66m.cloudfront.net/sopa/img/12-14-letter.pdf

Adam Savage from Mythbusters explains how SOPA could destroy the internet as we know it:
http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/articles/mythbuster-adam-savage-sopa-could-destroy-the-internet-as-we-know-it-6620300

Please help inform your audience about how Congress is attempting to regulate the internet.

I feel that I should start over and restate my earlier contribution, due to...well, a lot of circumstances.  This version isn't as volatile, but hopefully retains the gist of the sentiment, while further explaining some of the muddier details.*

As a film student in early 2001, I was a juggernaut.  I was making a lot of short films that were garnering moderate acclaim, and I was always pushing ahead, making bigger and bigger projects.  For my senior thesis, I wanted to base it on a short story by Isaac Asimov, which was part of the compilation that made up the book “I, Robot”.  Isaac had died a few years previous, but after a lot of badgering to the publishers, I was finally awarded with the home phone number of his wife, Janet.

I figured that the number I was given was just another publishing associate, so I dialed with thinly veiled skepticism.  To my surprise, the voice that answered was a feeble, elderly woman.  I struggled through my initial shock to explain that I was a student; I wanted to use her husband’s story as a basis for my project, and could I get her permission.  She said that it sounded like fun, and gave me the number of the estate attorney, so I could get a written form that gave me the go-ahead.  I called, I got permission, and they faxed the form to my professor’s office.

*It’s important to note that the film was based on one of Asimov’s short stories, “Reason”, but was not a direct interpretation.  It was not titled “I, Robot”, and barring the inclusion of the laws of robotics, was almost wholly original.* 

2 weeks later, 30 people showed up to help build sets, sew costumes, and make a little bit of history.  **Sadly, I let them all down.**

In our last week of shooting, 3 months after I received written consent to use the short story, one of the crew brought in a copy of Variety, which mentioned that a major studio purchased the book rights to I, Robot, and planned to make a film.  Initially, I thought, “Awesome – free promotion!”  Alas, that’s not what was looming on the horizon.

Part of the project was to make posters, trailers, and a website for the film.  We even went so far as to create our own production company, as to look professional.  Somehow the legal team from the studio found out about a student project, in a small private college in the Midwest, with no budget, being shot in a warehouse basement, and decided to issue a cease and desist order.  Basically, what that means, is that the studio’s lawyers said to us, “You’re using our property.  Stop, or we’ll sue you into the stone age.”  I responded by sending them the consent form from the Asimov estate, and explained that it was a student project, not a commercial venture worth litigating.  I turned over our script, our shooting notes, our shot list, copies of our tapes and even the concept art drawings.

Instead of the letter recognizing our valiant efforts as students that I expected, I found myself on the tail end of a phone call that changed my life.  I was contacted directly by the lead of the studio’s legal team, who explained my situation to me very clearly.  He told me that I was technically in my legal right to use Isaac Asimov’s material.  However, if I chose to proceed, they would file multiple lawsuits totaling over 2 million dollars against me.  In the end, I might win, but it would take hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to fight it, but would cost them nothing more than the salaries they already pay their lawyers.  It would be 10 years before any type of verdict could be levied, and by then it wouldn’t matter what the outcome was, since their film would be long since released.

I was 22.  I was working 2 jobs, making about $9 an hour, in addition to attending school.  I had taken out every student loan I could get to finance my film, which totaled about $10,000 in debt.  I had spent my last dollar to buy breakfast for the crew on the last day of shooting.  I was properly fucked.  *I caved.*

In the end, my professors had sympathy on me.  They had visited the set, seen the dailies, and recognized my talent and dedication.  I graduated with honors, without ever turning in a senior thesis project.  I guess that they assumed I had learned the most valuable of all life lessons.

Looking back, I can recognize that the lawyers were only doing their job; I was only worth a couple of hours of an intern’s time, and a 10 minute phone call.  To me, they completely pulled the rug out from underneath the career that I’d been trying to carve out for myself.  Without a thesis project, I wasn’t equipped to apply to grad schools, and by the time I’d recuperated from the costs I’d incurred, I’d already been forced to accept a different career path, and rearranged my life to fit.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a fairly successful career designing web sites for major entities, and I make a decent living.  I was willing to pick up and start over, but I can’t help but harbor resentment for having my wings clipped so early, and so unjustly.

It’s been ten years since this all went down, and even though I want to share my film, show my work and risk the consequences, I cannot.  As my wife reminded me, we have a home, careers and our livelihoods.  I’m not just putting myself in harm’s way, but her as well, and that’s not a fair sacrifice regardless of the honest intentions.  *Please note that I don't condone any illegal activity of any sort.*

My story is not unique, nor is it very interesting.  I’m one of many that have had a short end of the stick handed to them by a big faceless monster, and I feel that it’s my right and responsibility to take that short bit and fight back - *one download at a time.*

I’m forced to watch the studios systematically destroy the art of film.  *One download at a time.*

I defy the system in my own petty way.  *One download at a time.*

I want to watch it burn.  *One download at a time.*

Some of you saw a portion of the film clip, and I want to thank everyone for their kind sentiments.  However, by posting it, I might have been in violation of the original cessation order, so I had to unfortunately take it down of my own volition.  I’m forced to consider that my actions no longer affect only myself, but my family, my company, and my employees, and am no longer in a position to make a stand and risk their futures, as well as my own.

I am deeply inspired by the support that has been shown by the reddit community, so much so that I’ve begun to rekindle my efforts to recreate this film since it not only holds a lot of personal sentiment for me, but is an incredibly timeless tale that deserves its’ due.  Sadly, I cannot use any of the original footage, pursuant to the legal action that was brought against me.  Luckily, like so many of you have stated, it’s not too late to start over.  Please send messages to me directly, since the comments in these posts have taken on a life of their own, and have become very difficult to follow.

**Thank you again**, reddit, for providing insight and support into something that has been hanging over my head for a decade.  Thank you for helping find my voice again, and for the inspiration that I sorely needed a long time ago.

As I was on the floor of the House yesterday, I can assure you that the actions taken were noticed by the Representatives.
For myself, I was inspired that millions of Americans cared enough about freedom to contact their elected Representatives.
But we have not yet prevailed.
The key vote in the United States Senate is scheduled to occur at 2:15 next Tuesday, January 24th.  It is on a “motion to proceed” to consider PIPA.  We need at least 41 Senators to vote NO on the “motion to proceed”.  Our vote count right now show us in single digits on the NO side so we have work to do.  If the motion to proceed is successful it is likely that a form of SOPA/PIPA will become law this year.  So this vote is a KEY VOTE on PIPA in the Senate.
The concern is that Senators may try to have it both ways.  They can say they are only voting “yes” on a motion to proceed to “allow the bill to be fixed.”  But the truth is that moving to proceed next week will leave the proponents of SOPA/PIPA in control of the process. 
It will shut down further debate and preclude input from Internet experts and the public and will prevent meaningful consideration of changes to the bills.  The goal of proponents of SOPA/PIPA is to pass something in both the House and Senate so that legislators can move “behind closed doors” into what is known as a “conference committee” and write what they want in secret.  
A yes vote on a motion to proceed is, in effect, a yes vote on getting SOPA/PIPA made into law.
And that vote is scheduled to be taken next Tuesday at 2:15.
Your opposition to SOPA/PIPA had nothing to do with political parties and everything to do with preserving free expression on the internet.
Make sure that everyone knows the KEY VOTE in the Senate is scheduled for this Tuesday, January 24th, 2:15pm (EST). We need Senators to vote NO.

It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, and was only stopped from going to a vote because Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on it. SOPA was introduced in October as an attempt to introduce the same ""anti-piracy"" legislation via the House. It has of course met with high profile opposition, so the supporters of this draconian legislation have turned their attention back to the PROTECT IP Act.

[Senator Harry Reid is seeking a cloture to override Senator Wyden's hold](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111217/22470217117/senator-harry-reid-moves-to-approve-protect-ip-begin-censoring-internet.shtml). **They will vote at 2:15pm on Tuesday, January 24, 2012.** The supporters already have 40 senators. They have a month in which to convince another 20 to vote yes. If this happens, the act will be sent to the House to vote on (there it only needs a majority).

That means we have a month in which to lobby Senators to oppose the bill. We're up against giant corporations, and I think it will require as many Redditors as possible to take part.  

**[Here is a list of those people/corporations supporting/opposing the PROTECT IP Act](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/money).** 

Remember, if the PROTECT IP Act is passed, SOPA won't even be needed any more. SOPA is thankfully getting a lot of attention, but the danger is that it's distracting people from the PROTECT IP Act, which has already passed further through congress.

AMA with superwoman ZOE LOFGREN that took place earlier: http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nfhhy/member_of_house_judiciary_committee_ama_on_sopa/

**______________**

**SOPA is far from defeated.  Treat today's mini-victory simply as a short delay and keep acting against it.**
**______________**


**STATUS:** No vote on the bill.

**WHY:** Chaffetz suggests a hearing with experts.  Astoundingly, Smith is open to the idea and agrees, therefore the motion is carried.

**WHAT:** The session is over without a vote.  The deliberations will resume December 21st, 2011 ~~2012 (this was the last day of work for Congress this year)~~ with experts participating but there is no mention of who those experts are or will be.  I am unclear if they agreed to have experts or if they agreed to consider having experts. (**update** Zoe Lofgren: ""Still working out details for experts/nerds."")

**UHH:** The term ""classified hearing"" was used, I don't know what it means. According to common sense and some quick internet research, classified hearings would be closed to the public, not shown on tv, and the records would not be available until such a time as they were declassified.

**IS THIS GOOD OR BAD:** IT IS ~~VERY~~ GOOD.  As long as the bill isn't voted on and passed, it cannot go further down the assembly line of legislation.  ~~The extra 3 weeks or so of reprieve gives the opponents of SOPA time to mobilize further and enlist more aide.~~

**WHAT DO:** Keep contacting your representatives.  Call them. Mail them letters. Tell your friends, tell your family.  Time works in our favour.

**Twitter accounts worth watching** (thanks to [m_i_rite](http://www.reddit.com/user/m_i_rite))

In order to be effective, the mass migration must still occur on December 29th. GoDaddy must suffer mass financial losses. Only then will they truly learn a lesson. Only then will other SOPA supporting corporations think twice.
Words do not matter. Actions matter.
Let's hit these suppressive liars where it hurts them the most. I for one propose the mass migration date is still on, and on with a vengeance. Who else is in?

Imagine that there are equivalents of these sites that are state-owned and controlled: a search engine that only returns government approved sites, a censored twitter where you must register with your real name and passport number, and an internet radio site that is forced to play ""red"" songs celebrating the government. Imagine that these government-sanctioned alternatives are shoddily and hastily assembled and have none of the quality or convenience the originals had.

Of course, you can bypass all of this by paying a premium for a VPN. But even then, those can be unreliable or slow and often get shut down. And having to use them feels like a precursor to tiered internet services. 

Everyday using the internet here feels like a struggle. There is so much restriction of information, even that which could be considered ""benign"". Imagine not being able to have access to any open education sites, such as Khan Academy. The lack of convenience of Googling for an answer is something I miss a lot. Going back home to US internet is amazing and something I'll never take for granted again.

I know SOPA doesn't imply that all of this would happen in the US. But it certainly feels like a step towards this sort of restriction, and sets a dangerous precedent.

P.S. These restrictions here haven't slowed down pirating a single bit.

Anonymity is a power, a privelage, not a silly mask for you to hide behind. SOPA threatens our Internet - our Anonymous status. This may simply be an image board, but I remember a time when it was organized, funny, and intelligent. I see nothing but porn and propoganda spread far and wide. This petty Civil War between the Internet is childish and ignorant. Reddit is Reddit. /b/ is /b/. 9Gag is 9Gag. Memes are not Gods. Memes are not the property of a single faction. They are to be spread and enjoyed throughout the Internet.

The Internet was crafted in order to house and share our opinions, beliefs, and entertainment. It was not crafted to wage wars with those we deem un-worthy. If 4chan, Reddit, and 9Gag were to group up - if Anonymous were to truly become a Legion - we could oppose SOPA, and uphold all that we believe in.

1327446442.0,529,self.SOPA,ov5j8,Senator Lamar Smith Likely Plans to Use Scare Tactics to Force Through His Legislation ,rawveggies,625,96,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ov5j8/senator_lamar_smith_likely_plans_to_use_scare/,"*This is a submission written by [SwampySoccerField](http://www.reddit.com/user/SwampySoccerField) that I have helped edit, it is submitted under my username so that it can be highlighted as a mod post. This is part 1, part 2 is in the comments.* 

On January 18th 2012 the people of the Internet decided that they would act to protect their rights, industry, and social networks. Our websites, at the people's request, turned themselves dark to draw notice to the contaminated legislation known as PIPA &amp; SOPA. We redirected the home pages of our websites with a single goal in mind: to show Americans how to contact their Members of Congress. That day millions of Americans learned how to petition their government. The response from some of Congress was refreshing: many whom were previously silent on the issue spoke up against the proposed legislation, and some of those who were co-sponsors changed their positions out of fear of political suicide. However, there are many members of Congress who are adamant about forcing legislation like [PIPA](http://projects.propublica.org/sopa/pipa#roll_call) &amp; [SOPA](http://projects.propublica.org/sopa/sopa#roll_call) through without public support or expert consultation.

In just days after millions did their best to petition their government, new bills have been brought to light that many suspect will be used as delivery devices to attach language similar to that that was in the PIPA &amp; SOPA bills. Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas, who is currently Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has announced that he has plans to keep pushing SOPA through Congress, and it is suspected that he will do this by painting anyone who does not vote for it as being a protector of pedophiles.

Congressman Lamar Smith's tactics are a dirty secret of Congress: when selfish ideas and bought legislation are going to be forced by lobbyists through Congress, Members name their bills things like “The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011,” which is the name of a bill that is scheduled to be voted on in less than a month. It is believed that the Congressman will attach large pieces of SOPA to a bill that would require your internet provider to track and store everything you do on the Internet.

Writers over at The Atlantic had this to say about how contaminated this bill already is:

[As written, The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 doesn't require that someone be under investigation on child pornography charges in order for police to access their Internet history -- being suspected of any crime is enough. (It may even be made available in civil matters like divorce trials or child custody battles.) Nor do police need probable cause to search this information. As Rep. James Sensenbrenner says, (R-Wisc.) ""It poses numerous risks that well outweigh any benefits, and I'm not convinced it will contribute in a significant way to protecting children.""](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/the-legislation-that-could-kill-internet-privacy-for-good/242853/)

What do this mean for you? Do you want to believe that because you aren't a pedophile that this bill does not apply to you? As much as we would all like to believe that this is the case we must realize that this bill targets each and every one of us as we go about our daily lives. It makes us all suspected criminals and exposes our private lives to the government. We would no longer have privacy in our own homes. Bought members of Congress who are pursuing special interests want to continue the deceitful practice that you can not object to bad legislation unless you have sympathy for pedophiles, someone who is against “protecting the children.” Regardless of the guilt by association tactic that Congress members are using, we must protect the privacy that each American has a right to, so that our children, as adults, still retain the constitutional rights they have been guaranteed, and we must call out these fear mongers and tell them that we are not going to stand silent for their abuses on our rights.

The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 has a fear-tactic built right into it's name, a trick that is completely dishonest. No sane person would want to endanger children, but the PCIP Act of 2011 is not about children or pedophiles. It is about the government and your internet provider keeping track of your every move on the Internet. Do you really want companies to keep logs of your private discussions with your loved ones, the intimate details you share with your spouse? Do you want someone to be able to see the emails you send to your doctor or the gossip between coworkers about how bad your boss really is? Right now the government can easily obtain access to this information with a warrant. It is not hard to do because all law enforcement has to show is a good reason to suspect you of a crime. Legislation like the The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 remove the need for a warrant. They break due process and pot this is something that is common in China. I do not think the United States should be taking tips on how to spy on its citizens from China. Do you? Furthermore, if major international companies like Sony and intelligence community resources like Stratfor can not keep their data safe from hackers then should your internet provider be able to ensure that your browsing history will not end up posted on the internet?

Hollywood and its lobbyists, like former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, are already threatening to stop funding members of Congress if they do their bidding. Media corporations and their lobbying firms are the money behind the kind of bills so many condemned just days ago. Chris Dodd is the CEO and Chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America. The former senator was known for good work in Congress in the past, many of you will see his name and think positively about this man. I do not blame you, but now  Chris Dodd is a lobbyist for multi-billion dollar corporate interests and is using his influence and connections to buy legislation from Congress.

The following quotes are taken directly from former Senator Chris Dodd:

""Those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake. Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake,""

[“Only days after the White House and chief sponsors of the legislation responded to the major concern expressed by opponents and then called for all parties to work cooperatively together, some technology business interests are resorting to stunts that punish their users or turn them into their corporate pawns, rather than coming to the table to find solutions to a problem that all now seem to agree is very real and damaging.”](http://mpaa.org/resources/c4c3712a-7b9f-4be8-bd70-25527d5dfad8.pdf)

Former Senator Dodd is doing his best to spin the fact that millions of Americans stood up against corporate interests by claiming the opposite, he is calling them pawns to corporate interests. For those of you who were not observing the events of January 18th 2012, almost every website that made a public statement of protest provided links to contact their Congressmen and encouraged you to read these pieces of legislation so you could understand their purposes and intent. Lobbyist Dodd's smear campaign undermines the very foundations of our democracy by trying to use his influence, as a CEO of a major media organization, to deceive everyday Americans into thinking that he is really fighting for their interests. For those of you at home wondering how much it costs to buy the influence of a thirty year former Senator: [the cost comes to $1.2 million dollars per year.](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/145389-report-dodd-on-verge-of-becoming-mpaa-chairman)

There is a startling problem to the approach that Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas and former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut have been using and that is the concept that they only want corporate interests to have a voice in these matters. [""In an interview Thursday, Mr. Dodd said he would welcome a summit meeting between Internet companies and content companies, perhaps convened by the White House, that could lead to a compromise. On Friday, Senator Harry Reid indefinitely postponed a cloture vote scheduled for Tuesday in the Senate, which appears to promise the death of the legislation in its current form.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/technology/dodd-calls-for-hollywood-and-silicon-valley-to-meet.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all) During the House Committee hearing for SOPA just two months ago, no experts in any technology related field had been yet been called to weigh in on the ramifications and consequences of the bill. At this time the bill was just steps away from being voted on by the House of Representatives. What had been done primarily behind closed doors was to have lobbyists and their lawyers directly influence the direction of SOPA so it would be tailored to their interests. These lobbyists from the MPAA, RIAA, and various other entities, that represent billion dollar interests, have had four years to craft the perfect storm and now they once again want to have more back-room deals where they came come to an agreement, all the while shutting the rest of us out because we don't have enough money to buy Congress and other elected officials, like a President who receives massive campaign contributions from Hollywood.

Last week, a junior Minister in the Irish government 'Sean Sherlock' signed a copyright amendment law. This has become broadly known as 'Irish SOPA/ACTA'. This legislation will give the Irish courts an open-ended power to grant orders against ISPs and other intermediaries who provide facilities which might be used to infringe copyright. This could include hosting providers, social networks, forums, video hosting sites – potentially most online services.

At a minimum this will probably allow courts to require ISPs to block access to alleged infringing sites (such as The Pirate Bay). Over and above that it becomes impossible to say – the language is so vague it might, for example, allow a court to require an ISP to introduce a three strikes system or to block certain ports. However, once copyright plaintiffs get hold of this power you can expect it to be pushed to its absolute limit.-THEJOURNAL.IE

This law was widely opposed, and a petition was signed by over 80,000 people, but this was ignored by the Minister. We need your help to fight this. We are supposed to be a democratic country, and our respresentatives must pay for not listening to the people!

UPDATE: The Lady from California is nice! EDIT: Zoe Lofgren


**FURTHER UPDATES:**

* The SOPA supporters are trying to speed through the hearing. The opposition in the form of Darrel Issa, and someone from california (don't know her name) objected the proposal to skip the reading of a new amendment.

* SOPA supporter (I assume) just tried to stop the reading of the new amendment by saying that the opposition are listening to the reading in a biased way. The motion to dispense with the reading was denied.

OFF TOPIC SUGGESTION:  Mass uploads of ""infringing"" material to Youtube, Daily Motion, Vimeo, Break, etc...., and put links to infringing content on your own blog (especially if it's hosted on blogger or wordpress or something), and also put ads on your blog after you link to infringing content, so that the ad provider has to be effected.  This would be for mass protest to demonstrate how ridiculous SOPA *actually* is in practice.

OFF TOPIC SUGGESTION: If you're rep is a Republican, tell him SOPA is a massive government intervention into the free market, and represents a massive regulatory burden on companies.  Because that's what it does.  If your rep is a democrat, tell them that SOPA is a massive violation of free speech, and even effects other countries!

* Ranking member compares opposition of SOPA to opposition of DMCA in 1998.  Says DMCA is now looked at as something that ""saved the web"".  Says DMCA isn't enough to stop foreign infringers.

* Conyers is speaking now. Says he didn't listen to the bill reading. ""All we're trying to do here is stop online piracy!"" -- accuses oppositon to SOPA of have some ulterior motive.

* Didn't get his name, chairman of IP committee speaking now. Says IP owners can't enforce their claims overseas. Is making the classical, fear-mongering case against piracy. Says ""foreign theft"" destroys the incentive to ""innovate"".

* Mr. Watt speaking now. Says he's ""old fashioned"" and techno-illiterate. Says the Internet allows ""pirates"" to flourish. Argues that grandmothers can die, and EMS equipement can fail because of ""piracy"".  Mr. Watt says some people think the Internet is like ""Las Vegas"".  Says brick n' mortar stores and websites should be equivalent in terms of law enforcement.

* Zoe Lofgren speaking now. She is opposed to SOPA. Says SOPA will make the Internet insecure. Mentioning the opinions of other opposition.

* Did anyone else lose the feed? - minor gap in coverage, sorry.

* Mr. Berman speaking now: says U.S. doesn't have jurisdiction to go after foreign sources of piracy (implying that SOPA changes that). Says U.S. comparison to Chinese and Iran net censorship is disingenuous.

* Lofgren responds to Berman: says SOPA is the beginning of the balkanization of the Internet.

* Berman pulls the child porn card in response to Lofgren.

* Mr. Chaffetz speaking now: says we don't know what we're doing, technologically speaking, and therefore SOPA is not a remedy.  Says we haven't consulted the engineers about the technical implications.

* Darel Issa speaking now: says he doesn't understand why SOPA must regulate IPv4, even though it's an outdated standard.

* Mrs. Jackson-lee speaking now: supports Managers amendment version of SOPA.  Is defending the new version.  Saying nothing specific. Sounds like she's just reading prescripted words.

* Mr. Lungren speaking now: says there are major defects in SOPA.  ""We have not had the benefit of technical experts"".  Says his sources say that SOPA causes ""real troubles"", and will have an adverse impact on cyber-security.

* Mr. Johnson, from Georgia speaking now: Addresses his concern about the lack of technical perspective.  ""Haste makes waste.""  Says there are ""brilliant minds"" in the room that can't respond to the technical aspects, and that concerns him.

* Mr. Issa speaking: ""This is not a new problem, this is not some urgent event like TARP."" ""IP reform didn't happen in 1 congress.""

* My coverage is going to take a break.  Follow EFF and Issa tweets, and the live feed.",,False,,t5_2t3xs,True,,,True,t3_ndrjt,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ndrjt/where_can_we_watch_the_sopa_hearing_live/,

The videos are ~6 minutes each filled with text.  Later videos will have more, but for now, I'm still learning how to make movies and production.  Regardless, Lamar Smith's statement that people are being critical for nothing is a false statement.

Let me be clear here...  The first video was a learning experience and may be more technical than the second video.  The second has a much better flow to it.  It's easier to understand, and shows the reasoning in a better manner.  I'm currently doing last minute edits on the second video.  Both will be updated along with this thread in the morning after a few hours of sleep.

As some of you are aware, for the last 3 months, TestPAC has been working tirelessly to put together a comprehensive campaign to increase awareness about Lamar Smith’s legislative irresponsibility with the ultimate goal of defeating him in the May 29th primary. SOPA may be “dead”, but Lamar Smith is still trying to push through PCIP, another bill which would threaten the privacy of any web user. Think CISPA..but worse.

It’s amazing to see what we have accomplished in the last 3 months. We went from a handful of Redditors passionate in their opposition of SOPA to a membership base of over 1,100 subscribers, we have over 500 followers on Facebook, and almost 600 on Twitter. We have funded a billboard in Lamar’s backyard, produced a professionally done advertisement,  and have been featured in some major media outlets like Mashable, BoingBoing and TheNextWeb.

In addition to all of this, today we are proud to announce the launch of our field campaign.

Boots are on the ground, led by Andy Posterick, TestPAC’s Treasurer who drove 12 hours from Phoenix, AZ to Kerrville, TX to lead a group of 10 volunteers to assist with handing out fliers, putting up signs and interacting with the voters in Lamar’s district. We are stepping out from behind our keyboards and monitors and getting out into the streets. We are making it happen, and we are here in TX-21 every weekend for the next 3 weeks.

Signing petitions and emailing your representative is a crucial first step when bills like SOPA, PCIP and CISPA are being discussed in Congress. However, it doesn’t end there. That isn’t enough. It is our responsibility as supporters of net neutrality, freedom and privacy on the internet to follow through and start holding politicians accountable for their bad legislation. TestPAC was formed as a mechanism to allow average citizens like us to do that.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future, Center For Democracy and Technology and similar 501 non-profits are groups are worthy of our support and are crucial in leading the fight for our internet rights. However, these groups cannot do anything to make our politicians truly scared…they cannot be involved in elections. TestPAC can, and that’s what makes us different.

Most politicians only pay attention to corporations and special interests, and if that’s how things are done what are we to do?
Test PAC was founded on the premise that if politicians listen to special interest groups and PACs, there was nothing stopping us from starting our own to represent what we all believe.

Lamar Smith knows TestPAC is knocking. Several reporters who wrote about us have contacted him and his staff for comment. They know we are out there working to send him home from Washington. Now it’s time that he sees us in his district, connecting with voters and working to send him packing.

Help us run a successful ground campaign by donating for fliers and signs to distribute in Lamar’s backyard. Help us get our commercial on TV by ensuring we raise enough money to make an impact. We have 3 weeks until the primary- this is our last chance.  

This is our last chance to do something about Lamar Smith. We will never have an opportunity like we do now again.

We need you. Please visit www.testpac.org to help us hit $5K on 5 May.

In a nutshell, our version of SOPA, named ""[Ley SINDE](http://www.depepi.com/2011/01/the-new-spanish-digital-inquisition-la-ley-sinde/)"", is a slightly lighter and toned down version. Thanks to [this wikileaks cable](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/how-wikileaks-killed-spains-anti-p2p-law.ars), it suffered a major blow and didn't pass congress approval.

However, once things toned down again and the dust settled, the major political forces managed to recover the law, and it has [recently been formally approved by the new government](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elmundo.es%2Felmundo%2F2011%2F12%2F30%2Fnavegante%2F1325253506.html%3Fcid%3DGNEW970103).

I think it's important to see how internet censorship is creeping up everywhere, not just the states, and how once the opposition gets comfortable and settles, laws that destroy the internet as we understand it are enacted behind our backs.

What can I as a citizen do to stop this? At the moment I'm gathering all the information I can and reading the original legal documents. I've also heard about various movements and organizations that are against this law, so I guess I'll contact them.

----------------------------------

&lt;&lt;&lt;SITE NAME&gt;&gt;&gt;,

As a fellow internet user and avid fan of &lt;&lt;&lt;SITE NAME&gt;&gt;&gt;, I would really appreciate it if you would consider blacking out your website to raise awareness about SOPA / Protect IP / Internet Censorship to your largely politically apathetic userbase on January 18th - the day that Reddit.com, along with many other popular websites, are temporarily shutting down to raise awareness about these bills which threaten to destroy the internet as we know it.

As of now we know of no other pornography website which is planning to blackout on the 18th.  If you were to publicly pledge to participate and condemn internet censorship, I'm sure your company would get a lot of very favorable press from all corners of the internet which should help offset the cost of going offline for a day. 

Even just a splash page that people must click through (without shutting it down) would likely result in enormous positive implications. You have the power to help stop these bills.

Thank you for your time.

----------------------------------

To the management of &lt;&lt;&lt;SITE NAME&gt;&gt;&gt;: 

The ""STOP ONLINE PIRACY ACT"" and ProtectIP bills are a very real threat to your business and almost certainly will be used as a weapon by conservatives &amp; religious types to shut down internet porn sites. You ignore this legislation at your peril.

Please consider joining Wikipedia, Reddit, Craigslist and many other major online sites opposing this law, and please consider joining in on a blackout on Jan 18th 2012 to raise support and awareness of this bill to STOP it from being made into law. 

Please visit http://www.reddit.com/r/sopa for more information, and to join the fight.

While Wikipedia, Google and reddit commanded the news, I wanted to provide some thanks concerning smaller and less mainstream sites not featured by the press. It just goes to show how widespread today’s protest was. These are people to thank and respect. I also provided a few *bigger*, wider known sites who participated, as well a few I felt disappointed by. You may feel differently, so I understand this is only my opinion. This was true at time of writing. Thanks in advance for reading.

[The Oatmeal](http://www.theoatmeal.com) – for not only blacking out but also providing a very funny GIF in protest via the use of Oprah Winfrey and inter-species loving, something that seemed to get a lot of chatter on twitter.

[Explosm](http://www.explosm.net), [SMBC Comics](http://www.smbc-comics.com/), [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com) &amp; [Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php) - all four of these comics were censored completely with no offered work around, all with plenty of links.

[Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) – on first visit, users were greeted with a full, informative page on the issue, with links on how to contribute. On second visit, the homepage was adorned with a large banner and link to the info page, though allowed normal use.

[GOOD](http://www.good.is/) – initially visitors greeted by a lengthy protest page decrying SOPA with many links, which eventually allowed users onward at the bottom of the page.

[PopUrls](http://www.popurls.com) - a lesser known web aggregator that shutdown entirely.

[Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com) -  visitors were greeted by an inescapable black window of protest with requisite links to more info and action, before allowing users to go on.

[Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/) – the boisterous website was 100% shutdown today, offering good links to more coverage.

[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) - for topping their homepage with a prominent and stylish banner condemning the bills, as well as featuring several related articles as today’s headlines that included much information and activism links.

[Wired](http://www.wired.com/) – dominated by a headline article on SOPA, they also pseudo-redacted lines on their home page to simulate censorship; links provided. Very striking.

[SongMeanings](http://www.songmeanings.net) – I was glad to see one of the best lyrics websites on the internet (i.e., they don’t assault you with adverts) blacking out entirely with no workaround, embedding the excellent ‘Break the Internet’ Vimeo video.

[Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/) – absolute blackout with the same Vimeo video as others, with link to EFF’s info page.

[ExtraCreditz](http://www.extra-credits.net/) - for making today's video about the ESA's support for SOPA/PIPA and desire for boycotts thereof in an emotive and defiant manner.

[Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/) – home page included a large banner denouncing the bills, with links to sign petitions and learn more about the issue.

[Oh Internet](http://www.ohinternet.com/) – shut down completely with a link to the petition site.

[TinEye](http://www.tineye.com) – this reverse image search is now totally shutdown for non-commercial users after an initial no-show, great for a site that is defined by its link trawling, potentially illegal activities under SOPA.

[Hype Machine](http://www.hypem.com) – like TinEye, they at first seemed not to be participating. Now the site is showing totally redacted text  making it difficult to use. This site thrives on linking to copyrighted material as a means of promoting band awareness; the site is awash with the stuff amongst remixes and covers. A link at the top provides info, though could have done with a petition link.

[Cracked](http://www.cracked.com/) – massive anti-PIPA badge on entry and a link to the petition site.

[Mojang](http://www.mojang.com/) – “SOPA &amp; PIPA? How about NOPA!”

**Special mention** goes to [YouPorn](http://www.youporn.com) NSFW – while a touch small, the top of the homepage featured a clear banner protesting SOPA, with a link to plenty of information in a blog post  including reddit’s analysis of the issue, and an activism feature. XVideos also blacked out, so take your fapping to these from now on. For some reason, it seemed to take me a while to check this one. Can’t think why.

**On the Fence – sites that reached a middle ground but much welcomed:**


[Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) - Tycho’s post featured some of his thoughts and opposition to the bill – describing it as ‘Satanic’ – as well as an invitation to view Extra Creditz’ piece of the issue. Great to hear. Yet compared to four of the other most popular webcomics out there (see above), they suddenly seemed to be making a lacklustre contribution. I think this is pretty forgivable given how much amazing work they do with other issues, such as Child’s Play, yet I felt a little disappointed.

[TwitPic](http://www.twitpic.com) - after apparently stating their intention to join the protests, their efforts resulted in a small black bar across their top left logo, easily missed by users moving quickly past the front page. Thankfully it led to an informative page with plenty of links, yet it still felt lacking.

[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/) – eventually making protest, their censored logo linked to the EFF petition page, as well as blacking out their advertisements. While admirable, it didn’t really drive home the possible impact on content or provide much context.

[Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com) – I’m a bit confused about this one, so it’s under this heading due to uncertainty. Already in the legal doghouse, a perfect candidate for blackout for awareness raising. Yet the protest page was tucked away in the blog and the site functioned as usual. **Edit:** Been told that they had intermittent statements of censorship when playing songs..

[TVTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage) – bordered with a bold STOP SOPA logo with links to ‘Fight For the Future’. No blacking out.

[UrbanDictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) – while clearly stating their opposition to the bill with an modified logo and protest banner – linking to Google’s info page – I’d hoped they would blackout given that users are free to link images and videos into definitions, a freedom in jeopardy.

[DailyMotion US](http://www.dailymotion.com/us) – in a move that I felt showed up it’s billionaire neighbour across the fence, the site made an impassioned film about SOPA/PIPA their headline video. Let down by not providing links to more info, so relied on active viewer participation. Also, I hope the 500 person view count was just the counter frozen like YouTube does!

[LiveLeak](http://www.liveleak.com/) – blackout logo and a link to AmericanCensorship pages, good but otherwise not much.

[Disqus](http://www.disqus.com), [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/), [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) &amp; [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) – all four provided some form of minor link to their thoughts and to petition sites. Welcome though pretty tame and potentially neglected, though I believe DeviantArt users were able to censor their individual page.

The next list may include entries that you full well knew wouldn’t do anything but I didn’t know. I still think it is good to point out where activity was lacking. Also, correct me where I am wrong.

**A Disappointment:**

[Digg](http://www.digg.com) - despite a small feed to the right of the main page, they could have offered solidarity with the cause by blacking out entirely,  just as our vastly more popular Reddit managed. Other information on the issue was dependent on user voted articles making the front page, with no personal statement.

[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/) – regardless of the fact that they played host to one of the most widely circulated, informative videos on the issue and *even featured it on their homepage* under ‘Videos We Like’, no other mention was made - not even on their blog. This is a site that places itself as an alternative, left-field community, with hundreds of videos that probably use cuts of copyrighted material. I was very disappointed here. **Edit:** Apparently they did feature pop-ups on videos, though I never saw any on my various checks.

[SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com) – I want to believe they were simply unaware of the goings-on. For a site that likewise is massively susceptible to hosting copyrighted media – and is about free expression and creativity – not a single word was offered on the site.

[Megaupload](http://www.megaupload.com) - really? A site already battling against legal attacks featured a tiny link at the bottom of the page, easily overlooked. Instead they preferred to continue packing the homepage with links to what Kim Kardashian and Will.I.Am think about Megaupload. Even if they think that stuff is indirectly helpful, these celebs make no mention of censorship and are simply ‘big ups’ from C-list entertainers.

[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) – this is a site that had voiced it’s opposition in [November](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/stop-the-stop-online-piracy-act), yet seemingly forgot to act as well today. For a community dedicated to the birth of independent entrepreneurs via the web, they expressed no active unity with the cause.

[SomethingAwful](http://www.somethingawful.com/) – even though being a long standing community and once significant contributor to internet culture, the site remained totally vacant of SOPA/PIPA.

I’m sure there are many more out there – both bad and good - but these are the ones I came across and have room for. More welcome below.

It's all about money, so why don't we don't we start boycotting the goods and services of the companies that support SOPA.  They sent a [letter to congress](http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/sites/default/files/pressreleases/letter-359.pdf).  I will start boycotting these things immediately and I plan to contact each company to inform them of that.

Edit: Here's links to contact info for each company.  Try to make your message make sense.  If you're not a lawyer, don't threaten to boycott a company that makes law practice software.  It's better to tell them that you're disappointed in their decision to support SOPA and that you will tell anyone who will listen about their attack on free speech.  Maybe even mention that you'll tweet about it or post their decision on your Facebook page.

Edit: I recommend doing the following.  Be polite, and call each of the companies.  Tell them you're calling because you found out they signed a letter to congress in support of SOPA.  You are very disappointed in their support for legislation that attacks freedom of speech.  Let them know you've decided to discontinue using their products until they actively withdraw their support of the legislation.  If you use their products regularly already, be sure to mention the product specifically so they know you're not just giving them lip service.  Also let them know that you will be tweeting and Facebook'ing about their support of SOPA so everyone you know will be aware of it.  Thank them for their time and end the call.  If you can follow up with a written letter, that is extremely effective too.

**EDIT:**

I'm reaching the limit of this box, so I'm putting everything below and the other companies in a [**GOOGLE DOCS FILE**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjisu18X6s7lPtAsIQg5Ol3KJjymPT2az1kasQVwGiw/edit)

I'll be editing it there from now on.


**EDIT:**
It has been suggested that you reward organizations and businesses that oppose SOPA and Protect IP.  Here's [a link](http://www.cdt.org/report/list-organizations-and-individuals-opposing-sopa).  That's a good idea.  Be sure you let them know you appreciate them doing the right thing.  Make the association for them.

After reading the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/01/11/reddits-sopa-blackout-admirable-but-google-and-facebook-must-follow/) about Facebook and Google's (hopeful) participation in a site blackout, it became very apparent to me that these two sites are vital to gaining ground for our cause.

Facebook recently launched the option to display a large banner sized profile image at the top of your profile, which they call the [new timeline](http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline). Starting Jan 18th, this feature will be turned on by default for all profile pages across facebook. But it can be enabled today by clicking ""Get Timeline"" at the bottom of the screen from the above link.

I think that this can be used to display a large banner to inform people about where they can get information on SOPA and general message to contact their congressmen/woman. 

Imagine that 5 of your friends see this message and add the image themselves. Perhaps 5 of their friends see it and *they* add the image. We could have a serious [Haley Joel Osment situation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=DvKAPHvCPS8#t=20s) on our hands!

I've made a banner, which you can [find here](http://i.imgur.com/iFI7b.png), so you can add it to your timeline if you want. If you have an idea about how this can be improved, let me know!

Also, I think it would be cool to make state specific banners that show that states congress peoples phone numbers and email addresses so that it can have even more impact.


**TL;DR: I made a banner to add to your Facebook timeline that will hopefully spread awareness about SOPA. **

So, what do you say Reddit, you with me?

**EDIT 1:** Alt color scheme: http://i.imgur.com/lv0C0.png

**EDIT 2:** Thanks for the support everyone! Tomorrow I will be making a profile picture to go along with the banner as well as a Twitter background for folks that don't have Facebook.

Originally I considered linking directly to the bill, but unfortunately I didn't feel like the majority of people would read it and if they did, to read it fully and comprehend it. If you feel like the demographic of your friends *would* read it and *would* understand it then I will be happy to make another version that links to the bill. If you would like to link it elsewhere, let me know and I'll make that happen too!

**EDIT 3:** As promised, here is a Twitter background for the folks who don't rock faces with books: http://i.imgur.com/sNv4i.png As suggested, I changed the url to direct to the wikipedia page on SOPA. There is loads of easily digestible information there. 

Tip: Be sure to set your background color to black so that it fades seamlessly. I will try to get to the Facbook profile image shortly! ",,False,,t5_2t3xs,True,,,True,t3_octfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/octfr/if_facebook_wont_blackout_raise_awareness/,

(x-post),Differcult,302,49,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nhyu7/lets_stop_sopa_the_correct_way_idiots_guide_on/,"People. Lets be real, no amount of online petitions or e-mails will do anything to change what our representatives do and do not know about SOPA. You must either call or meet your representatives. The fact is most don't even know what SOPA is yet, this will change if it makes it out of committee and to the floor! Let YOUR voice be heard and help influence their decisions by calling and speaking to them.

Now the odds are you will not speak directly to your representatives...THIS IS OK...their aides generally do a great deal of research for them and help them make key decisions on votes. 

**Contacting your representatives is easy!**

[Contact your Represenative by using the EFF zip Code look up tool.](https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8336) - All you have to do is enter your zip code in the box on the right and hit ""Submit Zip"". Your representatives information will be displayed, then all you have to do is CALL THEM!

[Contact your Senator by using this look up tool.](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) - Simply select your state from the drop box on the left. CALL BOTH OF THEM!

**How long will this take?**

3-5 Minutes per representative if you keep to simple talking points. 9 - 15 minutes for all 3 representatives.

**Will my representative actually listen?**

YES!...Well maybe. Most have no idea what SOPA is. Mine didn't, his aide had some ideas but not a clear understanding. But that is beyond the point, he now knows someone in his district cares about this bill being defeated. I HIGHLY DOUBT ANYONE IS GOING TO CALL IN TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. The more negativeness this bill generates, the better.

**What are some talking points?** 

I would recommend reading up a little on SOPA, as it has changed in the past few weeks from its original version.
[The EFF has this PDF with a very basic summary of the bill.](https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/One-Page-SOPA_0.pdf)

I also talked to my representative and his aide a lot about the current abuse of DMCA take down notices and the whole Bit torrent lawsuit trolling scam. Showing how even the DMCA is being abused, imagine what would happen with the powers SOPA allows.

DreamHost came to this conclusion after first hearing of the bill in late 2011 and has never wavered in its opposition. SOPA was, and is, a raw deal for free speech on the Internet.

Web sites like YouTube, Wikipedia, Twitter, and any other sites that rely on user-generated content would be at risk of immediate shutdown should SOPA become law. It would make website owners liable for the content that its users post, impose strict punishments for vague definitions of piracy, and allow rights-holders to demand the immediate shutdown of entire domain names based on mere claims of rights infringement. The overhead needed to police this new law would make inexpensive web hosting a thing of the past.

When DreamHost employees were first told of SOPA and its potentially devastating impact on customers, there was stunned silence, followed by raucous laughter, followed by a very uneasy silence, followed by much shouting.

“So let me get this straight,” questioned Tech Support team leader Oscar Padilla after reading through the proposed legislation. “If a customer has a blog and someone posts a comment on that blog that a large company with influence isn’t happy about, that company can just contact the US Government, who then contacts DreamHost to have their blog shut down?”

“The way it’s written,” explained Robert, the DreamHost Abuse Team Specialist, “Yes.”

“So the complaining company needs to prove its copyright claims to the Government?” pressed Padilla, “Or to DreamHost?”

Taking one forlorn long look across the room, Robert lowered his gaze and said quietly: “Nobody. They answer to nobody. Rights-holders need only claim copyright infringement — they’re not obligated to prove that any actual infringement has taken place. They literally can just file off a form letter to the US government to have content removed. And it’s not enough for us to just remove the contested content — we would need to take entire domains offline or WE could be held liable too.”

“SOPA changes the way the Internet works, and not in a good way,” said DreamHost CEO Simon Anderson. “It undermines the freedom of expression enjoyed by all Americans online, and removes the safe harbor protecting web hosts established by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). SOPA will create uncertainty for American entrepreneurs and stifle innovation, hurting American jobs and investment at exactly the time when the economy needs a boost from small businesses. We’re part of a coalition of leading web and Internet companies asking that Congress do the right thing and reject SOPA. It’s a flawed concept that is not in line with American values.”

DreamHost is a member of the [Save Hosting Coalition](http://savehosting.org/) a group of web hosts united in their opposition to SOPA and PIPA, a sister bill proposed by the US Senate.

&gt; Hi Jimmy,

&gt;I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Reddit is capable of doing giant things, GoDaddy for example. But it seems as if the internet is only boycotting GoDaddy because they (godaddy) actually rely on the internet that they are ruining for profits. There are a great number of posts on reddit calling for action and a larger boycott of all the companies backing SOPA, but they are getting lost in the static. So I ask you to write one more personal appeal calling for action. As a internet celebrity of sorts, and a figurehead for free speech I feel as if your words would be taken less lightly and people across the globe might get on the same page so to speak.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for everything you do, a concerned internet addict.


And his reply:

&gt;I think it's worth taking a step back and thinking about what we can 
accomplish and how we can win this thing. The boycott and back down of 
Go Daddy was important - it got the Internet community organized to 
start doing something. But the support of one company doesn't make or 
break SOPA - indeed, the support of whatever companies doesn't make or 
break SOPA - what does is awakening the general public and activating 
them to call, write, or visit their Congressperson.

&gt;Many of the companies on the list of supporters do, in fact, have 
legitimate beefs with the current situation. Particularly for companies 
like Chanel, Coach, Juicy Couture, etc. - they face a daily problem with 
counterfeit merchandise sold via foreign websites. Boycotting them 
would be counter-productive because they are rightly considered by the 
public to be victims here.

&gt;My issue is not with working to crack down on counterfeit goods, 
trademark infringement, copyright infringement, etc. My issue is that 
the bill attempts to do so in a way that is inconsistent with the First 
Amendment and that the bill is technologically incompetent.

&gt;A boycott against companies who are not tech companies (and who 
therefore, unlike Go Daddy, can't be expected to understand the 
technical issues) in this context runs the risk of the entire anti-SOPA 
movement being branded unfairly as not caring about the real problems.

&gt;So Go Daddy backed down - and Congress watched that play out. The next 
thing is not to hammer on other companies, but to hammer on Congress 
directly. I've been told that if I can get 30,000-40,000 people to call 
or write their Congressional representative, it will have an impact. My 
view is that 30,000-40,000 is *easy*. We should be aiming much higher.

&gt;But to do that we have to get people off their butts to do the right 
thing. A lot of people! I think we can!

&gt;--Jimbo

Wise words. 

I can submit a screenshot for proof if need be.

* Read a classic

In particular, **suggestions for FAQ entries would be greatly appreciated.** Note that we're purposely keeping it as minimal as we can while still getting sufficient information as to the ""why"" and the ""how"" of everything.

Following all the news since [last week's announcement](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html) has been intense. As an arbitrarily short summary of events (in no particular order):

* The White House has [made statements](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet) calling for more ""sound legislation"" than what PROTECT IP and SOPA propose
* The [DNS portions of the bills](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/internet-blacklist-power-to-be-stripped-from-senates-protect-ip-act.ars) are under ""reconsideration"" and may be removed.
* SOPA itself *may* have been ""delayed,"" [though I'm unclear](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/01/16/businessinsiderno-sopa-is-not-dead-.DTL) on whether that's actually the case.
* Hundreds of sites have [decided to join reddit in the blackout](http://sopastrike.com/). Sites big and small, such as:
    * Wikipedia
    * [imgur](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/01/16/imgur-joins-blackout/)
    * Good Ol' Games
    * Destructoid
    * Free Software Foundation
    * Minecraft
    * Wordpress
    * The Cheezburger Network
    * Mozilla
    * Too many more to list them all here - see [sopastrike.com](http://sopastrike.com/) for a full list of verified and unverified sites

The fight is still far from over, and there's still a huge public benefit to blacking out in terms of getting the word out! For sites planning to black out, here are some resources for blackout day:

* [sopastrike.com](http://sopastrike.com/) has some ideas, and will have banners and other resources available before the 18th
* [sopablackout.org](http://sopablackout.org/) has simple javascript for creating a blackout overlay, and links to a Wordpress plugin
* [blackoutsopa.org](http://www.blackoutsopa.org/) has resources for changing your Twitter / Facebook profile in protest.
* EquanimousMind and Inuma are [running a facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/events/366829326666319/) aimed at spreading the word during the blackout.
* I'm no fan of ""SEO,"" but blackouts could muck up your results on google and with other crawlers. [Read here for info on how to avoid long-term effects](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=13f98d6e7c7a67e2&amp;hl=en)

EDIT 2: [Updated response to ""Why 12 hours?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ol5xz/reddit_go_down_for_24_hours_like_everyone_else_12/c3i6yqt)

Myself and the rest of the admins just discussed this. We definitely appreciate the sentiment of wanting reddit to ""match"" other sites' 24 hour blackouts. If we had anticipated the full effect our initial announcement had, we might have planned for 24 hours initially. However, we're sticking with a 12 hour, 8 AM EST to 8 PM EST (5 AM to 5 PM PST) blackout for the following reasons:

* Our peak traffic is during working hours in U.S. timezones. We have the maximum impact by blacking out during the time period slotted
* Coming back up in the evening provides an opportunity to discuss the day's events on reddit
* The 12 hour timeslot minimizes (though of course, doesn't eliminate) the impact on non-U.S. redditors. Yes, PIPA and SOPA will have international repercussions should they pass, but there's only so much that non-U.S. redditors can do.
* In terms of preparation, it would be very difficult (not impossible, but difficult) to change our timeline now. That's the least important reason/excuse not to shift, but it's part of the considerations",,False,,t5_2t3xs,True,,,True,t3_ojypk,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ojypk/reddit_sopa_blackout_day_preview_faq_feedback/,admin

While the intention was good, this list is a bad thing.

Guys, I'm a systems administrator overseeing systems that host some of the largest Web sites in the world. I administer the computers that you connect to as you surf the Internet. Please, hear my plea. If you use the emergency list as of today, your Internet will very likely *break* and you will *not* understand why. I am urging you to be aware of the list's existence but do *nothing* with it until something awful happens.

If you have trouble following the list's directions in the first place, you will have no idea what's going on when the list causes your shit to stop working.

Administrators like us need to change IP addresses frequently. Whether we're doing failover, a facility move, or just rotating out servers and equipment, sometimes an IP address needs to change. Since the only method of accessing us that we support publicly is through the domain name system, we typically don't give any thought to throwing away an IP and reusing it elsewhere. (Behind the scenes of your typical Web browsing, IP addresses are actually a scarce commodity. Many of us are giving some back to be given to other people.)

If you put these entries in your system's static hosts file, you will forget about them. Then, when we update, you will have no idea why sites stopped working. Please, do not use this list until SOPA is **passed**, **implemented**, and **something actually happens**. Realistically, the earliest this could happen is probably 2014 or even later. There is absolutely no reason to use this list on your computer today. None.

To compound this problem, every site that does more than Joe's Trinkets level of traffic worldwide very likely uses a caching CDN, and the IP address you get when you ping naively is absolutely worthless. It's almost certainly a CDN server located very near you geographically, and if you copy an address from that list without knowing what you're doing, there's a pretty good chance the performance of your Internet will drop across the board. *Particularly* if you fuck with Google, Reddit, and so on.

In the unlikely event that you actually have to use this list, *please* only put sites that stopped working in your hosts file to minimize potential problems.

TL;DR If you use the emergency list today, there's a fairly good chance Web sites will randomly stop working in a matter of hours to days, and you will not know why or what to do. **If you do not know what you are doing, the emergency list can and very likely will break your Web browsing.**

I am the CEO of a company that runs a popular VOD streaming site similar to Netflix Streaming or Amazon VOD. We have deals with a few studios and I know pretty well how this business operates. We are obviously very much affected by online piracy.

That said, SOPA is a terrible terrible bill that I (and everyone in my company) am strongly against because it's NOT the way you fight piracy. Blocking sites or content will NEVER work. Ever. Period. Worst comes to worst, people will just resort to Sneakernet. The only way to fight piracy is by offering a better service/product at a reasonable price. There will ALWAYS be people that pirate, that's a given. But by offering a good service/product you absolutely can have a majority of people purchase content legitimately.

SOPA will not work. SOPA threatens a helluva lot more than it will possibly gain for the RIAA/MPAA (which will not be a lot) and it needs to die right now.

If I were in USA I would be calling my congressman right now and doing whatever I can to stop this. And I'm a person that is pretty much the most affected by piracy. That should tell you a lot.

Demand the complete opposite. Demand SOPA to be replaced with INTERNET FREEDOM related bills.

Stopping SOPA is delaying the inevitable; they'll keep doing it until there's protest fatigue and it'll be easier to make compromises that will still lead to [less internet freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique) (SOPA Lite). Especially when they'll keep presenting such bills to less internet freedom.

Having INTERNET FREEDOM bills will not only stop SOPA-like bills, but it will mean politicians will have to abolish INTERNET FREEDOM bills to pass SOPA-like bills.

Tell Mozilla, Google, Facebook, Reddit, etc to change their title from ""STOP SOPA"" to ""REPLACE SOPA WITH INTERNET FREEDOM"".

This post is the appeal to the reddit community, from his direct D-21 challenger, Candace Duval. After the District 21 primaries, Candace emerged as the Democratic challenger, the only hope in removing him from office. We hope that the reddit community can actively stand behind Candace, as she supports no censorship of the internet or censoring people's intellectual property on the internet. The first step in taking the father of SOPA away, is to ensure he is not re-elected.

Back to government class we go.

A bill can be submitted by any member of congress and can be co-sponsored by other members (basically, the helped form the bill with the author).  This bill is then submitted to a committee for consideration depending on whether a member of the House or Senate submitted the bill.  If a house member sumbitted, it goes to a house committee (where we are at right now), and the opposite for a member of the Senate.

The bill can remain in committee for an indefinite amount of time until passed or defeated.  Hearings are often held where members of the committee are able to ask questions of experts in the fields that relate to the bill being discussed.  Amedments may be offered by any member.  Amendments are things that modify the bill or add something to it.  After getting through all hearings and amendments, the committee votes on whether or not to pass the bill on to the House or Senate (in the case of SOPA, it would go to the House).

At this point, the bill would go on to the Rules Committee of the House, which can determine if any newly submitted amendments should be debated on the floor, and can set the time limit for debates in regard to each bill.  If the bill passes the House, it would then move on to a senate committee, then the Senate floor.   The Senate would then debate the bill (no time constraints in the Senate).

Once it passes the Senate, the bill is sent to a conference committee (combination of House and Senate members) to work out differences between the two versions of the bill.  Once this is done, it sent back to both houses for final approval.

Once it passes both the House and Senate, it is sent to the President for approval.  Signing it puts it into law, whereas a veto sends it back to the House and Senate.  At this point, no more amendments are allowed.  A debate is had, and the members vote.  If there are 2/3 or more in the affirmative in both the House and Senate, the veto can be overridden and be passed into law despite the Presidental veto.

If you have any questions, regarding bill progression, parliamentary procedure, or anything related, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer.

&gt;""Dear [company name here].

&gt;I am writing to you regarding the looming threat of H.R.3261, otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act. This is a bill that would allow corporations to freely request takedowns of websites they feel are infringing on their copyright – for almost any reason. It would allow the Government of the United States to censor the internet almost freely. If abused, this bill could choke out political dissatisfaction, new business startups, creativity, protests against oppression, and worse.

&gt;As of today, your company is supporting this bill both morally and economically. While you may see H.R. 3261 as a step in the right direction to protecting your intellectual properties, I want to make sure that you understand what the horrifying implications of SOPA are. I wholeheartedly agree that creativity and trademarked goods should be protected, but I am shocked that anyone would see this gross violation of freedom of speech as a viable way to do this.

&gt;As a supporter of basic rights of expression and freedom, I, [your name here], request that you reconsider your stance on the Stop Online Piracy Act. This is a bill that would fundamentally damage the Internet that is used - every day - to disseminate important news and information to millions of people. A strike to this structure would be a strike to the very society we live in today. 

&gt;I also want you to know that I’ve been an avid customer of [company name here] in the past; however, if this bill passes with your backing, my views of your company would be damaged forever, and I would be morally obliged to inform my peers of your stance on basic human freedom – and the implications of handing over their money to you.

&gt;With hopes for a better future;

&gt;[your name here]""

God this woman is a superhero. 

----
*  Lungren once again stating ""take this slowly, talk to experts, there is no reason NOT to""
*  Issa is supporting bringing experts (or nerds(go Chaffetz!)) of course...
*  Mr Watts claiming he hasn't been bought off by saying everyone else has been bought off... 
*  Mr. Watts goes on to say that ""hearing experts won't solve anything"" and that the people involved have enough money to get experts to come in on both sides.
*  Mr. Watts is speaking out of his ass...Completely underplaying the importance of this hearing by saying ""No one is going to get serious about this until we DO have a bill"" and supports just passing it.
*  Mrs Waters tells the chairman ""JUST MOVE THIS ALONG SO WE DON'T WASTE OUR TIME""
*  Mr. Poe mentions the detainee act in saying ""people probably wanted more time"", goes on to say ""we should have more time on this and there is nothing wrong with more time""
*  Chaffetz asking for 7 legislature days, stating ""we can NOT get this wrong, there is nothing magical happening before christmas, there is no reason to rush things"". Pleadingly asks to ""get this right""

*  **Mrs Johnson (?) just called out Mr. King for his tweet ""Discussing SOPA, browsing the internet to waste time""**
*  **Mr. King wants Mrs. Johnson to take back her words, she goes ""You can cancel this hearing cause I ain't taking them back"".**
*  Mr. Sanchez is back, relating to the bill by saying he has been hurt by piracy personally. Goes on to say ""everyone is agreeing to reduce piracy"" but says ""the internet is already policed"". Explains how different technologies can help commit crimes. Goes on to say **parts of this bill are offensive**.
*  Mr Sanchez: Relates ""Crackhouse: we wouldn't take it down, but we would just block all the surrounding roads, making it harder to get ANYWHERE...but still leaving the crackhouse up""
*  **They are voting for something, I didn't catch it... But Issa voted Aye, Lofgren voted Aye, Jackson Lee Aye, Waters no, Quiglee Aye, Deutch No, Sanchez No, Polis Aye -- Gomer No, Jordan Aye, Chairman No, Colvin No, Johnson Aye, Chu No, Conners No -- I missed a few votes... 12 aye, 22 nay. Amendment is NOT agreed to.**

I did not catch WHAT Amendment they voted on, someone please inform me?

*  Lofgren citing ANOTHER source saying that this would impair national + cyber security. This makes like 7?
*  Lofgren offering another Amendment -- goes on to say it isn't proper for district courts to vote on this, but rather EVERYONE (Intelligence, Armed Service, Homeland Security, few others I missed) -- Mentions Dec. 9th letter from people objecting to the analysis provided by a proponent.
*  Issa is supporting Lofgren -- If this is going to hurt something we DONT KNOW, we should certainly have a clause that says 'we agree to do no harm'. Asks if Chairman is going to accept this, Chairman says **NO**. 
*  Issa continues on his crusade of ""If we are going to do harm, why the fuck would we do it?"" (paraphrase)
*  **I can't keep this updated any longer, atleast not for the time being. Let it be known that Issa, Sanchez, Lofgren, Chaffetz are ALL BADASSES**

-- 

I had to run out and I only managed to catch the ending of today... There was almost an agreement made to make a change in the bill after some rewording, but aside from that nothing else happened.

1326935106.0,108,self.SOPA,omcp7,The lesson that Washington will take away from today's successful blackout.,nosecohn,124,16,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/omcp7/the_lesson_that_washington_will_take_away_from/,"Here's the lesson that corporate lobbyists and Washington elites will take away from the success of Wednesday's coordinated blackout:

&gt; The internet-driven protest movement in the US is no longer anything to scoff at... and therefore must be manipulated so that this kind of wrench can never again be thrown in the power brokers' machinery.

&gt;For a while, we were able to dismiss certain groups as powerless, misguided teens; to discount hyperbolic email campaigns as a meaningless fringe; and to look at technology-enabled protests overseas as unique to those locales. But no more. It has now been shown that the technology sector has significant power if it unites, and that the masses in the US can use this technology to affect real change, derailing our plans and disrupting the profitability models of our clients. Now that we're awake to this reality, we must ensure that this debacle is never repeated.

I expect multiple fronts to be opened or expanded...

1. Astroturfing, [already very widespread](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing), will increase tremendously. Public relations firms are paid handsomely for their ability to convince the American public to support what's good for their clients. Money will start pouring money in to such firms who specifically target online media.
1. They will seek to divide. Divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the book, and it's already used to great effect in American politics via the two-party system. Look for people to start bringing up ""wedge"" issues that can divide the power of the tech-centric world. Imagine if they had been able to convince half the opponents of SOPA/PIPA that perhaps it wasn't bad enough to participate in a boycott. Imagine if they'd been able to convince those who use the technology that they should be opposed to those who create/manage the technology. The whole thing would have collapsed if there was even slightly more internal conflict.
1. They will manipulate the timeframe. Don't expect potentially controversial legislation to have this much time for debate in the future. The most controversial provisions will be introduced as last-minute addenda to otherwise innocuous-sounding bills so that there isn't a chance for momentum to build in the opposition online.
1. Attempts will be made to discredit the major players. Expect to see negative publicity campaigns impugning the virtue and motivations of the companies who supported this blackout. [It has already begun](http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/18/chris-dodd-sopa-blackout-is-an-abuse-of-power/).

The vocal opposition to these bills clearly caught Washington by surprise. But as Japanese Admiral Yamamoto said after learning of the successful attack on Pearl Harbor, ""I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""

People like Chris Dodd have spent decades building their influence within government's hierarchical paradigm. They're not about to relinquish that power to a bunch of faceless nobodies.

I hope everyone is prepared for the considerable pushback that is to come.

GD asked me why I left them.

I told them it was because:

1. They hide their toll-free number to avoid paying LD charges (but they have no issues with unrelated SuperBowl ads)

2. Their upsell process is so incredibly fucking annoying it makes me want to bitch-slap my computer screen

3. Their servers are excessively slow

4. I've actually had technical service tell me they had to let me go because they had no idea how to solve a server error on their end.

After that I asked them if the whole SOPA fiasco had them losing a lot of people over the past couple of days.

THE ANSWER?

""Actually, not that many...it's most a misunderstanding and I believe the people on Reddit got their facts wrong and overlooked some crucial details.""

REALLY?

Then I called HostGator about one of my sites and while on the line, I asked the agent about the GD SOPA migration.

His response?

""HG had to call in extra staff to handle the volume - we didn't get everyone of GD's old customers, but the volume of inquiries about our service has been crazy and a lot of people are extremely upset with the whole SOPA thing.""

If you think I could post it elsewhere and get better results I will remove this and post it there.

I unfortunately kept up with sopa and acta at first, but after it died down I didn't watch any news articles for it. But this means I have a lot of knowlegde compared to what the kids in my class know about this topic (probably my teacher as well). Which means ill need a lot of sources, because nothing will really be bg info. 

Its only a highschool research paper, but I'm going to have to be talking about sopa acta and any other ways the government has censored our internet for five pages. 

So it. It possible that anyone has good articles from online newspapers and sources that are mostly neutral on the topic. (like not lobbying against sopa etc) honestly the more info you can hand me the better. Wiki unfortunately is not a reliable source. So no wiki links? :)

And sorry for any typos. I'm actually in my english class on my phone right now.

May I discuss some details with you, Reddit?",JohnFappityFapster1,123,19,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/sjzn1/both_google_and_facebook_support_cispa_were_their/,"On r/SOPA and r/evolution, I've seen posts on ideas to kill the CISPA bill before it's passed and wreaks havoc on the internet. But I'm not reading any posts to make a simple and direct protest for friends/family to protest CISPA. So here it is:

On Facebook, right now, put ""Google and Facebook want to sell YOUR information to companies and let the U.S Government spy on every word you type or post. If you agree with this post, repost it and delete your Facebook and Google accounts"" Then post this link to Diaspora: https://diasp.org/ and explain in steps to how to sign-up:
1. Click on sign-up at the top of the page 
2. Fill out your info for a network where you control your info
3. Set up your profile picture, as with Facebook or any social networking site
4. ???
5. Profit!

Now remember, Reddit: Our strategy is different this time around. SOPA was threatening to Capital Hill because we were organized with our calling, emails, and raising our voices to creative and open censorship of sharing content. CISPA, however, is a fight for controlling our information and not allowing our overlords of ineptitude and ignorance to sell it like they would a manufactored product. So, be sure to also tell your friends and family to use DuckDuckGo.com as their main search engine. If Google wants to fail hard with support in CISPA and lose their power, that's their choice. 

TL;DR Make a simple message on Facebook/Google to transfer all accounts to Diaspora. Also, be sure to click the upper right-hand icon for a default search and change to DuckDuckGo. Good luck, friends!

So I met this lady, Miss Duval at a volunteer function sponsored by Democrats.  I want to do my part in politics and be involved in the government of my country, but I had really not been excited about doing ""volunteer"" work.  Anyhow, I pulled myself out of my funk and went to do some civic volunteer work.

First lady I meet is Candace.  She's really nice, happy, talkative, and wearing all kinds phat silver Texas jewelry.  (I love silver Texas-style jewelry.)

This is my favorite quote from her, ""All my life I just wanted to be a public servant, so I decided that I was just gonna do it!""

You go girl!  The volunteer work I signed up for wasn't nearly as boring as I thought it would be--in fact in turned out pretty good!

Well buddy, it was fun while it lasted. So before SOPA passes, I figure that now is as good a time as any to say goodbye, before it's too late. Maybe people will read this, maybe they won't, but hopefully they'll still be able to. 

You've been a constant companion for us all for years now, and we've grown to know you well. You've been there to kill time and to save it. You've brought us uncensored news from foreign lands, and music from unheard of artists. You've settled arguments, and put a world of facts at our fingertips and in our pockets. Documents from a century ago, movies we've never heard of, programs that top anything Microsoft or Apple put out, you brought them all to us. You're Red from *Shawshank Redemption*, the “man who can get it for you”, and we're very grateful. No matter how stupid the YouTube comments got, or how deranged the humor was, we still needed you, and every time you came through for us, we really did appreciate you. 

Maybe it won't be that bad; maybe the government will be as bad at censoring you as it has been at everything else it's tried to control. Millions of people every day drink underage, paint graffiti, smoke weed, explore abandoned buildings, drive over the speed limit, and commit hundreds of other little trespasses every day without really worrying about getting caught. Maybe SOPA will end up as a laughingstock, an unenforceable daydream that the American people refer to with a wink and a nudge. Americans have proven time and again that we are an innovative bunch, and we will find the holes in any law we deem unjust. Prohibition tried to outlaw something Americans loved, so they worked around it until Washington realized how foolish it looked, with rum-runners and gangsters raking in the profits while legal distillers who *didn't* go around shooting up cities were put out of business. Eventually, Washington folded under the pressure.

If we're lucky, SOPA won't change you as much as we're afraid it might. We'll find ways around, and things will be like they were. But they won't be the same. We'll be afraid of getting caught, and you won't have the strength you used to. You'll be a mere shell of your former self.

Eventually, the Government will hopefully realize what a mistake SOPA is. But I'm afraid of what's going to happen in the meantime. In the meantime, the American people will loose access to thousands of services we enjoy, and instead of paying gangsters for what we want, we'll have to pay corporations. Any time we want to watch the “Say 'what' again” scene from *Pulp Fiction*, we better be ready to shell out for the whole DVD. Any time we want to make a music video with your friends, we better not try sharing it, 'cause someone already owns that song. Any time we want to caption an image on memgenerator.com, we better pray no one has copyrights on the picture. Any time we want to watch an obscure Dr. Who episode, or an old movie no longer in print, we're just shit outta luck. Shell Out or Shut Up will be the whole of the law. 

I'm sorry, Internet. I'm sorry it's come to this. I'm sorry the Government thinks it has to fear and control things it doesn't understand. I'm sorry the needs of the many for knowledge, expression, and experience has been overpowered by the greed of the few for power and money. We will fight as hard and as long as we have to to get you back, and one day we will. In the meantime, please don't hate us, and know that we never wanted it to be this way.

Goodnight and Good Luck.",,False,,t5_2t3xs,False,,,True,t3_ne9bg,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ne9bg/a_farewell_letter_to_the_internet/,

I have to say I feel very betrayed by the SOPA act. I completely oppose everything it stands for. We as a people don’t have much freedom anymore even though we are completely brainwashed into thinking we do. The internet for me is more than just a place to watch other people sing lady gaga songs on YouTube, the internet is where I find multiple links to many different sources of information worldwide. Not just one point of view, but many and all of the opinions of the “people” that come with it. I do not have cable nor do I support its “censored” television programs. Please don’t let this bill pass. I feel as though the voice of the people doesn’t matter anymore, and if this bill passes many people will feel the same, if they don’t already. This bill will put a muzzle on every American, no more creativity or free expression online. All we will get is government censored websites and we will be able to research things only the government deems worthy to know. Money isn’t the most important thing in the world, freedom is, the kind of freedom our ancestors died for, the freedoms this country was founded upon, the idea that every man woman and child can live free, those values have been skewed. The SOPA bill affects a lot more than protecting big companies and their intellectual property. It goes to the point where it will censor all countries not in the United States from displaying their website to us and ours to them. What this means is that the United States will be cut off from all forms of communication. This will allow our government to censor and filter all info that is obtained via the internet in the United States. This is not freedom; it is a step above being a prisoner of the state. You will see what government tells you to see, you learn what they tell you to learn, you will read what you are allowed to read, it is a step above wearing an orange jumpsuit and living in a cell block with other members of society who have failed to follow the governments’ censorships. Your friends, your family, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, everyone knows somebody who has violated what the SOPA bill is trying to achieve, whether they knew it or not. All of those people will soon be considered felons regardless of social status and contributions to society. How is that freedom? Why would the United States of America, a country founded upon the ideal of freedom of speech and action, pass a law that is intended to cripple the voice of the people. Even if there is no way to stop the SOPA bill it must be amended. It cannot be allowed to take away essential freedoms from every United States American citizen. Piracy is one thing, internet censorship is an entirely different matter, and these are not related in any way and should not be grouped as such. It is your job as a representative of the people to protect the rights and freedoms of American citizens. Please do your job and do not allow this bill to pass. I feel very betrayed and hurt by my own home that is supposedly free.

WHAT IS MEGAUPLOAD'S STANCE TOWARDS ABUSE?
Recently, we have drawn some flak over our sites allegedly serving the sole purpose of mass copyright breach. Since some of the allegations are grotesquely overblown, we would like to put things into perspective.

Megaupload is a so-called ""cyberlocker"" and allows its users to conveniently store and transmit any kind of data from anywhere, to anywhere. We provide connectivity between end users and storage capacity in the cloud, but no content - just like e.g. ADSL providers and hard drive vendors. As such, Megaupload provides a multi-use tool, just like an e-mail account, a USB stick, or the Internet as a whole - it can be used for legitimate and illegitimate purposes alike. In fact, most public Internet services, including backbone carriers, could not exist if the law did not protect them from liability for abuse committed by their users, as long as they fulfill specific requirements, such as the timely processing of abuse notices. Furthermore, legal (ECPA) and technical (encryption, obfuscation) provisions exist that make it both illegal and pointless for a service provider to eavesdrop on the communication traversing their facilities.

On the legal side, we are setting very clear guidelines to our users. Activity that violates our terms of service or our acceptable use policy is not tolerated, and we go to great lengths to swiftly process legitimate DMCA takedown notices. We also cooperate closely with rightsholders and their copyright enforcement agents and provide them with direct realtime takedown access, bypassing the DMCA process entirely. Because we strictly conform to all legal requirements, nobody has successfully sued us over copyright infringement, and cases brought forward against our competitors have a long history of being unsuccessful.

We operate one of the world's largest storage clusters, securely hosting billions of user files totaling over 100 petabytes, and our per-file download counters indicate that the vast majority of uploads are accessed less than 10 times during their lifetime - this hardly justifies the accusations of ""mass infringement"" that our users have recently come under. Of course, abuse does happen and is an inevitable fact of life in a free society, but it is curbed heavily and efficiently by our close cooperation with trusted takedown partners. It is just unfortunate that the activities of a small group of ""black sheep"" overshadows the millions of users that use our sites legitimately every day.

Mega has over 150 million registered users and over 50 million daily unique visitors. Employees of over 70% of the world's Fortune 500 companies have accounts with us. We have become the de-facto standard for sending files that are too big to email. We are the most popular hard disk in the cloud. We host more backups than any other company. If Mega is a rogue operator as we have been unfairly labelled by the MPAA and RIAA, then what about Google? What about Yahoo? And every single ISP? At any given time, they all host pirated, illegal or even criminal content for which they are not liable nor legally obliged to prevent their users from posting. They are, like Megaupload, online service providers who are in no position to monitor or restrict their users. activities. There are technical, practical and legal reasons why these entities as a whole enjoy safe harbor protection all over the world. Service providers like Megaupload are simply better off focusing on providing a better service to their customers than fending off lawsuits from third parties unhappy about content.

That said, all service providers have to deal with the challenge of online piracy, just like us. Google probably hosts the world's largest index of pirated content and yet no one has characterized them as rogue. Why not sue the manufacturers of external USB hard drives or burnable DVDs? They can be used for illegal purposes, too. Microsoft's Windows operating system is the world's largest enabler of piracy. Windows is used to transfer and consume pirated content on a massive scale every day. And yet Microsoft is not rogue. This double standard should not be imposed on Megaupload since it finds no basis in either logic or the law. All we want is equal treatment.

The fact is that the vast majority of Mega's Internet traffic is legitimate, and we are here to stay. If the content industry would like to take advantage of our popularity, we are happy to enter into a dialogue. We have some good ideas. Please get in touch.

Continue the fight against the MPAA and SOPA/ACTA with a focused, measurable effort",wookiee42,138,54,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/osymi/boycott_the_opening_weekend_of_the_dark_knight/,"Here is the first draft of the [/r/boycottthebatman](/r/boycottthebatman) FAQ:


**1. What is /r/boycottthebatman?**

[/r/boycottthebatman](/r/boycottthebatman) is a subreddit created to organize the opening weekend boycott of *The Dark Knight Rises*.

**2. Why boycott a movie?**

reddit blacked out for 12 hours on January 18th, 2012 in an effort to bring awareness to PIPA and SOPA. While the blackout and subsequent call to action did much to jeopardize those bills, they have not been fully defeated and legislation like PCIPA and ACTA continue to move through the US and abroad.

More action is required to stop these bills and more importantly, the system involved in their creation.

Entertainment lobbyists like the MPAA were able to spend millions of dollars in contributions in order to create these bills. Bills so apparently devoid of outside input that if they had passed, the websites of the bill's congressional sponsors themselves would have been subject to shutdown without due process.

It's time to directly target lobbying groups like the MPAA and the lawmakers who have chosen to put corporate interests ahead of the public.

**3. Why only the opening weekend?**

Opening weekend numbers and box-office totals in general dictate a lot of the way society talks about movies. They also impact the way movies are made and promoted.

*The Dark Knight Rises* is poised to break the opening weekend record as the *The Dark Knight* currently holds the #2 spot. Hollywood and the media will surely notice if *TDKR* doesn't break the record.

It will be hard to influence the behavior of millions of Americans, especially those who were surprised to discover that Wikipedia didn't work on the morning of the 18th. Getting people to change their behavior for only 3 days is an achievable task that will have a huge impact.

Finally, I don't think that a quality film like *TDKR* appears to be should be punished for the sins of an industry or political system. A rebound in second week numbers will show that the opening numbers were not due to the movie itself or piracy.

**4. But I really want to see *The Dark Knight Rises*/I'm a huge fan of Batman!**

I want to see it too!  But we have to endure a little pain and take action to ensure we're not just falling victim to 'slactivism'.

I think fans will appreciate that Nolan's Batman could influence real life. In the first two movies, Batman has combated the undue influence that powerful people and organizations have had over politicians.

In *The Dark Knight Rises* trailer, Catwoman tells Bruce Wayne,  ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could ever live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" 

Christopher Nolan seems to want to talk about Occupy Wall Street. I think we should oblige him.

**5. What if I want to boycott for longer than a weekend/other media?**

[/r/boycottthebatman](/r/boycottthebatman) will allow the discussion of a longer boycott and support other reddits like [/r/boycotthollywood](/r/boycotthollywood), [/r/SOPA](/r/SOPA) and [/r/ACTA](/r/ACTA).

Just thought you'd like to see the exchange I had with good old GoDaddy over the past 24 hours.

My support ticket, filed after transferring my 31 domains to Namecheap:

&gt; I would like to know how to cancel my account outright. I have transferred my domains from GoDaddy due to its support of the SOPA legislation, but I would like the account to be completely cancelled. 

&gt; Thank you in advance for your help --

GoDaddy's response, in part:

&gt;Dear datn,

&gt;Go Daddy is the world’s largest domain name registrar with more than 50 million domain names in our portfolio. Go Daddy has a full time presence in Washington D.C. and takes an active role in Congressional and legislative proposals.

&gt; Included in Go Daddy’s legislative efforts is the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). We are currently reviewing the most recent legislative proposal and continue to educate ourselves on the many facets of SOPA. We look forward to working with Congress to refine legislative language about this issue when appropriate.

&gt; To review Go Daddy's statement on the matter, you can read this article: http://support.godaddy.com/godaddy/go-daddys-position-on-sopa/

&gt; &lt;instructions on canceling the various services&gt;

My response, in which I marked the ticket resolved (and forced myself to be nice despite their assumption that I was a kneejerking unread idiot):

&gt; Thank you. Of course I had already read GoDaddy's position announcement on SOPA before canceling. I appreciate your help.

Their sudden response today to my closed ticket (cut-and-pasted inexpertly with breaks inside paragraphs, which I've removed for readability):

&gt; Go Daddy Customer,

&gt; We recently published our position on the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). You responded, and we want you to know that we listened.

&gt; Go Daddy is no longer supporting SOPA.

&gt; ""Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has been working to help craft revisions to this legislation - but we can clearly do better,"" Warren Adelman, Go Daddy's newly appointed CEO, said. ""It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.""

&gt; For more information on our position, please visit x.co/statement.

My final response:

&gt; Dear GoDaddy, 

&gt; Thank you for your response to my ticket. 

&gt; Since it is my understanding that GoDaddy participated in authoring SOPA and testified before the Senate in favor of the legislation, I'd say its withdrawal of its support by means of the deletion of a blog post, the writing of a new one, and a couple of interviews counts as ""too little, too late"". 

&gt; Please let me know when Warren Adelman steps up before the Senate and formally recants your company's support for the legislation. 

&gt; Regardless of the foregoing, however, you will not be regaining my business nor my recommendation. ",,False,,t5_2t3xs,False,,,True,t3_noqb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/noqb1/my_chat_with_godaddy_support_over_sopa_xpost_from/,

SOPA and PIPA, which is dangerous mostly just to the US citizens, will probably not happen, but people forgot about ACTA - why? Because ACTA is talked about in secrecy, and it almost sounds like a conspiracy theory...  
But ACTA **is** a real threat! And it would take our online privacy, internet providers would have to track our every movement... It would change free states into police states, it threats human rights... And still, nobody wants to release any information about it. Why? Because Obamas government said that the disclosure of the information could cause ""damage to the national security.""

Thanks for sharing your feedback with us. I’ve forwarded your comments on SOPA to the appropriate departments within the company so that your feedback will be heard.
 

Please know that Nintendo is strongly in favor of free speech. In fact, the entire video game industry recently fought extremely hard all the way to the Supreme Court to ensure protection of free speech. This past June the Entertainment Software Association won a landmark First Amendment case, Brown (Schwarzenegger) v. Entertainment Merchants Association.
 

We don’t allow U.S. stores to operate that are dedicated to selling stolen goods. Why should rogue websites that break U.S. law be any different? We need laws to address this reality and are confident Congress can find the right balance in the coming months.
 

Thank you again. We appreciate hearing what is important to our consumers.
 

Sincerely,
 

Nintendo of America Inc.


David Marshall

I just found out that Nintendo supports SOPA legislation, and I must tell you how much I was disappointed. I have decided to boycott all companies who support SOPA, and I am heartbroken that you must be on this list. I hope that your company will change its mind. I will not be buying any more products from your company until I hear that you have changed from supporting to opposing SOPA. I will also be publishing my findings on Nintendo related internet forums that I regularly visit to share the information that I have found regarding Nintendo's involvement with SOPA. 


I want to also say that I DO understand why Nintendo is involved in this legislation especially with the rampant problem of emulation and roms that software companies have to deal with. SOPA is not the answer. I am proud to say that I purchase all of my video games legally, and not everyone on the internet pirates software and other copyrighted materials. 


Kind regards,

With all the noise that's been going on around Sopa/Pipa these days and the whole world focusing on them, it is a very good time for them to pass ACTA in Europe. Since Sopa/Pipa has taken a stab i believe it is best that Europeans should focus their full attention on ACTA while Americas keep focusing on Sopa/Pipa. The rest of world can assist all these three legistlations.

Some ISP's in Europe, for example in Finland and Netherlands are trying to block sites like thePiratebay.org. We start to see a move towards making the isp's in Europe the policeman of the internet. With ACTA all european isp's will be force to censor the internet. And the funny thing is that ACTA has been negotiated for the past 3 years in secret by unelected officials.

People need to become aware and educate themselves otherwise they will not be able to fight back.

Here is video expaning ACTA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=citzRjwk-sQ

And Here are two text links. 
1) ATCA info: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/acta
2)How to act against ACTA: https://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/How_to_act_against_ACTA

So i wanted to urge people to share this and anything else they find useful related to ACTA, start talking about it more and organise themselves. Although European people are the one whose is gonna have to call their representatives anybody that can help with sharing and spreading the word is much welcomed.

**Note:** ACTA its pretty much global problem. Countries that negociated this are not only European, it includes Japan, US, Canada, Australia etc. Full list of countries and info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement. US is probably the mastermind behind this and it will threaten the internet as whole. It will soon be voted on EU perliament.

**Update:** Sopa bill has been canceled. PIPA has been postponed indefinitely (Still a threat). Another sneaky legistlation ""Protect Children from Online Pornographers Act (H.R. 1981)"" is emerging, you can find more here: http://gcn.com/articles/2011/08/05/protecting-children-bill-could-kill-internet.aspx. ACTA soon to be voted.

From the Internet to the iPod, technologies are transforming our society and empowering us as speakers, citizens, creators, and consumers. When our freedoms in the networked world come under attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the first line of defense. EFF broke new ground when it was founded in 1990—well before the Internet was on most people's radar—and continues to confront cutting-edge issues defending free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights today. From the beginning, EFF has championed the public interest in every critical battle affecting digital rights.

Blending the expertise of lawyers, policy analysts, activists, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers and the general public. EFF fights for freedom primarily in the courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the US government or large corporations. By mobilizing more than 61,000 concerned citizens through our Action Center, EFF beats back bad legislation. In addition to advising policymakers, EFF educates the press and public.

EFF is a donor-funded nonprofit and depends on your support to continue successfully defending your digital rights. Litigation is particularly expensive; because two-thirds of our budget comes from individual donors, every contribution is critical to helping EFF fight—and win—more cases.

[GoDaddy CEO] Adelman couldn’t commit to changing its position on the record in Congress when asked about that, but said “I’ll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that’s an important step.” But when pressed, he said “We’re going to step back and let others take leadership roles.” He felt that the public statement removing their support would be sufficient for now, though further steps would be considered.
So, GoDaddy hasn't gone on the record to oppose SOPA, and now they've made it clear they're still officially supporting it. In my opinion, the ""we no longer support SOPA"" statement released yesterday seems to be just a calculated PR move.

Corporations that have shown a lack of regard for whether their DCMA or ICE takedown notices are valid. SOPA is a scorched earth policy that punishes the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen. It will decimate fair-use and safe-harbor provisions and drive profitable, job-creating, legal businesses offline for the infraction of ONE bad apple. 

Please please please research SOPA outside of RIAA and MPAA spin and vote against this short-sighted law proposed by special interest groups.

Thankfully, we don't have to stop buying their games in order to stop giving them our monies. We can boycott them by buying them used. (This also extends to buying consoles, handhelds, peripherals, and accessories.)

There's no avoiding it- people will continue to buy games new (and sell them) no matter what you do. But, at least *your* money would not be going to companies who support these bills. For example, Gamestop, as well as Amazon, evil as they may be, actually have not expressed support for SOPA or PROTECT IP, so unless you're boycotting them for some other reason you can continue to buy used games from them.

The bad news is that you can't download things used unless they're free. So no Wii Shop Channel, no DSi Shop Channel, no Nintendo eShop, and no PlayStation Store. And since you have to pay for Xbox Live, you can't use that either, so you might as well stop playing Xbox altogether. Also, you can't play games with paid subscriptions that are made by the first party or a third party that supports SOPA or PROTECT IP.

The only games you can buy new are third-party games made by developers that don't support SOPA or PROTECT IP.

Remember: even if you're not giving them your money, a boycott won't work unless the targets get the message that you, the consumer, are NOT happy.

It has come to my attention that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even Reddit (along with other sites) have been considering the idea of a coordinated blackout of services on the 21st of January, 2012. This is an idea that I, personally, find to be brilliant. To say that the temporary loss of these services would be a hiccup in the lives of Americans would be a dramatic understatement. 

It is of mutual benefit both to these websites and the users who love them that SOPA not be passed; I am sure there is no doubt of this fact among members of this website, and as such I will not detail reasons why this is the case - you already know, if you're still reading.

I know that I am a new Redditor, but please disregard the lack of experience that my Reddit account shows, and bear with me. Reddit is powerful because of its users. Reddit is powerful because of the dedication and the tenacity that Redditors display when they truly show investment in an issue. 

I feel, personally, that the coordinated efforts of Reddit, Google, and all of the other prospective participants of this proposed blackout will at the very least bring the issue to the fore of the average American.

Not everyone uses Reddit. Not everyone pays attention to legislative issues. Even novice internet users use Google, however. Google's participation in this proposed blackout would send a statement both to the American population, and the legislators. 

As cheesy as it sounds, if the American people are together on an issue, there is nothing that can stop them. 

So, my proposition is this. Let's find some way to petition Google and the other major websites. Let's tell them that their users behind them. Let's stop sitting back and letting our legislators screw us out of our rights. Let's stand up and fight! 

Please, discuss ideas and conspire. 

TL;DR - Let's try to get Google and the others on board with the blackout idea, so we can maybe stop SOPA.

**The Good**

* SOPA was definitely the most popular issue there - there were three distinct questions during the Q&amp;A period regarding the bill, and all of the questions were basically like ""why do you support this bill when it's going to harm the Internet?""

* Most of the SOPA-related questions fed into some kind of ""this bill is going to destroy jobs"" statement so that was also nice

**The Bad**

* Berman actually received applause for his support of SOPA at some points. However, this was not necessarily surprising because the audience did seem to be disproportionately senior citizens who used to work in the film industry and believe that ""film piracy"" is ""destroying their pensions.""

* In fact, this sentiment (that film piracy would destroy their pension) was expressed by one union member, and this actually received applause. I think at least in LA the meme that film piracy is the only thing that's causing the retreat of the industry from Southern California (as opposed to runaway production, technological progress, etc.) is well established in the mind of many older union members.

However, I did come away with the feeling that a lot of these attitudes (such as the belief that film piracy is destroying pension funds) are largely restricted to a few representatives in the Los Angeles area. Unfortunately, these people are the main co-sponsors of the bill. In order for any sort of SOPA protest to get through to these people, they have to be shown that passing SOPA will have a detrimental effect on jobs (not only in Southern California, but all over the country), which will in turn have a detrimental effect on the stocks and securities that their pension plans own.

On the other hand, the fact that support for SOPA seems to link up solely with opposition to piracy might show how limited in appeal the bill actually is. I think the coordinated Internet blackout would probably hit a lot of those people who were complaining about piracy the most, so that's probably the most effective way of drilling the fact that SOPA is a really bad idea into their heads.

I have created a primer that explains just about all of CISPA as well as I could explain it.  It's designed to be read alongside the actual bill (link to the bill in the posts).  It's a little long, but hopefully it'll help explain why CISPA is so dangerous (particularly Section 3(g)(6)).

Spread the word, if you can.  It'd be appreciated.  Also, IANAL, but I have a pretty extensive mastery of legal-ese, as well as a penchant for word problems.  The 3 part series is pretty much designed for people that really want to see EVERYTHING in CISPA.

[Part 1 - Section 1 and 2](http://redd.it/1ctycc).

[Part 2 - Section 3 - (a) through (c)](http://redd.it/1cykk6).

[Part 3 - Section 3 - (d) through Section 7](http://redd.it/1cyo8o).

For a short and sweet ELI5-version of CISPA...

CISPA creates a way for the US Government and companies like Facebook, Google and others to share information with the US Government, as well as each other.   It also includes laws making it illegal to share information with people that shouldn’t know (what Bradley Manning did), to share that information among others that shouldn’t know (what WikiLeaks does), and allows for companies to trade personal information without getting in trouble.  It also allows for the US Government to spy on US citizens, to prosecute people that pirate movies, games or music, and does all of this without telling you.  You will also never know it’s happening.

The extreme version is people violating CISPA can be labeled ""domestic terrorists"" through a combination of CISPA and the Patriot Act, which is what the US Government *really* wants to do to Anonymous.

Many companies (nearly all that support CISPA, actually) stand to make money from this Act - new companies will be hired by every company on the internet for ""cybersecurity,"" as well as by the US Government, and everyone from internet providers to social networking sites will make money from the trading of information.  This is why there are so few companies fighting CISPA, and more reason for us citizens to protect our freedoms and liberties from ""Big Brother.""",,False,,t5_2t3xs,False,,,True,t3_1cyref,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/1cyref/cispa_and_you_a_guide/,

I present you a shell script that monitors your DNS queries and stores all IPs associated with hostnames you visit. It was tested on Linux only.

[**The main daemon script**](http://pastebin.com/3wJp6uRh)

[**An additional script for automated updating your /etc/hosts**](http://pastebin.com/wgmpHkur)

Requirements: Perl, Tcpdump, Bash. On Windows, also Cygwin.

Usage: run the daemon script as root. Browse the internet. When you feel like it, run the update script to update your /etc/hosts. If you want to stop the daemon from monitoring your browsing habits, run the daemon script with `stop` parameter (I'm not sure if it will work on Windows, I didn't test it; if it doesn't, simply kill tcpdump).

You also can update your /etc/hosts manually. In any case, it's better to back it up.

Don't forget the configuration. It's done by modifying the script. The most important part are /etc/hosts file location and exception list (note that the exception lists in both scripts play a different role).

PM me with bug reports, patches, compatibility reports or anything else.

Feel free to mirror, copy, modify, sell, whatever.

Of course, the only problem that this script solves is DNS spoofing. For IP blocking, I'd need to use Tor or something like that.

If the service provider does not take action within 5 days they loose their immunity and could be sued by the complainant, no court order required. If they do stop providing their service they are immune from suit by the alleged violator whether the claim is true or not. These workaround DNS measures do absolutely nothing to solve the problem.

The are accused of paying people (mostly spammers/scam artists) to upload copyrighted content, and then paying those same people—through a ""rewards program"" (a.k.a. affiliate program)—to drive people to subscribe for premium services. Premium services that would let users download that same, pirate content. Like, ""Download Harry Potter in HD for just 99¢ on Megaupload!""

They are also accused of BUYING and MAINTAINING spam sites that advertise things like, ""Download The latest season of 30 Rock FREE with Megaupload Premium."" We've all seen these sites all over the place when looking for torrents. I know I have. 

Not everyone in the company knew about this, apparently. Seven key Megaupload executives are involved in this racket, including the CEO. Basically that means the entire management team was using the selling of copyrighted content as a BUSINESS MODEL.

This is what is accused. It may or may not be true, but we'll find out. I suspect it is. Online file storage/transfer is a tough business. Megaupload just kind of ""existed"" for a while, and then it EXPLODED overnight. There was no real reason why it suddenly became so successful after years of mediocrity, it wasn't even a really competitive service. It kind of sucked.

So put down your pitchforks and think. Then maybe pick them up again, but at least have some understanding of what's going on before you go out locked and loaded and then end up regretting it later because you realized you were an idiot.

So that's the REAL DEAL with Megaupload.

It's downright shameful what congress is doing. Corporate influence is ruining this country. (And- many others.) Right now, many people either don't know about, or don't want to get involved in all of this. But- If SOPA or Protect IP pass.. a lot of people are going to start paying attention. When your parents can no longer find that funny video on youtube or your sister can no longer log onto her facebook account- they're going to start to care.

So- What to do when that happens?

I'd like to say- Don't buy their products or visit their websites. But, I realize there's an oligarchy in the entertainment industry. People get bored. To tell somebody to not listen to most popular music, watch most movies, etc... Well- That isn't going to go over well. 

Maybe- It'd be better to make an example out of somebody. 

While It'd hard to get the masses to not watch movies or buy music... it might be easier to get them to blacklist one company- to make an example out of them. Not watch their movies, listen to their music, buy their products....

Looking at the music industry and how all these things relate- 'Who' to boycott becomes (in my opinion..) obvious.

(Last I checked...) There's only really 4 major record labels... EMI, Universal, Sony &amp; Warner. 

(Well, 3 actually..)

EMI no longer really 'exists.' Last I heard, It was being sold piecemeal to Universal &amp; Sony. Warner Music no longer has any relation to Warner Brothers (the film company.) Warner music is owned by a Russian billionaire &amp; it's currently the smallest of the 'major' labels. Sony also makes electronics &amp; other things... so it seems a bit of an odd target.

That only leaves Universal/Vivendi. Which (to my knowledge..) is purely an entertainment company.

So, If SOPA or Protect IP become law- I suggest that we urge everyone we know to boycott all Universal/Vivendi products.

Don't watch their movies. Don't buy their music. Don't watch their TV stations. Don't buy their products or visit their websites. 

Make an example out of them.

I fully realize they own a lot of stuff. But, voting your congressman out of office won't stop the lobbyists. You have to kick them where it hurts.

Your basic rights are being put in danger... So somebody can sell more tickets to 'The Fast and the Furious Part 6.'

You gotta throw the gauntlet down somewhere.

Comments/ Suggestions? 


********************

Edit: I'm getting the impression (I might be wrong...) that a lot of people are sort of missing the point. It's great if someone doesn't support company X, Y or Z because they support SOPA &amp; Protect IP. But- That's not organization. That's not tactical. I'm saying we pick one corporation and make an example out of them for everyone else to see. While we still have an uncensored Internet.. We should think about this.

Imagine giving Universal the worst fiscal year on record.

**Some background first:**The IAFF is one of the most active lobbying organizations in Washington; its Political Action Committee, FIREPAC, is among the top one percent of the more than 4,000 PACs in the country.The International Association of Firefighters IAFF part of the ALF-CIO (which ""overwhelmingly supports"" SOPA/PIPA). The IAFF represents the nation's 300,000 professional firefighters protecting 85% of the U.S. population. 

The IAFF President is HAROLD A. SCHAITBERGER, who also just happens to serve on the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, and is vice president of the AFL-CIO’s Executive Council. The AFL-CIO is one of the largest (if not the largest, next to Teamsters) labor union lobbying for support of PIPA/SOPA. 

The MPAA released [this press release](http://www.mpaa.org/resources/2501a617-d2d5-4cf3-ad9c-a485b52b8daa.pdf). In this press release, HAROLD A. SCHAITBERGER (who has no formal internet or technology background) expresses the IAFF's support for this bill. He just expresses his mere personal opinion (which is likely just what the MPAA paid him to say). 

I can assure you, Reddit, IAFF Locals do not discuss SOPA/PIPA at our meetings. I can assure you, majority of firefighters have no clue about SOPA/PIPA and especially do not know they are being wrongly represented. I can promise you that your firefighters do not support foreign interests that damage our economy, but do not represent nor support corporate and government interests that have detrimental effects on the very sector that is the future of our country. **And above all, we are protectors of our citizens. As a para-military organization, many of us have served on the front-lines of our military protecting our freedoms. It's wrong that our labor union is misrepresenting us, and promoting internet censorship.** Please do not believe this bullshit. Firefighters fucking love Reddit, we don't want this shit going anywhere.

Contact your congress men and women today, make sure they understand where you stand.

I think we can all agree that these days we consider the Internet to be a basic human right, the same as free speech and and freedom of religion. We want to have the option to write about anything and read about everything without some commercial figure dictating to us what's right and what's wrong, what we can download and what we can't.

We see that fighting those who try to mutilate the internet to become their own private conveyor belt for their new and over priced products is futile. In one week we managed to stop SOPA and PIPA just to find out about ACTA on the next, which is 10 times worse than that, and we can't fight it because the legislators are funded by the same people who try to hurt the internet as we know it.

What if we could avoid all that and move on to the next level and create a new Internet that is free, open, unrestricted, and unbiased by monetary power?

---------------------

We have the technology to establish a global wireless mesh network to extend and eventually replace the existing internet infrastructure, and provide free internet to anyone with a WiFi capable device (any smartphone, tablet, laptop, and most modern desktop computers).

A Wireless Mesh Network is a network consisting of Wireless Routers much like the one you have in your house connected to your internet service provide, but instead of connecting to an internet provider, these routers connect to each other to create a P2P network.

The top-of-the-line wireless router costs today about $30 for the consumer, what if all you ever needed to pay for to access the internet is $30, and from that point on you are surfing the internet for free and also letting your neighbors access the internet if they can't afford a wireless router of their own?

What I'm proposing is to establish a company that creates and maintains this network, designing and manufacturing hardware and software for the consumer to install in their houses and offices, and also designing and erecting self-sustaining wireless nodes across the world supported by solar and wind power.

Imagine an entire world interconnected with this wireless mesh where no single authority can alter the way this network is run or who can access it and what information can be accessed.

The technology exists, and it's cheap as dirt compared to the outrageous amounts we're paying every month for cellular data and voice communication, the only things missing are a unifying protocol, the hardware (dozens of designs are available already), and software for the end consumer that would make this all possible.

Imagine that in 5 years, the time it took for smartphones like iPhone and Android devices to become ubiquitous, we will no longer have to pay for internet access, voice and text communication, we have Viber, Face Time, Skype, and Google Talk, Twitter, Facebook, and the list goes on and on and it could easily replace our current cellular networks, and it would be 100 times as fast as the internet we have today.

The next generation of wireless routers can support 1.3gb/s of data, that's 1000 faster than the current average internet speed across the world, and you won't have to pay 100s of dollars every month to get access to this fast internet, all you have to do is buy a wireless router supporting this technology, and you have your own internet service provider.

Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity legislation. Your taking time to contact me is appreciated.

 

S. 2105, the ""Cybersecurity Act of 2012,"" was introduced on February 14, 2012.  This legislation would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with owners and operators of critical infrastructure, the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council, and other federal agencies and private sector entities, to conduct a top-level assessment of cybersecurity risks to determine which sectors face the greatest immediate risk.  In addition, DHS would be required to identify or develop risk-based cybersecurity performance requirements as well as implement cyber response and restoration plans.

 

Today there are increasing threats of espionage and attacks over the internet that threaten our national security.  However, I understand your concerns regarding increased government regulation of the internet.  Therefore, I recently joined several of my colleagues to introduce S. 2151, the ""Strengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, and Technology (SECURE IT) Act of 2012.""  This legislation would improve our cybersecurity without increasing the size of the federal government, creating burdensome regulations that hamper the private sector, or adding to the enormous national debt.

 

Furthermore, on April 26, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3523, the ""Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.""  This legislation currently resides in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. 

 

I am hopeful that the Senate will recognize the importance of enhancing our cybersecurity in a responsible manner by supporting the SECURE IT Act.   As the Senate considers future cybersecurity legislation, including S. 2105, S. 2151, or H.R. 3523, I will keep your comments in mind.

I presume this new bill will be just as terrible for internet freedom.
