We're crunching the numbers. If it happens, you all will be the first to know--heck, we might ask your help setting up!

I'd also like to hear what parts and kits you guys would like to see stocked.

------------------------------------

I'm an electronics hobbyist, and thinking of opening an electronics store to cater to the hobbyist and student markets in Chicago. Anyone from there? Would you make use of it, even for ""oh crap!"" deadline stuff?

Lets say it had:

* Fully stocked walls of passives, priced by the inch of tape.
* Very reasonable prices (Ain't nobody want to pay $5 for 5 resistors!)
* Full stock of Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, ICs, programmers, etc.
* On-site laser cutting/engraving
* Classes/meetups and contests

**So here's my solution:** You give me a schematic or *really good* description of what you want/need, and I'll go do the PCB and get it back to you. I'll even help you find a good option for where to buy it from.

----

Here's the caveats (at least the ones I can think of on short notice):

* I'm assuming that this is a hobby thing, i.e. you're just making a few boards for yourself but aren't very good with PCB software or doing PCBs. It seems inappropriate for me to do stuff for actual industry or whatever. [(dont be this guy)](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/17/business/us-outsource-job-china/)
* I'm gonna post the resultant schematic and PCB on the internets/Reddit as public property (or [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) or whatever)
* If this is a school project, you better be damn clear to your instructor that you got *a lot* of help with the project. If the project is to design the PCB, I'm not gonna do it for you.
* I'll probably add more stuff if I or anyone else can think of relevant stuff to add

----

Oh I should probably include something about how I'm not a total crackpot and I am vaguely qualified to do something like this.

* I am a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Technology program at Purdue University.
* I am proficient at [PCB Artist](http://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-layout-software/) and [EAGLE CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/), but I prefer EAGLE
* I have made my own 1 sided PCB's at home using [this process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWnfnt2rNO0)
* I have ordered PCB's from [Advanced Circuits](http://www.4pcb.com/), [Batch PCB](https://www.batchpcb.com/) 
* [Here is a gallery of my PCBs](http://imgur.com/a/r1TK1#0)

----

I figure /r/electronics is the best place to float this kind of idea.

So what do you guys think? 

Would this be a useful ""tool"" for people?

Do you think it's appropriate to do this?

The cool part about this design is it takes 1 PCIe x4 lane slot and breaks it up so each port get a x1 lane. It's probably not the craziest thing you guys have seen, but I'm super stoked. http://imgur.com/a/ARPgw  
**EDIT:**  
I wish I could tell you guys everything about the design but since its for work im very very limited. To be honest im kind of scared that i posted it now. The reason I did is because 1) I want to show people my progress as an EE ( need to find a safe way of doing so) 2) I wanted to show people that there are dream jobs out there. I have somehow landed one. I work with some of the smartest and coolest engineers that are flooding me with knowledge. They want me designing motherboards for our products in a few years and thats the moments I have been waiting for since I was a kid.  
**EDIT2:**  
Sorry guys im super paranoid now. I took down the images. It's ok if you guys hate me now... :(

These weren't even my design originally, but rather borrowed (with permission/attribution) from a friend of my who originally built an Arduino based version in July of the same year.

I never had any interest in selling these, so I never even considered applying for a patent, but I did slap a Creative Commons non-commercial license on the page to offer some kind of protection (I'll be honest, I haven't done a whole lot of research into what it covers).

Two days ago, I was sent a link to a Kickstarter project called ""Dropshades"".  They claim:

&gt;DropShades are the world’s first audio responsive party glasses that “dance” to the beat of the music

Yet a search for ""audio responsive party glasses"" returns a reference to my blog multiple times on the first page.

Also, in an [article](http://www.tcu360.com/campus/2013/04/18023.tcu-students-create-sound-reactive-sunglasses) about the creators, they say:

&gt;Herndon said he, along with senior engineering major Nick Cate, tried to search the Internet for equalizing sunglasses but couldn’t find any. Then, they started playing with electroluminescent wire.

Which unless they are really terrible at using the Internet is clearly false.

I sent them a message on the project asking them if they knew that I had a CC license on the page.  They replied with:

&gt;we have taken a look at your product, unfortunately your Creative Commons license only protects the visual aspects of your product. Since you don't have a patent the functionality of your product is not protected. Nevertheless, are pcb and the circuit which powers ours is not an audrinio unit, and is fundamentally different from yours. Feel free to contact our legal team &lt;phone number redacted&gt; thanks.

My project was not Arduino based. I'm guessing they're a little mixed up.

I don't really want any money, but I am upset to see the work of my friend and me being paraded around as if it belongs to someone else.

The description of the video and the link are below:

In this episode Shahriar demos the world’s fastest oscilloscope! The Agilent DSA-X 96204Q offers 160GS/s of conversion rate  with a bandwidth of 62GHz on two dedicated ‘RealEdge’ channels. It can also provide 80GS/s conversion rate and 33GHz of bandwidth on four simultaneous channels. The unit demoed in this video is equipped with all available options and is valued at over 0.5 million US dollars. The block diagram of various sub-systems of the oscilloscope are presented and the principle operation of the instrument is explained. A 56Gb/s PRBS-15 signal is applied to the scope from a Centellax 2G2P5A (now Agilent N4975A) and the resulting data pattern is examined in real-time. Various scope functions are also presented as well as the capability to observer bit failures at baud-rate using this instrument.

As a second experiment, two 3.125Gb/s PRBS-7 data streams are simultaneously up-convered to 20GHz and 40GHz respectively by using a pair of MITEQ mm-wave DSB tripple balanced mixers and a pair of Avantek 20-40GHz YIG oscillators. The resulting two signals are combined by using a power-combiner and fed to the oscilloscope. The capability of the instrument to act as an ultra-broadband software-defined radio is demonstrated by recovering the the two PRBS sequences simultaneously through DSP post processing. The block diagram of this setup can be downloaded from The Signal Path website.

I wanted something with enough power but also still be portable. It does weigh 20lbs but has 18Ah of battery inside so its not going to die any time soon. 

The lepai T amp seems to be the way to go for these type of projects. I may ungrade the amp internals at some point. 
I also want to add solar panels. http://www.voltaicsystems.com/3wattkit.php

UPDATE: solar cells added. 6.8 watts of power. Thats .566 amps in full sunlight. They have enough power to run the amp on their own without the batteries. It will only play 1/4 volume before it cuts out though.


Here are some of the pics of the construction. UPDATE: Handle and panels added. I didnt get many of the wiring.

This chip (NXP LPC1114/102) was [mentioned](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/03/13/32-bit-meet-dip-arm-cortex-m0-in-dip-packages/) on the Adafruit blog a few months ago but I haven't seen much said about it since then so here is my first impression. I come from working with AVR and Arduino stuff and I didn't find this chip hard to get working at all. The built-in bootloader makes loading your programs easy; all you need is two wires for a serial connection and some free software.

* [LPCxpresso](http://lpcxpresso.code-red-tech.com/LPCXpresso/) IDE (limited to 128K flash) based on Eclipse, works on Win/Mac/Linux
* [Flashmagic](http://www.flashmagictool.com/) (Win/Mac only) to load your .hex files to the board. Its sort of like a GUI avrdude. EDIT: Linux users can use [lpc21isp](https://github.com/Zuph/lpc21isp) 

Note: to use Flashmagic with LPCxpresso you need to change the build to output .hex files instead of only .axf files.

* http://www.microbuilder.eu/blog/09-12-16/Building_Intel_Hex_Files_with_LPCXpresso.aspx

Details

* 32 bit Cortex-M0 48Mhz
* 32 kB flash - 4 kB sram
* 1 UART, 1 I2C, 1 SPI, 6 ADC, 22 GPIO
* [User Manual](http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10398.pdf)
* [Datasheet](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/LPC111X.pdf)

Example Code (drivers, freertos, examples)

* [http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/](http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/)
* [https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC1114CodeBase](https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC1114CodeBase)


Pros

* [Cheaper](http://www.findchips.com/avail?part=LPC1114FN28%2F102) than many midrange 8-bit DIP chips
* $25 [debugger board](http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc1114_xpr.php)
* 50 Mhz with the onboard ~~crystal~~ (EDIT: Internal RC oscillator)

Cons

* not 5V (1.8V to 3.6V)
* Flashmagic not supported on Linux but you may get it to run in WINE. Linux users can use [lpc21isp](https://github.com/Zuph/lpc21isp) and the LPC-Link from the Xpresso devboards.
* Not as power efficient in deep sleep mode as a Picopower AVR (based on datasheets)
* (EDIT) Availability outside the USA is poor at the moment. Shipping is ~$30-$50 from Mouser/Avnet

Enthusiasts have often wished there were more MCUs in DIP format. Some would argue its the reason 8 bit MCUs have had so much staying power, at least in hobby circles. To my knowledge this is the only 32-bit MCU out there (EDIT: there is a [PIC32 in DIP](http://www.findchips.com/avail?part=PIC32MX110F016B-I%2FSP+) too)and its not some rare bird but a common ARM that is supported by a bunch of compilers and IDEs.

I wanted to share this older vid of where I attempted to make the world's simplest balancing robot that would as easy as possible to duplicate. I thought it would be more appropriate to post here instead of /r/robotics.

[simple analog balancing robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-afnY32RrY)

The little balance bot is based around a 555 timer chip set up as a crude PID (integral isn't actually used in the vid) using LDRs (light dependent resistors) as sensors and a servo modified for continuous rotation.  In the latter part of the vid I show how to make a 2 transistor balancing robot. All parts for this project can be bought at a Radio Shack and a hobby store.

The modulation in to pin 5 of the 555 timer means that I'm frequency modulation the pulse train. Servos can accept a wide range of pulse train frequencies, typically about 20-100Hz, so on a pratical level, this frequency modulation doesn't matter. The benefit is that using this technique, it's simple to modulate the pulse width going in to the servo, which is all that matters.

It is much simpler to build the 555 timer version of this robot rather than the 2 transistor version.

A 14 watt compact fluorescent light the is used as a reference off screen.

You can google *modify a servo for continuous rotation* to see how it's done or buy them pre-modified from multiple sources. A lot of people don't realize that a servo modified for continuous rotation is a full proportional bi-directional motor controller.

Caps in parallel will always get a short on one, it is the last one you pull out.

Resistors get placed upside down, this shouldnt matter but it makes people nervous.

Flux psychically knows where I want the solder to flow.

Rework always looks awful under a scope

the default behavior of an op-amp is to ring, amplifying a signal is accidental

single-pole filters filter nothing

BGAs exist to punish us for our sins.

Cold spray only works on youtube

sawing solder should be illegal

The datasheet Beta is a lie

resistors are just badly designed capacitors

capacitors are just resistors with some parasitical capacitance

inductors are way too large

NP0 for precision, ceramic for power, and mylar for flair.

The prototype board for the component has the actual values you need for the external components. The datasheet is lying about this.

Oddly enough the only true insulator I have found is the esd bag. You can use them like an oven mitt.

No matter how many layers you have it still won't be enough.

Always pick everything off the same reel.

No parasitical property can be used to your advantage. If it could be someone would have made a dedicate part that already did this.

Your current limiting diode will just be put in backwards.

ROHS stands for “really obnoxiously heat sensitive”

vibration is to electronics as cancer is to a pancreas. 

Wash cycle is to pcbs as a baseball bat blow is to the head

Would anyone be interested in learning about Electronics visually? With plenty of pictures, waveforms and information? My Idea is to set up a Blog that may take for example a switching regulator and have step by step examples for every bit of it and show the users what happens if we change the inductor to a smaller value and what this inductor does and why its critical.

For each change in component value I would show an Oscilliscope waveform to help illustrate it. I could make kits available as an experimenters kit where it includes multiple values of components ideally It would be very close to near cost however I have not decided about really selling anything. It would depend on what the users wanted.

I'm really just curious as to what others think, If others are interested in seeing this I believe I would have fun doing this. 

I welcome any feedback anyone may have and I appreciate everyone's time! :)

**EDIT: So now that we've established there is interest I'd like to get a feel for what level everyone is at and what in particular your goals are or what you'd like to learn, Maybe even with things your having trouble with.   I'll see if I can get someone else to be a co-author of sorts for the blog. Again thanks to everyone for your time and I'll see if I can make this happen**

Bit of background. I am farmer trying simplify a few things in my daily operations using the technology that is available to me. I'm a bit of a nerd and love building stuff weather its out of wood or steel, I enjoy the challenge of making stuff work out of what's available (read: CHEAP!). I'm also not a complete 'n00b' when it comes to basic electronics, I've worked in IT, went from break fix type stuff to server admin. I am also comfortable with basic AC (wired my basement) and DC (installed several car stereos, aux lighting, relay controlled HID lighting, etc). But I am lacking in the more  sophisticated technologies, usually if I cant figure something a quick google search and i'm good. But with electronics its different, you need to know what you're looking for to find information on it. You also need to understand fancy symbols and diagrams and etc. I have no formal training in any of this.

Anyway, on to my problems... well the first thing I want to do is create a simple monitoring system for my seed drill. Imagine a box is full of seed, the level of the seed is constantly decreasing. I need something to tell me when the level of the seed hits a certain point then I will know to refill. It would also be nice to have a couple different levels (like half full, 3/4 full, etc). This would be on a 12v system. 
On the same seed drill, there are shafts turning (fairly slow, like 100 - 200 rpm). I need something to monitor these shafts from the tractor, just to ensure they are in fact turning. Again 12v system

The last thing I want to do right now is create a monitor light for my cows water trough that tells we when its full of water so I can shut the hose off. Ideally this would be a light that illuminates when the water reaches a certain level. This would be on a 110v system.

Again I am just a dumb farmer so please use laymen terms. Also I am trying to do these projects on a limited budget, so the cheaper, the better. However if there is a option that would work 10x better, but costs more I wouldnt be opposed to going that route. 

I hope my post makes sense and someone is able to help me :) I will likely have more of these types of projects in the future and I hope I can turn to r/electronics when I have questions. I would more then happy to buy anyone who helps a eBeer.

We got together and played with the gain of the chip and these are the results of our experiment.

* [Taped to a speaker, playing more music with different sensitivity](http://gtabfans.com/~andrew/upload/accmic/counterpoint.mp3) - [Original Song](http://counterpoint.frequency44.com/pages/mods/counterpoint.html)

We ended up using the 4g range with 1200Hz sample rate. The model is BMA180, made by Bosch.

I thought I might append some details as to how it was done. We simply took the signed 16 bit value coming out of the accelerometer and converted it to signed 8 bit. We sent these values down the UART (no message delimiters) through an FTDI where it was captured using miniterm.py and saved to a file. It was as simple as opening the file in Audacity as raw data and playing it back at the appropriate sample rate.

By Request:

* [Voice Recording](http://gtabfans.com/~andrew/upload/accmic/voice%20recording.mp3) - No filtering and rather silly. This was using a piece of 8.5x11 in. Paper curled slightly and held vertically. Once I realized that the recordings come out like a distant radio signal, I had to record something fun.
* [Better Voice Recording](http://gtabfans.com/~andrew/upload/accmic/voice%20recording%202.mp3) - No filtering and much clearer. This method of capturing the sound waves is very directional.

So, some times 0 ohm resistors are listed with different tolerances, even in the same package, by the same manufacturer. 

Like here:

0 ohm, 0402, 1% http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Yageo/RC0402FR-070RL/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtlubZbdhIBIGhJWRsHPi3S816YogM5jUA%3d

It looks to me like every other property(temp coefficient, wattage, etc) of these resistors are the same. 

The 1% and 5% resistors are also different prices. WTF?

I have seen this situation in other manufacturers where the 5% and 1% 0 ohm resistors are the same price. I suspect in those cases those resistors are the same item.

Anyhow, what the heck is the difference between a 5% and a 1% 0 ohm resistor? ",,False,self,t5_2qhue,False,,,True,t3_191ik6,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/191ik6/1_vs_5_0_ohm_resistors/,

1347768620.0,45,self.electronics,zyi60,My custom motion controlled rifle/display designed for Call of Duty on the 360!  95% complete.,Harbingerx81,56,11,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/zyi60/my_custom_motion_controlled_rifledisplay_designed/,"I posted this on /r/gaming a couple days ago but I think the crowd there is a little to immature to really appreciate it so I thought I'd put it up here as well.

[Link to the album](http://imgur.com/a/7hlI2#0)

**The goal here is simple:**

* Place an LCD screen just in front of the players face, covering most of his/her field of vision.
* Motion control which does not rely on camera's and IR to allow the player to actually turn 360 degrees.
* Of course everything (including the video) need to be wireless.
* Usable for other games, but tailored for Call of Duty on the 360

So here it is.  I have stripped the main board of a 360 controller, rewired all of the buttons and joysticks, spliced a micro controller and gyroscopes in to replace the look stick, mounted everything in an Airsoft Rifle making the controls as natural as possible, and will be mounting a screen just in front of the users face so that as you aim your field of view moves just as it would if you were aiming a real rifle!

**About the controls:**

I am trying to make them as natural as possible.

Left hand (holding the hand guard)

* Thumb sits on a PSP-style sliding thumb stick allowing moment (simulating input from the left stick on a normal controller)
* Fingers curl naturally around the guard and each rest on tactile buttons for A, B, Y, and RSB
* Small movement of hand to grenade buttons

Right hand

* Trigger fires
* Magazine release reloads
* Button on pistol grip allows you to simply squeeze for ADS
* Thumb easily reaches the D-Pad replacement which is located where the selector lever normally is

**About the electronics:**

I will not go into too much detail with this post (unless requested), but when its 100% I will throw out the code and some more specs.  I will tell you that it contains a 3-axis gyro/accelerometer combo, which at the moment is overkill, but I might eventually try to add more motion control like actual movement and crouch/jump.  The gyro data is processed with a Adruino Pro Mini and outputted to a series of digital potentiometers.  The D-pad was replaced with a 5 position switch.  The controllers electronics are powered by a 2000mAh LiPo battery so it will have extreme runtime and quick recharge.

**About the display:**

10.1"" HDMI LDC monitor...Very light and power efficient running off a 4600mAh battery at the moment, though I plan to upgrade.  A wireless HDMI transmitter/receiver combo which also runs off the monitors battery allow the device to be entirely wireless, though I did have to make a regulator so that the 5v receiver can run with the same 12v the monitor uses.

**Notes about use:**

Given the components involved, the entire system has a current max run time of about 4 hours before the battery for the screen needs recharging.  The battery and wireless receiver will need to be worn on the players back due to size and weight.  The rig even with the screen is still light enough to allow for extended play, but obviously due to size and weight you would not be able to last long if EVERYTHING was mounted on the gun.

**What I have left to work on:**

* Build the physical mount which will hold the screen to the gun...Not difficult but time consuming.
* Streamline the data from the gyros...Right now it 'works' but there is more programming to do to normalize and calibrate the data from the gyros to make it more accurate and reliable...Just a matter of time and math.
* ADS...Some of you may have thought about it already...You aim slower aiming down the sights...I will need to monitor the ADS button with the micro controller and adjust the look speed accordingly...Again not too difficult, but the coding will be interesting...


**Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome and I promise there will be a video when the coding is finished and the cosmetic work is touched up!**",,False,self,t5_2qhue,False,,,True,t3_zyi60,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/zyi60/my_custom_motion_controlled_rifledisplay_designed/,

1339340306.0,40,self.electronics,uumj4,AVR 8-Bit Microcontroller Books/Tutorials/Guides/How-To Links,tommytwoeyes,46,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/uumj4/avr_8bit_microcontroller/,"I am learning to program the Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontrollers by re-designing a robot I built previously with an Arduino clone using AVR-libC and an (possibly multiple) ATmega microcontroller.

Disappointingly, I haven't found too many books about programming Atmel microcontrollers that are aimed at beginners, and of the ones I have found, many had poor reviews on Amazon. There is a book, [Practical AVR Microcontrollers
Games, Gadgets, and Home Automation with the Microcontroller Used in the Arduino](http://www.apress.com/9781430244462), coming out in August 2012 that looks promising.

I've found a handful of helpful websites. For anyone looking for similar resources, I can tell you I've had more success in Google using names of specific microcontrollers versus terms like ""AVR microcontroller tutorials"" (e.g.  use ""ATmega328 tutorials"" or ""ATtiny2313 tutorials PWM"").

So to help anyone else who may also be learning how to program these awesome microcontrollers, here are the best sites I have found:

* [NewbieHack.com](http://newbiehack.com): This site is absolutely the best source of information I've found so far for programming Atmel microcontrollers. It has an extensive list of written tutorials and accompanying video guides that cover ""Hello, world"" (LED blinking), dealing with buttons (debouncing), analog-to-digital conversion, building power supply circuits, pulse with modulation, and more. I am in no way affiliated with the authors; I just found them in a Google query; but I have learned more about AVR programming from that site than any other.
* [AVRFreaks.net](http://avrfreaks.net): Probably the most well-known and frequently mentioned AVR resource, the AVR Freaks site is filled with guides, articles, and advice from experts in their forum.
* [Extreme Electronics](http://extremeelectronics.co.in/): This site has 50+ AVR tutorials covering a number of topics, including many common operations such as PWM, communication with I2C, TWI, etc. I like it because it has a lot of tutorials showing how to interface AVR microcontrollers with other devices, like sensors, motors, servos, and LCD screens. Though not as well-written or in-depth as NewbieHack.com or AVRFreaks.net, there is plenty of helpful information to be found there.
* [Engineers Garage](http://engineersgarage.com): This site has dozens of project examples and tutorials, not only for AVR microcontrollers, but also for the PIC and 8051 chips. Many of the guides/tutorials also include video and code examples (although you have to be a registered user to view the code examples - registration is free).

There are many, many other sites out there that have very helpful guides (that's why I've written this post -- I want you to help me find them!  :)   ). I've mentioned the ones above simply because they've been the most helpful to me.

Please add the **best AVR resources** you know of, so we can build a solid list of books, tutorials, video guides, etc. to help newbies like me learn how to Make with these awesome microcontrollers! Thank you

Who else sends free samples?,Tectonic23,46,4,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/lwiiw/i_ordered_a_few_samples_for_my_electronics/,"[Linear Technology](http://linear.com)'s pusle generator as described by their [Application Note 94 (pdf)](http://www.linear.com/docs/4183) is the project I'm building. I recently got my hands on an old Tektronix 2465B Analog Oscilloscope and I wanted to test a square wave with sub-nanosecond rise-time to see how well this old workhorse is doing. This will allow me to test the horizontal and vertical signal paths and see how tired they are after a lifetime of use. My school does not have the equipment to test this, not remotely. My teachers tell me that the equipment we use has never been calibrated and most of it it 15+ years old. This is not a problem for basic electronics or even basic digital classes since their old 100MHz digital scopes are overkill for the lab homework of the students. Unfortunately, we have no pulse generators. We have function generators but the rise time on those is quite slow.    
    
I still feel I'm in a giant playground and I have to experiment as much as I can while I have access to all sorts of equipment I don't have at home. As much as I'd like to complement my old oscilloscope with function generators, digital dc power supplies, logic analyzers, and SMD rework station, etc etc... I simply won't have the means to do so in the near future. Same goes for costly electronics experiments.     
    
Thanks to a few companies though, I've been able to source samples for most of the project. Without these, I wouldn't be doing this due to my limited budget until I graduate.
    
[Linear Technology](http://www.linear.com) has shipped me 5 different ICs (2 of each one) for me to use in this pulse generator as well as an avalanche pulse generator they have in another application note. Some of these are $5-10 a piece when ordered from Digikey so the cost of the project becomes non-trivial for students such as myself. [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com) is another great company which mailed me samples. I received 3 different microcontrollers, and some DC/DC converters. I smell fun projects ahead!    
    
Now if I could only find a source of samples for FPGAs and Actel's Fusion mixed signal chips....     /drool

This is my entry for the 555 design contest. I decided to make an education video so that people learning electronics can also learn robotics. A lot of this work stems from my research in to analog biomorphic robotic systems. One can see a provisional application (the patent was never filed so this is an open source concept (unless memresistors are used) titled a [Synthetic Nervous System for Robotics](http://www.google.com/patents?id=Y0WjAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

This is really just the tip of the iceberg and I'll be making some more videos related to simple adaptive analog motor control, neural networks, oscillating infinite state machines and biomorphic robotics geared towards the hobby and education community. 

This video articulate some of the core concepts of analog robotics:

I have not seen this before.,burtonmkz,42,5,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/19nrs8/what_was_happening_with_my_digital_voltmeter_i/,"I was looking to measure the voltage across the terminals of a 12v lead-acid battery supplying power to a 3A bilge pump.  The pump runs normally and doesn't appear to be doing anything weird, and the circuit is a direct connection with two components: pump and battery.

When I read the voltage of the *unconnected* battery, it's close to nominal, depending on charge level.  

When I connect the pump (the pump pumps water), the digital voltmeter screen gives me ""garbage"".  It either indicates out of range, or all the segments are displayed simultaneously (i.e. 1888), sometimes fluctuating back and forth between them. This happens on all ranges (up to 200VDC), and even more mysteriously, it happens with *all* the digital multimeters I tried.  There is no significant measurable AC voltage.

I figured some funny business must have been happening with the pump (due to inductance), so I put an oscilloscope on the terminals, and it shows a nice steady ~12v.

In other words, the oscilloscope shows everything is fine, but all my multimeters (measuring DC voltage) go crazy.

What's going on?

Even the ones that at face value would seem to be ludicrously unreliable (e.g. those ribbon cable quick-connects with the V-shaped contacts that cut into the insulation) work perfectly well.  Good crimp contacts are designed to be reliable without needing solder.  

On the other hand, I don't do production assembly and I have the extra 10 seconds to spare for the extra step.  The soldering iron is right there on my bench, and a solder bond seems more reliable than a friction/pressure contact.  Why not put a tiny drop of solder on there, just to make sure?

What does [/r/electronics](/r/electronics) think?

EDIT: A few technical details:

Control architecture

* OSX Application sends commands as to what color the lights should be set to, and how long to fade them
* Arduino manages fading the lights evenly between colors - sends commands to the 6 control boards via I2C
* ATTINY85 on control board recieves I2C commands and generates a PWM signal to dim the LEDs
* ATTINY85 also calibrates the requested brightness with the CIE human lightness response curve (the eye is non-linear) 

Power Circuitry

* AC input converted to 36V DC for the LEDs and 5V DC for the arduino
* LEDs driven by 3 channel LT3496 in buck topology

All the soldering was purposeful, so it wasn't like drawing something with wires and solder.

I saw this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/vgksj/the_bullduino_arrived_xpost_from_diy/

And decided to apply for team /r/Electronics... and was ACCEPTED!

-------------------------------------

/r/electronics,

Welcome to Red Bull Creation Version 2.0.12. The adventure is just beginning.

Here is what you need to do next: 

- Use the Bullduino application kit. Build something you love. Have a great time in the process. Pretty simple. 
- Upload a short video introducing the team and your Creation to the link below by July 3. 
- Please make sure your video is in one of the following formats: MP4, H.264, or FLV. 
- Please keep your video under 2 min.

Red Bull Creation is an ""un-competition"". It's all about creativity and having fun. Qualifier judging is based on a combination of technical skill, creativity, and awesomeness (awesomeness is almost impossible to define, but you always know it when you see it).

Please upload your video by July 3rd using the following log-in info.
Login:*****************
Password:*******************
http://creation.redbullusa.com/admin

Our judging/ selection committee will then pick 12 teams to compete in the 72-hour build-off for the Top Creator alias. Finalists will be announced July 9th.

Thank you for creating, and godspeed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our team will be hosted entirely online (or if there is a large group of you that live close to each other, I might be tempted to ship the builduino to you guys). I'm way open to suggestions but we do need an immediate videographer and someone with an idea. 

Let's have a discussion but, ultimately, I want the Mods to make a final decision because, after all, it is Team /r/electronics.",,False,self,t5_2qhue,1340848700.0,,,True,t3_vpv67,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/vpv67/relectronics_we_were_accepted_into_the_red_bull/,

I've come to the point that I'm eager to try some new software and see what's out there. I tried out Eagle recently, and although the component libraries were expansive, the interface and tools felt horrendously awkward and unintuitive. I had a brief peek at DesignSpark PCB as well, and I've gotta say I love the access to online libraries but haven't seen much of the interface.

I've written a very short list of what I would consider necessary features of a PCB design sofware...

* Intuitive and convenient interface
* Hotkeys for tools and commands
* Expansive libraries with various symbols and footprints
* Straightforward and easy to use symbol/footprint creator for when those unusual parts crop up

I'm interested in MCU/CPU history and was studying the Fairchild F8 just recently so I thought it would be interesting to point out this one.

F8 was introduced in 1975, year after Intel 8080 (which is at the origin of x86 architecture) and year before Zilog Z80 which improved upon the 8080 design. The system used just two chips and had onchip 64 byte scratchpad RAM as well as interrupt handling and several I/O ports. Mostek was selected as second source for this chip and two years later it came with integrated one chip solution, the MK3870, one of the first microcontrollers.

But even before this, Intel got inspired by the F8's features and in 1976 designed the 8048 single chip microcontroller. From there it's short way to modern micros through the all time classic, Intel 8051, made in 1980. Perhaps the most important feature at the time was integrating serial port (UART) module as well as 16-bit timers. All these were ROM or EPROM, only decade later reprogrammable Flash variants became appearing.

To this day there are still many chips based on 8051 core and modern microcontrollers which are pin compatible with the original (for example the AVR based ATmega8515). It all started with the Fairchild F8, almost 40 years ago.

[Picture of the IC, this one was made in late 1976](http://cdn.cpu-world.com/CPUs/3850/L_Fairchild-38501DC%20(wgg\).jpg)

This is how we can kill it.](http://hackaday.com/2011/02/11/how-the-arduino-won-this-is-how-we-can-kill-it/)** - Hack a Day

I just stumbled onto this article. It made me realize what a n00b I am in hardware land and also how wide open the possibilities are if I'm willing to put in the effort to learn (and never stop). Made me realize that there's soooo much I don't know about electronics that I don't even have a clue as to how much I don't know.

So that post was definitely an eye-opener and in some ways a bit disappointing, like someone popped my Arduino balloon, or finding out that Santa Claus isn't real. But on the other hand, it is always nice to be introduced to reality, however harsh it might be. Reading the post made me realize that there's a lot to learn, and that the only way to go is up (i.e. towards more success with hardware hacking). It was also very encouraging, because it made me realize that if I can acquire the requisite knowledge, then there is virtually no limit to what I can make.

Where should I go from here? What is the best path to the knowledge I need to advance?

Background:
In addition to being a web developer by day (for the past 12 years), I'm also a hobby roboticist (since about five months ago). I'm really loving the Arduino platform, too. I have one semi-autonomous robot (based on the [Magician chassis](http://www.robotshop.com/productinfo.aspx?pc=RB-Dag-47&amp;lang=en-US) that is about 85-90% ""complete"" (really, I doubt it will ever be complete - I'll continue to improve it while there is still room on the chassis). 

I also have an RC jeep that I'm converting into an autonomous rover. It is not roving autonomously yet, but the DC motors (steering and propulsion) are working, controlled by an UNO and an [Ardumoto motor controller shield](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9815).

I'm approxmiately 80% through the excellent Make: Electronics book by Charles Platt.

**tl;dr**
I am a n00bie roboticist who is totally enthralled with electronics and very excited about learning more. All of my experience to date has been with Arduino. What should my next steps (e.g. books, school, online tutorials/videos/classes) be to advance beyond n00bness?

The AVR is an ATmega328P, clocked at 12 MHz, and comes with a bootloader. The bootloader means you do not need to buy an AVR programmer. And unlike many cheap Arduino derivatives, you are not required to own a FTDI cable or any sort of USB-serial converter.

There's a 3.3V voltage regulator on the board itself and a jumper allows you to choose between running the device at 5V or 3.3V.

The USB circuitry is based off V-USB's recommended hardware. You can develop USB devices using the V-USB code. I have a 15 minute video screencast tutorial showing you wire-by-wire and line-by-line how to create a RFID tag reading USB keyboard http://frank.circleofcurrent.com/index.php?page=usnoobie_rfid_keyboard

Here's another short guide on how to start writing computer applications that communicate with USB devices http://frank.circleofcurrent.com/index.php?page=startlibusbdotnet

And if you are confused about writing USB HID report descriptors required to make simple ""driver-less"" devices such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks, I covered that here http://frank.circleofcurrent.com/index.php?page=hid_tutorial_1

1355787426.0,25,self.electronics,150rcz,Budget Hobby Scope/Logic Analyzer ?,Frans-Willem,26,1,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/150rcz/budget_hobby_scopelogic_analyzer/,"I suspect this question will have been asked a lot, however I wasn't able to find a clear-cut answer to the question.
I'm a software engineer with a great interest in electronics. I don't intend to do anything with it professionally, but I love tinkering with it in my spare time. At this point I've got quite a bit of experience with AVR's, already designed my own (tiny) PCB, and have a neat lighting solution with WS2801 based LED-strips. All of this just with my trusty Arduino, (cheap-)multimeter, and soldering iron.

Usually I get by with loads of debugging, reading datasheets, and sometimes reading Arduino libs (if you're unsure of how to drive something, google for an arduino lib, and it should get you started :)). However, often I feel like things would be so much easier if I would just be able to take a look at the signals I'm generating, or take a look at the signals something else is putting out.

Seeing as I intend to upgrade my LED-strips to different chips that use a single wire protocol (which will be a lot more difficult to get right than a simple 2-wire SPI protocol), I figured it's probably time to save up some money and buy either a scope or a logic analyzer.

I've spotted the following that seem to be affordable on a hobby budget, but am unsure of which is right for me:

* BusPirate like device
* Saleae Logic, $150
* Saleae Logic 16, $300
* Open Workbench Logic Sniffer, $50
* DSO Nano v2, $90

The Bus Pirate seems like a bad choice, seeing as I'll want to be using it for non-standard protocols, and the website itself states that, although possible, it's not meant to be used as a logic analyzer.

The Saleae Logic (16) seems to be used all over the place, and seems to be properly backed by a reliable company. However, at over 3x the price of the Open Workbench one, i'm not sure if it'll be worth the money. Apart from that I'm afraid that if I go with the normal version, I'll regret it in the future when I wish I'd gotten the Logic 16 (which is even more expensive!)

The Open Workbench Logic Sniffer is fully open-source, and I love that about it. Also for the $50 price-tag, I'm not sure if I should even be considering the other options. However, it appears that the recording length is limited by it's internal memory, whereas (for example) the Saleae Logic will be able to ""stream"" it live to the PC and are as such unlimited. I don't think I'll ever need to record something for more than a few seconds, but I can't find out how much space is on the device.

The DSO Nano v2 looks nice, and has the advantage of also supporting analogue signals. However, it's only got one channel, so no debugging of multi-wire protocols, and in general it feels more like a gimmick than an actual tool.

I believe my best bet would be either a Saleae Logic or the Open Workbench Logic Sniffer. I'm tempted to buy the latter, as I'm just not sure if the Saleae is really worth 3x the money, and if I'd go for the Saleae I'm afraid I'll end up needing some higher frequency stuff that only the Logic 16 would've been able to handle.

What are your thoughts on this? Did I overlook any other options?

TL;DR: Want a budget scope/logic analyzer for hobby purposes. Is the Saleae Logic really worth the money, or would the Open Workbench Logic Sniffer be good enough for most cases ?",,False,self,t5_2qhue,False,,,True,t3_150rcz,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/150rcz/budget_hobby_scopelogic_analyzer/,

The trigger coil for Xenon flash tubes!              
http://www.xenonflashtubes.com/tc-36.html

That example has 190 Volts upped to 6,000 volts!

I've got the parts, but I want to run it past people here first, before I burn out another transistor. =)

The charge circuit connects to the 'cap via a diode to produce the DC it needs right? Otherwise the cap would be getting the AC from the oscillator direct, and not charge (and get damaged?).

So, if I were to connect the primary coil of the trigger transformer to the oscillator's output, before the diode gets to it, I should be getting a ~300 volt AC wave wiggling the magnetic filed in the trigger transformer, and I should see a nice healthy ~6000 to ~12000 volt potential on the second winding?

I can't find a site that lets me dial in voltage, and shows the spark produced - based on one atmosphere, 70 degree temp, and 30% humidity.... but I'm hoping for a few millimeters?

Does anyone have any thoughts on this high-voltage generator? Problems I may have? Should I leave the large 'cap connected, or remove it? Would the power going through the coil damage the transistor?

All these things I don't know!

Thanks!

(Also pictures if I get a fuzzy spark from it!)
