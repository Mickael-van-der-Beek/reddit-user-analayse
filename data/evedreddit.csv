Im so sorry to be the one telling you guys this.
I don't really know anyone from Dreddit, but from what i know my friend was well known amongst you guys.

My dear friend Tony better known as R76983, passed away this morning, he was a capital pilot amongst you guys.
Im chocked about this, and i dont exactly think this is the right thing to do, to break the news to you guys, but this was the only way to let his friends in TEST know

Im so sorry

RIP R76983




Edit 2: new message from R7's family 


Hello. From the bottom of my heart I'd like to thank you all for the tributes and kind words I have read. I now think of Tony flying high and fast among the stars, and I thank you, Elizabeth, Tony's mum.
I'd like to introduce you to R76983...

1323691583.0,156,self.evedreddit,n9kv8,First few days in Dreddit.,Evian_Drinker,192,36,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/n9kv8/first_few_days_in_dreddit/,"So i joined up on a whim after stumbling into the 21 day invite thread last Friday - Dodeca Hedron providing me with the initial invite, pointing me towards the Reddit Wiki and guiding me through the first (confusing as hell) hours.

By the time i had completed the Military and Industrial tutorials i figured i knew everything i needed to know to play Eve and was enjoying flying towards stuff to see if my ship would blow up (kind of disappointed their is no collision damage tbh).

Then my application for TEST got approved and i realized just how little i knew. Everyone on Team Speak 3 and in Corp chat were speaking English - but it made no sense to me. People kept talking about ""Dictors, PI and Poeses"".

Luckily no-one in DeeDeeReddit shouts at you for asking dumb ass questions so i only every seem to be in the dark for a few moments at a time (that and the Wiki). Within an hour i was in Curse being given a handful of free ships (most of the mods wouldn't work at this point due to me learning Survey to lvl 3 for the first day!) and then managed to fuck up the first two fleet instructions as Madlof Chev tried herding cats with us - teaching the basics of flying internet spaceships in combat.

He and Nikolai did kill me mind, so I think we're even.

As i went to collect another ship Pidgin popped up. letting me know a fleet was forming in H-ADOC. 

Thanks to a Family Christmas party (hosted by My wife and I) the next day I already had my wife giving evil eyes as I joined the fleet. Given my experience during the rest of the day I figured I would be dead within minutes anyway so largely ignored her and tried to figure out how to warp to a Titan (by the way these things are fucking huge).

Moments later we're on the other side of Eve and I’ve lost the fleet again - I warp in to a random member @10km as the fleet jumps to another system. Burning to the gate (I can use a Micro Warp Drive by this point) we jump into the hostile fleet as they sit off gate.

It's around now that someone in DeeDeeReddit mentions that Tengu's, Skimitars and Command Ships are the most prized ones to tackle. Since i have no idea what a command ship looks like and all the Skimitars are 100km away from me I frantically Zerg towards the nearest Tengu 30km away...

28km...

25km...

Fuck I've forgotten to turn on my MWD. The hostiles warp out, we follow and land 30km from them again. 

Second chance.

I activate the Drive and get shot before I start moving. A Tengu on my Overview has a red box around it - i vaguely remember that means something bad so i lock him up and head towards him. Second volley hits me and my armour vanishes slipping into hull. The FC shouts to get tackle on a Tengu as they warp out again. At this point i'm still zooming towards the Tengu - 18km away. I Wonder what the range is on my Warp Scrambler and decide to try to activate it anyway. It turns green and a little icon appears next to the Tengu. Moments later the fleet catches up and melt his ship. Thankfully i think he shit bricks at some point as he thankfully stopped shooting me at 20% hull.

Over the next few minutes i tackled a few more and learnt the value of keeping distance from the enemy fleet until tackle is called for.

In the afterglow of the fleet my name got passed around. Shadoo the FC donated 500 million ISk to me as a thank you for getting the first Tengu, moments later 50 separate pilots did the same. My wallet exploded to over a billion isk. A few hours before i had been wondering if i would ever afford a 1.2 million high speed manoeuvring skill book and now i had no concept of just how much isk i had.

My first night playing Eve wrenched me from pure terror, to utter glee in moments. Flying through a fleet of 150 heavily armoured battleships - trading blows with another fleet 100km away was a thing of beauty. The though of going back to empire and running missions (or god forbid mining) now seems like an alien concept.

Thank you to everyone in Dreddit, i'm now fuly subbed so will hopefully be dying gloriously in more fleets to come.

Mind I’ve since turned down my settings so  my PC doesn't melt though the desk, and may need a divorce lawyer soon.

I'd like to work with you in the future though on other ops now that you know I'm capable of massive destruction.  No hate, seriously.  This is just the only way i could get it done and win.  If i gave you the $1000, i wouldn't be winning at all.  I know that paying $1000 in game time to some guy on the internet is a sign of weakness.  However, backstabbing that person on the other hand, is pure profit.  I totally do like talking to you, and again, sorry it had to be this way.. but I had to get the ends.

I know this isn't likely to go over well, but I figure you should know why you just drove away someone very interested in EVE and the idea of an EVE/reddit community.

Know what?  Sure you're not thinking ""homosexual"" when you type it but you damn well know what faggot means.  I'm gay and that shit really fucking stings.

For the most part I have a pretty thick skin and I can deal with it once in a while, esp. from enemies in-game but from my ""allies""?  It's been a goddamn non-stop fest of LOL FAG AIDS TRANNY FAGGOT THAT'S SO GAY that ... well --shrug--

I've been assaulted IRL for being gay and know what they yelled?  ""Fuck you faggot"".

I don't know, I kinda expected you guys to be a bit more mature.  I thought, hey Eve looks like a game that attracts more than your typical 12 year old idiot, and Redditors are usually a pretty cool and intelligent bunch.  Guess not?

I play games to get away from this sort of shit.

If you are a ""Lurker"" and have a reddit account that just *barely* meets the requirements to get in or has a lack of comments/recent comments then the only way for me to check you are actually a lurker is to view your voting history.

So save us both time and make your voting public. 
&gt; You can allow us to view your votes by enabling it in the preferences section of Reddit, named ""make my votes public"".

**Do not submit applications for all your alts.**

This is very annoying. If you do not have at least one character in TEST do not submit alt applications. Apply with your main and then once you are in you can shit up the queue with lots of alt apps. I'll be withdrawing alt applications when I notice them, you can resubmit the app if/when you get in.

**Don't:** Shit up the queue with alts when you aren't already a member of TEST.

**Do:** Add the api of alt accounts and wait till you get into Dreddit to submit applications for all your alts.

**Do not submit applications if you don't meet the requirements.**

You might laugh at this, we get some apps with messages like *""oh, I don't meet the minimum requirements but I'm a coolbro and really want to get in, hope this is ok""*. Sorry, but no. Requirements are requirements. They aren't up for negotiation unless they have been approved by a director.

**In-game apps:**

Please for the sake of this bag of kittens I have ready to throw into a river, make sure you also submit an in-game application along with the auth app. Also, don't submit an in-game app without having an auth application.

**Those with roles in current corp:**

Try to drop roles and have the in-game app ready to accept. Don't worry, I won't get :mad: about this. You may be in the position of wanting to stay in your current corp if you don't manage to get accepted, which is cool. But if you are going to leave that terrible high sec pubbie corp anyway, you may as well prepare and get those roles dropped. Saves waiting in the application queue for an extra 24 hours.

**Use the message feature in auth.**

Sometimes you are asked to change or update something. You probably got a message from a specific HR drone when replying to them that you fixed it, try to also add the message to your app. That way you don't have to wait for that specific HR guy to sort it out. The next person who checks your app can see you have updated it.

**Don't be in Jita 4-4 while you have an application open.**

If you get accepted while you're in Jita 4-4. Kiss your ass goodbye. We are constantly at war with terrible ""pvp"" high sec corps who do nothing but camp the Jita undock. 

** A Word about our Joining Requirements:**

Please don't take the joining requirements as some sort end goal to reach to get in and then be done with reddit. That isn't the point. The point is to let Redditors in. I've said it a million times already, you don't necessarily need to comment lots but if you expect any HR person to believe you are a ""lurker"" you need to have the voting history to back up your claim. Also, don't be an idiot and quote the joining requirements and demand to get in, you will come across as a massive asshole and will probably destroy any chance of ever getting in. We know what our own requirements are, you don't have to quote them to us.

edit: [Killboard link. Jeremaya Bones's Rupture named ""Fugly""](http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12915)          
           
Residents of OWXT certainly recognize the name. That guy roamed our space for some time like he owned it. I started observing him. Watching intel channels reportings when he was away. Scanning with my directional while he was in local, looking for some kind of pattern I can take advantage of. I think he got complacent... I nailed him that way.

I found out I often could spot him within scanner range of the station but rarely (never?) on the station’s grid itself. Planet IV being an obvious nearby spot, I warped there without expectations whatsoever. BAM! Rupture in overview, flying away at maximum forward speed. 300+ km off warp to 0 beacon. He disappeared a moment later. I could not see his egress vector at this point as he warped/fell off grid out too soon for that. Narrowing the directional scanner was fruitless. He was just gone. I recall he jumped out of OWXT shortly after. Tough luck! But now I have a nail on him. 

Of course, he returned after some times. I positioned by Harbinger on the station, working out the directional scanner. It took a little while but, once again, I got a close range spike for a Rupture named “Fugly”. I warped blind to Planet IV at zero in a hurry. Look at what I found... This time, he was a meagre 125..130 km away, in a perfect line with 3T7-M8 stargate. At this point, Im fairly certain he likes to warp to P IV at 100 from 3T7 gate, presumably to scan the station. It seam to be part of his patrol pattern. That’s why I think he got complacent. He showed a pattern and kept showing it. I locked my throttle to “rabbit” and burned toward him. At some point he even turned back and approached me but he must have said fuck it and warped out to some unknown point in space. I reported this precious intel into dk_surveillance.

Next round, I know exactly where to be. I warped to 3T7 gate then right back at Planet IV at 100km, positioned myself 5..10km in a line between wt100 spot and the gate. Sit and wait. I didn’t wait long. Maybe 3 minutes.. felt like 3 weeks, actually. 

BAM! He landed exactly where I expected him to land. Spot on. Everything happened so fast. Go go Warrior IIs. I overloaded the entire top rack. My shields basically vanished in a blink. My armor went down to 50% in another blink. Meanwhile his shields were at/or near peak recharge (35%?). At this point, I thought he had me by the balls. I declared my catch everywhere I could by printing “wwwwww” in various channels including deedeereddit like the noob I am. My brain was in panic mode. You guys know how it goes, right?. Among all that excitement, I collected sufficient presence to “look at” his ship and place myself essentially in formation with him. This dropped transversal to low double digits in a pinch. Meanwhile intel chan’s people are like “wow, totally usefull and shit”. Made me giggle, actually. 8jane formed fleet with me. At this point im entering structure. He is in very low armor. I turn OFF overheat as my guns are about to burn out. I have hope. I think I can win this fight actually... and I did! Fugly exploded. His pod escaped by less than a second. 8jane landed next to me just after the fight ended. My hands are left shaking due to the adrenaline inrush and the victory’s exaltation. 

I won this by a thread, honestly. With Heavy Beam IIs loaded with Xray M. My only tank was a DCII. No shit. 45% structure left. Full gank mode worked this time.

All his stuff is for sale in OWXT station actual at or (slightly) under regional average. Thanks you for shopping in OWXT. ",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,True,,,True,t3_csxim,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/csxim/first_solo_kill_thats_where_it_begin/,

'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the station,  
Not a TESTie was stirring, save for some masturbation.  
The Rifters were docked on their platforms with care,  
In hopes that -A- soon would be there.

The newbros were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While memories of gudfites played out in their heads.  
My cat in his collar and I wearing naught,  
Had just settled down after many Serpentis rats fought.

When out of the station there arose such a clatter,  
I undocked in my Manticore to see what was the matter.  
My grid slowly loaded, red, brightly lit,  
And I docked the hell back up, because holy fucking shit.

The planet with it's dark side made the ships stand out,  
-A- had come knocking, ready for a bout.  
So I raised the alarm, klaxons blaring over and under,  
The pilots arose, and the war machine mustered.

One FC stood alone, ready to fight,  
He gathered his men and flew into the night.  
More rapid than rockets his brave pilots flew out,  
And he cued his mic, called battle-comms, and started to shout:

""Now Dictors! now Hictors! now Logis and 'Nados!  
On Talos! on Naga! on Drake and on Phobos!  
From the top of the grid, and let our weapons shoot true,  
Primary, secondary, DO NOT SHOOT BLUES!""

Like kindling before an open flame will burn,  
A terrible lesson the -A- badposters quickly learned.  
So out of the bubbles the sperglords aligned,  
With TEST in pursuit, naught but conquest in mind.

And then, like an angry god, I heard on the Mumble,  
""Make them burn, make them plea, make them all crumble!""  
As I kicked on my 'burner, and was making a run,  
A red cyno went up, and they brought in the big guns.

There were titans and dreadnoughts, carriers and supers.  
We watched as they appeared, quietly, in a stupor.  
In tight formation they flew, reps linking them all,  
The subcap fleet huddling under their protective pall.

Their guns, how they thundered! Their fighters, how they flew!  
The battle was lost, we knew we were through.  
When in our ears the comms started blaring,  
Fear not dear TESTies, our capitals are preparing!

Galvanized we flew into the enemy's maw,  
Missiles streaking, lasers blasting us raw.  
Our ceptors gave us warpin's deep in their ranks,  
They were certain to die, but they'd have our thanks.

Our capitals undocked, carriers and dreads,  
With Foxcat support, lasers streaking overhead.  
The carriers triaged, the dreadnoughts sieged,  
And what happened next had to be seen to be believed.

Bombers uncloaked, and let loose their load,  
And one by one the enemies started to explode.  
Railguns, blasters, rockets and arty,  
All of this was a recipe for one hell of a party.

The battle was over, the good guys had won.  
The smoke was clearing, the shooting was done.  
And as legions of Noctises salvaged their loot,  
The FC exclaimed, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a salute!""

1336395031.0,84,self.evedreddit,tb380,The Deadliest Catch: How TEST is the best place ever for newbros!,,127,43,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/tb380/the_deadliest_catch_how_test_is_the_best_place/,"I started typing up a lengthy story of my day in true ""Guillane in Local against AAA"" style, but realised I couldn't even read through it all myself, so here's the ""short story""!


It is an early Monday morning, and I am merrily beltratting for lack of better ideas. I have a fellow newbro with me that I found in deedeereddit that salvages anything I manage to kill, and hopefully the income was decent for the both of us. We even manage to find a Shadow Serpentis Captain at one point! Alas, no fantastic drops from that one...


We go on with this for a little while until...


I warp into a belt, and see how three rat battleships warp in. Nothing strange there I think, and begin locking them up. I suddenly notice one of the battleships has a different name from the usual spawns. I even have to read it out loud to believe it.


*""Tuvan Orth""*.


I can hardly believe it! First a Shadow Serpentis, and now this guy worth 21M ISK! And then I start to realize I have no idea what I'm doing.


His first salvo hits me, and my shields decide they have something better to do than hang around my ship.


Second salvo, and half my armour is gone on my armour tanked Cane, and a light gently flickers in my head that hitting the warp button would be a fantastic idea right about now.


Third salvo hits. *Half hull left*. I hit Shift+R and hope the drones manage to make it back in time! The ones that don't will have to fend for themselves! I've just remembered there's a officer-free repair-party in station, and my ship's invited!


Fourth salvo hits... My Hurricane turns into another Minmatar ship, or possibly a wreck. I'm not sure yet. All I know is that I'm in a pod, and this guy just stopped my unstoppable Cane. I warn the salvaging newbro of the dangers of the belt so he doesn't get himself killed. And then I think to myself:


""*But this guy is surely worth a lot! I hope someone around here has a ship capable of killing him so this isn't a complete waste!*""


I make an announcement in Alliance for the faction spawn (turns out it's called an officer, not a faction spawn. Thank you DJ Rubbie. :3). I notice some of my Hurricane-stuff survived the explosion, and I warp myself back to get my cloaky Bestower in the hopes of saving some of it. When I return, there's already 5 Tengu's fighting Orth. Not before long, he explodes and I can uncloak my Hauler. It takes 30 seconds before I can lock onto my own wreck, and I already see a Tengu nibbling on my wreck.


Recover of 9 million in modules + ship insurance, not very bad at all! \o/


I can see the Alliance chat lights up with all the incredible modules that were looted! Things worth upwards of 10 billion ISK in total - insane! Verb Object is kind enough to remind me I could ask for a finders fee, and I wouldn't say no to one of those. :)


The response from the looter was somewhat underwhelming though:

""LMAO THIS IS TEST, NOT A CHARITY""


Slightly sad about the response, he also reminds me never to tell anyone about when I find an officer. The giant group of wonderful TESTies I've come to learn and love now is not slow to remind me it's more about finding a *trusty* person to share it with. Having left it there, I would have been slightly heartbroken about getting my ship destroyed, but having learned a valuable lesson. This guy went further though, and kept letting me know how much he gained from it, without even a single 'thanks'. :|

I was naïve. I thought all of TEST was filled with the most wonderful people on the planet, many of which I've already chatted with. Now I know there are also greedy people, spais and awoxers, and I should be a little more selective. **What happened next was incredible though.**


I may have lost my piece of the cake of an incredible spawn, but now I was reminded why TEST is awesome! People rallied up and backed me up, asking for nothing in return! Forum threads were started, I had to give my wallet CPR due to it drowning in ISK and I got a new fitted Hurricane and a lovely Shadow Serpentis EANM! I'd love to post the names of everyone who helped me, and who came to the defence of a newbro, they deserve all the love and appreciation from this event! &lt;3


Moral of the story:

1) If you're a newbro in TEST, the people in TEST are incredible but you still have to pick who you can really trust.

2) Don't announce officer spawns in Alliance chat, it's very silly and shouldn't be done. Also, tickling officers in a Hurricane is a very bad idea, don't let any more innocent Canes die.

2) I'm bad at counting and writing stories from actual events.

3) For every bad apple in TEST, there's at least 100 people in huge ships ready to help and defend you!

TEST is just the best alliance with the most wonderful people I've ever seen!

(long and detailed)",KainX,95,12,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/coy9l/guide_to_t2_frigates_helping_new_and_old_players/,"Ok this is my first post on Reddit so bear with me.

 My in-game name is Andreya. I played Eve for around 4 years, have 72 mill SP, only ever logged in to blow things up. And to this day, I cannot fit and fly a battleship all of my frigate related skills are maxed out.. I have spent +90% of my Eve career in T2 frigate and destroyer hulls. Hence why I am writing this guide. Everything in this guide is highly opinionated. I am just speaking from years of heavy PvP experience.

 I find a lot of players wondering which race to train. There is millions of variables in picking your faction, so I am going to explain them to the best of my ability to help you guide you in the right direction. There will be some newbie info, but also for more seasoned players

 Each faction has their pros and cons. No faction 'sucks', they all just appeal to different playstyles.

 Each ship will have a description. If the description claims the ship is redundant, I will explain that usually another ship in the same class can do the job better, or the same, but cheaper. Keep in mind, Eve is nothing but variables, and situational, and these 'opinions' are just based on my personal experience.

 Lets cut the babble and get to the guide.

 Also Rockets are a weapon system built for frigates, however they are complete rubbish currently, and the Eve community has been waiting for a buff to rockets for some time now. so when describing a ship with rockets, keep in mind, they may suck now, but have huge potential when rockets are fixed. Also, I rarely to never go out to pvp without a MWD on a frigate. 

  Lets get on with it.

---

**Assault Frigates**

* Caldari Harpy: This ship is a Sniper, its got dual bonus to range. if you put blasters on it, it becomes redundant. she can shoot 100km with around 90 dps with railguns. she doesnt hit hard, but shes great in war decs against poor newb corps. The Harpy can be useful to have one in major fleet fights, just one is needed to send every enemy pilot back to a gooey filled clone vat bay. *However*, the Cormorant is a cheap T1 'frigate module classed' ship, shoots around 95% as hard as the Harpy, and just as far. but has 50% better tracking at a fraction of the price! The Harpy does have a higher survivability but i prefer the tracking of the Cormorant. The Harpy simply is not worth the isk/efficiency ratio. If you want blasters, get a ishkur, a moa or a cormorant. This ship is just sorta flown 'for the fun of it'.

* Caldari Hawk: Can be fitted with missiles or rockets. the missiles hit like a girl, you may as well fly a crow instead for a bit less damage output but all the perks of being in an inty. you *could* fit rockets, but untill they are fixed, not an option. skip this AF, grab a T1 kestrel or a crow instead.

* Amarr Vengeance: This is a tanked out rocket platform. She has the potential to become one of the most ruthless annoying little shits in the world when they fix rockets. untill then, nothing but a hard to kill Paralysis Tick. It definately has the greatest tanking potential of all frigates. (Bonus note, the T1 very the punisher can be tanked out to have near game breaking amount of EHP, and is amazing in T1 frig warfare)

* Amarr Retribution: This ship needs to go die in a fire. it has one mid slot meaning no tackling gear. meaning, what the hell are you doing in this frig in the first place. she has par level DPS. and thats *it*. Do your gang a favour and never step into one of these, leave it to the PVE. *Any* T1 combat cruiser, or AF is better. Frigates are meant to tackle, so i'd prefer to see a punisher, or a rifter in my gang ovef this failboat. Do *not* fly this ship!

* Minmatar Jaguar: aka the mini Vagabond. The best, or tied for the best of all AFs. Its fast, has a great shield tank, and par DPS. Main reason why i favor this ship is because 95% of the ships that *can* catch you, can be killed by you. Everything you can catch, you may not be able to solo kill it, but you will be able to hold it long enough for your friends to kill. Dont screw around with a well piloted Jaguar. he will either kill you, or not be killed by you. either way, it ends up in the Jaguars favor.

* Minmatar Wolf: Meh, not many valid reason to fly this over the Jaguar. If you *really* want to use artilleries, get a damn thrasher. Unless your epeen dictates you flying expansive ships at the sacrifice of flying something more usefull in the gang. She has a weak tank because of the lack of explosion resist, you could plug that hole, but at a cost to your damage or mobility. However, the Wolf does hurt a lot. If your in cruiser and above, and the Wolf has a nos, and can tank/kill your drones, and *somehow* managed to get on top of you with an AB, your screwed.

* Gallente Ishkur: This ship will smack the crap out of anything it can land on. Shes packing the highest DPS of the frigs. she has a great slot layout, and uses drones. To sum up the Ishkur, is she is par across the board with the exception of her hitting like a brick. You can have loads of different effective setups for nearly any situation. Can even be used for PVE. A ‘Jack of all trades, but the master of *one*’ and that is, breaking faces.

* Gallente Enyo: Decent ship. hits like a brick, but isnt quite as good as the Ishkur. This ship can often be made redundant by a cheap T1 cruiser, or some other AFs. Similar to the Wolf.

 Assault Frigate Summary/Notes: Untill they fix the 'missing bonus' on assault frigates, the do not really have a role in Eve, other than for fun. Sadly AFs can easily be outperformed by T1 cruisers and do not fill a niche that other frigates can. However, the Jaguar is an excellent tackler, and the Ishkur will eat your children. 

---

**Interceptors** (there are two types, ones with combat bonus's and one with tackling bonus's) Inty are great to start PvPing with. If nothing can catch you, nothing can kill you. So if you die, its usually your own fault. Which, you learn from. If your wanting cheap practice first, grab a T1 Rifter of Vigil to get a feel for it

* Caldari Crow (combat): This is a common all time favorite for good reason, it deals reliable although weak damage from outside webrange. Therefore making it a safe option. A crow in a hands of a good pilot will last a very long time. its got par speed, so just watch out for other intys, and battleship neuts. A great tackler, but dont expect to tickle too many people to death unless you got a magazine to read.

* Caldari Raptor (tackler): Redundant, nearly every aspect of this inty can be done better by another inty. sorry to say but the only reason you use this ship is for its cheap price tag, and or cannot fly a different faction.

* Amarr Crusader (combat): Fastest inty (although it should be the claw) great damage, chasing one of these in an inty to kill it often results in your own death. Not the greatest inty, but definately worth flying, and very fun to fly

* Amarr Malediction (tackler): This inty has amazing potential, but currently rockets in Eve are horrifically underpowered, so avoid this one untill they are fixed. once (if) they are fixed, this will be a beast

* Minmatar Claw (combat): Very similar to the Crusader. but your dealing with different firing optimals, and the claw can fit a Nosferatu. very fast, very quick lock time. Impressive DPS for an inty. However, it has extremely short lock range, and doesnt shine in any specific aspect anymore than any other intys out there.

* Minmatar Stiletto (tackler): This, without a doubt, no argument, is the best tackling inty. Its the only inty with 4 midslots. and thats all that matters. by definition of a proper tackler, the Stiletto takes the cake. If your a new T2 frig pilot, and wanting to help your veteran PvP friends, this is a ship thats usually welcome in any gang.

* Gallente Taranis (combat): One of the most fun intys, It has the highest DPS by a longshot, easy to fit, and simple battle tactics to live by. however you must pick your targets wisely, and the Ranis is a little slow. pack a nos on this and you can try your luck with larger targets like cruisers because if your neuted in a ranis, your dead. This is one of the few Solo intys that really shine. some crazy kills can be pulled off in one of these. a DCU is often seen as a requirement, is nearly doubles its EHP (effective hit points). A smart, well piloted Ranis can terrorize a system full of carebears. Read Sun Tzu’s the Art of War if you want to master this ship.

* Gallente Ares (tackler): Avoid this, just like the raptor. Only useful for tackling. Yet there are other intys can do the job better.

 Interceptor Summary/Notes: Intys are fun, cheap, and useful in any gang. I recommend if you start flying T2 frigates, you start with the Interceptors. Each race has a decent inty. but if your wanting to be a true interceptor whos job is to catch targets, get a Stiletto. if you want safe-*ish* mode, get a Crow. If your foolish/brave and want some crazy solo kills, get a Taranis.

This is simple, post in the thread if you want an extended 21 day invite and you will be contacted by reply or by PM by dozens of nerds looking to get you into EVE. 

The 21 day buddy invite is beneficial to the inviter as well if you end up subscribing, and as such most people offering up invites will also offer you in-game monetary incentives. Typically we've seen numbers between 100-150m isk, which is a TON of money for a brand new player. 

Also we now have 60 day invites, but these offer no incentive for the inviter. These 60 day trials have the same limitations as the 21 day invites (and the 14 day trials found on the eveonline.com site) but give you 2 months to start learning the game. If you would like one of these invites, feel free to request one and someone will likely contact you with one. 




* Looking for an invite? Reply to this post and request one
* Looking to send out invites? Sort through the new posts and reply

Remember these are invites to play EVE **NOT TO JOIN DREDDIT**. If you are looking to join Dreddit and feel you qualify, or want to get a feel for the game before you join up, you are in the right place. 

Also keep in mind that these 21 day invites are NOT compatible with CD-keys (like you would get from buying EVE through Steam). If you use a CD key, your inviter gets nothing and it really screws them over - if you make a deal with someone to accept money for an invite, do not use a CD key. 

Edit: Don't post that you have invites, everyone has them. Post if you need one, and look for those posts if you have one. 

Edit 2: For those of you who are new to this, invites must be used to create new accounts. You cannot use them to add time to your current subscription, or to reactivate an old account.

News  
**PayPal no longer a valid payment option** for the Buddy Program reported by: CCP Navigator | 2012.01.23 18:15:17  
As of Monday, January 23 we have removed PayPal as a payment option for the buddy program due to an exploit discovered with this payment method. The [1] terms and conditions of the program have been updated.  
Players, who from now on, select PayPal as a payment option for their buddy account will have to contact customer support as **the reward will not be given out. **~~


Thanks for pointing that out, Scalar Angulargf/Jazzy_Josh

I am a nobody, just random guy in EVE - Currently in BNI.  I gained a lot of respect for you guys a few weeks ago when you left the souther coalition and your leader announced that TEST is all about fun and gudfights.  I also flew for a bit with MoA up in PB and was blue to you then as well and so far I've found that TEST members are basically good bros.

That being said, I am sincerely rooting for you all in the current war.  I see you guys as the ""good guys"" etc. etc. in EVE.  I know that as a single pilot there's not much I can do to to help in the grand scheme, but I would glady come support/add another gun to your fleets or be cannon fodder do whatever I can do assist you.  

Anyway.  Good luck!",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_1fv6kk,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/1fv6kk/good_luck_test/,

I was ratting in 6VDT, I know it's stupid to rat in such a populated place, but it was my first time ratting, ever. I wanted to get a feel for it before wandering to another system.

I'm minding my own business taking on two BS's when suddenly a wild Manticore appeared 20km out. ""SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!"" First thing I do is attempt to warp out. I set my warp out and recall my drones. Suddenly I realize I'm not warping.

BLAM! A rocket hits me and I lose 20% of my shields. I see two more rockets on the way and try to warp again. I then realize that he's got a warp disruptor on me. I'm not getting away...

BLAM! Another rocket hits me, another 20% of my shields gone.

""No nonononono! I can't afford to lose another hurricane! This one is supposed to be paying for the next one!""

I am forced to make a decision. I set my orbit around him at 1000m. I turn on my MWD, I burn at him as fast as I can.

BLAM! My shields are blaring in my ear. down to 23%

I'm closing in on him, it's my only hope. I lock my target and launch my drones about 15km out. Go get em' little hammerhead I's!

12km

11km

10km

I activate my guns and score my first hit. 60% of his shields disappear and I realize I have hope. Another hit! he's down to 80% armor. Another hit brings him down farther.

""I'm doing it! I can win this! Take that, and that, and that you little bastard!""

Then suddenly he blows up. His pod turned around and warped off. I'm left sitting there, shaking. I realize that I'm still being shot by the rats and decide to take care of them real fast after looting my Manticore buddy.

I feel brain dead at this point. ""What just happened? Where am I?""

I return and dock up. Shaking..... Nervous.... Proud.



----------------------------------------------------------------------
I know I did a lot wrong to get into this fight, but I am happy that when put in this situation I was able to make a split-second decision and do what needed to be done.

I've been in plenty of fights during my short 25 days here, but never one that forced me to take this chance. When solo I've always either died instantly, or warped away in time.


And of course..... The killmail!

Im a returning Eve player with alot of clay on my hands that i had intended on using to make props for a pathfinder game but decided to use for this project instead.

Originally i was gonna go with something alittle more elaborate, outlined with [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/MczNi.jpg) snazzy diagram, but by the time i finished i was near out of clay and figured i had already pushed my luck with just mmd himself.

After extensive research on youtube i used some groundwire to fleshout some kind of frame and wrapped it up in tinfoil [LIKE SO](http://i.imgur.com/HZTpo.jpg).  Then proceded to layer it up with clay.  I have to admit though.  This whole thing took several hours and for the first half of this time i thought to myself more than once ""Maybe they'll pity me...""  But i pushed on with a healthy dose of resolve and stubbornness and slowly something half decent started to show itself outlined [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/jpKUE.jpg).

At this point i thought it was done and was quite satisfied with the results but then i remembered reptiles have scaly skin so out of sheer curiousity i started picking at it figuring i could just smooth it out if i screwed up as it was still quite wet.  But again i surprised myself with what happened and threw caution to the wind as i started carve into it like i knew what i was doing and turned [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/O6Z9i.jpg) into [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ZtnUa.jpg) ending with [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/N8IJq.jpg).

Again i thoguht i was done.  Though over the next few days i would take some time to clean it up and smooth it out leaving me with [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5UVyv.jpg).

This is where i knew i could screw things up now.  While i could copy drawings fairly well with decent accuracy in highschool, i never bothered with painting or coloring things.  This was new territory for me.  Without giving it a second thought i just went at it with some acrylic paint and ended up with this sexy [MIB](http://i.imgur.com/lAfeG.jpg) sitting on my desk. BUUUT Noo, i wasnt done yet.  I whipped out some mod podge to finally call this project [DONE](http://i.imgur.com/VgMRD.jpg).

To be honest i really shocked myself with this thing and am quite proud that i actually pulled this off.  So irregardless of being accepted i have to thank you guys for letting me know i could do this.  Just a week ago i would have laughed if i was told i could.

So next time i run into a blob of reds by myself i can look up to [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/b9DFq.jpg) and think i have a chance of surviving... then get blown up :D",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_11j9v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/11j9v0/arts_crafts_clay_mmd_scuplture/,

**tl;dr, starting in 2 weeks, all Dreddit members will be required to have both Teamspeak and Jabber services set up on your auth account.
**   

Some people seem to have manufactured the idea that Dreddit being full of dead weight and j4g pubbies. It probably has some truth to it, but who the fuck cares, they pay for your reimbursements, heyoooooo


That said, we do have some strange problem with people joining up with Dreddit but deciding not to join into the greater community. If you've read the subreddit ever (it's getting better, really - btw post more on the subreddit) you should pretty much understand that Dreddit is looking for more REDDITORS to join our COMMUNITY, not just people to join our eve corp and only that.


I know forcing members to set up Jabber and Teamspeak won't necessarily bring people into the community. That said, I find it kind of dumb (and some directors seem to agree) that we have ... I think almost 200 people who are in the corporation and refuse to at least put forth the 5 minutes to set up these services so generously provided and maintained by Matalok and Aevum. Not that you cannot be a part of the greater B0RT without Teamspeak or Jabber, but the two services are fairly critical to the community as a whole and are basically necessary for you to contribute (in most ways) to the corporation, and furthermore the alliance.


For those of you who are new or uninformed, Jabber is text-based and allows us to send mass broadcasts to all online members for important things, or to advertise fleets or other fun stuff for you to do. Jabber also allows you to join various (text-based) chatrooms to talk to people outside of EVE. Teamspeak is a voice server and is downright required for almost any TEST-run operation. 


So if you would like to remain in corporation in two weeks' time, go on to your auth.pleaseignore.com account and add the Jabber and Teamspeak services and make sure they are both functioning correctly. 


If you need help setting up your auth account, please read [this \(public\) article](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Auth)   
If you need help setting up your Jabber or Teamspeak services, please read these two public articles:  
[Jabber](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Jabber)  
[Teamspeak](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Teamspeak)  
At this time, we are not REQUIRING you to set up external services such as Goonfleet Jabber/mumble, but it would be a good idea while you're at it.
If you need help figuring any of this stuff out, feel free to ask in the ingame channel deedeereddit, as always.


If you're deaf or illiterate (hah), please mail me or another Dreddit director so we can note an exception in your auth account - or just set the damn thing up anyway just in case.


If you are removed because of this in two weeks' time, you will NOT be blacklisted and will be allowed to re-apply to Dreddit and get a second try. If you abuse this for some reason and are kicked multiple times, you will be asked not to return if not outright blacklisted from rejoining.


Any questions, send me a private mail or post in this thread

E: to clarify, starting in 2 weeks anyone who has been in the corp for more than 2 weeks and has not added these two services to their auth account will be kicked out. Restating differently: All members have 2 weeks to get these services added to their auth account, or you get purged.

Being only a week into Dreddit, and even though I knew a lot of the basics already, I figured I'd join up to learn a bit more. SilentMajority calmly and clearly explained a bunch of the game mechanics, fielding questions left and right, and I got to learn a whole lot of things I didn't even know existed before.

Managed to get the drop on a couple neuts, SM was lavish with his praise (""Oh, you tackled him, you're a hero!"", etc.), and we all had a blast learning. Then, outta goddamn nowhere, we hop through a gate and find Brack Region on the other side. Way more of them than us. A dozen newbros cried out at once, myself included. ""OH GOD, DON'T JUMP. THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND OF THEM. WE'RE DEAD."" ""JESUS WHAT OH NO PLEASE GOD.""

Like a beacon of warm, squishy light, SM's voice checked the comms.

""Shh. It's okay. Shhhhh.""

A wave of calm washed over me.

""Here's what we're going to do. We're going to jump on the broadcasted target at the same time and blow the fuck out of him and then die gloriously. We still have 30 seconds on our session timers. Any questions?"" 

My only response was ""Let's do it!""

Like a swarm of second graders leaving school for summer vacation, we poured out of our gate cloak and swarmed the enemy. Streaks of laser fire tore through space, cutting many of us to ribbons, podkilling those unfortunate enough to have lost our ships in the bubbles.

We got a few kills, but they tore us to shreds. We all learned something very valuable, and SM's calm, soothing baritone guided us safely back home.

Thanks, SilentMajority, from all of us in the fleet. You're a credit to your profession.

Current Intel and Analysis

17-08-2011


As evidence has continued to show from a fight a few nights ago and other actions taken by Gonnswarm Federation and Test Alliance Please Ignore. It now seems certain that GSF and TEST have agreements with the DRF to assist in the taking of Delve and Querious for their own purposes. They consistantly were late to aid NC forces when the DRF was invading the north and often found excuses not to come in at all. Sources i have found inside of GSF and TEST have confirmed that they are actively in contact with Nothern Coalition., Evoke, and Raiden. high command for an assault on Delve. 


This is part of an extended plan by the DRF to take over all of null sec before October 2011. The DRF are aiming to holkd all the null sec space they can by that time so that their reliance on Super Capitals will not cause an total colapse of their comabt capability. It has eben noted on many ocasions that the DRF and their extended alliances power base seem to have no ability to run support gangs. They continue to depend upon the power of the super capitals in all engagements even if they are deployed or not. They are starting to recongive that this percieved threat wiull be going away in Octover and thus are aiming for total dominance now.


White Noise, the center of leadership for the DRF, are starting to push all avaliable rescources to the conquest of Against All Authorities. The DRF see -A- as the last major alliance power block standing in their way. At this point they are all but counting the victory agianst them as a done deal. After -A- falls they wiull then recind all association and dealing with Stain Wagon and begin to take out Red Overlords and Stain Empire. After the onquest of all that space is complete they will start to commit forces into Blood Raider space.


Evoke and Ewoks were sent to Delve as a distraction force against the allies of -A-. They did not expect to have Morsus Mihi and Brick Squad all but abandon their assault on Nulli Secunda and TEST pet alliances in favor of attacking the Evoke infrastructure and fleet logistics. Evoke was not prepared to deal with an extended engagement with RAWR and BR1CK. As a result Evoke has made an extended effort to deal with RAWR and BR1CK and has cost them a good portion of their fighting force. As a result forces that were slated for operations against -A- have been moved to deal with the growing issue in Delve. Evoke has been unable to distract the forces of -A- away from the DRF as a result of major action with RAWR and BR1CK.


GSF and TEST had already staed their inbtrest in taking back Delve from the invaders and have been in contact with NC. and Evoke to facilitate this. AS a result there appears to be an agreement for coioperative action in Delve between the Decline Colaition and the DRF. In addition Raiden has placed supers in low sec within jump range of 1DH-SX. Raiden has brought all but about 150 supers down from the north and placed them in either HED or in low sec. NC. and Evoke are doing the same. At last check GSF and TEST are moving a large quantity of super capitals and material power. The direction is assumed to be Delve.


As it stands the DRF appear to have an agreement with DC for the final dividing of the last free areas of null sec. They are stagiong to put this plan into action and are aiming to completely own all avaliable space in eve by the begining of October. DRF view the remaining alliences not under their control as bumps in the road. It should be noted that atleast 5 of the major players in the DRF are running major defficates to make sure that they conquest all of eve. Their logistics trains and the lack of major market movement because they have pushed all the major buyers oout is causing them to not have the equity they are neededing to keep the war machine running.


DRF are betting that they have all the power needed to over run the rest of eve and hold it until to sov and super capital changes that are slated to come. they are quickly realizing that they are sevierly lacking in a good and consistent tactical doctrine that will allow them to fight on eve grounds with their enemies. Instead of adressing this they are just bguilding mroe super capitals and depending on the likes of Evoke, NC., and Pandemic Legion to cover their flaws. After being shown that Evoke and NC. are no longer able to consitantly win fights they are going for their end game run now. Expect to see DRF satart to significantly boost the number of super capitals in the hands of their allies to shore up the short commings of not having a good support fleet.


Pandemic Legion has gone mostly inactive. Most of their memeber have not logged because they are not enjoying the game anymore. Many of the members are now regretting the action they took in siding with the DRF and destroying what many of themsaw as a consistent and fun place to get fight (Northern Coalition Territory) and now that they are on a perminant retainter with the DRF they see the extremelly low risk and extremelly low effort PvP as more boaring then anything. Shadoo has not been logging on consistantly for the past 3 weeks and many other members of the leadership team seem to be inactive. At this point it is doubtful that if the DRF call them, that Pandemic Legion would respond.


DRF are aiming to take Providence as of right now. This is aimed at completely cutting off all normal acess to empire for -A- and Stain Wagon. They have assigned this task to NC. and Raiden. Starting this weekend the DRF will start to mass seige -A- space and try to break all will from -A- in one massive assault. This assault will be putting a massive strain on the DRF and they are depending on iontimidation rather then force to keep -A- quiet. They are looking at a time table fo the total destruction of -A- to be completed by the first of september. Or at least be far enough along to not make a difference. Disaster for them would be if their assault stalls for whatever reason.


CCP have staed to many that if the DRF as a whole manage to take over most of null sect to the point that no other force would be allowed in without their saying then drastic changes will occure.

Some of you have already tried out my concierge service via the forums, but I know a large portion of TEST doesn't even read them, so I'm offering the service here as well in the hopes of getting some more traffic from dreddit at the very least.

If you want things that aren't available in fountain or simply don't want to pay the huge mark-up of the things that ARE available, my service is for you.  Instead of charging 25-50%+ markup,  I will get you anything (that can fit in a JF) for the Jita cost + a flat 15% fee.

I will custom fit ships to your specifications or just get you the hull.

If you're just looking for particular mods or whatever, I can get those for you as well.

All you have to do is submit an order, and I will take care of the logistics and deliver the items to you at either 6VDT or in Deklein at VFK.

If you're interested in placing an order you can do so [via my thread in services offered](https://forum.pleaseignore.com/topic/7789-xels-fountaindeployment-concierge-service/).

Please check it out.  Prices are so FUCKTEST in fountain currently, that you can even use this and turn around and still sell the items for a profit w/o having to get over to jita, and deal with JF services to get it there in the first place.

This is all the convenience of buying in fountain without the markup cost.

I delivery within 24-48 hours and offer same day delivery for those time sensitive order!

I also offer a [scrapyard](https://forum.pleaseignore.com/topic/7424-xels-buy-all-your-shit-anywhere-in-fountain-scrapyard/) if you salvage or are looking to clear out your hangers but don't want to deal with babysitting sell orders. **Edit: Now paying 20% more for your junk!**

Please upvote this post for which I receive no karma so that more can see the service :3

**Edit: I have a promo running (it's in my latest post below). Check it out!**",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,True,,,True,t3_q56tk,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/q56tk/no_one_reads_the_forums_so_im_offering_this/,

Losing this system would be, to put it lightly, disastrous.  If -A- gets control of 49-, they will be able to launch large attacks across Delve with relative ease.  This is a threat to **every**. **single**. **person**.  in TEST

We can **not** let this happen.

I know that there are some of you out there who don't participate in the forums, don't get onto mumble, don't log on to Jabber.  You're missing out on the best part of TEST if you don't change that.  Seriously, get on the forums and read about the ops, get on jabber and wait for pings, and get in mumble to Bacon Bar it up before the battle.

Some of you think that you'll be useless in a fleet battle, that a Rifter serves no purpose in 1000 man engagements, or that it's the end of the world if you lose your ship.  You're wrong.  Tonight, you'll be some of our most valuable assets.

I'm here to tell you that we need *every last one of you* in this battle tonight.  We don't just want to defend the system, we want to fucking **wipe the floor** with -A-.  They've won three large battles in a row, they're cocky as fuck, and they're threatening our homeland.

Good evening, fellow B0rtlings. 

If you read this forum, you know that I am the new Dreddit CEO (as of last week). I'm sure the decision to find a separate corp CEO was a tough one; some people welcome the idea and others seem to think this will lead to our doom. I can only promise that I'll do my best to keep everything running smoothly.

Many of you know me, from various places, but for the rest of you I guess I should tell a little about myself. I'm 20 years old IRL (which I think makes me the youngest CEO in TEST now that E115 is gone), a college junior going for a comp. science degree. I've been a Redditor for about a year and a half, I've played EVE for almost 3 years now off and on, and I joined Dreddit in April last year. I've been helping new players for about 10 months, I've been the head mentor in TEST for about 4.
Oh and I should back up a step and say my finals are next week, and I've had tons of final projects due this week - hence the delay on this post.

]Why a Dreddit CEO?

A few reasons. Some people - like me - think Dreddit needs our own leader to take care of the corp. In the past the Dreddit CEO has always been the alliance executor, and typically hasn't had enough time to address the concerns and needs of our corp directly. Instead Dreddit has been treated simply as part of TEST.
My job is to look after the needs of the corporation, to keep us effectively functioning and (hopefully) happy. We will of course remain in TEST and Rob3r will retain the actual CEO role in-game. I am not here to refuse alliance directives on behalf of the corp, I am here to see that we follow them in a way that satisfies alliance leadership and corp membership alike.
I will retain whatever position I had in the alliance training department; however, I will delegate more duties out to other people instead of taking care of them all myself. 

I've been reading through various posts in this board and others, I've been watching jabber, I've been talking to people in-game when I have the time, and I've discussed a few things in private with certain people. I've seen a lot of suggestions for things that need to be changed, implemented, removed, etc. I have taken note of as many as I can manage (literally... written them down by hand. I have more handwritten notes for EVE than school).I have been, and will be, contacting people both in private and on the forums for more ideas and help in better developing them. I don't want to make closed private decisions all on my own, I don't think that's how a reddit-based corporation should work. 

Speaking of Reddit, I fully intend to use the subreddit more often for corporation discussions. I think the reddit style is a little more effective for certain things. If the need arises, I MAY look into making a private subreddit for corp discussions, but for now we'll continue using the forums for anything that needs to stay private. For starters, I'm crossposting this to the subreddit and I'll do an AMA for you guys as well :D. I will post here or send an in-game mail whenever I do something important on the subreddit, but I would like to see the continued and possibly expanded usage of /r/evedreddit. I'm really happy to load up the board and see posts that AREN'T about ""hay i want to join the corp brup brup brup,"" and I would love to see more activity there still. 

One last concern that I'll address right now is the approachability of leadership. Again, a whole lot of you already know me or have spoken to me. Don't think of me as some back-room decision making politician. I am your personal representative to the rest of alliance leadership, I am YOUR CEO. If you ever have a problem, suggestion, question, whatever - feel free to talk to me. You can reach me on the forums in a PM, on Jabber most of the time, or by in-game mail. Granted, I do have finals next week, so mail is probably your best bet right now - but please, get in touch with me if you ever have anything important (or unimportant!) you want to talk about. I still actually log into EVE when I have time, so you'll see me in fleets, chats, and (my favorite) deedeereddit. 

On that note, thanks for all the well wishes, and I look forward to being your CEO.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,ceoColor ceoText,True,t3_hb2k6,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/hb2k6/iam_your_new_ceo_boodabooda_ama/,

We've got several issues with this, so ill try to cover them point by point. 

* Name similarity

Our names are very close to each other, we can't complain too much on this because we modeled our name after one of the most popular Reddit posts of all time. However Test Outfit Please Ignore denies that they selected the name because of the popularity of our organization. I believe this is a lie, I've had at least one of them admit to me in a PM that the name was selected _because of us_, not _because of the Reddit post_. 

In addition to this, 2-3 of the moderators and several members of Test Outfit Please Ignore have been in Test Alliance Please Ignore before. 

**Update**: [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/iltzf/would_anyone_be_interested_in_forming_a_reddit/c24uny0) appears to be the start of them using the name of Test, and it specifically references Test Alliance Please Ignore. Any notion that this name was derived from the post is false, it was selected _because of us_.

* Logo issue

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/1339ls/sorry_to_drop_by_dreddit_but_can_someone_inform/) popped up asking for the artist of the Honey Badger Coalition logo. No leadership was contacted prior to this post and the post wasn't directed at leadership. Artists absolutely own the rights to any work they do, however in this situation the image is being used for an organization - no attempt was made to contact the organization about this issue until after it had blown up. 

In addition to this the poster claims he found the image while searching on Google for 'reddit'. I call bullshit. Go try it, search on Google for reddit and see if you can find our logo. You won't. Even if you did you would likely find it being linked pleaseignore.com, or an EVE article about us. He said he had _no idea_ what it was being used for. The link in his post is [http://i.imgur.com/5copD.png](http://i.imgur.com/5copD.png) and when you [Google that](http://tinyurl.com/d6tqgpa) all you get are links about EVE and our organization using this.

* Art asset usage

Early on they were using a number of art assets very similar to some of our propaganda, this of course can be tied to us both using the 'TEST' name and finding common images to share that theme. However within the context of the above issues it comes off as very unoriginal. They've largely removed these assets and switched to unique branding though.

* The [TEST] tag

Test Outfit Please Ignore grabbed the [TEST] tag before we could reserve it for ourselves. This has already created confusion for our newbies getting into the game. We are currently in a different outfit in combination with PL and others, but we may break off into our own eventually. Not having the TEST tag at the very least is restricted to our branding options. I can't really fault them for grabbing it, but its still a point of contention. 

* Moderator censorship

Moderators are basically deleting and hiding any discussion of issues on the /r/testoutfit subreddit, last time I checked [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TestOutfit/comments/13vt8h/naming_issue/) was deleted. Not allowing the conversation to happen at all seems entirely contrary to the Reddit ~culture~. We are very much anti-censorship whenever possible and we regularly allow open discussion of controversial issues. When a moderator has to resort to deleting and hiding posts because they are angry, that is the sign of a bad leader.

* Arrogance

Nothing seems to set our organization off more than dealing with arrogance or elitism. A lot of the posts by the Test Outfit guys are along the lines of ""We are bigger then you in Planetside 2, go away"". We dealt with this mentality very early on in our EVE career, as did our mentors Goonswarm. It tends to be a rallying cry for us to step up our game and prove the other side wrong. The way they've handled the situation and the attempts at trolling have just inflamed membership interest in this issue.

and for whatever reason, all of test was in the cargo hold or something. so, then all the enemies start taking our sov, and we cant do anything about it because were all trapped in the ship. 

so, everyone is shitting bricks and yelling at me, and i have no idea what to do. somehow i have a mouse in the pilots area, and i start double clicking on the floor of the command area to steer the ship. then i try to redock with the station, but accidentally crash into it, and we all die. then i woke up.

Rejoined dreddit 2 days ago after a year long hiatus (before which I only played the 14 day trial). I look for open fleets in the finder window because that's what boodabooda told me to do when I was crying of boredom in deedee. I see an interesting fleet lead by horrorgun [Dr_Sandvich]. The title says ""RESCUE MISSION. EXPECT TO DIE"" and the description further read ""Johnathan Alabel has some ships in C3X. We are attempting to rescue them. You will most likely die""

I'm pretty used to dying by now, so I figured, ""what the hell it's a free rifter anyway"" and joined the fleet. I was greeted by a rag-tag group of 5 MUCH more seasoned pilots than me, but welcomed nonetheless. They were already 5 jumps ahead of me so I had to play some catch up. They were awesomely patient for me, I must have asked ""where do I go?/where are you guys?"" at least 5 times. When I finally catch up, they tell me to head straight for the station and accept the contract from Johnathan so that I can fly the ship home. The entire time, Beef Cubes (I think?) was near shitting his pants at the warp gate making sure all was clear. The others waiting for me at the station were joking about spamming trade windows with the reds or something. I dock and accept the contract... but low and behold, I don't have the skills yet to be able to fly the damn ship he gave me. I let them know that on coms.

*""hey ummm... I can't fly this...""*

""JE-SUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!""

""WHAT THE BLOODY HELL!!"" *beef cubes your voice is awesome btw*

""YOU CAN'T FLY THAT?!?!""

""WE'RE SO FUCKED! WHAT DO WE DO NOW?""

""JUST LEAVE IT HERE!!""

""NO, FUCK THAT. HES FLYING SOMETHING ELSE.""

*""guys im so sorry I told you I was new D: D: D:""*

""CAN YOU FLY ANY OF THESE?!? - *lists a few ships* ""

*""ummm that one!"" I picked out a small Incursus*

""FINE. HERE! FUCKING HELL!""

And so it was. On the FC's command we all zerg'd out of the station and flew to the safe spot before getting the all clear from B-cubes at the stargate. The entire trip back, someone was blasting *America, Fuck Yeah* and *Flight Of the Valkyries* over coms so that we could barely hear the FC's jump/warp commands when we came up to gates. This lead to a few of us getting lost, and plenty of lemming jumps. But somehow we miraculously made it back in one piece. No casualties. We even scored some 'rat kills along the way (I got to use the sweet T2 shit on what I was flying. The power!!!) When we got to the station, we all had a laugh about how rag-tag it was and how it somehow worked out ok. I contracted the Incursus back to Johnathan, and he thanked us all with a 10mil donation. 

me: ""wow thanks! you doubled my isk!!""

everyone else: ""...wait what? doubled? how much do you have...?""

me: ""no really, its ok.. I don't need anything, I get it all for free anyway right?""

everyone: ""TAKE A FUCKING SCREENSHOT OF YOUR WALLET AND SHOW US HOW MUCH YOU HAVE!""

me: ""[ummm.... D:](http://i.imgur.com/LtXRj.jpg)"" *at that point only Johnathan knew how much I had because he knew how much ""doubled"" was*

10 seconds later, everyone: ""ok check your wallet now""

me: ""[JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!! WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO WITH THIS MUCH MONEY???](http://i.imgur.com/4RmC6.jpg)""

They had effectively increased my isk by 2500%... I still have no idea what a noob does with this kind of money. This was the shit that I read about in forums about ""hero"" noobs getting showed in isk and having no clue what to do. I am living the dream right now. The whole time I was spazzing out in coms about wtf do I do with all this, they told me, ""you see, we play this game for fun, and this is what it's all about: doing stupid shit with a group of strangers and having an awesome time. Enjoy it! Spend it on whatever you want! Just remember to pass it on when you see someone in the same position as you were :)""

 Good evening, gentlegoons. As you may already know, the NC forces were not able to match the 120-supercapital blob (led by a coalition of vehement anti-blobbers and anti-bluers) in Tribute and so stood down rather than waste their fleets in suicidal gestures (this was the correct decision). The NC as a whole is likely to cease to exist after this engagement (whereupon seven or so full CSAAs will/have died), as key parties have Had Enough With All Of This Nonsense; as a result, there's nothing restraining me from resetting various 'NC Blues' who we don't actually have any relationship with. Going forward RAGE, BCA, OWN, Stella Polaris, United Front Alliance and Majesta Empire are all reset, as well as various 'bullshyt guests' such as Demon Hunters and god knows who else we can find to prune off the list. Violet entity, Cold Steel Alliance, Polar Splendour. Enough, enough! 

Of course, we will remain blue to our core allies in Morsus Mihi and Razor, and our local partners in the Pure Blind region, as well as aiding them in the process of rebuilding after the difficulties of the past few days. Our debts to our friends in Morsus and Razor will not be forgotten; meanwhile, it's hard for me to figure out what we owe 'Cold Steel Alliance', or even who the hell they are.

My first night in I had gotten myself to 1dh, Gotten my test_free rifter, joined a fleet that i saw on jabber and within minutes died to bombs.

I then sat in the station waiting for test_free, assuming they were laughing at my terribleness and not wanting to give me a new rifter, only to receive 14 when they got back and a pat on the head.

The next thing I knew, I was shitting my pants at the awesomeness of one huge titan jumping me across space and time, into a fleet of 50 titans and super capitals to blow up some terrible station which took a total of like 10 seconds.

Then I joined a 'triple o.g.' op which I still have no Idea what that means, but the FC decided I got to be the scout so there we went about 50 jumps deep into stain looking for someone to trash, got on some kill mails, then came home just in time for me to go to bed at 7 a.m.  You magnificent bastards have ruined my sleep 

Its been 8 days and I have honestly not had this much fun and awe at a game before in my life.

I'm excited about the wardec. Are you? If not, you probably don't realize the situation we're in. This is going to be _fun_.

Since we do not have a military director, I will be chairing the preparations for the upcoming war. Bear with me, I have some odd requests.

For those of you who have never been in a war before, let me explain: Someone has decided to pay vast sums of ISK to give us the opportunity to shoot them. Anywhere. Even in High Sec. Their thinking in this is that they will be able to blow up a lot of expensive industrial ships and miners. However, there are a couple of easy and free preparations that we can do to ensure that they're paying for _our_ entertainment and not their own. We are in a unique position at the moment. As we're still sorting out a lot of our organization and command structure, we're not doing much else besides roaming gank operations anyway, so here's what we ask of you - and if you do it, I promise you we will have more fun than they will.

1) Get mumble. Join the mumble server. If you're unclear on how to do this, ask someone in corp chat. I don't care if you don't have a mic, get mumble. Frankly, I don't need to hear you, but I _NEED_ you to hear me.

2) Take some time today and prepare a few ships. These will be the ships that you will fly over the course of the next week or so. I know, a lot of you like mining, a lot of you like missioning, and a lot of you like hauling. Now, however, you're combat pilots. Here's what you need: a t1 frigate with a couple of guns, a warp disrupter (not scrambler), and an afterburner. The rest is up to you. Even if you can, do not put t2 guns on it. Buy the cheapest modules you can find. Make a bunch of these outfits and stash them in a whole bunch of nearby stations. If you're having trouble funding this because you're new, we'll take care of you.

3) Once the war goes hot, do not leave station without the fleet. When the war is on, that is ALL we will be concentrating on in game. There's still a lot of organization that we need to get done _out_ of game, and that can be taken care of outside the game. To reiterate: This is going to be a lot more fun for us than it is for them. It isn't fun to blow up frigates. It especially isn't fun to blow up frigates if you're losing battleships in the process. All operations online will be fleet operations where we hunt war targets. We will lose ships. We will lose some money. We will be drunk.

And that's pretty much it. The rest writes itself. Never talk in local, and never fly without the fleet. They're paying a ton of money to give US this oppurtunity. It's the weekend. Let's party.

I will be donating 3 PLEX, bought with my own ISK, to 3 people who need them to resub back into TEST, I have already bought one for Malin Norphos (SteveyMack on Reddit) so I have 2 to go.

Anyone who wants to donate PLEX to this cause can either hit me up here, buy them in game and donate directly to me to hand out or to the guys who need them, or you can drop ISK in my account, my main is M'jolnir and my alt is Gungnir Odin-Spear.

To qualify to a PLEX you must adhere to the following:-

1. Be a part of TEST already.
2. Be too poor to sub yourself (Don't try to hog on the PLEX if you can already afford it or are already subbed, that is a dick move and will be considered bluefucking)
3. Actually want to get into the fight and be a part of the community again.
4. Use the PLEX to sub, not to sell. This would also be a dick move.

These are my conditions, don't worry about the ISK, I stole it off pubbie fucks anyway.

See also Lilia Emunah/Wraiith303 (Eve/Reddit) who is joining me in this endeavour! (Probably).

Donations so far:-

January Seraph - 550mil!

6 or 7 PLEX given out so far I think, I am ill as fuck and can't remember. Keep donating and I will keep buying and handing them out!


One request, if everyone who gets a PLEX could just shout out on the forums so people know this is happeneing that would be ace!

---

*Edit*

So, here's what I've done in those days.

Day 1: Set up a mediclone in CS- and used the ""pod express"" for the first time by visiting the gorgeous Amarrian nebula from Paye and self-destructing on my way to the star. Flew in a whelp cane fleet after using our free ships program to get a Rifter. :3 

I've flown in small gangs before, but never a blob bigger than fifty - so flying with 180-200 hurricanes, tornadoes, and scimitars was amazing. I'll never forget how significant I felt playing a small but vital role in a fleet like that - I was in complete awe when we pulled up to an Erebus.

I started snapping screenshots like none other, and ultimately fired up fraps to get some cool shots - I don't know who runs DredditMOT but I will be sending them my video [in a few weeks] when it's complete and I have enough footage. 

I realized how important we must be to defend that Titan - especially after the nerf and whatnot, since they're not the almighty deities they once were. That night the whelpcane fleet took out a POS and we went home after killing some stealth bombers. Gathered a few corpses. 

---

Day 2: 

Flew around with some camping fleet for a few minutes until my game shat on me - logged back in four hours later and flew in the Maelstrom strategic fleet to take out a few POS's - we encountered a fleet of Against All Authority Tengus along the way, and I pointed a few people and ended up on a few fleet KM's, I bet. It felt awesome as I snagged the first Tengu pilot's pod just as he tried to warp out - watching him be crippled and then blasted to hell by an incoming Maelstrom missile was a great moment. I also saw what I interpreted to be near-full force of our Titan fleet - several capital ships [Revelations and Moros] showed up around the POS's we were destroying to assist, and I saw a cyno light up - and then all of the sudden there's an Avatar, Erebus, and Leviathan right on top of us. Got some more glorious FRAPS footage. Gathered 22 corpses, both friendly and enemies, alike.

A guy piloting a maelstrom contacted me during the fight and said he knew my face from a lowsec system in Amarrian space - reminding me of the time I called him ""dishonourable"" for gatecamping me. We had a good laugh and got back to shooting Tengu pilots, but it really made me appreciate the sandbox for what it is; to see an old enemy - a truly red face who has killed me several times - smile as a red pilot locks his weapons on me, and then blow him to hell. It didn't matter that I mined or did PI in his lowsec system - it mattered right then that we had a common enemy, and we blew the shit out of them. 

I also found an old Goonswarm friend - the guy who met me in my first few hours playing near Pator [with a tengu] - gave me a few million isk, some advice, and then went on his merry way. Eventually I joined a small highsec corp with him, and he's since moved on to TNT. I bumped into him outside the CS- station and we shot eachother for a while.


---

Day 2/3:

Set up my mediclone in 6VDT after the strategic op [around 2 AM] and pod-expressed to Fountain. Beautiful system, talked to a few Redditors and learned more about life in Nullsec.

I set up a jump clone in Fountain by jumping my consciousness to Foves [deep Caldari space, old corp HQ] and sold off a few of my old retrievers and then flew a Mammoth loaded with supplies down to Paye [current highsec home] and tended to my PI / mining. 

Currently sitting in Paye, I intend to float about in Amarrian space for at least 12 more hours and mine / freight things around to gather them up. In a few days my alternate account [not in Dreddit, pure industry char] will have her Providence and my main will have a Charon - at which point I can fly supplies to Tash-Murkon / Jita and make a couple billion. Might make a few trips. :/


---


**The tl;dr-**

I had no idea life in Nullsec was as organized as it seems, and while it *does* take a long time to do certain things, once there is a fleet up-and-running, there is no hope for our enemies.

I'm very impressed with the logistics of TEST / Goons [and any others], and as a previously highsec miner I will now be happy to play a role as hero-rifter in any fleet, for you.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,True,,,True,t3_rp84j,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/rp84j/first_three_days_in_test/,

I've conquered many games (by conquered, I mean ""racked up way too many hours wasting my life staring at pixels""). I hope I can impart some knowledge to others who have never even looked at Eve, saw the news and thought ""damn! I wanna do that"".

* After downloading Eve and logging in, do the tutorials. They don't take long, they're rather easy, and teach you some basic skills you're going to need.
* Follow [this tutorial!](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Newbie_Skill_Plan) (must be logged in) Skills are the ""leveling"" of Eve. You don't grind boars for hours in this game, you set a skill to train, and wait for it to finish (even when you're offline!)
* I'm a watch and learn kind of person, also I like to read and learn. [So this is a great start after reading the link above.](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/New_Member_Guide)


* Also, if you haven't already been accepted to Dreddit and are having issues with your application because you [didn't read](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Joining_Dreddit) the sidebar, [here's your link](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Auth). Oh, [and this!](http://redd.it/kpq9y)

Seriously, those are the 3 (+1 optional) things that will get you started right away. The tutorials are awesome! They're short, simple, provide examples and clear directions. I'm also the type of person that throws the manual away when assembling things or, at most, breeze through the quickstarter guide. The in-game tutorials will get you started on how to operate a your ship, market, clones, etc. The second tutorial (forums) walks you through getting your skills in order ASAP. The 3rd item gets you started down the road to joining Dreddit at home base, getting in to the proper channels for help, and links to other things you'll need to know.

I hope this helps other newbros. [God speed](/r/atheism) (if, you know, you believe in that).",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_17mpcn,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/17mpcn/from_one_newbro_to_another_what_ive_learned_in_35/,

My shitty ol' laptop is nowhere near the specs required to run EVE, so (thankfully, since I'm still in school) I'm not able to play it.


However, EVE makes my imagination shiver every time I even think about it, for so, so, so, so many reasons, it's just such a perfect thing to have in this world, and I'm happy to enjoy it from the sidelines for now. I LOVED reading about what GHSC did to Ubiqua Seraph, and the recent Asakai battle, among other things (I've spent a lot of time reading wikis, forums, etc. but most of the mechanistic details didn't stick because I don't play). 

So, I thought I would make this thread, because I'd like to hear all your best stories about EVE. I know there is eve-history, and other websites like that, but I want to hear all your micro-histories told first-hand! What it was like to start out, political dynamics, a little encounter you'll never forget, whatever. Hit me with your best shot; I'm hungry. I don't give a shit how long or short, or ""boring"" or ""exciting"", you think your posts are, I want all of it!

P.S. If anyone would also like to explain - since EVE is a world that builds itself, what channels do you guys use for ""news""/""happenings""/""various-goings-on"" to keep up to date, etc.?

1266276204.0,58,self.evedreddit,b2g9w,Q&amp;A with FTV,skrunkle,82,24,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/b2g9w/qa_with_ftv/,"Greetings redditors. My name in eve is skrunkle. I am one of the executors of the Fear th3 Vampires alliance. We have been auditing these forums ever since Haskuldr First popped dotblank in alparena. And I have decided to offer you all a chance to talk to one of us in your own environment.

Let me start off by saying that I will probably not respond to trolls or flames. My intention here is only to correct the record on a few misconceptions you all might have about Eve-online in general or FTV specifically.

The first thing I think you all need to know about FTV specifically (and I think you will find this applies in a very general way to most of the people you will come across in eve) is that we are not player haters. We did not start this war out of any sort of animosity towards dreddit or redditors. (in fact reddit.com is a web site that many of us were already familiar with.) We declared war only because you represent many very soft targets. I noticed a post early on after we war deced. The commenter declared that this must be an eve record for time from corp creation to war dec. If that is true, then the record to be noted was not the speed of the declaration but the speed with which the dreddit corporation was growing and filling with trial accounts and other 2010 toons. Any corporation in Eve that grows like yours did should expect multiple war decs within days. FTV was just lucky enough to be the first and therefore the cheapest war dec you now currently hold.

The next thing I would like to mention is your constant references to the gloom puppy movie ""Twilight"". I have never seen nor will I ever watch that schlok. The Fear the Vampires name is over 10 years old and represents a gaming group that has played together in many games across the internet. I cannot answer why that name was chosen because I was not a part of the group when this name was first applied. But I have been playing under the FTV tag in one game or another for years before Twilight so your Edward references go right over my head. :)

Another post that I would like to adress is a post that talked about the FTV killboard having skewed numbers regarding the value of pods. This post claimed that pods are not worth 10 million. and that the total value of the pods should be removed from our efficiency numbers. That commenter is right and wrong in the same breath. The truth is that most of the time pods are worth ALOT MORE than 10 million ISK. Now before all you trial account players start saying that YOUR PODS cost you NOTHING, let me say that your experience is the exception to the rule. It's hard to know for certain because killmails for pods do not include implant loss. But I would hazard a guess that most pod deaths represent about 50 mill. This number is based on a full set of basic implants and no hardwires. 15m each x 5 = 45M + an average of about 5 mill for the upgraded clone needed to not lose skill points when you die after you have more than 900,000 SP = 50M. A quick chat with the killboard admins will turn up that they consider 10M a reasonable middle of the road estimate, considering that in certain cases it's not unheard of for an advanced highly skilled clone to have over 2 billion credits in implants. So relish this time where your pods cost you nothing as this will change quickly once you start progressing in the game.

Next we need to talk about money a bit. The amount of money that any of my main toons is capable of making in eve as opposed to the amount of ISK a trial account toon is capable of bringing in is exponentially different. So when you talk about making this war hurt us because we lost a fully TII fitted and rigged battleship, please realize that a 200M BS represents about 4 hours of ratting. I'm not saying that losing a billion credit legion didn't butt hurt a little :P, I'm just saying that money has totally different meaning to us than it does to a new player, and if you all stick with the game long enough you will find that money will come easily and quickly once you have some piloting skills.

The last thing I would like to address before I leave this to commenter questions (which I will try to respond to as long as you are not asking about things that we consider to be secrets while we are at war.) Is that even though we should be able to converse about this in a friendly manner here don't go thinking that somehow I won't still kill you when I see you on grid in eve. :)

Today we taught MM about the magic of friendship, roaming from M2 as our launch point we roamed the pipes toward 1DH.  We arrived in NOL which Brick had stolen from us and loved and tolerated the shit out of a lovely Mega which just sat on the gate and took our loving.  Like a bitch: http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=178781

We warped to the out gate and sat, spreading words of joy when an Absolution came to play.  We fed him rainbows and he melted under our orbital friendship cannons: http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=178782

We then ventured off toward 1DH catching us a tasty treat, almost as good as cupcakes: http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=178784

And finally reached 1DH and sat on the gate, watching them run about like parasprites in front of a John Phillips Pony concert.  We caught a few slow one: http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=178786

But then they decided they didn't want to be friends anymore and warped in on us with Abbadons and other such things.  Still managed to show one more the magic of friendship: http://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=178825

In the end we taught them all about the Elements of Harmony 631 mil Losses MM : 391 mil Losses TEST

We hope to teach them more about friendship and harmony soon.


Your faithful student.

1360921941.0,51,self.evedreddit,18kp3a,[Arts &amp; Crafts] A custom Dreddit satchel bag,KamaKaZzie,62,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/18kp3a/arts_crafts_a_custom_dreddit_satchel_bag/,"The Dreddit Bag. (pic gallery at the bottom)


When I first conceived the idea to produce this bag I saw it as a way into Dreddit, a corporation that had intrigued me for some time, but due to my lack of available gaming time in EVE I would be unlikely to be granted a place.
Unfortunately the lack of time in EVE is still an issue, but when you’re trying to get your own business up and running your priorities shift somewhat.



Back to the bag.


My first thought was to get the highest resolution images I could of the MMD and the Dreddit logo, in this I was assisted by Syscry/probablyagoat from the HR Department who was kind enough to supply a link to a high resolution copy of the MMD, the Dreddit logo in the correct size and resolution was found via a Google search. I decided that the bag should be large enough to fit a common laptop such as a Mac Book Pro.



The Process. 

I did the Dreddit logo first by taking a tracing directly from the screen of my laptop (not usually the best idea, but if you’re careful quite doable). The tricky part was the transfer to the leather because of the fine detail and lots of straight lines. Once the logo was transferred across by imprinting the cased leather the carving with a swivel knife began, I was soon reminded just how hard it can be with the level of detail present. Once the logo was cut into the leather the stamping began, again the detail made it a slow process. In the end I am pleased with the results, I do not do very much carving or stamping so I was a little concerned how it would turn out.

The MMD was, if anything, more challenging than the Dreddit logo, I started by tracing each line of the image, including the various areas of shading and detail. Once satisfied the tracing was taped to the leather (cased) and imprinted by running a ball point pen carefully over the tracing. Corrections and additions were then made where I had missed areas or the lines did not “look” right.

The outline was then carved with the swivel knife, followed by all the detail. At this point I had to decide how I was going to stamp the demarcation between the colours. In the end I choose to have the darker areas raised and stamp down to the lighter greys, the exception being the outline.

The fun part!
Dyeing the leather! What fun I had with this! The first idea was simply to dilute some black dye with methanol to the desired shade, and while it kinda worked there was no solidity to the colour with the natural leather showing through, I also had to devise a way to do the white areas. I looked at the cost of white acrylic leather paints, but at the same price as a month in EVE (before postage) for a 200ml bottle I was a little put off. The solution turned out to be a 100ml bottle of Kiwi White Sports Shoe dressing. This white paint type liquid was then tinted with black leather dye (Note: It doesn’t like to mix with alcohol based dyes) until I had the shades I desired.


Production times (approximate)… 

Research ran to about 3 hours, selecting and preparing the leather another 2 hours, producing the Dreddit logo 5 hours all up, about the same for the MMD, dying the rest of the bag including using vinegarroon to blacken the strap another 3 hours. Assembly and finishing… 5 hours. 

For a nasty total of approximately 21 hours


The entire bag and hardware is hand stitched with 0.8mm braided polyester thread that has been waxed with bees wax. The final finish is done with Fiebings Resolene acrylic finish.

I hope you enjoyed this write up as much as I enjoyed the challenge of producing the bag.

I left dreddit to found SergalJerk, which is a corp for /r/furry. We're growing at a fair clip and are now the biggest and most active furry corp in EVE. Mainly because I brought the TEST mentality of fun first, srsbsns later mentality with me from Dreddit. 

We've been doing well, despite just about all the EVE community yelling at us the whole time, which simply amuses us.:P We've lived in null with the HBC, thanks to a diplo helping us find a friendly HBC alliance who would take our at the time, tiny and useless corp. They ended up loving our ridiculous fleets and just as we got settled, the HBC died, and Sort dragon demanded our space for his little power tri... Alliance. As the only PVP corp in our alliance, we could not mount a defence, and so we were forced out. Our alliance invited us to go join them with S3N but we felt our loyalties lie with TEST and friends, so we chose to simply evac to highsec as neuts.

Since then this war with goons has started, and our first action was to move our staging system, and start flying little harassing fleets up into their space. This has been wildly effective and we've been picking off ratters pretty much nightly. We've gotten good enough at avoiding/harassing them that our primary source of income is now stealing their data/relic sites out from under them. 

Our very existence is seen as stupid, the furry community is uneasy with us for being redditors, they also fear us for making too much noise and drawing attention to us in game, where they feel we'll be the victims of harassment. The eve community simply hates us because we're a group they don't approve of.:P There's mad all around us but despite it all we've persisted, shown our teeth and fought our way to success and became the ones harassing, not the ones being harassed. 

We have few allies in the game, and TEST diplo has been nice enough to try to find us some ways to help,and we're grateful, but the alliance we've been paired with is kind of serious business, and spent their time getting mad at our newbros, which we refuse to leave behind for any reason. (What good is a corp without a cuddly newbro or two?) 

Basically, we want to fly with TEST proper, we don't need reimbursements, moons, or space/outposts. We just want spots in your fleets so we don't have to spend the rest of our time in game isolated from the rest of our community in dreddit by silly internet spaceship lines.:P I'm hoping by maybe getting some support from you guys on the subreddit we might get leadership's attention on the matter. As we're a reddit corp first and foremost and we might not be able to bring 3000 people to bear, but we know where our loyalties lie.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_1gl8iv,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/1gl8iv/while_on_the_topic_of_reddit_corps_choosing_sides/,

Short version:

* RA moving to Delve, because they cannot win against SOLAR+AAA+Cascade+others. They got an offer to move aside and let the aggressors pass to xXDEATHXx, but they rejected and are generally tired of being a meatshield. They also got an offer from xXDEATHXx to move in to their territories, but that wouldn't change a thing as they would still get stomped, so they want a new, fresh start.

* They want to raise their combat skill and morale so they need softer opponents - that's why Delve is so great apparently. They also want to change the alliance focus to be a NC./PL-style PvP alliance.

* In the end some guy (sounds important) admits that he signed the alliance's death warrant by getting involved in the MACTEP (SOLAR) vs xXDEATHXx war and that is why they are getting destroyed now.

First of all, EVE is a game that favors the proactive - if you don't put yourself out in space you will never get anywhere and you will probably give up. 

&gt; ""But how do I put myself out there? How do I become proactive when I am so new that I can barely work the stupid, overly-complicated overview?

Salvaging is going to be your new friend. You and salvaging will become the very dearest and bestest of BFF's in all of fake internet space. And this is how I made 100 million ISK in 30 days and if you actually put in some effort, which I really didn't, you'll make a whole lot more. 

No, really.

Joining channel noob_salvage is a great start, but it's not the end all be all of salvaging for us noobs. Hours can go by where noob_salvage is filled with tumbleweeds and spiderwebs but that does not mean there isn't any good salvage out there. 

Since we're new we'll have a Thrasher to salvage in. She's a good ship too (and free in test_free) but she isn't very tough so you don't want to wander too far from home alone. But that's okay too.

&gt; ""But I'm so new I don't know where anything is! How do I even know where to go?""

**[GARPA](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/GARPA_Topographical_Survey)**. That's how (click that link to the .zip file). 

You already have [EveMon](http://evemon.battleclinic.com/) to track your training and plan your skills, so what's one more program to keep running on your second monitor? (and really, having a second monitor is really, **really** helpful since ALT-TABing means you have to leave the game screen).

Install GARPA now.

Next, [go here](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Jump_Bridge_List). See that big table? Highlight and select everything in that table under the header (don't highlight the row that says Region, System / POS, Status, Owner, etc, just everything *in the table itself* below that header). Highlighted? Good. Now copy it to your clipboard.

**EDIT : Just go to the page with the jump bridge list, it can be either ours or Goons and ""CTRL-A, CTRL-C"" (Select All then Copy). Then import it into GARPA and it will parse it for you. (thank you, xik)**

Now, in GARPA click the tab that says Data (top left). Now click ""Import Jump Bridges"". Now click the tab on the top of the window that just opened that says ""Import"". You'll now see a button that says ""Push button"". Push that button. 

GARPA has now copied the contents of that table into the program and you now have all our jump bridges. Close the window. Remember to keep the list up to date by repeating all those steps when the jump bridge list wiki page that I linked above changes. I check every single day before I load GARPA.

&gt; ""Okay, great, now what?""

Find 6VDT-H in the map - it's all the way over to the left in Fountain. We are out in the sticks it seems, but whatever and now you can see all the nearby systems. You'll see NDH-NV is one jump away and from there you'll see a dotted line going to DBRN-Z - that's the jump bridge route. 

So now when someone posts in noob_salvage that they have salvage in DBRN-Z you don't have to make 6 jumps. You can just make 2 easy ones.

To use a jump bridge (JB), approach it then click on your capacitor. An option on the drop down list will say something like enter password (I forget what it really is, but it should be obvious). GARPA will tell you what the passwords are (in the table in the bottom right there is a column labeled ""Pass"" - that's the password for each JB in your route) to the various JB so now you can use them. 

Oh, by the way, when you are in system and you can't find the JB because it doesn't show up in your overview - you can use GARPA!

So let's plot a route right now. Find 6VDT-H on the map in GARPA. Now click it on the map itself (that's the giant space on the left). Now, in the upper right of GARPA you will see 2 buttons that say ""use selected"". Push the use selected button next to ""Source"" since that's where you are. Now, find DBRN-Z on the map and click it on the map and click ""use selected"" next to ""Destination"" since that's where you want to go. 

Okay, now under routing options (that's just below the ""use selected"" buttons you just pressed, check ""use all systems"" and make sure ""use jump bridges"" also has a check next to it. 

Great. Now press ""Find route"" (it's just above ""routing options"").

&gt; ""Cool! It's all highlighted on my map!! But, uh, what's all that stuff in the table in the bottom right mean?""

See the column that's labeled ""P-M""? That mean Planet - Moon. That means that when you warp to NDH-NV from 6V you need to warp to Planet 3 Moon 1 (according to this particular example). Once you get there you will see the JB! 

&gt; ""Awesome. Uh, what's ozone?

Ozone is the fuel the JB uses. Don't worry about that right now, but once you get bigger ships, you'll want to add ozone to the JB every so often. No ozone means the JB won't work.

But wait, that's not all! 

When noob_salvage is a ghost town, you can just fly your trusty Thrasher to any of the surrounding systems and ask in the local chat if there is any salvage or, better still, you can use your ships scanner to find your own stuff.

&gt; ""Scanner""?

Yep, scanner. Here's how to scanner.

Go to, say, DBRN-Z and fly to any celestial body (a star is good) and open your people and places. Now open your ship's scanner and do a scan. After 10 seconds the scanner will give you a list of all (or most) the anomalies in that system. Bookmark the Haven's and the Sanctum's (remember to add the code to the BM title which is a 3 letter code followed by a 3 number code and looks like ABC-123). That code is important to keep you BM's straight.

Now fly back to 6V, dock and watch some TV for 20 or so minutes. 

OK, done watching Everybody Loves Raymond reruns? Good, now fly back to where you did your scan, open people and places and do another scan. Have any of the anomalies you listed in your bookmarks not shown up in this new scan? Yes?! Awesome!! - that means someone probably ratted that one and that's why it no longer comes up on your scan. Now, change the titles of your BM's to add in a note to all the possible anomalies that might be salvageable and then warp to within 70-100km of each one on your list. 

At this point you wanna be a little cautious. If all the wrecks show up as white triangles, they belong to someone. You can still salvage them but you don't want to loot the wrecks since they belong to someone else. If all the triangles are blue then you can salvage and loot them. Of course, it's best to ask in local if you can salvage any wrecks before you do anything just to let people know you are there. Most people are quite helpful and it's a good way to make space friends too.

Remember, blue is for you, white is alright but yellow ain't mellow (ugh, that's bad even by my low pun standards).

**EDIT : Also, about the colors of wrecks (thank you, golgol12)**

* Blue - abandoned, anyone can loot, no repercussions
* White - you and your corp can loot,
* Yellow - someone else - if you loot it, they can attack you without concord attacking them. Only applies to non nullsec.

Note, Salvaging does not trigger an aggression countdown or a criminal flag. Looting does. Ninja salvaging is the act of finding people doing missions and salvaging their wrecks.

Not sure but at last count it includes about 8 Carriers, 5-6 Dreads, and Possibly...don't quote me on this...1 Titan.  Is the group strictly a corp right now or are you thinking of spreading out to be an alliance.  Also where are you based out of right now.  I'm just thinking of logistics for moving our cap fleet to you which is always stressful.  Anywho let me know and I'll pass on the info.  Again we're very serious about joining but if it's a Reddit only club that's fine I'll join and bring with me my carrier and dread.

I've only flown with about 3 guys from a different corp (i had no clue i thought they were all part of dreddit). just me toting along in my thrasher, salvaging a little bit from rats, and flying around in a rifter, broadcasting reds in local (i had no clue what any of these terms meant before today either) like a noob.

 This is day 14 on eve for me also . Right when i joined test was when i moved out of highsec/faction warfare space. This wasn't highsec anymore. I was in a different world. I undock from our main station with my little rifter and i see this FLEET. OF DRAKES, a few of these massive rokh's and two Thantos' make this red bubble and fly off into it, just Zip, away. It was amazing. WHAT THE FUCK DID THEY JUST DO.

I go to the forums, read up a bit to find out what i can do in this litle thrasher and immeadiatly set my eyes on flying one of those rokh's. I get a skill plan ready and then go back to eve just to fly around.

 so i go join a fleet, to go see what is happening, and right when i join some -a- come to k6 and think hey lets just kill shit to get their jimmies rustled. I get a new rifter, and join up with this 14 man fleet. I have no clue how any mechanics work, but i remember them being ""Raycats"" and seeing all these drakes. I listen, keep quiet, and just align/jump to where im supposed to. We go fly around for a bit and have our Scout who was baked out of his mind go look for shit. 

So we finally find one place to get some fights goin. I'm this little speck of a rifter inside this fleet of drakes (someone brung a hyperion too). We have 14 of us around this gate waiting. Suddenly we see 2 or 3 -a- jump in, a loki, a oracle, then more oracles, and i blast my microwarpdrive not knowing what else to do but approach what the FC called out and hit my scrambler before i die. 

Suddenly 20-30 oracles jump on in, and so do more ships, tons of them. I can't keep up, and watch as all these drakes drop in seconds. 20 seconds after we started we're all blapped.

So we all laugh about it in coms and i understand the meaning of ""fucking blobbed"". so everyones leaving, and i feel it would be cool to say thanks for the time, because i enjoyed it (i tryed to be quiet as possible because i thought i would get in the way of something) and these guys i flew with shower me with isk. I tell them wait, i'm okay i can make it myself and then i look into my wallet, see 100M. If that isn't icing ontop of the cake. Holy shit.    

My first real time in a fleet i flew around and got completly anihlated in the worst way possible, and it was just damn amazing. so much fun. TEST alliance best alliance.

Thank you all for making me love this game now haha

UPDATE: so apparently after our fleet got blobbed, another TEST fleet of 70 or so went to that system (i think) and actually butchered the ones who killed us. We saw their fleet when we were roaming around. It's cool to be flying around in this game, see a fellow fleet of your alliance, go off to fight and be space raped, then know those guys murdered for your vengeance.

I, with assistance from a fellow redditor, built a [Pink Glittery Rifter](http://i.imgur.com/MX9qh.jpg).

The booms are engines are made from pink insulation foam. The wings and the rest is made from cut glass. It is about 14 inches long and 12 inches wide, and is roughly to scale with the actual ship. Given the medium that was used, a lot of the peripherals and final set of wings would have been either too complicated/too delicate/too much of a bitch to attach, so they were omitted. 

In order to get cuts on the larger pieces, we made a foam cutter out of NiChrome wire and a short circuited wall outlet. Heating the wire to 800ish degrees made it slice right through the foam. [Finished foam cutter](http://i.imgur.com/nw01B.jpg).

Once foam was cut to the rough sizes that were needed, we went to my buddy's glass shop to cut out the wings and connecting pieces. [Glass pre grinding](http://i.imgur.com/iTDje.jpg).  Luckily he has a side business making terrariums and is very skilled with glass working, otherwise this part of the ship would have been either impossible, or turned out like shit.

With the glass cut, the next step was to sand down the foam to make it look less bad.  Sanding foam sucks. Really sucks.  Especially when you break pieces of engine off like I did.  Needless to say this was the most time consuming part of the project. [Foam Sanding Process](http://i.imgur.com/rdcEW.jpg).

After everything was sanded down, final assembly took place, then I was able to paint on glittery glue to make this pink rifter really shine.
[Yes, the sparkles make the ship that much better](http://i.imgur.com/OqCis.jpg).

Currently the glue is drying, and once it is done, it will hang from my wall as a glorious reminder of what it is to be an eve player. 

The [Entire set of pictures](http://imgur.com/a/fRD1y#0) has more cutting, sanding and painting for you, as well as more pictures of the finished product.

Not, like, I'm-a-lazy-gamer-and-I-don't-want-to-go-to-bed insomnia, but actual clinically-proven insomnia. I have to take Trazodone before going to bed.

On top of insomnia, I also suffer from cluster headaches. If you don't know what they are or have never had them, consider yourself lucky. They blow harder than Makalu in a Texas truckstop gloryhole.

Well, so, the Imitrex I take for my headaches, paired with my Trazodone for sleep, gives me some really lucid and oftentimes fucked up dreams.

Last night I dreamed I was my pod pilot, Daionnis. Me and several people whose names I forgot (I know Jonathan Alabel was there, though. Can't forget my Santee!) were flying assfrigs in Geminate for some reason, shooting at a fleet consisting of UAxDeath and a few other people. All of a sudden we got dropped.

Titans as far as the eye could see. I could feel the terror one would feel in that situation. Not like, aw crap, some capitals are on my overview *align and warp*, but as if I were **actually there**. Shit was scary, as we got bubbled by some dictors and locked down and ransomed. Why they were ransoming assfrigs IDK, but all of a sudden a friendly covops decloaked a few hundred km away, and lit a cyno.

Durr, Monty, Booda, Beffah, Dingo, and every other ""VIP"" in TEST came to our aide along with hundreds of drakes and capitals.

The fight was glorious. Titan DD's were going off every other second, fighter bombers were pummeling supers, lasers and missiles and rails were streaking across space. Drones were popping by the dozen, cynos were flashing in and out of existence. The biggest fleet battle I have ever seen in or out of EVE or YouTube videos, and no TiDi. Fweddit came in and reinforced us. -A- bridged in to help UAxDeath. 

It all finally ended when Bombers Bar came into local. Makalu ran, of course, leaving us and the rest of UA's friends. All of a sudden 200+ bombers decloaked and took turns launching volleys of bombs at both fleets. In the end we came out with the most survivors and the least ISK lost.

Bridged back to 6VDT, docked, Miller Time.

I miss this game. I miss you guys.

I made [a label for the beer](http://imgur.com/VjVaH) but I never got around to making a tap handle for it. (BOOOOOO!)

I decided to make a Munich-style Dark lager (although I used ale yeast) and went so far as to emulate the hard water profile of Munich, Germany (hence the cloudy water and minerals being weighed on the scale in photos 6-8 &amp; 11)

[Here's an album of 69 photos](http://imgur.com/a/xqb9s#67) I put together of the process. There were about 30-40 more images, but some of them were blurry or redundant, so I got rid of them. Feel free to ask any questions. The recipe is available upon request.

This was only about $45 of grain/hops/water/etc per 5 gallon batch (I made a double, my brew buddy wanted in) and it came out tasting fantastic. This recipe is going into my regular rotation, and I hope to get a nice buzz from this and tackle my way into a medical clone a few times for you. This has been about 3.5 weeks in the making, and I hope you folks like it. As you'll see in the pictures, I certainly enjoyed it.

We flew around for 2 hours, hostiles didn't undock, mumble crashed, structures fell before we made it into system. It was long, successful, but boring. However, it gave me time to write this song called The Ballad of Delve Part 1. I'm a banjo player, not much of a guitar player, but I did my best. I recently watched the Jaynestown episode of Firefly, so it's sort of in that vein.

This is the first part of the Ballad of Delve, which sets the tone for the great war. Any future installments of the Ballad will be written based upon our heroic actions in battle. I would like to write a triumphant ending to this tale, but that depends on you.

I am Malloc Mangeiri.

I got my first kill. Yes.

So I'm flying to meet up with the fleet to farm some tears with them in my first fleet op. As I drop out of warp and approach the gate, I'm being locked. My heart races, my head spins ""WHO THE FUCK IS LOCKING ON TO ME?!?"" I panic, but a sudden calm comes over me. I say to myself, ""To hell with this...I'm in a tackle rifter, I'm gonna tackle shit."" I return lock, hit my MWD, and get in his face. I start up my nosferatu, orbit at 1000m, turn on my guns, and web + scramble him. All of a sudden, he blows up. ""Was that me?!? Did I REALLY do that?"" No, I didn't. Some bigbros came along and blasted him to hell. 

Well, would we call this a kill? I ran my little rifter given to me by Middle Managment Dino into his big bad hurricane. I hit my nos, turned on my guns, and tackled. Simple enough.

But I understand my role now. I'm small, fast, and hard to hit. I get in their face like a mosquito and make sure they can't get away. 

I jump into Corp chat and let Dreddit know about my wonderful experience. Two seconds later, I have 10mil ISK in my account. ""Happy first kill"" the mail says. Happy first kill indeed. 

See you all out there. I'm hooked.

I quickly learned that I was not near high enough level to handle much of anything by myself; I can't handle the rats, random reds would gank me. I quickly felt like a fish out of water. 

I learned a ton those first few days, scouring the wiki. I learned that I need to just do salvaging at first to make some money. I finally found a few guys out ratting who were willing to let me hang around and salvage after them. I found a good salvage selling service after I made the trip from NOL to Jita by myself once and swore never again after the several heart attacks I had on the way.

I took part in my first fleet and was 100% lost. I had a hard time following the terminology about what direction we were going. (Oh, tech mean dash? So HM tech is the HM- system. Got it.) Luckily, that first fleet we didn't run into much and I got to learn a ton. My second fleet was more of the same, mostly just running around, learning. At this point, I had been salvaging enough that I had learned to navigate pretty well, including utilizing jump bridges. I had been relying on TEST_FREE, so I had extra ships.

Last night though, after 3 weeks of playing so far, I took part in my 3rd fleet, determined to actually contribute. 

I joined up on mumble after seeing the ping on jabber, just in time to hear the FC ask for a scout. I volunteered. I took a free rifter. I had navigation down to where I was doing a great job of staying ahead of the everyone and communicating quickly with the fleet. 

Eventually, scouting ahead into 319 I think it was, I come across a few THORN carriers being tackled by goons. I tell the fleet ""I see a bunch of reds fighting a bunch of blues right on the other side of the gate, you guys should get over here."" Next thing you know its an all out battle. I moved away and set up a few perches 300k from the gate so that the fleet could warp out to me if needed. Hearing the FC say ""align to nathan, warp to nathan"" was awesome. 

Eventually reinforcements showed up. I stop bouncing around and burned in close, tackling a sabre. First successful tackle. The sabre was blown up quickly after that. I was on my first killmail! Finally, the goon's force buckles, and we stand victorious. 

I grab what little loot I was fast enough to get my hands on. Everyone heads back to NOL. I mention on mumble that it was my first time scouting and my first killmail, and thanked everyone for giving me a shot. Next thing I know my wallet starts blinking, and I end up with 20m extra.

1) Post and request an invite 

2) Wait like 5 minutes for someone to reply 

3) PM the person who replied and ask them to send you their open invite link 

4) Remember that you must actually turn your trial into a paid subscription to 'subscribe.' Not simply take the invite
 
5) Play EVE

**DO NOT** spam requestors with PMs for open invites, and don't post open invite links in this thread.  **Posts with invite links in them will be removed.**

Any questions, go ahead and post and/or PM Me.

This is simple, post in the thread if you want an extended 21 day invite and you will be contacted by reply or by PM by dozens of nerds looking to get you into EVE. The 21 day buddy invite is beneficial to the inviter as well if you end up subscribing, and as such most people offering up invites will also offer you in-game monetary incentives. Typically we've seen numbers between 100-250m isk, which is a TON of money for a brand new player.

Looking for an invite? Reply to this post and request one

Looking to send out invites? Sort through the new posts and reply

Remember these are invites to play EVE NOT TO JOIN DREDDIT. If you are looking to join Dreddit and feel you qualify, or want to get a feel for the game before you join up, you are in the right place. Also keep in mind that these 21 day invites are NOT compatible with CD-keys (like you would get from buying EVE through Steam). If you use a CD key, your inviter gets nothing and it really screws them over - if you make a deal with someone to accept money for an invite, do not use a CD key.

Invites must be used to create new accounts. You cannot use them to add time to your current subscription, or to reactivate an old account.

Don't post that you have invites, everyone has them. Post if you need one, and look for those posts if you have one.

Reading through the Dreddit/TEST Wiki it was obvious that Jabber is used quite a bit to organize things, but what about when you want to know what is going on and aren't near a computer? For that, I wanted to create a Jabber ""alarm clock."" A standalone device that lets you know at a glance what is going on.


Initially I wanted to build this using an Arduino, but when I looked into features and cost it was obvious that the Raspberry Pi was the better base. After a week of contemplation and several days of wiring/coding I present the **JabberPi - a Jabber fleet ""alarm clock"" built using Raspberry Pi**.



Here is a photo of the finished product:

[Finished JabberPi](http://imgur.com/NvTXx)


And here is a photo of it before being put in the case:

[Naked JabberPi](http://i.imgur.com/3Lar2)


And here is a YouTube video of it working!

[Working JabberPi](http://youtu.be/rOJze4S0zHI)


Here is an album of me putting it together &amp; testing the various parts:

[Lots of JabberPi](http://imgur.com/a/vmwkA)



**How it works:**

1. A message is sent to the Raspberry's jabber account
2. A python script running on the Raspberry receives the message, and sends a confirmation back to the sender
3. If the message contains the word ""fleet"" it then gets sent to the LCD panel using a custom Python library (Note - If you buy the SainSmart 2004 LCD panel to use with a Pi, let me know and I'll send you code that works with it)
4. Additionally, it sets one of the GPIO pins high to turn a MOSFET on
5. The MOSFET connects the 12V power to the LEDs and leaves them on for 3 seconds
6. The python script returns to monitoring Jabber messages



The biggest challenge in making this was dealing with the voltages that the Raspberry Pi provides and aligning them with those required by the LCD screen &amp; LEDs. All the logic on the Pi runs at 3.3V but the screen runs at 5V and the LEDs run at 12V. Additionally, the Pi isn't tolerant of higher voltages, so if you cross a wire you can toast your board. To get around this I used an Adafruit bi-directional level converter to sit between the i2c pins on the Pi and the LCD screen and a MOSFET to act as a switch for the 12V for the LED strips.


I'm trying to get stuff cleaned up right now, but if anyone is interested I'd be more than happy to post the scripts on GitHub.

Well, after receiving my notification that I had been accepted, and would be accepted in-game within 24 hours, I made myself ready.  Sold off my meager assets, jumped into a blank clone that was NOT in Jita, and stayed logged in, waiting.

Next morning, still nothing.  Well, no big deal - they said 24 hours, right?

Then last night, shortly after dinner, I walk by the PC and see that I have JUST been accepted.  FUCK YES.  I immediately change my clone and bloodjump to 1DH.  I had already set up my forums and various other apps to be ready once I was in.  Updated my API on Auth, and away I was!

Upon jumping into Mumble and local, I see there is a fleet leaving, FC'd by none other than Montolio!  First minutes in Dreddit and I get to be in a fleet with the boss!  Something else had been cancelled, and it was time to suicide a fleet in it's place.

I was excited - but not having a ship ready and not knowing what the local market would be like, I went straight to the contracts.  Found a fit Thrasher for 11m and undocked.

We went a bunch of jumps looking for targets and eventually found a gang of Tengus (Tengii?)...who seemed to primary me first!

I went down in a ball of flames, and got a free ticket back to 1DH via pod express. https://kb.pleaseignore.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=524310

After having been in Dreddit for 2 minutes, I was already in a fleet, heading towards and enemy gang, and getting 'assploded.

AND IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME.

Signed, 

Excited Newbro

The 3 days that have followed have been the most fun I've had in EVE, today especially.

I decided to take advantage of the reimbursement that NOS is doing and formed a 5 man gang of newbros, the plan was to just slowboat from 6VDT to 1DH, killing stuff on the way. We waited on a bubble that some random TEST friends had put up, and caught a Retribution. 1 kill down. We then continued on our way, getting caught once in a bubble that was luckily not manned. At 1DH we got 3 more kills when a Thrasher and 3 Rifters jumped on to us, we killed the Rifters, but the Thrasher burned out of point and warped off with 10% structure left. At 1DH we got some more people in the fleet and went out on a short, fiery roam. I volunteered to FC because we didn't have anyone that had done it before (neither had I), and we found a VC AHAC fleet twice our size in about 4 jumps. I died, along with 2 Rifters, but everyone else made it back alright.

Thanks Dreddit for being the corp that made this game interesting where many other have failed before.

1329752508.0,47,self.evedreddit,pxv3h,Went on my first op last night. Now I have many questions.,wildfyre010,48,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/pxv3h/went_on_my_first_op_last_night_now_i_have_many/,"Op redux:

1. Got lost after the first jump. Didn't know about jump bridges.

2. Looked up the jump bridge map on the wiki. Didn't know how to find the bridges if I didn't already have them bookmarked. Turns out jump bridges are near a moon and the map lists the moons. Used the 'All' setting on my overview to find the moons until I realize I can right-click on the starfield and warp to them that way.

3. Sheepishly asked in Mumble for a current system location, found the bridge by the relevant moon, finally jumped. Learned to bookmark.

4. Eventually caught up with the fleet, shooting something I later learned is called an 'SBU'. I pinged it with my hero rifter guns for negligable damage for a while.

5. When the SBU is just about to start taking structure damage, we all warp out rapidly and make our way back to 6vdt. I lag behind a bit, since I'm still finding jump bridges by warping to the moon. Eventually I get back to 6vdt and find the fleet near a gigantic monolith of a ship (Erebus?) which I can only assume was a Titan. That was fucking awesome, by the way. First op, I see a Titan? Sadly, we didn't end up doing anything with it except jumping back out to the system where the SBU from earlier was still floating.

6. Everyone's shooting the SBU, and my guns don't really do anything, so I look around a little. Overview says there are three red blobs over that way; couple of Thanatos and something else.. Chimera maybe? Anyway, I figure my overview is fucked because those can't possibly be bad guys because they're less than 80 km away and we brought a big ass fleet out here. Surely we would go and kill them if they were hostile?

7. So my Rifter is flying over that way and some people on Mumble are laughing at the hero rifter. I get close to these three ships and something shoots at me. Oh shit. Pop the afterburner and run back towards the aHAC light show (also, I learned what an aHAC was). Some generous logi soul reps my ship. SBU eventually dies, we go back to 6vdt (I'm getting pretty good at finding these jump bridges by this point). I log off for bed.

So, some questions. Forgive my complete ignorance; my EVE account is almost two years old, but I have less than 4 days of actual playtime and almost all of that is from the last week doing newb missions and tutorials.

- How do I get jump bridges to show up in my overview, so I can warp to them directly? Do I have to visit every one in nullsec and bookmark it, or can I import that data to my client somehow?

- When the FC talks about a primary, I want to shoot it. How does that information make it to my screen / targeting? I read a little about something called broadcasts, but I'm still confused.

- Anyone who was on the aHAC op last night when we were killing the SBU, were those three ships (that I assumed shot at me when I took damage) actually hostile? How can I tell?

Thanks in advance. I had fun, but I don't like feeling like a burden on the fleet every time I don't know what's going on.

So with my trial winding down I went ahead and activated the full account but there are some things I wish I did differently.

First of all, though Dreddit is for everyone, I think it should be stated a bit more clearly that doing as much of the PvE epic agent mission arcs should be a top priority *before* joining Dreddit. I really wish I had got my feet more wet before leaving high-sec.

I had only been in game a few days when I signed up for Dreddit and now I'm in low-sec with 23 days left on my [30 day skill plan](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/30_day_plan) to get through. What that means, or at least seems to be the case so far, is that I can't really do much right now in game. I tried [doing some PvE missions](http://forum.pleaseignore.com/index.php?topic=12434.0) but when I got to the base I was killed instantly. Very instantly. 

However, it hasn't been all bad either.

Last night I joined a fleet and though I spent half the time just catching up to everyone (thanks to some help from a very patient and helpful player), I was able to mess around a little bit until I found myself on the wrong side of a gate (and the wrong side of ordnance) where I died instantly (very instantly). My death proved to be very profitable, however, as everyone donated ISK to me (not to mention the insurance on my Rifter) and so now I have at least plenty of money to keep me in paper ships that blow up instantly. 

Also, earlier today, I figured out how to use noob_salvage (as well as learning how to find a bookmark in a can) and spent the better part of a few hours in my destroyer running back and forth to a site collecting and salvaging everything I could fit in the cargo holds. That too was profitable - though now I have way to much stuff that I can't figure out if I should sell or hang onto (a problem to have, for sure).

Still though, finding stuff to do at the moment seems sort of hit or miss. noob_salvage updates infrequently (not that I'm complaining - having that option is really helpful and I thank everyone who posts in there) and joining a fleet that I can actually get to without getting killed instantly en-route to is another challenge. I do keep my eyes on Psi for anything going on, but not everything there seems suited to a nub in a Rifter (though I may be wrong assuming that).

The rest of my time I've spent reading guides that are pure information overload and though they are written to help new players, they do seem to assume a level of proficiency with the game that someone on a trial who has just joined Dreddit and dies instantly is going to have a hard time applying all that information on a first-hand basis.

Overall though, everyone in game has been incredibly helpful and I have really enjoyed getting to meet a few people. The complexity factor is insane, but I'm trying to just focus on small things right now - learning to fly a tackle Rifter, salvaging when those opportunities arise, training skills - and then move up into something that will allow me to rat and at least get some combat experience against NPC's so I'll feel more comfortable in real PvP combat.

So, for the moment, I feel like I'm spending a lot of time docked at 6VDT-H watching the chats for opportunities and trying not to get impatient, but I have learned a lot already and I really want to improve so I paid for a full account and will keep at this.

“Forward, the Frigate Brigade!”

“Charge for the drones!” he said:

Into the system of Death

Flew the one hundred.

-

“Forward, the Frigate Brigade!”

Was there a man dismay’d?

Not tho’ the pilot knew

Someone had blunder’d:

Theirs not to make reply,

Theirs but to do and die:

In the system of Death

Flew the one hundred.

-

Cap ships  to right of them,

Cap ships to left of them,

Cap ships in front of them

Volley’d and thunder’d;

Storm’d at with drone and shell,

Boldly they flew and well.

Into the jaws of Death,

Into the mouth of Hell

Flew the one hundred.

-

Flash’d all their disruptors,

Flash’d as they fired with care,

Tackling the ships there,

Charging a fleet, while

All the corp wonder’d:

Plunged in battle with no cloak

Right thro’ the camp they broke;

IDLE and vamp

Reel’d from the quick blow

Shatter’d and sunder’d.

Then they flew back, but not

Not the one hundred.

-

Cap ships to right of them.

Cap ships to left of them,

Cap ships behind them

Volley’d and thunder’d;

Storm’d at with drone and shell,

While ship and hero fell,

They that had fought so well

Came thro’ the jaws of Death

Back from the mouth of Hell,

All that was left of them,

Left of one hundred.

-

When can their glory fade?

O the wild charge they made!

All the corp wondered.

Honor the charge they made,

Honor the Frigate Brigade,

Noble one hundred.

I had been warned that the free-born Dreddit are prone to making rash and non-prudent decisions, but my mind was made up.  

The application process was as smooth as butter, and the HR folks were quite efficient (mad props).  So much so, that I found myself in the rush to liquidate my assets, set up my jump clones, purchase whatever datacores I was entitled, and get a 'fighting worthy' amount of ships and mods to Jita to have jumped to Dreddit-land.  

So everything is smoother than it should be...I have my ships, my fits..  Dreddit has accepted my application and I'm just waiting for the 24 hr period for my roles to drop.  I understand that once I'm a dredditor, I only need to set up a jump clone with semi-decent implants away from major hubs (Jita, Rens etc).  I so smert.  :-0  

So, after jumping all around moving crap and selling crap in my little Ibis, I wind up in Jita.  I figure, I should install some implants for the one last thing to do, load up a clone that is ready for nulsec.  (I'm in a total highsec clone w/ Crystals).  So the fool of me loads a couple nice Improved and Standard implants into my cargo bay.  

After a smoke, I come back to my EVEings, and see that there's a nasty Ibis bothering my hanger.  So, OF COURSE, I decide to ""right click"" TRASH....and bam, I've lose those (160M worth of) implants that were foolishly loaded into the cargohold of that IBIS. 

Yeah, happy times.  I feel like I've lost brain cells, just thinking about it.  That said, I will be glad to be a Dredditor, and hope these kinds of shenannigans continue.

This is going to be big.

There are a few things we need to address, so I'll get those out of the way:

1) There are instructions in this subreddit on how to join the corp. Private messaging me in game is actually detrimental to getting anything done... as I've been logging on, and have been getting tens of convos going at once.

2) On that note, we're currently at capacity for the corp. I'm training megacorp management level 2 (who would have thought I would have EVER needed that?) This will give us a cap of 150, and by sometime tomorrow I should have level 3. By Thursday or early Friday, we can count on level 4. I'm seeing that this is going to be bigger than I originally anticipated, and am skilling my damndest to accomodate.

3) There are standing orders in EVE Mail. It's got a system I recommend the older players to group up at (and the newer players can group up nearby in the high sec systems.)

4) About the Corp HQ: Once the board of directors is established, I will more than likely be bowing out of ""command"" and assume an administrative role. My days of commanding a corp are long past, and now I really just want to pew pew. Luckily, I've got the corp management skills to at least get us off the ground. I'm taking suggestions on how to fill the corp management director roles, but essentially I'd like established players who demonstrate a good knowledge of each of the areas we're specializing in. As a result, this MIGHT lead to a little less than a democratic vote, but if there is public outcry demanding we put it to a vote, that's for reddit to decide (I would fully recommend that we simply appoint the people best suited to the jobs however).

5) Please keep this in mind: This is going to be a clusterfuck for a couple of weeks. A lot of you new players will get pretty dismayed by the lack of organization, but this game isn't really meant to handle a corp of this size so immediately popping onto the scene. There are going to be political positions we need to take with some of the locals (because a corp of this size just popping into existence will NOT go unnoticed) and maneuvering we'll have to do to get everything organized. Be patient, it will happen, it will just take time. This gives the new players a chance to learn what they want to do in EVE, and the veterans a chance to learn each other's strengths and weaknesses.

6) I want to thank everyone for their immediate action. I truly am sorry about the member cap issue that we're currently having, but we should see that as a positive, rather than a negative. This is a problem that very few CEOs would even dream of having. I'm honored that I get to be the one to waste skill training time on it. I will be at work all day tomorrow, browsing the boards as always. I look forward to your input.

Edit: Last night I updated the corp information to allow 50 more members. By noon I'll have Level 3 trained which will allow 50 more. After that, it will be 2 days before we get 50 more.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,True,,,True,t3_b08p7,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/b08p7/state_of_the_corp_address/,

I joined TEST to enjoy what I assumed would be safety and security, to rat in nullsec, and maybe even go on a roam or two. When we first attempted to expand out from HED I tried to participate, but found it was out of my PVE comfort zone, so I went back to Fountain and told myself I could best help the corp. by ratting as much as possible, that the taxes from my bounties would be enough.

Fast forward a few months and suddenly the entire alliance is turned on its head before me. I sat and watched from the safety of ""home"" as we reset Goons and ditched the HBC while Fountain's invaders grow more and more numerous each day. Of course, the first two weren't my concern, I didn't care if we kept or lost Delve, I was happy with what we had in Fountain and figured it'd be so much easier to defend anyways. I even joined a local jewing/PVP squad to help reach that goal, slowly gaining more and more experience in player combat but never understanding why nobody else seemed to share my views.

When the first defensive stratop of 1-SMEB came along I told myself I would leave my comfort zone, I would join my Jewbros in defending our alliance's 'home away from home' despite how much I didn't care about it. Years of training carebear skills, however, left me ill-prepared to fly any doctrine ship, so I hopped into a tackle frigate and joined the n00b fleet. Needless to say being a perch for targeted logibros to warp to was boring as shit, watching from afar, listening to the FC try to coordinate tackle frigates, interdictors, ECMs, etc all at once. And then I saw the gigantic blue blob that was our Rokhs...

Well over a hundred battleships come and gone in a multitude of beautiful explosions, a tragedy which could've been easily averted had at least one interdictor been doing what he/she was supposed to where they were supposed to. I imagined how FURIOUS those Rokh pilots must've been and was sure many of them were ready to ragequit. But instead they re-shipped and came back, and fought harder than before. It's then that it hit me; they didn't HAVE to be here. Nobody HAD to be here, we all could've just said ""fuck it!"" and done something else. But here we were, over **sixteen hundred** people, sitting there playing internet spaceships, each with a vital role to fill no matter how mundane it may seem... we were each making more of a difference than any amount of taxes ever could.

The second half of the 1-SMEB campaign only served to reinforce that feeling of accomplishment and helped me understand the need for conquest, the desire to defend that which we've taken. Who cares if we needed help to get it, it was ours now and we'll show the entire universe just how well we can hold our own, even if it's against those whom we used to name 'friend'! To call it exhilarating would be a grave understatement, and I now know that I belong to something so much bigger than just one ship doing one profession in one corporation. It takes so much organization to get this gaggle of drunken, sleep-deprived nerds to come together, but when they do not even the combined efforts of the Goons, TNT, NC., Pizza, and whatever other organization that tries to take our playground away from us can do so.

Though my heart will always lie in Fountain I am now more than excited to pledge what free time and resources I have to helping TEST retain both regions of space. And for those of you ever wishing to come visit, friend or foe, my name is *Fenix Shadowsong*, and I'll keep a light on for you. o7",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_1f2ptj,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/1f2ptj/1smeb_opened_my_eyes/,

I used to make and launch these rockets from kits when I was younger and even mix and match pre-made parts, but had never made anything based on a popular design and thought it could be both challenging and fun.

I took a look at all the spare parts I had, bought some balsa wood and went to work.  The first thing I noticed was it was going to be really hard to make an exact replica with the parts I had and without some troubleshooting.  I would have loved to make a dual rocket model, but having no prior experience with this, I did not know if this would launch properly due to both engines not firing at the same time.  Due to this I decided to go with a single rocket model which presented a new problem.  With a single engine, I had to have this balanced in the center of the rocket.  With the Rifter, the cockpit is fairly small, but if I made this to scale, then I would have no room for the engine plus enough room for a parachute.  Because of this I decided to make the body larger.

Here are some pictures of the work and assembly process of the rocket:
[http://imgur.com/a/oPPUB](http://imgur.com/a/oPPUB)

When it came to launch time, things got a bit funny.  Previously I did an engine test with another rocket I still had and figured if I used a small engine to start I could see if it was stable enough to use a bigger one.  I was a bit worried about the aerodynamics at first.  This was a mistake on my part.  I was honestly surprised what a small amount of extra weight difference between the two would do.  The small rocket barely had enough power to lift the rocket.  It also resulted in damage to the top stabilizing fins.

[Launch 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CougjNlr-Ps&amp;feature=plcp)

After the first launch I decided to just stick the biggest engine I had left and see what would happen.  I really had no hope for this launch.  It's quite funny how a lack of stabilizers makes a big difference, lol.  It's also funny to note the ""pop"" around the 16 second mark being the charge which releases the parachute.

So I've played EVE for almost 5 years. I've been in hisec, losec, npc null and a bit of sovereign null. I've been a grunt, a corp director, and had way too much responsibility.

Around the fall of 2010 TEST caught my eye, with their terrible posting on the EVE-O forums, and elsewhere. They did the most unimaginable thing – they played EVE for fun. I wasn't having fun anymore in EVE, and I wanted to. I wasn't going to go for ""Elite PVP"" (I am not good enough at the game), I wasn't really a ""goon"" - although I respect what they do and laugh with them (and occasionally at them), and I'm not Russian. I'd been on the wrong side of fighting the NC enough times that I wasn't going to join that sinking ship, and as I wandered aimlessly throughout EVE, I found the source of TEST (and by extension Dreddit) - reddit. I started reading, posting, and enjoying reddit, which led me to the opportunity to join Dreddit a few months later.

Now I bike in reddit-branded gear.

I send friends links to posts here.

I read this more often than my usual news sites.

I come to reddit first to find opinions on current issues.

I post badly here, but I like to think I might be getting better.

And, I get to play EVE with people who have fun in (and with) the game.

&gt;There is a MMOFPS game currently in semi-closed beta called Firefall. The game is having a patch on the 22nd that will implement basic army functionality, allowing players to team up in large groups and work together not too unlike corporations in EVE.

&gt;The Firefall subreddit decided that we would form one such army, and the name Test Army Please Ignore was nominated and chosen to represent this army. The tag used for the group would be [TEST].

&gt;I saw the controversy that spiked up over the Planetside 2 reddit outfit: Test Outfit Please Ignore. It looks to me like there were some possible issues with the graphics that they wanted to use as well as their leaders simply being discourteous.

&gt;In an attempt to stifle the possibility of any similar controversy between our two groups, I wanted to get in touch with you and inform you of our intentions. We are just starting out and so far only have a subreddit, a Steam Group, and some interested players.

&gt;Though we would like to stick to the name as it is easily recognized by other redditors in game and references the famous post, I'd definitely be willing to discuss and agree upon some ground rules to ensure we do not encroach on your organization.

&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;wiseguy430

For my arts and crafts project, I had the idea to make a battle report in the style you see for some major historical naval battles (example: see [Battle of Leyte Gulf](http://www.historyanimated.com/LeyteGulf.html)). I had to find a public battle report, so I chose the [Battle for ES-Q0W](http://themittani.com/news/battle-es-q0w-tengus-vs-napocs).

The first thing I did was storyboard the whole battle using the account I linked and the [killboard](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=14503793). Since there's obviously some gaps, I took some liberties with what happens.

The next thing I did was make the little ship outlines. I chose the ship types that were the most important in the battle: the main fleet doctrines and then other ships that played an important role. I hope you guys recognize them. I've probably actually seen only two of those ship types in game.

I then combined everything to create the battle report: [album](http://imgur.com/a/217Yi) and [animated gif](http://imgur.com/MgDpR).

I also reenacted the battle in pasta form: [album](http://imgur.com/a/dfhwM). You can see the glorious macaroni victorious over the vile gomiti. My girlfriend thought my reenactment was the most hilarious thing she'd seen this week. She probably took more pictures of me making it than I took of the pasta. So here's a making of [photo](http://imgur.com/nkDXI).

Hope you guys like it.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_11atxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/11atxg/arts_crafts_historical_battle_report/,

Our wise, overweight and benevolent despot/overlord BoodaBooda wants Dredditors to poast moar in EveDreddit.  Since I have nothing original or interesting to say, here's a thread for people to ask industry questions for the collective will of Antitrust Squad (that's our industrialist squad name, clever eh?) and Dreddit/TEST at large to answer.

Here's out charter, below, as a way of shameless attention/member whoring for if you're wondering if you'd like to join.

**TEST's Antitrust Squad**
*Mission*

Do you enjoy Industry? Do you find more satisfaction in a fat wallet than a well-equipped HAC? Does a smoothly operating production line make you spooge like a schoolgirl? Does the idea of a multi-hour mining op send you for two fingers of scotch, rather than screaming for the door? Do you like to talk and write like an adult, instead of a Ritalin-addled Sperg Squadder?

Then Antitrust Squad may be for you! Antitrust’s mission is to provide you with a place to hone your industrial chops amongst like-minded robber barons like the latter day Croesus, Rothschild or Vanderbilt we all want to be.

Antitrust may not be for you if you think mining is boring in a bad way, can’t be bothered to google Croesus or generally prefer to make your money through ratting and missioning first (aka the hard way).

Antitrust is looking for Miners, Planetologists (PI), Manufacturers, Industrial Pilots, Salvagers, Refiners, mineral compressors and importers, and all sub-genres that make up the isk side of EVE.

*Member service goals:*

* Provide TEST with a ready source of industrial know-how and willing participants for logistics operations in the maintenance and expansion of the glorious industrialist Mecca known as Fountain.
* A place to find and connect with like-minded players to engage in the ancient art of natural resource exploitation. Be it Rock, Ice, PI, Gas or Moongoo we want to use it to our own ends: Antitrust is Scrooge, Fountain is our fortune, TEST is our Moneybin.
* A mature environment where trolling and flaming are frowned upon, in favor of the exchange of advice and information.
* A forum and sticky posts and sources built and maintained to place want ads, services offered, organize industrial ops and other benefits to membership. 

What you should bring to Antitrust:

* A desire to learn about and participate in Industry
* A willingness to share your expertise, whether by post, TS, mentoring, and Antitrust in-game channel help.
* Antitrust does not have a wealth, SP or other artificial constraint to membership. We only want your knowledge and participation. 

*Administration*

Squad Administrative crap: Squad will be run primarily on the initiative of its members; it is your job to see we succeed. I intend to act as supreme squad dictator to start off, assigning officers and roles until this thing gets off the ground. Once established, Antitrust roles will open to election, and/or appointment in as laid-back manner as possible. Think of it as a little island of direct democracy in a sea of communism.


Who we need:

* YOU
* Players with significant industrial experience who would be interested in serving as officers.
* A Wikipedia guru, to make and maintain a (eventual) Squad wiki page within TEST.
* Moderators to help organize the (eventual) squad sub-forum.
* People who want to find people to work together with in ISK acquisition activies.
* People who are still reading this.
* YOU

I've had an arduino for about a week, and I've started to write a small program (based off the twitter client example code) for it that connects to the eve API and displays the remaining time on your skill queue.

Here's a video of what I had a few days ago, since then I've added a bit more.

www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYpptX_8Ti0

An album of shots taken while I built it (includes obligatory pasta):

http://imgur.com/a/NaTNJ#0

And a video showing the newer features (now with case!):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPg6u9Cc_u4

How it works:

1. connects to api.eveonline.com and accesses /char/SkillQueue.xml, using user provided verification code and key ID (specified in the code)
2. reads every time value given, parses it into unix seconds thingy time and stores it in an array called skillEnd (this includes current time and cachedUntil, woohoo for terrible naming conventions.)
3. uses Time library to keep track of current time as unix time.
3. counts how many skills there are and stores it as skillNum while reading the xml file.
4. displays the value of skillNum as the number of green lights
5. displays time until end of queue on the 7-segment LED screen 
6. by pressing buttons, you can see how long until individual skills finish training and how long until the cache is refreshed
7. reconnects to eve if the first skill completes or the cache has been refreshed

Also, would anyone be interested in me putting the hideous, hacky code on github or somthing?

Inviting your real life friends and family into Dreddit who don't have a reddit account or own a reddit account which doesn't meet our entry requirements.

*See the sidebar:*

Dreddit, an EVE Online corporation for **users and friends** of Reddit.

**Not For:**

* Selling/trading for cash or ISK.
* Getting your high sec ""spaceship"" friends into nullsec.
* Absorbing your ex corp into Dreddit, especially if they have been previously rejected from joining TEST as a corp. Recommendations are not a ""backup plan"".

I think many people don't understand the consequences of recommending someone they don't really know. 

If the person you recommend breaks an alliance rule, **you will also be held accountable for their actions.** If it results in someone being kicked, you and everyone else you have recommended into Dreddit may be kicked from corp and/or blacklisted.

If you even hint on reddit that you are willing to ""help someone out"" by recommending them, you may be kicked and you will definitely have a warning added to your auth account which will strip you of your ability to recommend applications.

We don't take many things seriously in Dreddit, but this is definitely one of them. Please do not abuse the recommendation system or you may one day see an announcement from me saying we no longer allow them. They are a privilege and not a right.

There is going to be a slight change to Dreddit recommendations.

For most Dreddit members that got in ""on their own"", as in, they meet the Reddit account requirements when they joined: **Nothing is changing for you, go about your day.**

*This change will only effect those that got into Dreddit via a recommendation from someone else.* If you were recommended in, you have to meet the normal Dreddit [recommendation requirements](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Recommendations) like everyone else. You also have to have a reddit account that meets our [normal entry requirements](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Joining_Dreddit#Applying_on_your_own) (which are not changing), **if you want to recommend someone.**

**Why?**

It basically means that everyone getting in directly knows someone who is an active redditor.

**Who decides if we are an ""active redditor""?**

The HR Drone looking at your application. It is basically exactly the same as if you are applying to Dreddit without a application. We will go through the same process.

**OMG I'm going to be kicked!!!!**

No, no, no, no, no. If you were recommended into the corp you are still under no obligation to become an active redditor, and you won't be ""purged"". You simply won't be able to recommend others in.

**If I attach a recommendation to an app and HR decides my reddit account doesn't meet our entry requirements, what happens to me?**

Basically, nothing. The applicant you are recommending in will be rejected, but this won't reflect poorly on you.


All questions/flames/threats can go below if you are not in B0RT. If you are actually a current member please direct them [here](http://forum.pleaseignore.com/index.php?topic=14136).

EDIT: Seems some people are getting the wrong idea completely, so to try and clear it up a bit:

**IF YOU WANT TO RECOMMEND SOMEONE INTO DREDDIT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REDDIT ACCOUNT THAT MEETS OUR ENTRY REQUIREMENTS.**

We are **not** going on a witch hunt and purging everyone that got in via a recommendation, and/or who isn't a Redditor. You just won't be able to recommend people in if you don't have a reddit account which ""could get in on it's own merit"".

It is effectively saying ""If you were recommended into Dreddit, you can't recommend others in"". Except we have added a ""workaround"" that if you end up becoming a redditor and have a reddit account that meets our entry requirements, you can ""cancel out"" the fact you were recommended in.

That's alright. I created this corp in order to _have_ this corp, not dictate it. 

After talking with a few EVE veterans last night in game, I've determined that a council of five corp directors, each with a specialized field, would be preferable to a complete democracy which would be slow to act, and would often take into account some real wackadoo ideas. Looking at it critically, I believe the five director positions we need are as follows:

* Military Director
* Industrial Director
* Training Director
* Economic Director
* Political Director

Although I feel the roles are fairly self-describing, I will outline them:

*Military Director* - The military director is the supreme commander of our PVP forces. His/Her decision is final when it comes to matters military. This includes running conquest campaigns, appointing FC's, delegating fleet composition responsibilities, etc. Any concerns you have regarding the direction of the corp on a military level will need to be put through the proper channels to arrive at the MD's ears.

*Industrial Director* - The ID will organize all things industry. They will largely be in charge of any industrial POS's that need to be put in position, be in charge of our corp-held blueprints, organize fleet mining operations, and be the one to finally drop the axe on when it's time to start cranking out capital ships. They are the ultimate strategic mind in running the supply chain. Often, they will need to coordinate with the MD in order to secure their operations.

*Training Director* - The TD will be our head of PVE operations. It is no secret that we have a lot of people who are new to the game. The Training Director will not only help to set up classes involving how to play the game, but will also be our coordinator for group mission running, complexing, exploration, and small pvp learning skirmishes. Essentially, everything that does not involve direct anti-player contact will be conducted by the training director. The TD will be responsible for putting new troops into the pipeline.

*Economic Director* - The ED will be in charge of our resource management. With this many players, there will be fuel that will need to be shipped to and from our nullsec space, produced goods that need to be brought to Jita, and hundreds of people will want their assets moved to wherever we decide to settle in to. The Economic Director will be in charge of all of our hauling, trading, and funding operations.

*Political Director* - The PD must have his/her finger on the pulse of EVE. He will advise the leadership council on the current happenings involving the other corporations and alliances who we may or may not be involved with. He will be our eyes, ears, and mouth when it comes to our foreign dealings. He will be our Henry Kissinger. Furthermore, the political director will be in charge of running our intelligence and counter-intel wings.

---------------

All of these directors will have equal power in deciding the direction of the corp (which system should we start with in nullsec, where should we expand to next, who is the largest threat to our assets who needs to be dealt with and in what way?) And it will be up to each of them to table the concerns of their respective wings. All directors must be compromise and work together for the betterment of the corp.

Of course, this is just the rough idea I am beginning with. I'll now open it up for discussion.

----------------

Edit: It seems that most people are pretty happy with this plan.

(xpost /r/EVE)",WingZeroType,44,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/11oetg/a_newbro_story_guns_and_point_preheated_to_hunt_a/,"I freaking love this game!  The screenshot shows the point *right* before the pinnacle of excitement in tonight's small gang roam.  But let me start at the beginning.

The night started as a pretty quiet night in Dreddit.  I was just hanging out in station playing skillplanner online when I see a jabber ping go out for a fleet to save some of our supers.  I'm still pretty new and hearing that there were supers that needed saving, I got super (haha pun) excited.  I jump into my Drake, which is the only ship I can fly even remotely decently and meet up on the TITAN.  We wait around for a while and then the FC tries some fancy titan jump bridge stuff to get us to get the drop on a 60 tempest -A- fleet but we get stuck in traffic control and most of the ships get away http://i.imgur.com/OXniQ.jpg.  Then comes approx 15-20 mins of camping A's station pooping cans before we finally decide to leave and go back home http://i.imgur.com/OErWd.jpg.  I feel excited that I got to see and use a titan jump bridge, but pretty let down that we didn't actually get any good fights out of it.  

So when I see another ping for a suicide fleet of frigates, I jump at the opportunity.  We quickly form up and I decide to bring my TEST_FREE merlin.  I am not very rich so if the point of the fleet is to just go out and thrash some stuff and probably come back in pods or worse, I can't really afford to lose anything much more pricey than a t1 frig (I really only take the drake out for reimbursable fleets).  We have a pretty small fleet with a mix of assault frigates, interceptors, t1 frigs, and a couple cloakies.  We start roaming through nullsec and head towards Catch and some Angel space which I think is NPC nullsec.  Somewhere along the way a bomber squad suddenly decloaks on us and the FC tries to get everyone to warp away in time but they still get almost half our fleet.  Most of the t1 frigs and a couple others went down and drop fleet, but fortunately since I was in my tanky merlin and didn't have my MWD running, i only went to about 30% shield or so.  Those of us that survived choose to go on.  

We don't get much action for a while and then someone in fleet remembers that we're pretty close to where he used to live or something.  He had a few ships there that he wanted to try to get back to his new home in or around K-6, so we agree to stop by there.  Three people in fleet take him up on his offer and fly his shinier, more expensive ships.  We now have a ragtag fleet of frigates with an Ferox (caldari BC) and a Scimitar (Minnie T2 Logi), including a pirate faction frigate Dramiel.  There were 7 of us left at this point, and we figure our main goal at this point is to try to get some of these shiny ships back home and take any fair fights (or unbalanced fights in our favor) we can get along the way. 22 Jumps, ok, we can do this.  Supposedly we're going through some pretty rough space but I'm not sure what that means, its all nullsec to me.  

On the way back, we hear intel that there's an enemy gatecamp on the route we were planning to take so we divert to a different route and unwittingly jump into an active fleet, comprised of a hurricane, two stilettos, a dramiel and another ship or two.  We crash the gate and manage to distract their fast tackle with some of our own fast tackle long enough to give our ferox and scimitar a chance to jump to a safe that someone created.  This now began a nerve-wracking coordination process where we try and escort the slower jumping ships (the ferox and scimi) through each gate while making sure that the fleet that's behind us doesn't chew them up.  We were a bit ahead of the enemy fleet so we just had to make sure that the ferox and scimi could warp to the perch set by our scout before the enemy fleet showed up on grid. The ferox would warp first, and as soon as he was off the scimi would follow in warp and we would align, and once the scimi entered warp we would all warp as well to make sure no one got left behind as easy pickings.  

This continued for a few jumps until the enemy fleet caught us in one system, and I started digging in for a fight.  As soon as this happened though, local spiked with a fleet of 15 or so blues!  SWEET I thought, the cavalry's arrived!  We can really bring the fight to them now!  People started cheering on comms, but once the enemy fleet saw local spike they warped to the sun or something before they were able to kill any of us.  We didn't have any points on them because we were still in ""run run gtfo"" mode and we didn't want to agress.  But now we are the hunters, and they are the hunted.  We move our fast tackle around to some different celestials while the ferox and scimi warp to a safe with the FC.  Before long, we hear that one of our fast tackle guys had a hurricane pointed.  ""Hurry!"" he says, ""I'm not sure how much longer I can hold him!"".  We all warp to him http://i.imgur.com/hDaAF.jpg (which was around when the screenshot from the title of this post was taken).  Right before I land though, he says that he lost point, and this is where things start getting a little bit hazy for me.  I don't recall exactly what people said on comms, but I remember them saying that the fleet of 15 or so blues were a frigate roam.  And when I load grid, I come into this:  We were hotdropped with 25+ cruisers/battlecruisers.  By the time I landed there was already multiple bubbles up and local was spiking like crazy.  I see a lot of red flashes on screen and at first I'm not quite understanding whats going on.  It didn't hit me immediately, but people were warping into a cyno that someone lit.  What I did understand immediately though, is that my overview was filling with *lots* of enemies in scary ships and that I needed to GTFO as soon as possible.  I immediately start MWD-ing out of the bubble and spamming warp to our next destination, which is the last command the FC gave that I can remember.  As I was entering warp, I could see a bunch of their dps yellow-boxing me http://i.imgur.com/M7e8f.jpg I had narrowly escaped.

Somehow our fleet's only survivors were the scimi and I.  He said he warped in at 70 which is why he was able to get out, I presume I lived because I was a cheap t1 frigate and no one cared about killing me.  All of our other ships, the ferox, the dramiel, the assault frigs and interceptors, died and were podded too.  So it was just me and the t2 logi left.  The FC apologized for getting us killed and dropped comms, as did everyone else but the Scimi.  I warp to the next gate and get caught in a drag bubble, and there's a stiletto on the gate.  He starts burning towards me and moments later the scimi shows up in the same drag bubble.  At this point I still wasn't sure that he and I were the only ones left, but he starts telling me to shoot it, shoot it. So i turn on my MWD and start approaching it, trying to engage it.  The Scimitar gets to the gate and jumps through, and the stilleto can't follow presumably because he was aggressed.  Problem is, so am I.  I start orbiting the gate with my MWD off and praying I stay alive long enough to jump through.  I see some enemies start showing up on grid and I tell the Scimitar that I'm probably going to die.  I get scrammed and tracking disrupted and i think damped too, but then i start jumping!  I'm shaken, but excited.  I managed to get away from the gate on the other side before any enemies can pin me down and i catch up with the scimitar.  I'm determined to do what I can to scout for the Logi so that he doesn't get caught.  He tells me what to do and I successfully follow his instructions.  On the last gate before highsec (which was the last dangerous section before we entered back into our own space), there was a bubble.  He asked me to create a bounce for him so that he could warp to me and then warp to the gate without getting caught in the bubble.  I wasn't exactly sure what that was all about, so I just warped to the gate thinking if I get caught in the bubble, no big deal I can just MWD up and get clear of it.  

I load grid on the last gate before High Sec and as expect, I'm in a bubble.  I begin aligning upwards when I notice 2, 3, 4, 5 bombers decloaking around me.  CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP.  I need to make a split second decision.  I've been in fleets where the FCs always tell me to make sure the MWDs are off so that you don't take full bomb damage.  But with 5 bombers I wasn't expecting to survive if I was hit, even with MWD off.  And I needed to survive to get that bounce for the Scimi.  I decide to take the gamble and hit the MWD.  My speed quickly jumps to over 2km/s and I see the bombs getting closer and closer to where I originally was.  I'm praying that I'm out of their detonation range.  During this time the gate rats have also locked me and have started shooting me.  I'm seeing lots of damage indicators going off and lots of ships redboxing me but my shield's aren't going down too much.  I see the bomb explosions and I was out of the blast range!  I rejoice and turn off my MWD as soon as I'm at 150km above the gate and tell the scimi to warp to me.  http://i.imgur.com/i4vPR.jpg  We need to get out of here ASAP.  I don't know how bomber fleets work.  I don't know if they have someone that can scan me down and give them a warpin to do another bomb run.  We need to GTFO.  We both warp to the gate and I jump into highsec first to make sure its clear on the other side, and it is.  No war targets.

This was only the third time I have FC'd and without all you guys who got involved it would not have been anywhere near as awesome, I would happily send you all some isk but I can't so my love will have to do :-p

Also I know some of us at the beginning got blapped by a 100+ strong goon fleet and left behind so I apologise for that, not much I could do.

Thanks also to the guy who sent me 30mil for ""the newbro heroes"", we ended up in Amarr staging out of the station, so we put all that cash into fitting destroyers for anyone who joined us, we lost about 15-20 mils worth of isk but we popped just shy of 460mils worth! Op success!

If anyone who was in fleet could post the kills that would be ace, it was a hulk, a pod, a noctis and possibly something else, if not I will do so tomorrow as I am posting from my phone right now.

Thanks again guys and keep an ear to bacon bar and an eye on deedee in game, I will definitely be out hunting tears again very soon.

Update: Your FC has the taste for blood and is going rabid for more! I am sat in work itching to go get more pubbie tears. If I am on later I am arranging another hisec gank fleet. Be ready for tears in floods Dreddit, I want blood.

Edit 2 I have decided I am going to try and make this a ""thing"", I will however need the help of the participants, as long as we can get some donations we will be able to provide you with ships and fits, all newbros are encouraged to join in, if your sec status is too low, as mine will be shortly no doubt we will just gank lowsec on a hisec gate that sees activity, we will jump off that bridge when we get to it. Remember, TEST gank best gank!

Cooking is something of a hobby of mine, and probably about as close as I get do ""craftiness"" so I figured doing something food-related could be fun as my submission to arts &amp; crafts. It took me a bit of thinking but finally I came up with an MMD cake. Although I'm not much of a baker (which I think in many ways is MUCH harder than cooking) I thought I might push myself a bit and make the whole thing from scratch!

The album has most of the commentary in the titles and decriptions, but I will add a few things:

1) The little blender I had to use was godawful. The blades didn't reach the sides of the jar so it was almost entirely useless. In the end I did most of the berry-mashing myself.

2) Though I talk kinda tough in the imgur gallery, I have never actually used fondant before. I was actually somewhat surprised to see it in the supermarket since I thought it was a specialty item, so on a whim I got it. I'm glad I did, though, since I think it really helped the end results. It made icing the cake much easier, since it was like painting on a blank canvas. I will add, however, that it has roughly the same taste and consistency as play-dough so I wouldn't use it again on a cake unless the decoration was more important than the taste, like here.

3) Mixing equal parts white and black frosting gives you black frosting. To get grey you need 2 or 3 parts white to 1 part black. I'm sure the actually crafty painter people already knew this, but it cost me much of my reserves of decoration frosting, and I nearly ran out.

This was a great deal of fun to do, so I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did. I'm going to bring the cake in to work tomorrow, and I'll let you know how it tastes!

Edit: Consumption report - Yummy, but I'd definitely not use fondant next time, that stuff really isn't very good.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,1344896079.0,,,True,t3_y4v27,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/y4v27/arts_crafts_middle_management_dino_cake/,

For my arts and crafts project I made a little mini game in HTML5. The title of the game is Killing Goons. 

* Link to the game: [http://static.alphacoders.com/dreddit/KillingGoons/](http://static.alphacoders.com/dreddit/KillingGoons/)
* Imgur of some of the how: [http://imgur.com/a/B710z](http://imgur.com/a/B710z)
* Game size is about 6MB, so it might take a little bit to first start up
* If your computer is old, it might not run great. Games in HTML5 are very resource heavy for what they are.

**Controls**

* Movement: wasd
* Firing: Left Mouse Click
* Switching weapon randomly: E  (there are only two weapons, so you might have to hit E a few times)


I've tested this in Google Chrome, FireFox (you may need to click an 'allow button'), and IE 10 (no shader support but it works).

It's a VERY basic top down shooter where you, the reddit alien, are shooting goons that spawn randomly on the map. Your goal is just to get as many kills as you can before dying. For every enemy that you kill, two will spawn, so the game will get tougher until there's just too much shit on the screen.

**Programs Used**

* Pixlr for image manipulation
* Construct 2 for game creation

Construct 2 is a very neat program because it lets you manipulate things in a graphical environment, rather than messing with a ton of code. There are some screenshots of the interface in the imgur link. It's similar to working in Flash, and kind of 'easy mode' for getting something graphical going. This is the first time I've ever used the program, so I'm pretty happy anything at all works :D

**Notes**

* I'm not a game programmer, I just dabble with game stuff once in a blue moon.
* The laser effect was the most fun for me, so I decided to go with it despite Rokhs not being a laser platform.
* The zooming in and out effect is a little jarring at first, but when I turned it off things felt too static.
* There is sound

I know it's rough, but I do hope you enjoy it!

Edit1: After looking through tons of arts &amp; crafts and seeing countless mentions of macaroni and glitter, I present to you: Killing Macaroni!

1348342740.0,40,self.evedreddit,10b5wm,Just another newbro beaming in the awesomeness of Dreddit,coelomate,49,9,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/10b5wm/just_another_newbro_beaming_in_the_awesomeness_of/,"Downloaded the game about a week ago, got into Dreddit Wednesday, and away from my gaming computer from the weekend so I thought I'd recap the highlights: 

* **Flying around in a tackling frigate is awesome:** People are extremely nice, even when I do dumb stuff (or am too dumb to know how to do the right stuff) everyone is good at helping clear things up. You really can jump into giant tactical space battles form basically the moment you get in the corp and get communications set up, and it's extremely fun. I've flown in like 5 well organized (for certain definitions of 'well') fleets since getting in Wednesday. 

* **Hisec was good practice at blowing up, but not good enough.** I accidentally survived almost half of the fleets I've flown on. WTF bros.

* **I am really good at being dumb.** The first thing I had to ask after being accepted was why my pod's self-destruct wasn't working. That's right: I managed to screw up suicide. For future reference, autopilot will make you jump at a gate which will cancel your self-destruct. The More You Know! 

* **But, it turns out, idiocy is profitable:** I ran the numbers (remember kids: EVE is a space spreadsheet simulater). According to the calculations, asking retarded questions in our new members channel has earned me ISK at approximately 112x the rate that mining or missioning in hisec did. Apparantly the space-rich enjoying showering the space-dumb with ISK when we're cute. 

* **Speaking of math...** I've lost TEST approximately 2.5 million ISK worth of ships, but per the killboard have been involved in the destruction of almost 2 billion ISK worth of ships. Dreddit is pretty serious-business about giving out unlimited free newbro ships, and I am starting to understand why. 

* **Lossboards are green:** While discussing the above fact, members of the channel got into a dick-waving contest about who had lost the most ISK worth of ships. I left shamed that I'd only asploded 2.5 mil worth. I endeavor to become worse at EVE, or at least as bad at EVE while piloting more high-stakes vessels. 

**TL;DR** Dreddit/Test is awesome. Eve is a boring game about microsoft office and if you aren't hanging out in nullsec you're doing it so, so wrong. Whatever else is going on with Dreddit/Test, it's still functioning extremely well as a fun and welcoming group for newbros.

Hiya folks. So, after a year or so of lurking r/eve, General Discussion, watching all the Alliance Tournaments and generally staring from afar, I finally took the plunge and signed up for EVE. I was hooked. Never before have I ever seen a game so complex. I still don't  even understand half the full intricacies of this game. 

I spent my first few hours missioning around hi-sec after finishing the career missions and the SoE Epic arc before I got bored and decided to try out exploration. I scouted out a nice pocket of 6-7 systems bordered by a few lowsec systems, moved my meager assets out there and began scanning and running sites… until I ran into tengu after tengu after tengu. My puny little Caracal couldn’t keep up in damage or speed, so I resolved to look elsewhere to find my radar/unknown fix.

I moved into lowsec and began ratting in a little shitfit Caracal, making almost 15m an hour with barely 600k SP. It was awesome. I upgraded to a Drake as soon as I could fly it, and then I lost it shortly afterwards. Cloaky SB didn’t show up on d-scan and held me down while I was aligning with my brick so his Proteus buddy could pop me. I still came out with 50m in the black, but I decided I needed better skills to thrive in low.

Thus, I moved back to empire to run missions. At this point I was tired of flying solo and decided I needed better company, so I applied to Dreddit. Needless to say, my activity was a little low. Thus, I present to you my Arts and Crafts.

As my sixth grade art teacher certified me artistically retarded and my career is rather boring and technical, I decided to try something new. I make killer jello shots as a hobby (HAI, THIS IS COLEGE) I figured I’d try and draw something in jello.


I took a [picture of MMD](http://i.imgur.com/viEco.png) and changed some of the coloring so I could simplify it down to three colors.     [Simplified MMD] (http://i.imgur.com/PAvXu.png).

First, I made a [panna cotta base/background.](http://i.imgur.com/QhAsuh.jpg)

I traced out the outline of MMD into the panna cotta by stabbing the paper repeatedly with toothpicks. [Outline](http://i.imgur.com/ESWpLh.jpg)

Next, I made a chocolate cream jello and poured it into the [now-MMD shaped hole] (http://i.imgur.com/LmGl5h.jpg) in my panna cotta. The vodka curdled the buttermilk a little, since I was too lazy to make a grocery run for evaporated milk. [MMD Jello step 2] (http://i.imgur.com/PGJwjh.jpg)

As I was waiting for the second jello to set, I saw my MMD panna cotta cutout and decided to make a [second MMD](http://i.imgur.com/WH4blh.jpg), so I grabbed an exacto knife and a tiny spoon and stabbed away. [Eh](http://i.imgur.com/Ri3g6h.jpg)

Now, back to the story. As I was derping around in hisec, some poor soul asked in local for help killing a battleship rat in his L4 mission. Intrigued,  I asked him why he was having trouble killing rats. I looked him up and asked him for his fit; 2.7m SP, flying a 1200mm rail Maelstrom; 180 dps, 250 tank. Shit, I could kill BS rats easily in my shitfit 600k SP Caracal. So, I decided I would set this terribly abused Maelstrom free and convince the owner to downgrade to a boat he was better skilled to fly.

I trained HAMs to III, got my warp disruption to I, fitted out a drake and applied to his corp.

Like a cat brings home a bird, I present [babby’s first AWOX.] (http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=14301153)

Some recent shows include Wrath of the Titans and The Avengers. So I wanted to do a project involving what I know.

However, because I'm busy with work often, I obviously can't match feature film quality with the amount of time and effort I can allow myself on this. But I did try to incorporate some interesting techniques and make it decently polished for what it is.

Here's the final cut:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuX5B37PTE

For the first shot, I wanted to melt a metallic block into liquid using limited computational resources, since I'm currently on a laptop (my workstation is dead right now). So I developed a technique that involves simulating a sparse particle-based fluid and advecting a dense mesh by the velocity of the fluid.

Video shown here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRztMse3p-k

A problem that occurs is the mesh becomes way too distorted after only a small amout of flow, so I then extended the mesh advection method to a hybrid approach by blending the base mesh into a meshed isosurface of the sparse particle fluid. This allows me to keep the high-resolution detail of the crystalline metallic mesh, and swap it with the low-detail fluid simulation mesh when it's been sufficiently overdistorted.

And here's a video of an early test:

and here's a video of a very early cut without the melt:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7mNrRQydrg

As far as the fluid texturing goes, it essentially involves a point-cloud lookup on the fluid particles for various attributes, like emission color, and viscosity (which I change over time to simulate cooling effects). I use a point-cloud lookup, so I can have details that are finer than the actual mesh that's being rendered, and it also allows me to have actual 3D details that are tracked with the fluid surface,instead of trying to texture it.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_xqgi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/xqgi6/arts_and_crafts_submission_dreddit_title_sequence/,

So, yeah, you read those right.  I have no PvP experience and I took a Dramiel to my first fight.  By all rights I should have lost it.  I didn't because my team fucking rocked.

The gang was put together to go shit on the campers in NPC Fountain to make our space safe for little carebears (like me).  Our FC was calm and cool, our fighters were cool and were bringing in good intel, our eventual plan to fuck up these guys' day was well thought and executed.

I heard the go command to jump to gate and tackle something and I was in a fast frig with tackle so that meant me.  I'm pretty sure I got there first but with the lag I was experiencing my Overview might not have been fully up to date.  I locked the Jaguar because I figured slowing down the fastest ship in their group would be best for my gang.  I locked, orbited and started hitting the AB, scram, point, neut and guns over and over to get them all active.  I said on comms that I had a point and then I never said anything again until it was over.

For the first few seconds I was panicking because my mods wouldn't activate on the first click.  There was lag, just on my machine, caused by being on comms.  For the rest of the fight I just watched fascinated as my shields and then my armor went down in great big chunks.  I thought I was supposed to be so fast I was unhittable but nope, they were hitting me just fine.  As I realized that I was about to lose my ship I started trying to spam a warp button.  That was when I realized that I was warp scrammed.  So I switched to trying to turn on my MWD instead.  That didn't work the first three clicks because the AB was still on, natch.  Turn off AB, turn on MWD, start trying to get out and everything just freezes up in the lag.  I figured I'm probably dead by now so I go back to warping to try to save my pod.

Five seconds later the lag clears, everyone is cheering, it says ""gf gf"" in local and I'm still alive - at about 40% structure.

FUCKING DREDDIT KILLED THEIR ENTIRE GANG IN 10 SECONDS OF ALPHA FURY

All of my orbiting and spamming buttons and taking damage and panic encapsulated all of the rest of the fight as well.  Without all of them being so cool and calm and taking out each target I'd have taken the last shot to cost me that little ship.

So... I'll probably park the Dram for a while (though no guarantees) and start taking a Jag out so I can learn to fly and learn to actually 'see' what is going on instead of just realizing it all after the fact.

The biggest mistake I made was not taking the time to clarify who the FC was so I could say 'thank you' after it was over.  He was awesome, his plan meant they all died before I died.",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,t3_gri9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/gri9v/first_killmail_tldr_is_i_have_a_lot_to_learn_and/,

I also saw a bunch of posts about people being rejected by Dreddit HR. That is sad, but avoidable. 

To avoid aforementioned sadness, first do a thorough read-through of [Joining Dreddit](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Joining_Dreddit), noting in particular the sign-up requirements. In particular, you must have a 3 month old or older Reddit account with active comment/post history. No, we won't tell you what the exact requirement is. Chances are if you've commented only 10 times in 3 months and posted no links yourself, you probably won't get in.

If you are not active, try the ever-popular [Arts &amp; Crafts](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Arts_and_crafts) program! Make something fun, irreverent or amazing for HR and you might get in that way.

If you have a friend in Dreddit who has been in for at least 45 days, try getting in a [recommendation](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Recommendations)! Since recommendations come with some strings attached, in general people you don't know personally will not want to recommend you.

***You don't have to be good at EVE to join, you just have to be active on Reddit.***

If you make it in and you are an adorable newbro, [special welcome to you!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96b7Jk5xCTQ) Come to the ""test_free"" channel in game to get free ships to fly around and blow up, [join Jabber to get notifications of fleets where you can get your feet wet](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Jabber), and join the ""deedeereddit"" channel to ask questions and get answers, from simple questions like ""What does the Mechanics skill do"" to more advanced stuff like ""Can I fit a meta hardener to replace a T2 if there aren't any T2 mods on the market"" (don't worry, you'll get to the point where this all makes sense).

This is my submission to the Arts and Crafts program. I made a small 2D game, which can be downloaded (with it's source code) at github.com/omega-anon/rifterfly . The video explaining the game and showing it off is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItmyQn2cz2g).

The plot line (since there _must_ be a plot line) is thus: You are a fresh pilot in Dreddit flying a small tackle Rifter in a fleet exploring a strange wormhole. Suddenly, your targeting system stops working, everything turns monochromatic, and to top it all off, your fleet is being attacked. Being the faithful and fearless tackler Rifter pilot that you are, you immediately head for your tackle target, targeting system or not. However, it is on the other side of the enemy fleet! 

I had a lot of fun making this smallish project: coding the engine, adding the different ships, and designing the level. I hope you try it out, and have fun playing it!

Edit: I am currently creating a .jar file so you can just execute that. It might take me a few hours though, as I have to go through masses of documentation.

Edit 2: I got the .jar to work; I will push it as soon as I get WiFi on my laptop (Verizon locks tethering my cell phone; argh!).

He recommended posting on here and seeing the feedback.

Eh, About Solisk, we are borderline Alcoholics who like to log on drink and try to kill stuff (however most of the time its just getting to drunk and stationed camped) We've been living out in stains for some time now and well, we are all somewhat new players to be honest but stay active around 25-30 guys. 

The reason we are looking for test alliance is because we wanted to experience the game in a different light and enjoy some pew pew with new drinking mates. 

We have a team-blog you can read at http://soliskpub.wordpress.com/about if anyone is interested or just want something to view while being bored. 

We are pretty self sufficient and willing to do whatever is asked of us.

",morehooks,37,2,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/b2ikm/fittings_skills_and_tactics_for_you_tackler_your/,"The point of this is to write a ""complete"" basics guide to tackling. Hope its helpful. Also posted on the forum [here.](http://forum.dredd.it/index.php?topic=114.0) 

**What are tacklers?**
Tacklers are ships that slowdown (stasis webifiers) and stop enemy ships from getting away from the field of battle (warp disrupter and warp scrambler). Any ship can tackle, but in big fleets usually frigates perform this role.

Afterburners and Overdrive injectors make you go faster (though you have to activate the AB to make it work) and Nanofibers make you turn faster. Weapons fire as you expect.

**What skills are needed?**

Racial Frigate III

Propulsion Jamming I

Electronics III

Navigation I

Afterburner I

Hull Upgrades I

Mechanic I

Theses skills take about 2 days to learn. You may need some fitting skills (Electronics, Engineering, etc) to fit all the required modules.

**Merlin fitting (Caldari):**

Lows: Overdrive Injector, Nanofiber Internal Structure

Mids: Afterburner, Stasis Webifier, Warp Disrupter/Warp Scrambler, Cap recharger (gives you more capacitor, not essential)

Highs: 2 Rocket Launcher and 2  Hybrid Blasters (short range) or 2 Missile Launchers and 2 Hybrid Railguns (long range).

**Incursus (Gallente):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors, Nanofiber Internal Structure

Mids: 1Mn Afterburner I, Stasis Webifer, Warp Disrupter/Warp Scrambler

Highs: 3 Blasters (short range) or 3 Railguns (long range)
also one light drone (Warrior or hobgoblin)

**Rifter (Minmatar):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors, Nanofiber Internal Structure

Mids: 1MN Afterburner I, Stasis Webifier, Warp Disrupter/Warp Scrambler

Highs: 3 Autocannons and 1 Rocket Launcher (short range) or 3 Artillery Cannons and 1 Missile Launcher (long range)

**Punisher (Amarr):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors and 2 Nanofiber Internal Structure

Mids: 1MN Afterburner I, Warp Disrupter/Warp Scrambler

Highs: 4 Pulse Lasers (short range) or 4 Beam Lasers (long range)

Note: use the Crucifer if you want to use a Amarr frigate with 3 mid slots.

**Why no armor/shield tank?** 
Cause if you get hit by a cruiser or battleship (your most likely enemy), your little tank makes virtually no difference. So you ""speed tank"" so your enemy can't hit you. Also speed is needed to get in range of your warp disrupter/scrambler so you may well need those speed mods.

**What enemies/modules  should I fear?**
Short answer, many. Light combat drones can catch and kill you even if you are 40km away from the target, smartbombs can wipe out a frigate fleet in seconds, webifiers can slow you down to make you a sitting duck waiting to be destroyed, Neuts can wipe out your cap so you can't use any of your active modules (a sitting duck without any offensive weapons). 

And oh yeah, don't attack any interceptors on your own. You will die. 

**Short range or long range weapons?**
Short range weapons do more damage and will be able to hit most drones attacking you, but long range can fire from outside of 10km, which means you can take out of range of nasty modules such as smartbombs, Neuts and Webifiers which will likely kill you. 

You can also have blasters on your ship while orbiting at 12km +, you're most likely to survive this way, but I'd advise against this in a frigate swarm fleet, cause if everyone started doing this, we'd kill noone. 

**Warp disrupter or warp scrambler?** 
Warp disrupter has more range so if you want to stay out of range of smartbombs/Neuts/Webs or want a better chance of stopping your enemy getting away use disrupters. If you want to disable a Micro warp drive or having fitting usage issue (needs a quarter less CPU usage) use a scrambler.  

**How do I use a tackle ship?**
If you see a enemy on your overview in range of warp disrupter/scrambler hit F1 (your disrupter/scram should always be in the F1 slot) and then hold down crtl button and spam click on the enemy to get a lock.  

If your enemy is out of range hit approach or orbit and turn on your afterburner/Micro warp drive. Approach gets you there faster but you are more likely to be hit and die.

Once you activated your disrupter/scram on the enemy you have him ""tackled"" he can't get away unless he breaks your lock, kills you, gets out of range or you run out of cap. You should also activate your webifier to slow him down. And if you have enough cap fire your weapons.

**What is a micro warp drive?**
 Micro warp drive (MWD) can replace your afterburner as your speed booster. It requires more skill points and way more capacitor and fitting to use, but it makes your ship go approx 2-3 times faster.

**Should I use expensive modules?**
You can but everybody will think you're an idiot :D. A Tech 2 warp disrupter/scrambler is the only exception to this rule as it gives you more vital range.  

**I really like tackling alot what should I do next?**
Become a better a tackler by learning more navigation and capacitor skills. Also turn up to lots of fleets to get experience. There are Tech 2 tacklers called Interceptors that you may want to look at for the long term.

**I don't like tackling what can I do?**
 Learn electronic warfare. Especially if you're Caldari or Amarr.

The Mittani is acknowledged to be one of the best there is at meta-gaming Eve.  He regularly writes the ""Sins of a Solar Spymaster"" column which is often insightful and always well-written.  Someone with his wisdom has to know that eventually, no matter what he does, Goonswarm will eventually fall and die.  

It happens to all things.

However, this does not mean that Mittens doesn't have a contingency plan to help him retain power in the Eve universe.  What could that plan involve?  Well, there are some clues.  TEST Alliance has slowly been guided and nurtured by the Goons and, as head of the Swarm, by Mittens himself.  It has gotten to the point where now, TEST has eclipsed all other alliances in size.  Goons and TEST are still very cordial to each other and, in fact, mutual pledges of support have been exchanged. 

As Goons wane and TEST waxes it is not hard to see the Goonswarm being absorbed by TEST slowly.  But this is where we would need to look at the individuals involved.  We need to find someone who, has acted as a major troll in the past, and is rising in power.  Someone who has been making themselves into a person that others can look to for diplomacy and leadership....

Here's the final product in Gimp showing all my layers and paths:  http://i.imgur.com/rblqS.jpg

I was so caught up in creating the art that I forgot to take a true ""in-progress"" shot.  

Edit:  I'm assuming I need to wait to hear from someone before I apply again.  Is this correct?  Or do I need to have an open application?

Edit 2: If anyone wants it as a desktop background, that file is 1680X1050.  Have at it!

Incase you missed it, what is Dropbear Squad about? Well if you live in [the highlighted area of the world](http://i.imgur.com/EaHyY.jpg)... we're here to play with you... no... not like that (At least buy me a drink first!)

Here are the current plans:

* Destroyer / Cruiser roams.
* All members will be required to play drunk at least once per month, or be kicked out.
* Ratting / Havens / Plexes.
* Bait-and-Switch those *SniggWaffe Fucks*...
* If we can't find Reds, we'll shoot Blues (dropbear squad sparing)
* In the unlikely event that we get a group of miners... we'll do an OP. I'm not above shooting rocks / tanking rats - &lt;rant&gt;TEST fails at mineral prices (it's cheaper for me to import Zydrine from Jita FFS)&lt;/rant&gt;
* Eventually we'll do *Hot-Drop-Bear* roams in lowsec. The mechanics of this will need to be worked out.

As always, suggestions and tears are welcomed (Fo**Z**nez ingame).

We arrived, pretty uneventful, and all of a sudden the fleet has over 200 members. This is the 2nd time I've been in a fleet, and 200 seemed awesome. 

After a while, we mass warp out to a gate, and several people start deploying warp disruptors. I still have no idea what's going on, and decide to orbit a ship out near the edge of the fleet. 

Suddenly, an enemy warps in, everyone attacks, drones everywhere, but he manages to escape. I was in a rifter, and had begun approaching with a MWD when he jumped, so now I was out from the fleet, near where he had warped in.

That's when the main enemy force arrived. I took a hit from a cruise missile, lost most of my shields, second hit put me down to about 5% armor. Someone in our fleet saw me in danger, and healed my shields and armor to half. I panicked, and tried to get back to the safety of our fleet, but wasn't fast enough.

I found myself in a pod, in between 2 massive fleets blasting away at each other. I was enjoying my view of an epic battle, when an enemy decided I had lived long enough. I didn't even see an attack, I just woke up in 6vdt with a notification about the insurance on my rifter being paid.

The fight was still less than 3 minutes in, so I pod jumped to a station near vft, hoping to get a new ship and get back into the fight. 10 minutes of warping towards vft later, and I was finally back in a rifter, and ready for combat again. I undocked, and immediatley fell victim to a station camper with artillery. 

Back in my pod, and pissed off about losing my rifter that I forgot to insure, I raged in local chat, then after saying ""GET AT ME"" set a direct course toward him. I made it about 50 meters before his guns locked onto me, and I was back in the medical station, 9 jumps from vft. The fleet chat was mostly congratulations about winning, and how awesome logi was, so I decided that I had lost enough ships today, and at 5:47, logged out and went to sleep.

After hanging around the home base since landing there, I made the decision to travel 14 jumps from home to get myself some strip miners I found at the right price.

Getting there was uneventful, I loaded the goods into my Iteron and was on my way back. KVN was starting to heat up with reddies, according to the intel channel. 

But before that even, a single neut ship was expertly stalking me in a deserted system. It was literally like cat and mouse. I immediately started making safespot bookmarks, bouncing one off the other. I could tell this guy was good, toying with me almost. He actually managed to fly into the grid of my first safespot! But I was halfway towards warping away...

He never caught me, and ended up leaving the system. I was back on my way home, with KVN still to pass through. 

I warp into KVN. Local channel goes from empty to crowded with hostiles. Not wasting any time, I immediately fly within 100 km of a random asteroid belt, adding a bookmark mid-warp. From that safespot I bounce off the make another, and then another. Then I warp within 100 km of my next gate, it's time I got out of here.....warp ends and HOLY SHIT the whole hostile fleet is here camping the gate!!!

I flew back to my most complex safespot to gather my wits again. I convince myself that since I'm coming from a random safespot, odds are they won't have bubbles in place to stop me if I warp to 0 and jump right away.

And so, I turned on some dramatic music, and boldly charged back towards the gate, getting ready to spam the jump button. 

I see myself entering, the gate is camped heavily and littered with warp bubbles, but none of them are in my trajectory!!! I start spamming the jump button and poof! I'm outta there! SO LONG, SUCKAS!

(I know I didn't actually engage anyone, but running away from pvp'ers who know how to kill me was enough of a rush for this dirty carebear!)
