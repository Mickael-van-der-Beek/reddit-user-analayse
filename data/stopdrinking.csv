1359471165.0,242,self.stopdrinking,17hwpk,"For those struggling with the label ""alcoholic"" and if it applies to them.... ",strangesobriety,273,31,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/,"An alcoholic is characterized by how they react to alcohol, not by the type of bag around their bottles, or their tendency to embark on movie-cliche-drunk behavior, or the amount of cars they've wrecked, or marriages they've ruined, or jobs they've lost, or nights spent in jail or on a park bench, or amount they drink, or the amount of time they've been drinking, or anything else like that. 

An alcoholic is someone who experiences a fundamentally different reaction to alcohol than your ""normal, temperate"" drinker. Once an alcoholic takes a drink, the phenomenon of craving is set off. A physical compulsion and mental obsession for *more* kicks in after the first drink / drug. An alcoholic is someone whose body and mind react to alcohol in a way that makes it hard or impossible to stop once they've started or stay stopped when they put it down. 

This reaction to alcohol (and other mind altering drugs) is a fundamental part of the alcoholics mental and physical makeup. This phenomenon of craving does not disappear or fade over time. It doesn't go away if we go to detox or dry out for *X* number of days / weeks / months / years. It doesn't change if we switch up the type of booze we drink or the places we drink in or people we drink with. It doesn't go away if we start exercising or seeing a counselor or getting in touch with our inner feelings. It doesn't go away because we've finally gained the self knowledge to realize alcohol is causing us harm. The only defense we have against the power of the phenomenon of craving, and the way our bodies and minds react to alcohol, is to avoid puting the first drink or drug into our systems, one day at a time. By doing this, we are afforded a daily reprieve from the consequences booze has in store for us, and that's all we can ever ask for. 

If you think all alcoholics are skid row bums or regularly embark on Hunter S. Thompson style escapades, go check out a few AA meetings in the wealthy part of your nearest city or it's affluent suburbs. And if you think you don't qualify as an alcoholic because your brain is running around in circles on overtime to come up with justifications and excuses and more palatable terms like ""problem drinker"", I've got news for you: Non-alcoholics don't spend any time at all wondering if they prefer the term ""problem drinker"" over ""alcoholic."" That kind of thinking is the mental part of your disease working its magic to push you back towards a drink because *you were never really that bad*. 

Minimization, justification, denial - these are the mental tricks your alcoholism uses against you. Alcoholism may be the most insidious enemy you have yet faced, because it speaks to you in your own voice and thoughts. Your best defense against these kinds of mental stumbling blocks is to get honest and familiar with your own story. This is one of the biggest reasons why people in AA tell their story again and again, even after years of sobriety. By taking a good, long, hard look at our established track record with drugs and alcohol, and then getting honest about it to another sober alcoholic, we learn more about ourselves than we ever would mulling it over in our own head. Because that's where my alcoholism lives - in my head, in my thoughts - and if I give it a chance, it will quickly manipulate and justify my history of drinking into a convincing argument for that most dangerous lie: *""I was never really that bad.""* If you have a proven track record of drugs and alcohol causing problems in your life, but are struggling to find reasons or ways to avoid the label of ""alcoholic"", that's the lie you need to be worried about. Because as soon as you start believing it, you're going to be drinking again. And if it wasn't ""that bad"" before, the progressive nature of alcoholism is sure to make all those *""but I haven't done _______ yet""*'s come true.

I'm working in my studio when I realize I need to blow my nose.  I don't have any tissue paper here, and I don't want to blow my nose in my shirt because that would be fucking disgusting, so I have to go into the house.  

In the bathroom, I realize the toilet paper roll is almost empty, so I use the last square, then take the empty roll off.  Remembering how annoying my wife finds it when there's no TP on the roll, I check under the sink to see if there's any in the cabinet.  There isn't.  That means I need to go into the utility room to get more out of the supply closet.  She'll never know I did this, but I don't care.  

On my way there I see that the dog's food dish is empty.  I fill it up.  Then I get the TP and bring it back into the bathroom.  I put it on the roller.

Then, on my way out, I notice my daughter is sitting alone in her room, on her bed, looking kind of sad.  I pop in to give her a hug and find out what's bugging her.  She's having issues with a friend at school.  We talk about the best way to handle it.

The cat comes in.  We pet it, and the cat acts silly.  This makes us laugh.  This in turn brings my other daughter in, and soon she's laughing.  Naturally my wife wants to know what all the commotion is about.  So the four of us are in one room, laughing together at the cat's antics.  This is my family and I love them.

It is frankly hard to believe, and I've lived it.  

I very much remember not believing that I could make it a day without a drink or some weed.  Life without alcohol or drugs didn't make any sense whatsoever, but life with it had become unbearable.  

I was a teenager when I stopped, and really believed that life was over and not going to be fun anymore.  Boy was I wrong.  I was (am) also an atheist and was forced to go to (those damn) 12 step meetings where they didn't stop talking about god.  Back then we didn't have reddit (or the internet, or cell phones for that matter), so I had to find my support group face to face. 20 years later I'm still going, and have a  solution to my problem, and am still an atheist.  

I may not know much, but I do have some experience not drinking one day at a time, so feel free to ask me anything about that if you so wish.  I'll be heading out to one of those (damn) meetings in a bit but I'll be checking in to see if there are any questions or comments.

The first one is the closest to my office. Right around the corner. Things cost a little more there, but it's the closest and that's important.

The second one is a little further away. I like to go there on the days when I actually have an appetite because there are a few restaurants. It's nice to already have the bottle as soon as I get off work so I can take a drink right away even though the other liquor store is not even five minutes away. Despite it all, I was always very good about not drinking at work, but sometimes the DT's were just too much so it was good to have a quick drink just to get through the afternoon on those days.

I rarely stopped at the third place since I was often already set, but it was there if my regular haunts were out of the cheap stuff.

The fourth one is close to my house and next to a grocery store, which works well for the secret alcoholic. ""Oh, crap babe, we're out of sugar!"" ""Don't worry, I'll be happy to run out and get some sugar.""

I hadn't been to the fifth one in years until recently because it was one of those warehouse-type places. They didn't sell any cheap stuff, so I stopped going there. I did go there recently, though, because I was in a hurry. The wife had to run a quick errand. I was out but I didn't think I'd enough have time to make it to my regular stores before she got back. It kind of felt normal to buy vodka in a glass bottle again. Not that it mattered since I immediately poured it into an old plastic bottle since those are much easier to hide. The same guy worked there. He remembered me after probably two years. I asked him if he'd been able to quit smoking yet. He hadn't.

The sixth one is my favorite. It's open 24/7 which I didn't even know was possible until I found it. Bottle empty at midnight? No worries. Wake up on Sunday morning to discover you'd drank everything? (which I never understood why that ever surprised me since I always drank everything) It's all good.

When I passed by all these places yesterday and fought the urge to stop, I wondered if any of the nice clerks there who were so friendly to me wondered where I was. Did they think I got a DUI? Worry I got in a wreck? Maybe some of them thought I decided to quit drinking and were happy for me, even?

In reality, none of them thought about me at all, because none of them give a fuck about me. They'll never think about me again.

I broke down right there in our office. She told me to take the day off and go to the Woman's Resource Center for some help.

I was with four of them last night for a volunteer project I am a part of.  It was at a private home and I did not know any of them.   They all knew each other.  One of them brought 2 huge bottles of homebrew beer, which was a surprise to me.

First, he shows them off when he arrives, as they are in fancy bottles.  Everyone applauds him.   And then he puts them in the fridge, where they sit for over an hour until the delivery food arrives.  

Second, when they finally did crack open the bottles, they each drank maybe a pint of beer.   Over a three hour period.

And third, when I declined to have any, nobody cared in the absolute slightest.   No questions.  No eyebrows.  Nothing.

So, we had a fun, productive time, and I now have four new good people in my life.   I spent the night shell-shocked about how normal people treat alcohol.   I would never have waited 80 seconds to open that first bottle, never mind 80 minutes.   A half-gallon of beer would not have been enough to get ME through three hours, never mind splitting it four ways.   And drinking in front of non-drinkers was always too awkward for me, which is why I ended up doing it alone all the time.

So... it's over.   Holy hell is it over.   It's obvious I can never, ever be a normal drinker again.   The idea is so absurd that I am more repulsed by alcohol than ever.

I hadn't seen her in 3 years, and we bumped into each other at a mutual friend's art exhibit yesterday. She had broken off the engagement, citing my drinking as a major factor. She is a recovering alcoholic, kicking the habit right when we starting dating, at her doctor's recommendation. Her excessive drinking was causing acid reflux issues, which apparently can lead to cancer. It was the wake-up call she needed. 

I left not too long after she broke the engagement, and she requested that we didn't have any contact. It was devastating. We'd been together for 7 years. I was prepared to lose the relationship, but never to lose my best friend. In the time after the breakup, I was been involved with a lot of women, and every one ended with me unceremoniously breaking up with them. More times than not, it involved my drinking, and the shame it would bring when I would say and do things that I didn't remember. Shame led to self-sabotage, which led to depression, anxiety and more drinking. I think somewhere in myself I wanted to hurt people the way I'd been hurt. No one was as good, or as smart, or as funny as my ex, and I'd chosen booze over her. It was easier to leave, and drink, than fight for the relationship. I was hopeless and lost. 

The last time I talked to her, before yesterday, was when I went to pick up some stuff from our apartment a few months after I'd left. I was snooping - *don't do this* - and found men's underwear and other evidence around the apartment. I started shaking, all over, and my vision closed in on me. It was a visceral reaction I'd never had. I left, and never went back. I called her, demanded answers, stupidly, to which I of course wasn't entitled. I went home, poured a six pack down my throat in the matter of half an hour, and curled up in a fetal position on the floor, for I don't know how long. That day was the last I'd talked to her until yesterday.

I didn't fall apart when I saw her, like I thought I might. We talked. We cried. We made jokes about things we used to make fun of, and talked about the pets we used to have. I told her I was sober now, and how sorry I was that I'd been so shitty at the end, and how I wished I could have done it sooner. We hugged, and she left, and we were both very happy - in a very bittersweet, melancholy kind of way - that we'd run into each other. I felt like some kind of elephant in my emotional room had left. It was closure, I guess. 

Before I stopped drinking, If I saw her, I probably would have gone home and poured a six pack down my throat until the weirdness and pain went away, and probably gone up to the bar and drank more, until the pain crept back in and I would come home and curl up on my bed and cry myself to sleep. But now, I'm facing these feelings sober. I'm not numbing the pain and regret. It still hurts. Hurts like hell. I regret so much. But I'm feeling it, deep in my gut, and I'm forced to face it. I'm forced to grow and learn. This, I realize now, is how bad alcohol really was for me. It was stunting my very emotional and spiritual maturation.

I have a girlfriend now, who's great. I don't compare her to my ex, I don't say shitty things to her when I'm drunk, or fool around with other women in a beer-induced haze. And I'm feeling everything, the pain, the regret, the self-sabotage, the mistakes. And I'm not, like exacerbating an injury by shooting it up with painkillers, avoiding the hard work of dealing with these issues - that everyone has - by drinking them away. It doesn't help, it only puts off the inevitable.

As usual when I check in, I thank you guys at /stopdrinking from the bottom of my heart. I really don't think I could have gotten this far without you. It can get better. Not easier, but better.

I stopped drinking.  Blindingly obvious?  Sure.  But it had to be done before any progress could be made, because as long as I was feeding my addiction, I was getting sicker and sicker.

2.  I talked to other alcoholics.  There have been two ways I've done this:  this sub (for the better part of two years) and AA (for the past year).  I felt for a long time that AA was not for me.  No shit it wasn't for me--I was an active alcoholic who would have done anything to keep drinking.  I have zero interest in the AA debate, so I'll just say this: AA is a program of acceptance, not analysis.  While there are some parts of it that are downright offensive to my twenty-first-century redditing self, please see the headline of this submission for the reason why I keep going.

3.  Sobriety is like marriage--it requires maintenance.  You don't just get sobriety like you get a coin in the pocket.  You don't just find it and hang onto it. You work it. The more you work it, the more it works on you.  It sounds tiring, but it's way less work than being an active alcoholic.  WAY less.

4.  I have never said I've quit drinking forever.  I can't deal with that.  I can drink any time I want.  I can go to the liquor store right now and buy a six-pack of 10% tall boys if I want to.  I CAN... but I choose not to.  I know what happens if I choose to drink.  It ain't pretty.

5.  Life has gotten steadily better for me, a little bit at a time, every day for the last three years.  I won't go into detail here, mostly because it would take too long.  Suffice it to say that this is SO worth it.

I hear this one a lot from other drinkers, too.  Many alcoholics believe that as long as they continue to make money, hold on to the respect of their peers, and are never late for work or drunk on the job, there is no problem.  They work hard, and so they deserve to party hard, too.  

There is something self-congratulatory about high-functioning alcoholics.  They believe they are a rare animal, a superhuman beast who can put up with more punishment than the average person.  But high-functioning alcoholics are actually the most common kind of alcoholic you will see.  That's because the low-functioning ones are invisible.  

Why are they invisible?  Because they're all dead.  Either that, or they're in prison, or a mental institution, or a detox ward.  Off the street.  You don't see them.  Until you join them, that is.  Then suddenly your eyes will be opened to the fact that there is a whole other world that you never knew existed.  Prisons, mental hospitals, and other institutions are part of that sick, sad world, and once you're a citizen of that world you face a very long, hard road to get out again.  

But what is the problem with being a high-functioning alcoholic?  If you're getting along fine in the world, then why should you even worry?

The myth of the high-functioning alcoholic is that alcohol isn't hurting them.  Many people even point to alcohol as having helped them in their lives.  This is not true, of course.  If they are alcoholics, then alcohol is actually killing them.  They succeed in spite of their addiction to alcohol, not because of it.  Imagine how much more they could accomplish if alcohol wasn't in control.

When I think of high-functioning alcoholics, I am reminded of people who are millionaires on paper.  These people may have lots of assets they can list, but very little actual money in the bank.  I was a millionaire on paper for a while myself.  I didn't have more than a few hundred dollars in the bank, but I could produce various contracts that would prove that I was very wealthy indeed.  

As a high-functioning alcoholic, I was happy on paper.  I had a beautiful wife, two beautiful children, I owned a lovely house, I had lots of friends, I had accomplished all my professional and personal goals by the time I was 30.  I could prove that I was very happy indeed, and in fact I frequently listed all these things to myself in an attempt to talk myself out of the horrible, crushing weight of the depression that had taken over my life.

Why was I so miserable?

Because that's what alcohol was really doing to me.  It wasn't helping me at all.  It was killing me.  Now that I've stopped drinking, I'm not miserable any more.  

Despite everything I accomplished, while I was drinking I had not yet begun to function.  Now I can say with pride that I really am a high-functioning alcoholic.  I don't drink any more, and haven't for 1001 days, and that's why I'm functioning at a higher level than I ever have before.  I'll always be an alcoholic, and there's nothing I can do about that.

My drinking story is the same as many of you, but I hope my sobriety will inspire at least one person.  At the age of 35 I was drinking daily but had only been drinking ""hard"" for about three years. I was misled, thinking that I had not been drinking LONG enough to be an alcoholic already.  I thought there MUST be someway through will power to dig my way out of the hole. I am female by the way.

My body could not take it.  I was getting so sick. Puking all the time.  Losing weight. Hair falling out.  Sneaking bottles. Hiding from my husband.  So humiliating.  Reading on the Internet, forums like this. Trying to moderate.  Switching to Smirnoff Ice, hoping that would help, always going back to Vodka.

Then I tried to stop once and for all. ""They"" said AA - 90 meetings in 90 days. I didn't believe in God. I figured since I went to college, I could do 9 meetings in 90 days.  I thought the meetings were lame and too basic. The people were weird.  The sayings were dumb and glib. I didn't NEED new friends. I had a great family.  These people were basically right out of jail. It made me MORE depressed.  I always went back to drinking no matter what, right when I got close to 30 days.

I would feel so good with about 10, 15, 20 days.  SO good.  Then it would lure me back, thinking if I could quit once I could quit again.  And AA just seemed so....goofy.  I was not religious.  I would switch meetings because I was embarrassed. I didn't want a ""sponsor."" or Steps. I wanted to do it my way, I would read the book, skip ""steps"" and do ""step four"" by myself and just wing it and sit in the back of the room.

The last time I hit 30 days I bought a mini pint of vodka and said it was my last mini vacation with alcohol, just a day off, I said. It turned into a 5 day bender landing me in the hospital and almost killed me.  After that I went into AA full force, doing 2 meetings a day (in the morning and at night). I said I would do ANYTHING, all the prayer bullshit (even though I did not believe it, I figured, why not), I would cut the head off a live chicken if they told me to).  I got a sponsor, I just figured my life was over, so who cares.  I treated it like boot camp in the army. I just said - do whatever you guys want with me. I was a zombie. I sat in rooms and just pretended I was in jail observing people writing a book and these were characters - anything to pass the time and make it bearable.

A funny thing happened. The people became interesting. I actually became fond of them.  I realized they were actually nice - and I let them get to know me.  Stuff started to click. And the ""praying"" bullshit - for some reason, I don't know why or how - made something change in my life.  Even though I don't believe in that. This post would become WAY too long if I described all the other changes. I just know that I started going to AA because I had no choice - that or dying - and it changed my life.  I hope someone who said they never would do it, and they are sitting here thinking this - maybe will give it a chance like I did. 9 years ago today.

Last April I had been an alcoholic for about 6 years and it was the first time I attempted to quit. 
    
I know a lot of people on here used AA (or similar groups) and swear by it, but I haven't attended any meetings and I don't intend to. I also haven't told any of my friends or family that I have quit due to having a drinking problem (but I am sure some of them know).
    
My support has been entirely through this subreddit. I was lucky enough to have few cravings in the last 12 months but each time I did I just imagined what the response from you guys would be if I said ""I went on holiday, my friend suggested having one drink, and this turned into a bender"". I knew people would say ""Why did you have the one drink? What benefit did that one drink give you? Why are you making it difficult on yourself?"" etc etc. That was enough to dissuade me from taking that stupid first step. 
    
My advice to people starting out would be:  
**1. Make it easy for yourself in the first few weeks**. It doesn't matter if your diet takes a nose-dive, it will be so much better to eat that sugary snack and avoid the alcohol cravings until you feel more comfortable  
    
**2. When you are ready for it, start exercising**. When you feel you are ready, make it more social (i.e. join a class, exercise with friends etc). Finally (if it possible) book into a local competition for your chosen sport. I ran a 10KM run last May and a half marathon last September, and the preparation I did for these runs made me forget about booze for months at a time.     
  
**3. No-one cares (or people care very little) why you aren't drinking**, including at social events. You can either tell people directly (I realised alcohol had a negative impact on my life, so I decided to stop) or you can skirt around it (I'm running in the morning, I don't enjoy drinking, I want a clear head tomorrow etc). As I said, I haven't told anyone why I really stopped, but in my case I wasn't ever thinking of an excuse because I genuinely wanted to exercise and keep a clear head.    
  
**4.** Most importantly, just **do not take a sip of that first drink**. Just don't. If you're on this subreddit it means you're already committed to attempting to stop, so make sure the last drink you had is the last drink you ever have. Do whatever it takes to avoid it because, believe me, you will feel awesome for avoiding it.

It's ridiculously long, and I've mostly made it as a list I can have in a 'safe place' (the internet!) that I can come back to whenever I'm tempted:

* Every attempt I have ever made to moderate has ended in failure. Not always immediately, but always inevitably. I can control the first few drinks, even go out and have one or two, but it always escalates until I am drinking alone and hammered on a bottle of wine.

* Drinking has almost cost my degree and my mental health. 

* I have not done the work I was meant to do. I missed out on numerous  important networking and academic opportunities because I was drunk or nursing a hangover.  I turned up to a networking meeting still drunk - at 4pm. The person I met looked at me with an expression of slight disgust and bewilderment that I have never forgotten.   I once turned up to a seminar I was meant to teach still under the influence (the seminar was in the afternoon, and I had been drinking in the morning - I wasn't slurring my words or stumbling at that point, but pretty sure I must have smelt of booze). If any of the students had noticed (or - horrors - maybe they did notice but didn't say anything) and reported it, it would have finished my teaching career.   I took a thermos flask of wine into the library with me and just drank while listening to Daft Punk. I would panic about having missed deadlines due to being drunk and then drink to mitigate the panic. The next day I would panic again and the cycle continued - for almost two years. 

* I accidentally left the oven on while drinking, could have burned my house down and killed both myself and my housemate. 

* Towards the 'mid point' of my binging days (the high), I found it amazing that I could, answerable to no-one, buy two bottles of wine (one as back up - the horror of running out) and get drunk by myself, listen to music, and numb everything I felt and thought, then lie down on the bed with everything spinning slightly. It was glorious and it was my most favourite thing to do in the world.

* Towards the 'end', I did the same but, after the initial fuzzy half hour, hated both it and myself.

* Suicidal thoughts and fantasies started to creep in. 

* The internal loop of my thoughts was constantly stuck on resentments towards others, my family, people who had upset or wronged me, and self-pity.

* If I was out with friends, I would constantly watch the 'level' of their drinks and try and control my drinking so I didn't drink too quickly. This was a kind of torture, especially when people would reach the near the bottom of their glasses and seem not to notice. How could you not notice you are almost out of alcohol?!? It never fully formulated in my head that only someone with a problem with alcohol would be aware of something like that.

* If I had an open bottle of wine, I could never save half or it or a third of it for another day. I had to drink it all, always.

* I gained 20 pounds.

* From having a baby face, I started to show wrinkles on my forehead, worsened by silmultanouesly oily and dehydrated skin.

* I had to hide bottles under my bed and every month I would go out to an abandoned railway track and dump them. 

* If a housemate left alcohol in the house and they went away, I would drink and replace it before they got back.

* If I went home, I would sneak alcohol, steal it, and replace it when my parents were out. Sometimes I would fill things up with colouring and water and pray that no-one 'fancied a drop of wine/whiskey/whatever' before I had a chance to properly replace whatever was in it.

* Muslim man at cornershop looked at me with such concern when I was buying a bottle of gin at 11am and asked me if I was okay and looked as though he was going to refuse to sell it to me. Ran out of the shop and never went in again out of shame. (Also, if I got alcohol in the morning, I would also buy 'party food' in an attempt to make it look like I was having some kind of do later on - pretty sure all shopkeepers saw through it though.) 

* Housemate went away for a week. Drank around the clock while playing video games. On about the fourth night, I was retching and vomiting constantly and couldn't stop and was just throwing up the water I was drinking. Had to keep running to the sink to let loose projectile stomach water. I wonder now if it was some kind of alcohol poisoning. I didn't go to A &amp; E out of shame and just stayed in bed, shivering and sweating constantly. 

* I got into debt. I spent stupid amount of money on things I didn't need. Oh, and booze.

* I wet the bed on more than one occasion. If the memory of any of the above ever fails me, peeling a pair of piss-sodden skinny jeans off my legs (a challenge of Krypton Factor proportions) haunts me still. 

* I once accidentally drunk my own wee. 

* I tore a ligament in my arm from falling over something while drunk in my bedroom, couldn't write or use my hand/arm at all for two months, had to lie on the hospital forms for reason why.

* I would walk home from places instead of getting a cab, in the dark. 
- once I started drinking, I couldn't stop.

He was the hardest working man I've  ever known. He would never miss work, and in fact his job made him take vacations since he never took it.  When he got home he rebuilt cars, did countless hours on house improvements, and was always cleaning.  He would help anyone out who needed it free of charge. 

But around the age of 48 his habit of drinking 12-24 beers a day caught up with him.  He had 3 heart surgeries, but that did not stop him from working hard.  Then around 51 he started having panic attacks behind the wheel.  Which eventually lead to him losing his job. 


He got himself together a little bit got another job (never quit drinking though), but then the panic attacks came back.  He lost that job was put on oxygen, but the drinking continued.  He went from amazingly built man weighing around 175, to 130 lbs,  and frail as they come within SIX MONTHS.  

I personally drove him to detox 3 times, each time he was completely drunk and insisted on stopping to get more beer since it was  "" his last time"".  But he never stuck with not drinking.  He would always say all the other people in rehab had real problems with drugs, and he just drank. 
He died within 3 months of saying that at the age of 52, a feeble, broken man.  

It was and still is the  saddest day in my life. I went through his possessions, and it felt like I was going through a child's things.  He had a pocket knife, a clay ornament I made him in 3rd grade, and clothes.  That was it.  He died eight years ago, and I still find myself crying over it. 

But this is what ""High Functioning"" will lead you to. It's not a badge of honor, or an amazing feat to be won. 

It's funny my Dad spent so much time doing all this stuff around the house and for other people, because he never felt comfortable in his own skin.  He was always doing these things, so if you complained to him about drinking, he would say ""At least I go to work and x, y z"".  But he never realized that all of his personal relationships were sacrificed too, due to his time doing other things. I was by far the closest person to him, but we were never that close. Because he didn't know himself.  

I wanted to share this to show, that being an alcoholic doesn't mean you're lazy, not successful, or some dead beat.  You can function, but the cost of functioning like this will catch up with you, and it will cost you so much more than you know. 

Thank you

First all thanks to reddit stop drinking and my Internet bestie the-incredible-sober I'm loving my first sober vacation ever!! 


I have to say when I first got here I was nervous if I could stay sober. My whole family is here and much of what they do is centered around drinking. Also the fridge and coolers are packed with my favorite beer. 

I thought we'll hey you're on vacation you've gone this far what's the harm in drinking? I know it's wrong but for some reason I had to hear it from someone else and of course my Internet bestie came through. 

She reminded me you don't need alcohol to have fun especially at a beach house. And that I don't want to ruin my vacation with hangovers and regret, which would of definitely happened. 

I even went out with two other couples and stayed sober all night and had a great time. and here I am up with my kids early about to go walk on the beach, while everyone else is still sleeping nursing their hangovers.

Some are making it day by day.  Others are either struggling or dead.  I look at alcoholism as an allergy. Just like any other allergy there is a reaction. In the case of a nut allergy the persons throat swells shut in a few minutes and they suffocate.  With alcoholism the reaction is in the brain, it destroys your judgement, self control... it's your brain.  Only instead of dying a quick and painless death, alcoholics get to destroy not only themselves but everyone around them.  Nasty stuff.  I know that this isn't new information, just letting you know how I feel about the disease.

My father is my inspiration, he was 42 years sober when he passed.  He was active in AA and sponsored many alcoholics.  I learned many things from him.  I think his best piece of advice was ""Rule number one: Don't drink"". Do whatever you have to, don't drink.  If you can stick by that rule you can work through the rest.

I've had some very tough times, white knuckles, calling tree and all that. And still, not a day goes by that I don't think about drinking. ""I know I can handle just one."", I tell myself..  Having that happen, fighting those ruminations, helps me to stay sober. I know that a normal drinker doesn't think like that (IE I'm not a normal drinker).  They don't plan their day around drinking. They don't sit around telling themselves they can drink just one, they'll be able to control it.  This is my cornerstone reminder that I'm an alcoholic and alcohol will kill me.  Same as if I'm allergic to peanuts, would I go buy a big can of planters and party?  Something reminds them not to eat the peanuts, something reminds me not to drink the corn whiskey.

Also, I'm Bi-polar and an atheist.  So, I have some experience with those two stumbling blocks some of us run into.

Almost every Russian (male) I know is a heavy drinker or at least a binge drinker.  If you tell them that you don't want to drink, they look at you like you are just the craziest person ever.  They instantly notice if you are not drinking and question it.

We constantly make jokes about drinking.    Oh you have a headache?  Drink 100 grams of vodka, you will be ok.  You don't need a doctor, you just need a bottle of Goose.  Drinking is treated like a hobby, not a problem.

To be labeled an alcoholic in my culture, you literally have to be living on the street begging for money.  Even drinking on the job is ok as long as you can handle it.  Hell, drinking anywhere is ok.  It's insane to not open the case of beer in the car when driving somewhere with your friends.  Being a functional alcoholic won't draw any serious attention, especially if you drink something like 5 drinks a day.

Russians frequently have shots at dinner.  Yes, you will literally drink a shot and eat a chaser multiple times at a normal dinner.  If it is a dinner get together, forget about it.  Nobody is leaving the table until the bottle is gone.  When the women get angry over how much we've had, we sneak around drinking more.

It's really hard to be clean when everybody tells you that you DON'T have a problem despite drinking everyday and obsessing over alcohol.

It's up at the lake, and there is feasting and bonfires and every year, it's been a great excuse for me to get cross-eyed.

I didn't know how I would handle being around a large number of my drunk relatives while I was sober.  

Well, guess what? They weren't drunk. As it turns out, they may have had a moderate glow going, but nobody was hammered. Then I found out that, in past years, they weren't hammered THEN, either. In fact, all these years, the only one getting hammered was ME.  

Here I was stressing about the weekend, and all I got was positive feedback from my relatives about how happy they were that I was sober this time around.

I can't say it has been easy, or that my life all of a sudden was better. I can't say that even now I don't crave a drink as a kicker for a celebration... after years of drinking for *any* excuse, this would be, for me, one heck of a thing to think/drink to celebrate.
 
I called my AA sponsor and I'm picking up my 1 year coin on the 2nd of March, that's when they have the ""birthdays"". Still, I don't feel worthy. I really don't. I still have cravings, the old-timers say what the old-timers say, and I haven't been able to get to as many meetings as I'd like because of RealLife(tm) stuff.
 
I'm told that the desires and cravings tend to stop, and yea they do lessen to an extent, but I'm actually shivering right now typing this because I really want a drink to celebrate my not drinking. It's enough to go insane, ya' think? I don't I won't, I know it'll pass, but woosh.
 
My life hasn't been all of a sudden easier starting a year ago. Instead it was harder. Yet I think it's been more fulfilling because I've noticed more of my life and what it has to offer me and what I can offer those around me.
 
I think that today isn't that big of a day because the weeks leading up to this day a year ago... last week I was reminded of what drove me to stop drinking. The bouts, the fights, the general stupidness that goes along with being a drunkard. All of that I remembered as my anniversary. The peak of my drinking before quitting... does not sit easily with me.
 
Again, why the instinct is still there, to have a drink, to dull out the reminder of why I stopped drinking. Insanity, it seems.
 
I've hung out in the IRC chatroom (sorry about my borked connection, guys) and hung out here a lot. All the help I received from everyone is greatly appreciated. I may have been able to do this all by myself, but it was really great to have people to talk to.

I feel like I've been struggling lately, and I wanted to... I don't know, I thought maybe this would help strengthen my resolve, telling someone about it who can understand.


I'm 39 years old.


New Years Eve, 2012.  My wife is going to a party with friends (girls night out).  I'm on my way home from picking my 2 year old up from daycare and I stop at the store to get something to drink, since it's New Years Eve after all.  I'm planning on quitting as a ""new years resolution"", the same way I'd planned on quitting as a ""new years resolution"" the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that before my son was born.


I'm standing in line at the store waiting to get my drink for the night, and thinking about how my wife was going out, and my son was going to be home with me, and for the briefest moment I realized as I had decided on getting a fifth instead of a pint (it's new years, after all) that it was never going to stop.  I knew I shouldn't be drinking that night.  Maybe my wife (who drinks maybe once or twice a year) would need a ride home, what if I had to go somewhere, or take my son somewhere, and I kept thinking to myself... ""it'll be fine, it's just one night..."" 


All of this is going through my head in the few moments while standing in line, holding my son's hand, waiting for my booze and I realized it was never going to stop.  No matter what reason I had to not drink, my idiot brain would figure out a way around it.  As long as I could just get it home with me, I'd find a way to justify it to myself later.


That was my moment.  I was planning on quitting tomorrow anyway.  I looked down at my son, who lifted his arms to be picked up.  I picked him up and he gave me a hug and laid his head on my shoulder, almost instinctively like he knew I was struggling with something.  Right there, in the midst of all those people, it was my turn to step up in line at the counter and order and I decided at that moment, that just for tonight I wasn't going to drink.  I'll get shitfaced tomorrow and quit on the second, but tonight, this New Years Eve, I'm going to choose not to drink.  Not a resolution, not a grand gesture, not expecting anyone to pat me on the back for it, just because I chose to gain some sort of control over this for just one night when I had every excuse to drink.  (it's new years eve, after all)


""Hey! Happy New Year, what will it be tonight?"", her name is Katie.  She'd sold booze to me for years.  She knew that's what I was there for.  ""Ya know what?  I'm good, thanks.  Have a happy new year.""  and I carried my son out to the Jeep and we went home.


The night came and went.  The boy went down for bed around 8:30 like usual, my wife went out to her party and came home around 1:30, and I sat and played World of Warcraft on New Years Eve like I had for the last 6 years, for the first time actually sober on New Years Eve.  


I woke up the next day and looked in the mirror and I almost cried.  The amount of self-pride that the 'morning me' had that morning for the 'other me'... looking at myself in the mirror.  I know I said I'd get drunk tonight for not getting drunk last night, but I think I might wait just another day.  I'll get drunk tomorrow.  


That was 66 days ago.  The bigger that number gets, the harder it is for me to let it reset back to zero.  Some times, that is the only motivation I have on the way home when I stop to get hamburger or milk for dinner.  What a waste it would be after 67 days to ruin it now and have to start over, for what?  A hangover?  ""But... it's just one drink, we don't have to get drunk, just have something small and call it good.  We've gone this long w/o drinking, clearly we have control over it.""  


 /sigh


I have had this conversation in my head so many times.  Some days I see this number being as high as 365 days, but I know better than that.  Right now I am happy just keeping it at 1.  


I was subbed to this subreddit for a long while and eventually began feeling so guilty that I couldn't quit that I unsubbed to get the voices out of my head and to cut the guilt, but honestly it helped a lot even when I was drinking 5-7 nights a week.  Thanks everyone.  


Well, today I'm back.  67 days and counting.  It's not a new years resolution, I just simply don't want to drink, today.


tl;dr:  Sober for one day, 67 days in a row.

I owe it to you guys to tell you how the last four years of my life has been, because you are the same kind of people that helped keep me sober.

I started drinking when I was 16, but not heavily until I was 18 and a freshman in college.  The first year wasn't too bad, and I could sleep through most classes picking up C's, but by the second year (age 19) I was a full blown alcoholic.  At that point in my life, school was just another obstacle inbetween my bottle and I, so I quit school, obviously.  

My life was literally wasted for the next 7 years.  My schedule everyday -- wake up (2pm if I didn't have to work), drag myself to liquor store or convenience store for some booze, recognize my depression, drink.  Then I would drive out to the bar if I could muster anybody to go with on a weeknight.  When I did have to work, the whole day was just a hungover haze. Every morning I would wake up and have nothing to be excited about.  Everyday was the same, and there was nothing I could do to change it, because I knew I would be drinking again very soon that day.  My life was groundhogs day.

People that say they only drove drunk the times they got caught are full of shit.  I drove drunk all the time.  I remember waking up in my bedroom wondering how the hell I got there.  I would have vague memories of the night before, the party, or stopping for gas and almost getting into fights with random strangers at gas pumps.  The worst was when I would forget where I parked my car.  I would have to search all over the neighborhood to find it, hoping it wasn't in a ditch somewhere.  You know what too?  I have to where glasses, and I would misplace them all the time when drunk before I went to sleep.  I have horrible vision, so it is literally a fucking scavenger hunt the next morning trying to find them.  I bought thick black frames just to help me recognize them on the carpet (luckily they became fashionable a couple year later).

My first DUI was in 2004.  I don't remember being pulled over at all.  I do remember having to sit in the jail booking without a belt and my pants falling off trying to make phone calls (belts are weapons in jail).  Somehow I managed to get bonded out.  I found out that I had refused the breathalyzer, so they decided to take a blood sample.  It wasn't until a couple of weeks later I found that my BAC was 0.29.  Because of this I was charged with the equivalent of two DUI's.  In my mind, this was my first DUI, no big deal.  Everyone I knew and associated with had at least one DUI.  I got the lawyer, went to the classes before my sentencing, made a decent impression and got unsupervised probations for 2 years.  It was literally a slap on the wrist because immediately after my joke of a sentence I was at the bar, celebrating my lenient sentence!  

The alcohol treatment classes I was required to attend had absolutely no affect on me.  Why?  Because I didn't want to quit drinking.  Simple as that.  Fast forward another 4 years and I get my second DUI.  I remember this one a little more clearly.  Same thing, refused the breathlyzer, so they took a blood sample.  This time my BAC was 0.28.  I figured, ""Hey, this is just my second DUI, no big deal.  I know tons of people with two DUI's.""  It was only when my lawyer had contacted me and informed my that I was being charged with felony DUI, and that I should prepare to go to prison for 2 years did it really sink in.  Two DUI's, and I was going to go to prison?  How could this be?  I never hurt anybody, and I knew a tons of people that had multiple DUI's.  My lawyer explained it like this, ""Your first DUI you had such a high BAC that you were charged with an excessive DUI.  Your second DUI was again, very high, so it is again counted as an excessive DUI.  Two excessive DUI's in this state, and you are charged with a Felony.""  He explained to me that the sentencing on this one wasn't going to be nearly as lenient, because according to my BAC I hadn't even attempted to slow down with my drinking in the span of 4 years, and that told the judge a lot.

I couldn't deal with the prison thing.  Regardless, I had to prepare myself for the worst.  I talked to my Dad (me and him never really got along, but it had been so long I had forgot *why* we never got along), and he explained that I must quit drinking.  If I didn't not quit drinking there would be no help from the family.  As far as he was concerned, I would be dead to them.  It wasn't until a few years later that he explained to me, ""We always loved you, we just didn't fucking like you"", which made a lot of sense later on.

My first AA meeting was the day after my second DUI, after I had found out what kind of consequences I was facing.  I knew that the only thing worse than being in prison, was being an alcoholic in prison.  The depression I was in at that time, I couldn't even imagine being locked up with a bunch of guys for 2 years.  I knew I had to attempt to kick this drinking thing.  Everything around me was crumbling down to the ground.  All of my friends were alcoholics, my parents wanted nothing to do with me, I had no education other than a year of college, and no decent job to speak of.  

My first AA meeting in a nutshell.  Get out of the car, stand in front of the door and smoke like 4 cigarettes in a row, walk in and everyone stares at me (small town meeting), immediately look at the ground and try not to make eye contact with anyone for the next hour.  This was my plan at least, and I followed through with what I could, but those damn people wouldn't leave me alone!  They gave me some coin, kept telling me I didn't have to feel the way I felt anymore, and kept saying that just my presence was helping them stay sober.  I thought these people were crazy, but I was willing to take crazy to quit drinking.  The one thing I do remember from that meeting was someone saying, ""To hit rock bottom, all you have to do is stop digging.""  That hit the spot, these people were making sense, I can relate to that.  I got out of that first meeting feeling a bit better, like there was a bit of hope, all I had to do was make it to the next day so I could go to another meeting.  Oh, they gave me some book they called the ""Big Book"" and told me to read it.  You know how long it had been since I read a damn book??  You expect me to read this whole thing?  ""Harry Potter is bigger than that book, I'm sure you can manage.  Get started.""  Well, that made me feel like an idiot.  So I went home that night and started reading the back of it -- the stories.  Thats what got me hooked.  These stories were *me*.  I wasn't unique after all!  

So I kept going back.  I went 5 days a week in fact, for a long time.  I went so much that when my sentencing came, I thought it was going to be such a waste to send someone like me to prison, when I could help so many people here in the meetings!  Wow, self-centeredness was coming back in a big way.  Luckily, the sentencing went really well.  I was charged with a felony, but given everything I had done between the charge and the sentencing I was only sentenced to 90 days in county jail, with a 7 year probationary tail of course (hah).  The judge made it abundantly clear that this was my last chance.  If she ever saw me again, I would be going straight to prison no questions asked.  I took that seriously this time, but I wouldn't have been able to do it without those people in those meetings.

So, go to jail, don't get $200 dollars, come out and be ready to take on the world.  Nope, nope it didn't work that way.  Jail actually cost me a lot of money.  But it was benificial.  You see, I was an isolated drinker.  The majority of the time I would just sit in my house with a few bottles, watch TV, and feel sorry for myself.  This consumed quite a few years of my life.  So going to jail was actually pretty damn exciting.  It was almost like a summer camp for me.  It really opened me up, I was making friends, and reading again.  I don't know how many books I read in jail, but I really started liking Russian literature (War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, Dr Zhivago.. all FTW).  Anyways, it was nice, and it was a good time to reflect and try to figure out what I was really supposed to be doing with my life, because clearly all of the decisions I had made up to that point only got me to one place, jail.  So things needed to change.  I needed some goals.

They told me, ""no relationships for the first year.""  In my mind, I had already gone 7 years without a *real* relationship, so one year?  No problem...  I met my wife 13.5 months after I sobered up (hahah).  We went on one date and I knew I had to marry this woman.  She didn't even drink!  Me, with someone that doesn't even drink!  Have the stars aligned?  How is this possible?  She's my safety net.  I know if I have 1 drop of alcohol, the only thing I will see is the door slam because she'd be gone so fast you wouldn't even notice.  I love her even more for that.

Throughout the past four years I have made a lot of great friends in the program.  I made a lot of great friends outside of the program too, except these are *real* friends.  Unsurprisingly, when my *old* friends had found out I had quit drinking and started going to meetings, the phone calls stopped.  If you're a drinker, you hang out with drinkers, that just how it is.  Nothing is more of a bummer than being a drunk and trying to hangout with someone who doesn't drink.  So that worked out in my favor.  I got married 1.5 years into my relationship with my wife.  Best day of my life.  She was trapped now.  :)  

So now I had a family.  Still in a shitty job.  What do do?  School.  This time I had the tools to do it right.  I never miss a class (unless its to work on another class.. strange how that works out sometimes), and have been going to summer classes in addition to fulltime semesters for the past 3.5 years.  I graduate with my BS in Mathematics this coming Spring.  If you would have told me 5 years ago that this would be my life, I would have told you you're insane.  The guy that barely passed algebra2 in highschool is going to get a BS in Math?  

Look at it through my point of view.  I haven't had a drink for four years.  Thats the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.  Every other goal I set for myself is just frosting on the cake.  Nothing I ever do in my life will even be a modicum as difficult as not drinking.  Sure, these days I don't get cravings or urges (those stopped about a year in, and the dreams stopped about 2 years in), but I still remember it.  I still watch movies and tv shows of people having good times while drinking.  I just came to the realization that I abused that privilege -- forever.  I've drank enough in my life to kill whole populations of towns in North Dakota and adjacent states.  I've had enough.  Nothing -- let me repeat that -- nothing will ever be as difficult for me than not having that first drink.  But I don't have that first drink, and so the cycle has stopped.  

Getting back into school was another journey in and of itself.  My state university wasn't so hip about giving me financial aid again after my first attempt (7 years previously, yea, they don't forget).  I worked my ass off, wrote tons of letters, begged, stole, and borrowed (ok not stole) and as I write this its 1am my time and I just finished up a take-home number theory / abstract algebra exam.  It takes a lot of work, but I put the time in because everything I do that makes me a better person, puts distance between me and the person I was only 4 short years ago.   

So this already looks like a big ramble from some dude, so I will end it here.  I could go on for many, many more pages of text, but I won't submit you guys to that.

Here is my message to the new people.  Don't drink.  Do everything you can possibly do in your power (and others power) not to drink.  Go to meetings, take the advice (even if it is crazy talk, crazy is better than dead or in jail), and make some damn friends!  My closest friend is a guy I met in AA, and even though he doesn't live near me anymore, he will always be the best friend I have.  Don't look at every superbowl you're going to miss out on by not drinking, don't look at all the holidays you will, ""not have a good time at"", because you'll be surrounded by drink, as a sad and bad thing.  In time you'll see that as just silly talk.  I have a son who has never seen me drunk in his life.  I have a wife that has never seen me drunk in her life.  These are the best gifts I have recieved from sobering up.

I went to a few Clubs with him and was the designated driver. The urge to drink was there but I powered through it and still had a great time. 

On the trip back my dad decides we are doing a night in Vegas! Every time I have been to Vegas in my adult life it has been a trigger to push my self-destructive tendencies to the max. With the last time I was here being a 3 day bender of non-stop drinking and drugs. 

Once we checked in at the Luxor I immediately felt a crazy strong urge to drink, smoke and gamble. Luckily I was able to use breathing meditation to help calm myself and remind myself of the reasons I why I was choosing not to drink. Seeing excessively drunk people on the strip actually helped quell the urges as well. 

I had a great time in Vegas, SOBER! I even gambled for a few hours and went to bed around 1. It was great waking up in the morning in Vegas and feeling refreshed and ready for the day, instead of hungover, still drunk, or just plain feeling like ass.

Long story short, the quality of my marriage has skyrocketed since getting sober. To celebrate my first 30 days of sobriety, my wife gave me a symbolic ""bottle of bubbly"" as a present! It means a whole helluva lot to me. I am finally able to look her in the eyes, there is total transparency in our marriage, whereas before I would constantly have the alcoholic side of my brain in the back of my mind, calculating, cold, isolating. 

In either case, here are some of the ways my quality of life have improved since getting 30 days sober:

- Exercise 3 days a week
- Lost weight
- Can think more clearly
- NO HANGOVERS!
- No worrying about making an ass of myself
- Been writing more, about 2,000 words/day
- Spend more time reading
- Have more energy
- Can stay awake later
- Can play through a videogame now without passing out drunk 
- Working harder
- Met amazing support network of friends through AA
- Discovered the joys of homemade iced tea
- Have saved money
- Less procrastinating
- More confident
- Closer to my wife
- Marriage improved dramatically
- Feel more emotionally
- Have renewed hope for future

My mind immediately went to booze.  ""There are two liquor stores on the way home"" I thought.  ""Who gives a shit - I'm only at a week.  I'll just get shitty and reset my badge tomorrow.""

Two things helped me decide not to drink last night:

1.  I made it a point to get up early and go to the gym.  I scheduled it, and I made a commitment to go and meet a friend there, so I couldn't bail if I was hung over.

2.  I just kept thinking about H.A.L.T.: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.  All common reasons that we turn to alcohol.  Last night was one of the first nights that I could clearly identify one of those things and actually made the wiser choice to go straight home.

On the ride home, I just kept repeating that to myself: ""Halt... hungry, *angry,* lonely, tired.""  And holy shit it actually worked.  Actually identifying the emotion and relating it to the causal relationship with alcohol somehow made it an easier decision to stay away.

I used to deliberately get drunk at social situations, as a crutch for my shyness. And it actually ""worked"": I danced. Girls liked me. I told interesting stories and made friends. 

The worst that ever happened would be telling someone a boring or embarrassing story, or maybe taking a french fry off someone's plate. Nothing major though, besides _becoming an alcoholic_. 

I often see posts how sobriety _prevents_ people from being dumb socially. It does, but for people on the fence about quitting, the prospect of being boring can be scary. But it shouldn't be.

**You've still got it all within you**. 

With a sober mind, you can learn from your drunk self. I'm not saying to act like an idiot, but with practice you can learn to flex your ""filter"". For me this means:

 - Being just a bit bolder in my conversations. A guy about my age standing to the side? Why not walk up to him and ask what he thinks of the original Super Mario Brothers. 

 - Dancing. This one was tough. I am _not_ a dancer, but have managed to get out there while _really_ drunk. I tried it sober this weekend. I tried to remember the ""not caring"" of being drunk, and it seemed to work.

 - Being bolder with women. Just go up and talk to them. Say hello. Make a dumb joke. Again, I tried to remember what it felt like to be drunk, and not caring.

I found that all those ""beneficial"" parts of being drunk were just parts of my own personality that I didn't know how to exercise. And it's so much better and awesome to know that I've really got it while sober. 

I even had that feeling the day after ""Oh God. What did I do last night? Did so-and-so get angry at me?"". But then I remembered that I was sober, and in control the entire damn time. There was no fear of having messed up. This was much better.

Also, being so social and extroverted, no one asked me about being sober. Maybe they saw a happy, free-spirited, confident guy and assumed I _must_ have been on something.

So I walk in and it just reeks of stale beer and piss (I've quit smoking too and whole my neighbourhood just seems to smell like ass now.)

I just stood there stunned and saw how incredibly sad they actually were. Grotesque little things coveting their precious pints of false self-esteem. 

So I payed my friend, who actually told me that what I'm doing is awesome, and just walked away from the idiots that I used to spend countless hours with getting pissed and just talking about nothing.

The fact of the matter is that the odds are stacked against us, and many who need sobriety never find it.

There is no real advantage to having Jan 1st as a sober date. If you are thinking about getting sober, why not start today?  Starting today has the added benefit of being able to remember New Year's Eve and not make an ass out of yourself. If you sober up today, you never have to have another hangover.

If you are lurking and thinking about quitting drinking, think about doing it now. Getting sober tomorrow didn't work for me. I needed to find a way to do it today. It wasn't until I found a way to do that and stay focused on today that I was finally able to stay sober.

1) I used to think that de-alcoholized beer tasted like the secretions of a yak's balls and was brewed in a subway toilet. I just tried one today. Now I KNOW it's true.  

2) I thought I was the cheerful, happy-go-lucky drunk that everyone loved. I was actually the sullen, morose, irritable drunk that I always hated in others. I'm easier to get along with when I'm sober.  

3) When I was drinking, that was what I was doing. I wasn't drinking while I was watching a movie, I was watching a movie while I drank. Now I do stuff that can be done without a glass in my hand.  

4) People tell me that I look better, and ask what I'm doing differently. When I tell them I quit drinking, their faces light up, and everyone gives me their support and encouragement.  

5) I used to think that I wasn't a morning person, and it would take a good few hours for me to come to 100%. I was fooling myself. I was hung over every single day, and it was taking that long to burn off the effects of the booze. Now I'm good to go after my morning shower, about 10 minutes into my day.  

6) The mysterious person who coated my mouth with vile substances in my sleep has gone away.  

7) I'm starting to develop a certain clarity of mind, and my thoughts don't wander like they did when I was drunk.  

8) When I was drunk, I thought that my job sucked, my relationship sucked, my apartment sucked, and I felt like I was stuck in a rut. Sober, I realize that I have a TON of great stuff going on in my life, and that the thing that really sucked was the way alcohol warped my perceptions of it.  

9) There is no Number 9

10) I could never have done it without this subreddit. I researched a lot before I kicked over the bottle, but all of it was static. /stopdrinking is PARTICIPATORY, and it makes me feel that I'm part of a team, a group, that all has the same goal.

A few months ago it seems like an impossible goal- 30 days seemed impossible- but I'm here and I'm sober and it feels amazing. 

I remember when I was first lurking in the sub I use to click through posts of people who had some time to see what has changed for them as a result of getting sober, ya know, to see if it was really all it was cracked up to be. Holy hell, it is. 

First of all, I look a million times better. My skin is clear, my eyes are bright and sparkling, my face isn't puffy and bloated. Although I didn't lose the drastic amount of weight some people describe, I sort of replaced booze with food for awhile (which honestly I think is the best way to handle it at first - have whatever your heart desires as long as isn't booze) but since the new year I've just made some small, healthy, changes to my diet and I've easily dropped 6 lbs and counting :) 

Emotionally, I'm a different person. I'm not a sad, shaking, anxiety ridden mess anymore. I can go out to dinner with friends, I can pick someone up for a meeting I dont know that well, I can smoke a cigarette in front of someone without worrying about my hands shaking, I can hold a coffee cup, I can eat soup. I can go to class and participate, I can hand the person next to me the attendance sheet. 90 days ago, I couldnt do any of those things without a drink. 

That all being said, it certainly hasnt been a cake walk either. Early sobriety is an emotional rollar coster. You have to actually feel the feelings you've been drowning for so long, and it sucks, but its worth it. My sponsors says, ""The only way to get through it, is to go through it.""

They were all drinking beer and someone offered me cold one, at first I almost reached out and went for it because I wasn't even thinking about the beer and didn't have the urge at all (it was just an honest reaction). But before I could, he says ""Oh that's right you don't drink anymore."" I said nope, and got a glass of water. 
 About an hour or so later I went to get a bowl of chili and another glass of water. A friend came up to me and said ""Man, I really admire anybody who drank like you did, who can sit here while we are all drinkin beer, and get a glass of water, and on top of that quit smoking cigarrettes for over a year."" I said ""I just try my best not to even give it a second thought."" 
 That made me feel very proud that other people recognize what a triumph it is to quit drugs, alcohol, and nicotine alike. Even one of those three is a huge step!

When you spend your entire life holding yourself to a standard of perfection, alcohol feels like the only way to turn that drive off for a moment. Alcohol can feel like the only way to be the funny, outgoing, social person you want to be. I've met some drinkers who don't seem to have any goals in life EXCEPT to outdrink everyone around them, but they do it consistently, and with pride. 

When you get sober, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the suddenly apparent responsibilities in life, not to mention the lack of your old coping mechanism. Nobody feels like they're perfect when they're getting sober. After 5 1/2 months, I've been getting really down on myself about not making enough money to keep my boyfriend happy, not having the energy after work to finish my new ceramic pieces, or not having a spotlessly clean house. It occurred to me that holding down a decent job for 3 1/2 years, (successfully) running a little pottery on the side, and not having one single drink for FIVE MONTHS wasn't that bad, though. 

If you're feeling overwhelmed by all of the things you COULD be, please take a moment and feel awesome for the fact that you're not going to drink today. No, one sober day isn't a college education, but they can feel like goals of equal magnitude.

Do you remember when we were kids and summer lasted forever?  Boredom was a ubiquitous as sunshine and heat.  Our Moms or Dads or Grannies would say, ""If you're bored, read a book!  Go outside!  Clean your room!"" and we'd sigh.  Boredom was a physical weight, but it served as an impetuous for creativity and imagination.

A lot of folks on here talk about how they drink because they are bored, or that being sober is difficult because it is boring. Most of us don't built forts with blankets and chairs anymore, or try to dig a hole in the backyard to the other side of the world.  But I think the idea still applies.  Let's face it; drinking is boring.  Too many of us drink or watch tv or play on the internet not to assuage boredom but to numb it.

For me, boredom and impatience are intertwined.  It is when I let go, calm down, and allow the world to keep moving without my forced interaction that boredom starts to morph into peace.

These days my highs come from running, taking deep breaths, and listening to my children.  Happiness is less a thought process than a physical feeling.  It comes over me during the most mundane times: folding laundry, driving to work.

So...read a book.  Go outside.  Clean your room.  This world is *interesting*, even when it's not exciting.  At least, I am discovering that is true for me.

1. You may have to buy new clothes. After cutting 1000+ calories out of your daily diet, you'll probably start losing weight. You might even go broke buying new clothes.

2. Were you hiding your drinking problem? Now you have to hide your money. You were probably spending most of your money on alcohol. Now you're going to have to hide the piles of cash that you're saving. Good excuses? You just became a drug dealer, or a prostitute, or both.

3. No more sick days. Your co-workers will hate you because you're that guy - the one who never calls in sick and makes them look bad.

I did go to a doctor first to ask if it would be safe and she said she would not recommend it in my case, especially because I live alone. Against her advice I tried anyway. I was determined. I managed to stop drinking for 2 days and during the evening I was playing a game on the computer when all of a sudden my right eye displayed a moving image that wouldn't go away, not when I looked in another direction and not when I closed my eyes. I completely freaked out. About 30-40 seconds later I lost consciousness. When I woke up again, about 1-2 hours later (I think). I had no idea what happened for at least 30 minutes and I felt extremely weird.

The next day I made an appointment for a brain MRI to see if I had epileptic characteristics. I never had any epileptic attacks ever and never had a seizure either. On the brain scan was no evidence to be found about epilepsy but they told me that many people have a one-time epileptic attack and this would probably be what happened. The same day I started thinking and reading about seizures happening from alcohol withdrawal and came to the realization that this is what must have happened. Especially because I never had seizures ever in my life (I'm 32).

I made an appointment with a neurologist to look into it deeper. I went cold turkey because the chances of seizure were low and because I never considered myself physically dependent on alcohol. Now I know that it's more serious than I thought and I'm going to do exactly what the neurologists advises. I feel terrible that I let it come this far and the irony is that I must keep drinking until I get professional advice. 

Bottom line: If you are a regular medium to heavy drinker, DO NOT TRY TO STOP ON YOUR OWN, especially if you live alone! In rare cases  a seizure can even lead to death.

This is especially for all you younger lurkers out there who aren't sure if you have a problem or not, but for some reason you keep finding yourself drawn back to this subreddit.


Let's say you're in your teens or early twenties.  You like to drink.  A lot.  It's fun, and it hasn't caused you any serious problems… yet.  Maybe you've had a couple of fights, maybe you've slept with the wrong person once or twice, maybe you've embarrassed yourself in public, but all in all your life is pretty much on track and you haven't suffered any major consequences.  Sometimes, after a big night, you think you might be overdoing it, and you suspect your life would be better if you stopped.  But you're still young, you have tons of energy, and you have your whole life ahead of you.  There is plenty of time to deal with this later.


So why stop now?


1.  **Because you're waiting for something really bad to happen to force you to quit.**  Think about this for a minute.  What is your price for quitting?  A failed relationship?  A DUI?  A spell in jail?  Losing a job?  Killing someone?  What would it take to convince you that you need to quit?  If you are waiting for something this bad to happen before quitting, you are engaging in self-sabotaging behavior.  You're gambling with your life.  And self-sabotaging behavior is one of the key components of being an alcoholic.  Learn to identify when you are behaving this way.  Be honest with yourself.  If you can't hear yourself being honest, then you won't be able to hear anyone else being honest with you either.


2.  **Because if you think you have a problem with alcohol, you probably do.**  I always hated this one.  My way of getting out of it was, *""If thinking I have an alcohol problem means I do, then thinking I don't have an alcohol problem means I don't.""*  The answer here is:  normal drinkers don't have to play head games with themselves to justify drinking.  If you catch yourself doing this, you very well might be an alcoholic.  


3.  **Because alcoholism ALWAYS gets worse.  It NEVER gets better.**  If your drinking is heavy now, and sometimes out of control, maybe you are trying to convince yourself that you're going to grow out of it someday.  Protip:  You're not.  It's that simple.


4.  **I'm not living in a cardboard box in an alley, so I'm not an alcoholic.**  The associations with this word are so negative that we are always going to find a way to prove we aren't an alcoholic.  *This is why the first step in quitting drinking is admitting we're alcoholics.*  Put another way:  When we admit we are alcoholics, we are choosing to reject society's definition of an alcoholic, and to instead adopt our own definition.  This is empowering.  It makes you stronger.  It means you are taking control of your life.  You wouldn't let society define what kind of music you listen to, what kind of clothes you wear, what kind of relationships to have, or what kind of job to take.  So why let it define how much you drink?


5.  **I hate the hysteria around alcoholism.  I like to drink.  I like to have fun.  What's wrong with that?**  I used to feel this way too.  Just because I liked to get drunk sometimes didn't mean I needed to use the nuclear option, did it?  The whole thought of quitting felt like some Puritanical over-reaction to harmless boyhood hijinks.  So, this is what happened to me.  One minute I was a carefree college student with a lot of great drinking buddies.  Then I blinked, and I was forty years old, with more than 20 years of hard boozing under my belt, a lot of failed relationships, a lot of missed career opportunities, fifty extra pounds, and a very guilty conscience.  You don't have to be hysterically anti-alcohol to quit drinking.  You just need to decide to take control of your life.


6.  **OK, fine, I've tried to quit and made it for a while, so I don't think I'm an alcoholic.  But I always get the urge to drink again.  It's okay now, right?**  Ask yourself this.  Can you have one drink and then stop?  Be honest with yourself.  There is a big difference between having one beer because you feel like it, and feeling an overwhelming urge to chuck everything to the wind and get loaded.  If the latter is the case… it's time to get honest with yourself.  Alcohol is an issue for you.  And that issue will only grow with time.

Sober day 04-01-2013",JustForThisSub,80,9,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/160zzy/we_lost_another_baby_so_i_decided_my_wife_should/,"As the post says, my wife and I were about 4.5 months into our third pregnancy and on Friday, we found out that the baby had died. It's the second time in a row this happened. We're both devastated of course, but I can't let this pass without scraping some kind of positive out of it.  

I've drunk heavily since about 1998, but 2007 was probably the first time I recognised that I might have a problem. Since then, I've been pretty 'high functioning' and things (aside the drinking of course) have generally been a success . In the last two years though, and ever more recently, I've become very conscious that I'm not in control of my drinking and that this is a downward spiral. Every day I wake up hating night me for making morning me feel so bad, and I resolve to give it a rest tonight. But by 3 or 4 pm, the alcoholic voice has won, and I'm figuring out the best way of getting more alcohol for tonight. I began hiding it from my wife, disposing of empty bottles in secret and pretending I'm still only on the first or second bottle of wine. Recently I've been more and more conscious of just how much worse it had got, how much more I needed to stop, and how hard it was. I can't remember the last day I had a rest from drink, I'm thinking September, but actually, it might have been May. 

Despite hiding it well (I think?) my wife and son deserve better. He deserves a dad who can run around with him all day and doesnt have a reputation for liking his drink. She doesnt deserve the me who's ~40lb fatter than when we met. She doesn't deserved my laziness in the mornings after a particularly heavy night. They both deserve the £3k + per year I spend on drink. And She deserves a husband who isn't permanently under the influence. On Friday something was taken away from her that completely broke her heart again, so the least I can do is give her back the better version of her husband. 

Friday was my first day without alcohol, and I have no intention of going back. I know I can't ease off, or cut back, it has to be all or nothing. Whilst all the inspiration of our loss is fresh, and helping, I know the journey ahead is going to be tough. I'm reading Allen Carr for some additional assistance, and I'll sticks round here for more inspiration. Those posts about that schizophrenic feeling of the alcoholic voice and your true self have really rung true with me, and they make me feel like I'm in the right place.

It was November 26th 2011 and I finally gave up. I gave up feeling sorry for myself for circumstances that happened years ago and were beyond my control. I stopped blaming myself for getting caught in an alcoholic web that I couldn't imagine freeing myself from. I didn't want to. Even though I suffered greatly during the day with hangovers, high blood pressure, excessive weight and heartburn, it was the night that I craved. I craved that 8pm feeling of warmth and out of body feeling that gave me moments of escape from the reality that I created. 

I drank that evening in November. I drank and drank like every other night until I didn't hurt anymore. The next morning I didn't partake in a bit of Breakfast vodka. I skipped the bar for lunch and I let the evening pass me by naturally. I didn't go to detox, a meeting or take medication to get through it. I just stopped drinking those 2 pints of vodka and started dealing with my life and everything that came with it. 

I think everyone has to take their own path to sobriety. We all got to that point from a different path and I think we all need to take a different path out of it. It's hard to do. It's painful to relearn to deal with raw emotions and feelings again. It feels unnatural to pass by the liquor store and to be sober all the time but it's so so truly worth it. I want to share with everyone the day I stopped drinking and what I look like today. Happier, 50 pounds lighter and just a bit better everyday.

That's all folks! I am always here if you need me. Ready, sober and feeling free. No longer a slave

I had lost everything that I worked so hard for. I had a bottle of tequila in my hand and a slight bit of curiosity. I'd quit smoking before, I knew I could do it so maybe I could quit drinking. 

Getting sober isn't easy, we all know that. We all have questions regarding sobriety that only more experienced people can answer. We have fears about our future that NO ONE can answer. We cry. A lot. We get mad. We feel alone and hopeless. We lose sleep. No one understands us. We may isolate ourselves. We get tempted. We start feeling emotions that we've never felt and have absolutely no idea how to deal with them. We might gain weight. And we might wonder if all of this is even worth it. 

I'm still in early sobriety and still going through these changes but I want to say something to those who are in the midst of anything I wrote up there. You are NOT alone. We have all felt the isolation and the fear, sadness and especially the temptation. It hurts. You may want to give in and grab a drink because hey, it's easy and at least you don't have to deal with any of that stuff up there. Nothing in life that is worth having comes easy.

If you want true, honest happiness then you have to keep on pushing, even on the darkest days (I think we have all had our share of shitastic days during sobriety) you have to WANT it so bad and have enough faith to get you past those 24 hours. You will be greatly rewarded for sticking it out. 

The fear will subside, the tears will stop, the anger will fade away, we will sleep better, the temptations DEFINITELY will calm down and you know what? you will be as strong as you've ever been because you made it through all of that *without alcohol* 

And it will only get better. I cannot say where you go from here because I'm still on this journey myself but I'm glad I stuck with it. Every day is a new experience that I actually WANT to wake up for. 

I just wanted to send this message out to all of you who are having doubts or wondering if what you're feeling is worth it. Please, please feel free to PM me if any of you need to talk or click on the link to the IRC chat room on the side bar. You don't have to do it alone.

I was thinking how glad I am that I don't get hungover anymore. So many times I'd have had a stressful week at work, drinking each night, then Friday would come and I'd get wasted. I'd then wake up hungover the next day, and crying, with major anxiety and depression. 

I couldn't believe that I'd chosen to give myself more pain and stress, when what I needed was rest. Somehow I saw alcohol as the 'fun' and 'relaxation' that would be a foil to the stresses of the week.

Now, I get to bed at a reasonable hour on Fridays and Saturdays, have a really good sleep, and a wonderful relaxing sleep-in! 

Work is somehow (mysteriously) less stressful. I am alert at work, I can concentrate, I am articulate when speaking about work topics. 

The lighting in the elevator at work is kind of harsh and whenever I used to be hungover I would shudder at the major bags under my eyes. Looking a lot better now, I'm sure my eyes are whiter and clearer too!

It was sad but a relief as well.  My father and my mother are not sober and have never been sober and drank everyday of my life.  My brother and I both are sober.  Friday before he passed she sent me a text that said ""In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorials be made to the Wolfe Street Foundation, P.O. Box 3708, Little Rock, AR  72203""  "" I think Dad would like this.""

Now this foundation is one that assists individuals and families trying to get sober.  I thought this was one of the coolest things she could have done.  My parents alcoholism with regards to us kids was, since we got sober, a bit of the elephant in the middle of the room.  It wasn't really talked about.  My Dad has been sick for a few years and never stopped drinking throughout it.  It didn't kill him but he was essentially playing with fire. 

My brother and I have been able to be there for my Mom for the past month and a half and I believe she knows that is because of AA and that her babies are sober.  So much so that she, a non-sober person, decided that donations should be made so that people have the opportunity to get sober, in memory of a man that wasn't sober either.

I feel like it is a badge of honor to be sober and have my Momma think of it so highly.  It made the morning pretty neat until I got word that he passed.  Her babies got sober in Oklahoma but her husband died in Little Rock. 

Blows my mind that I could have missed all of this great life I have today.  My brother and I made in through SOBER and were there for our mother and family.  Like people are supposed to do.

What I mean is, 1000 days is no more impressive than 1 day.  1000 days is just 1 day repeated a thousand times.  And that's how I arrived at the place I find myself today.  I did not decide to stop drinking forever.  I did not announce to everyone in my life that I was never touching booze again.  I did not start saying things like ""I can't drink, or I will die.""  I just decided not to drink today, and it just so happens that I've done that a thousand times in a row.

I did this by cobbling together a program of sobriety that works for me.  For the first year, I just stayed sober—that's it.  No support whatsoever.  I don't recommend that.  For the second year, I stumbled across /r/stopdrinking and quickly began to make it my home.  On my second soberversary, I decided to up my game and start attending AA meetings once a week, largely because I was afraid of going.  It's turned out to be an incredibly important part of my life.

And I spend lots of time in our IRC chat room, of course, where I am blessed with the presence of some good people who are dedicated to being there for each other, even if only in a virtual sense, whenever one of us starts getting the fantods.

Here are some numbers:

* I celebrated today by running three miles in a personal best time that is over fifteen minutes faster than my time from two months ago.  

* I've lost almost 40 pounds since I stopped drinking.  

* I quit smoking 39 days ago.  

* I'm 42 years old.  

* I have 1 wife and 2 kids who love me.

* According to recent reading I've done, I've probably added 12-15 years to my life by quitting drinking and smoking.

I'm not even sure about the exact date that I stopped drinking. Back when I had just stopped, I used to count the days and it took me a few weeks before any day was just _a day_ and not _a sober day_. I had been drinking heavily for about 5 years, up to a bottle of vodka a day in the end. I tried to stop countless times but could never stick with it for more than a couple of days.


Thinking about what I've done differently the last time, it wasn't that much but I think it made all the difference:


* I told most of my friends and family I was going to quit drinking. I didn't admit to being an alcoholic to everyone, but I made a point of telling them I intended to stop. This helped a lot because it ruled out a lot of situations in which I could have picked up.

* All of a sudden I had developed polyneuropathy (numbness and tingling sensation in my hands and feet). It scared the crap out of me and even though I continued to drink for a while, it eventually made me realize what I was doing to my body. So this time I stopped with a passionate hatred for alcohol, not just because of rational thoughts telling me I should stop.

* I had intense cravings in the evenings for the first few weeks. Drinking had always been my reward for a hard day, or any day for that matter and around 5 or 6 pm I always started to get nervous. I read somewhere that glutamine was supposed to help with the cravings and boy did it. I'm not sure if it was placebo effect or not, but I recommend it to anyone quitting. It's easily available and doesn't have any side-effects and in my case 1 or 2 teaspoons in a glass of water eased the cravings pretty quickly.


So with these 5 months of sobriety behind me and many more such months before me, let me summarize what I've learned.


The Good:


* I'm becoming myself again. I'm slowly learning to enjoy my life without the need for alcohol.

* Just the thought that I finally managed to quit makes me happy every single day.

* My polyneuropathy has all but disappeared.

* Though my personal life is far from perfect right now, I don't have any trouble not drinking. I have no intention of ever picking up again and after the first few weeks (which were really hard) it got ridiculously easy.

* I can drink beer all day long without a guilty conscience. I'm talking about alcohol-free beer of course. (It doesn't make me relapse, but apparently it has that effect on some, so be careful.)

* I'm a regular at the gym now and I don't think I've ever felt fitter in my life. I get compliments too. Feels good man.


The Bad:


* I can't drink anymore in social situations. I'm a very outgoing guy, I used to party a lot and my life has changed dramatically after I quit. I'm still getting used to it. (I do enjoy the occasional bong hit, but knowing I have a history of substance abuse, I try to be careful.)

* Long-term alcoholism has a certain effect on your brain's reward center, which means for a while after quitting I hardly felt pleasure in anything. It's kind of weird realizing that whatever I loved to do I only loved because I was drinking at the time. It's been getting better though and I hope it'll eventually subside.

* In my experience, people will not give you a pat on the shoulder for being able to quit. I was never in an AA meeting or the like, so YMMV. In my case, friends and family accepted it, a few complained, others laughed, some encouraged me, but since I don't know any other alcoholics I never felt like someone had an actual idea about what I was going through and how much it meant to me.


The Ugly:


* Withdrawal symptoms. Fuck them. The first few sober days were the worst I've ever felt in my life. I wouldn't do it on my own again given the choice - _please be safe and see a doctor if you want to stop_. I saw a neurologist a few weeks later and she had a hard time believing I even managed to stop on my own given the amount I was used to drinking.

* I've been suffering from anxiety disorder for years and it turns out I was actually self-medicating with alcohol. My anxiety has returned with a vengeance after I stopped drinking. I'm on proper meds now again and slowly getting better.

* My polyneuropathy has all but disappeared - I listed this as Good because it certainly is, but from what I understand the little that is left will remain, which sucks. I try to see it as a reminder to the harm I've done to myself.

* Drinking heavily for so long has definitely had a negative effect on my brain. I tend to misspell words when typing (something I never used to do), I'm not as eloquent as I used to be (I really was, no kidding) and I can't for the life of me remember what I had for dinner yesterday. I think it's getting a bit better now compared to a few months ago but I doubt it will go back to how it was before.


Anyway, that's my experience. Thanks for taking the time to read it. If you find typos or anything, that's what drinking has done to me, also I'm not a native English speaker. ;)

Many years ago, I was working at a (now deceased) Cafe in Berkeley. A customer who I'd never seen before came in and ordered coffee and asked, politely, what my plans were for Independence day. I told him that Independence day is also my birthday, and that year I would ""be turning 21 and ushered into the wonderful world of alcohol."" Those were my words and that was how I felt. I never picked up a fake ID and remember clearly relishing the idea of being able to finally drink, and get drunk, legally.

As the man doctored his coffee he paused me mid-sentence and looked me dead in the eye and said. ""There are *other* things in life."" I said, half-heartedly, ""Sure.""
Insistent, he repeated ""There are *many other* things in life to live for, and if you live for alcohol, you *will* die."" He bid be a good day and left.
I remember feeling that I had been given a solid piece of advice, but owning to how all 21 year olds are, I didn't heed it. I was invincible of course. What did he know?
Well, his words resonated with me over the decade and a half that saw me slide deeper and deeper into alcoholism. Now that I've dried out and am doing so for the long term. I'm already reaping the immediate health/mental benefits. As I wake up each day more excited than the previous, I look out my window and see endless opportunities where before I saw darkness and dread. Each day I'm reminded of how correct that stranger was.

I was miserable.  I did not do it for my wife, my kids, or anything else.  I was miserable and living a tortured existence.  And I am happy now.  Well most of the time.  I still have to deal with life.  There still are rotten people in the world, there still is work, I still have considerable debt and a lack of money.  But I am learning how to process these things.  I am learning how to deal with all these things in a healthy manner.  And I am happier than I have ever been.  I still have problems.  But drinking and the misery I felt are not one.

I believe that happiness is the whole point of recovering.  There were times in my recovery when I was miserable.  I was doing it all wrong.  I was afraid to ask for help.  I didn't want to reach out to other alcoholics.  I wanted to be lazy and do things my way.  My way and my hair brained ideas tend to not work.  My brain is what got me into this situation in the first place.

I have discovered that when I am miserable in sobriety I AM DOING IT WRONG. 

For me, a once hopeless and miserable drunk, happiness is attainable.  I have it most days.  It's a wonderful gift.  It's a side effect that, to be honest, I did not believe sobriety would give me.

My advice to newcomers is to reach out and ask for help.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  Find yourselves some sort of program and a sober network.  Use it.  Throw yourself at it with the reckless abandon that we used to use when throwing ourselves at alcohol.  The results can be astonishing.  Honesty, open mindedness, and willingness have brought me a long way in a short time.

I was a drunk; a homeless, jobless and hopeless drunk, just months ago. I was so bloated and yellow. I looked and felt awful. I couldn’t start the day without vodka. I shook violently without alcohol… More and more every day. I wandered the streets during the day (and a lot of nights) because I had nowhere to be and nothing to do. Once the fun bartender to go party with, I had turned into a lost, drifting loner. Emotionally vacant and physically dying. I was a shell of a human. I lost my ability to make eye contact with anything besides the pavement. My last thoughts before passing out at night were “God, please don’t make me wake up. Please.”
One cold rainy day, I stumbled into a meeting. I couldn’t afford to ride the bus all day and I was cold, so I just walked into an open church. I listened as best as I could, but I was nearing a black out. I did tear up while there though. I remember being sad because all these people were happy and sober, and those were two things so far from my reach. I felt like I was too far gone. Along with a phone list, a woman there gave me a number to a local treatment center. A few weeks later I managed to go in for an assessment. And soon enough I was on a bus to a detox facility then right to an inpatient facility. I spent 6 months there. I graduated December 28th 2012. 
Today I go to meetings 3 times a week. I work a program. I work at a coffee shop! I’m going to school to finish my bachelor’s degree in mathematics (wtf right??!). I walk with my head held high. I volunteer. My skin is no longer marked with a yellow tint. My liver doesn’t throb every morning. My face isn’t bloated. I look like me again! I am typing this in my pajamas, in my studio apartment, on my new laptop with my recently installed internet. That may not sound like much to some of you, but I have never had these luxuries and I wouldn’t have gotten them without being sober. It all didn’t happen at once, I had to chip away at it… But my life is back on track and better than ever!
I am so damn grateful for every breath. I am grateful that I listened to those who told me that a life in sobriety is possible and worth it. I am grateful for all the support I have found within the recovery community. I am grateful for my new found self-esteem and self-worth.

Ok, just hear me out.  I'm fine.  Look, I've passed two bar exams; graduated from law school in two years and I'm only 26.  Only 26, this is what you're supposed to do at my age.  There is no harm because I'm not like those other people.  I'm different.  My disposition, demeanor and attributes are as distinguishable as a finger print.  Others don't understand what its like to have a mind incapable of cessation.  So I need a few to turn it off and enjoy incidences of the moment.  That's no big deal.  All of my heroes partook.  So what if Hemingway shot himself, Thompson shot himself, Churchill was plagued with VD and Jackson trashed the white house!  Its not a big deal, yeah I've been getting sick a lot more; but its probably the stress.  I have no problem trading sleep for serenity, so what if I have to rush a bit in the morning.  Just because my dad had the problem does not mean it's an inevitability in my life.  No one thinks I have a problem so I probably don't.  And if I do, its okay.  Everyone has their little demon.  Sometimes its permissible to keep the company of that little helper.  I'm not hurting anyone!  I'm not a warlord in Africa.  I don't steal, assault women, drive drunk or even speak out of turn.  Its the stress, the demands.  You need to listen.  Hear me out.  Its under control.  Just a couple with dinner.  Read a book outside.  Fall asleep.

It’s been 6 months without a single sip of alcohol. This is the longest I have ever gone without drinking. And I did it myself. No AA, no NA, no god, just me and my own sheer willpower. And of course, this awesome and life-saving sub. Thank you guys, seriously. I don't always post, but just reading the posts here help a lot when I'm struggling.

It feels absolutely great. I remember making it about 4 months last year before I caved, and I remember thinking that it would take forever to get past that point again. I am extremely damn proud of myself. I still go to bars on occasion to hang out with friends to to play pool, and sometimes, when I’m feeling brave, to say hello to a beautiful woman. Yet I don’t drink there. Even the bartenders get annoyed with me sometimes for being that guy that always gets water, but I could care less (tell them you're the DD, and they'll stfu.) There are even a few beers in my fridge right now that I have no desire to drink that a friend left last time he was here. Another friend of mine recently asked me about this, asking me if I should get rid of them as to not “tempt me”. I laughed. I told her beer and alcohol in general isn’t a temptation at all anymore. I am completely and 100% not tempted to drink in any way whatsoever. And that’s an awesome thing to be able to say.

The truth is, is that I just don’t like who I become when I drink. I become a different person. I’ll make stupid decisions and do things I wouldn’t normally do. And that’s the only reasoning I need. I hurt people when I was drunk. I hurt myself when I was drunk. I let people down. And those are things I quit doing (at least not accidentally) when I quit alcohol. When I see those beers in my fridge, I don't think of them as ""one beer or two."" I view all alcohol as something that I can't have at all because I choose to be a better person. That's why it doesn't even tempt me. I am so positive I never want to drink again, I never want to become that terrible person I become when I drink, that I *absolutely have no fucking desire to pick that back up.*

The differences between my life when I drank alcohol and now are many, but truthfully there is only one big difference that I care about. And that difference is that I now plan for the future. I now feel a slight stability in my life that I never had before. My brother was recently in town for two weeks, he just left this morning actually (he's the one that left the beers, haha), and I already miss him like crazy. But we have some great plans in a year from now, and the crazy thing is that I know **as long as I don’t drink, I’ll probably reach those plans**. I can plan for the future now, and look forward to it. I didn’t have that before. I mean, I would plan for the future and stuff of course, but there was always that slight *who knows what might happen the next time I drink* playing in the back of my mind. I did crazy, foolish, dumb ass things when I drank, and I never had a sense of permanence like I do now.

I've also found my health and confidence rising dramatically. For the first 2-3 months my confidence was shot without alcohol. There was no way I could talk to that girl at the bar without getting a few shots first. But just recently I worked up the nerve to stand up and walk over to a table with 3 beautiful girls, and introduce myself. That's something I never thought I could have done sober. I would have had to have a million drinks first. And I'm exercising a lot now too. Now that I'm always 100% healthy in my mind, I want to get stronger, I'm working out, eating better, trying to gain weight (too skinny) and actually focusing on stuff I never cared about before. Maybe it's because I don't drink so I need to fill my time with more things, but it's working.

The only advice I really have for anyone else struggling is to just not let yourself talk yourself into it. Your own mind can play tricks on you. Your own mind knows better than anyone else in the whole world how to get you to do something. And you can't fight with it. You have to just tune it out. You can't reason against your own mind. I'm not tempted by alcohol at all in and of itself, like I said earlier, but my own mind will sometimes try to tempt me into logic games that lead to drinking. I've gotten really, *really* good at tuning my own mind out.

I want to thank you all again for being so awesome and having the guts to share your stories and posts. Even the posts that talk about ""Oh, I couldn't do it, I drank again..."" help me. Every post here helps me, so please, don't be afraid to post how you feel. And by no means am I saying AA/NA aren't great programs.

I had to give up a dream job and a budding career in film in order to get my health in order. But the investment of throwing away opportunities in order to get my health in order is the best decision I've ever made.

This monologue from Craig Ferguson really inspired me to overcome my shame and bite the bullet. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw

I Hit Rock Bottom!,GottaStopItNow,68,7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18ls7z/great_news_i_hit_rock_bottom/,"The title seems sarcastic, but there is much truth in it for me.  I enjoy reading others' stories, so I thought I'd share my own.


It wasn't a wake up call when the police came to our house to inform us my uncle had jumped off a parking garage and killed himself (because he had lost everything important in his life due to the bottle).


Nor was it when I got my DUI.  I was merely embarrassed when my parents bailed me out and, upon returning home and entering my bedroom, I discovered they had placed all my hidden empties on my bed to send a message.  


It wasn't when my first and only serious relationship ended.  She didn't know I began drinking vodka on the way home from work.  And when she once found a pint of vodka in my work laptop bag, she thought it was funny.  Even now she doesn't know that she dumped me because of my alcoholism, but I do.


It wasn't when I hit 30 and realized nearly all my close friends had grown up and left the party.  I could always wrangle up a few troops to hit the town and get shitty.


I realized at this point I was heading downhill and gaining speed, but still didn't know where bottom was or quite what it meant.


Then the fog rolled in, making me an anxious, jittery, slow-witted mess at work.  I was embarrassed when subordinates rose above me or when when they joked about my partying lifestyle in only a mildly sarcastic tone.  I  noticed my boss sitting closer than necessary to try and smell my breath.


Rock bottom continued to remain elusive to me because I knew I'd never lose my decent-paying job.  I'd always be competent *enough*.  I'd never be on the streets because my rent was cheap and my apartment nice *enough*.  I'd never lose my family because I'm single with no kids and you can't lose what you don't have.


My rock bottom came when I realized there was absolutely no way I could make any progress in any area of my life unless I stopped, and the idea of remaining in that state of inertia indefinitely was beyond agonizing.


It was an important step for me to understand the different ways rock bottom can manifest itself and identify and embrace my own.  Ironically, I'm thrilled to finally reach it.

As we wrap up our first month of sobriety, it’s a good time to reflect. I’m sure I’m not alone in saying that this has been a month full of ups and downs, certainly a time full of memories I won’t forget. 

At the conclusion of my first 30 days, I’m ready to commit to 30 more. Sobriety makes me feel better, it helps me be more productive in my job, more committed to my girlfriend (28-year-old guy here) than I have been before, more excited about spirituality (I know lots of you are atheists… I’m not trying to throw God in your face by including this. The bottom line is I feel we were all put on this planet to be excellent to one another, not act like a big bunch of jerks.), and I’m physically healthier.

There have been tests. I confronted a group of friends by expressing regret for my drunk behavior on New Year’s Eve. I explained to them that I gave up drinking. It was really awkward, but it was a pill I had to eat because my behavior had impacted so many people. I was like an 800 lb. gorilla in a room of people trying desperately to ignore what they were seeing. We still have tension, but these people at least offered the opportunity to prove my good intentions through the actions of the future. It’s about all a person could ask for.

There have been social gatherings, business meetings and one-on-one conversations where alcohol is a major topic at hand. Arnold Palmer and I have grown acquainted. It’s strangely been easy to order soft drinks on these occasions, no one else really seemed to give a crap what I drank. A small test arose when a co-worker ordered scotch at a going away party for a very well-liked colleague of ours, but my craving passed quickly in the excitement and fun to be had at the party.

The biggest test popped up about a week ago. The only time I really contemplated going to the liquor store for a bottle arose last Friday, when my dad found out he has cancer. I wanted to crawl into a bottle and stay there all weekend, but the feeling passed when I realized it was my responsibility to be in his corner for his upcoming fight against lymphoma. The good news is, it’s treatable. My dad’s fighting spirit is strong and he’s ready to win. We live a 12-hour drive apart, but we spent a great deal of time on the phone last weekend, and I could not have done it had I been drunk. Our family has accepted the challenge.

It’s funny to type this now, but I honestly took a moment to think about my damn /r/stopdrinking badge before I made the decision to stay home in my alcohol-free apartment instead of driving anywhere.

This subreddit is great, I’m grateful for a chance to share, and I’m even more grateful for a chance to read other people’s stories. Together, we can pile on the days of sobriety until it’s not even worth counting them anymore.

Let me give you some reason to drink tea: 

1) **It's a great substitute for habitual drinking.** One of the biggest problems I had was figuring out what to drink instead of drinking. Whether it was at night, at dinner, at a restaurant. Coffee is a good substitute as well, but too much of it will make you crazy. Drink as much fucking tea as you want--I won't bother you that much. 

2) **It will help you loose weight** another substitute is soda--which is a safe alternative, but packs a bunch of calories. Water would be the less calories, but it has no flavor. With flavor and little calories, drinking tea constantly has flush many elements out of my system--I've lost 25 pounds. 

3) **It's incredibly inexpensive** A case of soda--damn too much (of course, nothing compared to alcohol) With tea, you buy a box and you're all set for a long, long time. To fill in this habitual gap cost next to nothing. 

4) **No more dehydration** one of the biggest problems I had while drinking was being dehydrated. Whenever I drank I had a huge headache (no a hangover) and it was due to having little water. Whenever I came home and had a beer, I had a headache for hours. But with substituting for tea, I never had this problem--in fact, I'm wide awake at night and get more work done. 

5) **I feel safe overindulging** I think this is the best reason. I will have several (and I mean giant mugs of hot tea) each night to quench my palette. And that's all right. With other methods to eliminate the habit, it might be potentially harmful--but I feel comfortable do this. 


So, to sum up. If you're trying to find a substitute, see if tea works. It won't be for everyone, but maybe this may help one or two--which is all that matters.

1347367799.0,57,self.stopdrinking,zpf23,1 Year Under My Belt: Musings from a Former Drunk Who Will Staying Sober,MonsterQuads,63,6,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/zpf23/1_year_under_my_belt_musings_from_a_former_drunk/,"Wow. Here I am. Seems like just yesterday I was drinking every single night and blacking out most every night. Saying hurtful things to my spouse, forgetting that I ate dinner, forgetting just about every event in the evening after polishing off the first bottle of wine (then on to the next!).  

I kept kidding myself because I was drinking wine or champagne, not the ""hard"" stuff.  I kept kidding myself because I didn't ""need"" to drink to function, I could wake up, go to work, get my job done, and hey, I was great at what I do! I didn't need a drink, I just LIKED to drink. So how does that make me an alcoholic?  

Turns out the reason I quit was that I began verbally abusing my spouse. Of course, I didn't realize I had done it as I was blacked out (but I'm not an alcoholic!  I'm not! I'm not! Yeah, right). It was the kind of thing where you wake up the next morning, not remembering what happened, but you know in the pit of your stomach that *something* happened because for some reason a feeling of shame comes over you. A feeling of guilt.
 
My spouse gave me ""the talk"" informing me of my behavior.  Needless to say I felt sick to my stomach.  Twenty two years of marriage and I was NOT going to ruin it.  That was on Sept. 12, 2011.  A year ago today.  I thank god for my spouse. He has stuck by me through thick and thin and he deserved better, much better, than I was giving him.  

My brother was an alcoholic.  A doctor, who was married three times.  He lost all three wives due to his love affair with alcohol.  He also lost his medical license and practice due to alcohol.  And then he lost his life at age 53.  And there I was, after passing judgement on him so many times, there I was, walking down the same path.  Thank god for my spouse.  Did I say that already?  Good because it should be said over and over again. 

So here I am a year later with more clarity in my life, so much love to share with my husband, and so much more appreciation of this life (which is so fleeting).  I am so happy to be alive and to be free of the hold drinking had on me.  It continues to tempt me at times, but I'm starting to view it more as a competition with me and it. And trust me, I'm going to win.  Every time.

Thank you for creating this subreddit.  Everyone here has a reason to be here and I wish you all the very best in your own personal quest to beat the beast.  And it is a beast.  But it can be conquered.

I got sick of feeling like a bag of mush everyday.. and decided to take steps towards sobriety during the weekdays (as step one) and succeeded thus far.. This is step one to reduce my dependence on alcohol and hopefully in time I'll see that it isn't so bad - and hopefully will start incorporating sobriety into my weekends as well!

My secret: Don't keep booze in the house dumbass!

What has happened as a result of a few months of dedication and moderation:

1. Lost a steady 10 lbs
2. Saved a ton of money
3. Finally able to go on more rides on my new sportbike (something that I couldn't do well when I was hungover the morning after)
4. **I GOT FUCKING PROMOTED AT WORK AFTER 3 YEARS!!!!! TO MY DREAM JOB (HUGE pay increase, big bonus pool and new people hired under me to do my old terrible job!)** This will change my life completely as a 25 year old.. I know will have the money to change my life, buy a house and maybe another motorcycle or two :)
I also get 6 weeks of vacation, an expense account and free tickets to events such as E3

5. I have the energy to do all the things I want, I bought a new downhill mountain bike which I plan to take full advantage of - I can finally dedicate some time to playing golf at 7am in the mornings when I would otherwise be passed out.

Mine is more characterized by bathos than pathos, but nonetheless I’ll share my own story of hope.

My adult life has been one of extraordinary good fortune: some hard work, a great deal of luck, and the blessings of love from many people. A photograph of me would show a successful, healthy, and happy woman with wonderful children and a devoted spouse. It would also show me pulling the languid shadow of alcohol.

There is no rock bottom moment to report. There are no car crashes, anguished tears of family members, or wells of sorrow. Instead there are moments of banal sadness, trivial to the world, but adding up to an inexorable sense of futility that made me choose recovery: telling my son that I would love to read a book with him, but “Let me get a glass of wine, and then we’ll sit down together.” Telling my spouse a story about something that happened at work and hearing him reply, “Don’t you remember? You told me that last night.” Trying to squeeze into a snug suit and having a breakfast of Tylenol and coffee before heading to work. Waking up in the middle of the night and wondering, “Why am I doing this? Why did I do it again? Is there something wrong with me? Do I have a problem? Am I a bad person?” Resolving to improve only to rehash the same anxious, silent monologue the next night. Having dinner with friends, and watching the level in the wine bottle go down, trying to pay attention to the conversation, but preoccupied by whether there is enough, whether we will order another, whether it will be noticed that I take the last from the bottle before anyone else gets to it. It culminates with an ordinary morning where I wake up, turn to my spouse, and say, “I think I’m ready to quit drinking.”

Many stories include how much the person’s life has improved since they chose recovery. My story has no mended fences, no exciting new career, no new-found well of spiritual strength. But here’s what it has: the feeling of synchronicity when I am running in the park, and see a flock of birds traverse the sky above me. The sunlight on my daughter’s hair. The genuine smile and laughter that I can produce at work in the morning. Waking up in the middle of the night, inching closer to my beloved, and falling back asleep. The feeling that my life, my ordinary life, is rich and beautiful, and I am experiencing [I]all[/I] of it.

My recovery story will never be worthy of a movie, or even a family legend. But it’s my story. And I will hold it tight to me like the fragile shard of sunlight that it is.

1358749458.0,60,self.stopdrinking,16z586,"I'm not anti-AA, but I found this little piece to be very true",ObamaSmokes,69,9,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16z586/im_not_antiaa_but_i_found_this_little_piece_to_be/,"I frequent a runner's forum and saw the following reply in a discussion about AA. I go to meetings and have no problem with AA, but I chuckled at this nonetheless. Actually, I'd like to hear your response to it.

""AA is ok as a support mechanism, but if you are intelligent, it can be hard to sit in a meeting and listen to people who are barely able to read or string a few thoughts together. What I usually found was that what people chose to share was a jumbled mess of narcissism and self pity that gets wrapped up with slogans like ""I'll keep coming back"" or ""It only works if you work it"", etc.

The truth is that there are very few people in AA that are honest in meetings. There's lots of talk about the ""gift"" and how each day is a blessing, but there's little acknowledgement of the depression that inevitably accompanies recovery and such topics are often discouraged by old-timers for fear of alienating new comers. Much like evangelical churches, there is a heavy emphasis placed on appearances and conspicuous AA piety. 

There's also a fair amount of hagiography of Bill W. and Dr. Bob. If you were to bring up that Bill W. spent many years late in life battling with depression despite vigorously working the program, you would not find many people interested in discussing that at meetings. If you ask why he took acid with Timothy Leary and Aldous Huxley, I'm sure that few people will want to talk about it.

I've also found that there is a prevailing negative attitude towards prescription drugs in AA, particularly for pain and/or depression. There are a lot of amateur MDs in AA.

Finally, you will have all kinds of people in your business. You'll receive lots of unsolicited advice and there are plenty of people where I live who preach that you're not really working the program unless you're going to a meeting every night. There are people who take pride in attending meetings every day for years on end. They fret about vacation and work trips.

I guess what finally put the nail in the coffin for me was the 1 millionth time I heard the slogan ""If you want what we have..."" I realized that I didn't want to sit around in church basements and other dreary gathering places with people who were emotionally brittle and needy. I felt repulsed by the lack of ambition and fatalism that I saw in most people that I met in AA. There's a genuine fear in many people in AA of getting out too far in front of their ""program"" and it makes most people cautious in life.

I did meet some really remarkable people and people that I genuinely admire. I'd put the number at less that 5% - about the same number of decent priests that I have met. But AA is/was not for me and I stopped going to meetings after 10 years. That was 8 years ago and I haven't really looked back.

I'm sure that AA has helped many people and I'm genuinely happy that it works for them. Personally, I think there is too much groupthink and too little raw honesty.""",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month8,True,t3_16z586,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16z586/im_not_antiaa_but_i_found_this_little_piece_to_be/,

With my support, one of my staff applied for a higher job in another team at my workplace. I'm proud to say he got the job and in his letter of resignation he praised my leadership skills. I was so touched. I've also been seconded to an exciting project for one day a week. So between recruitment and a few other big projects, my job is pretty full-on at the moment.

I'm almost 200 days off the booze. I also stopped smoking weed a week ago. I've quit weed many times, including for a whole year at one point. This time I intend for it to be permanent. I was just smoking in the weekends but noticed that I would experience anxiety in the weekends. Also, my experiences with 100% sobriety were very positive and I want to return to that.

I've decided that total sobriety is very precious and important to me. By sticking with it I've found my consciousness expands. That sounds hippy-dippy but what I mean is that I become more aware of my immediate surroundings and appreciate things like clouds and sunsets and cups of coffee and cuddling my cats more. I'm not gonna mess up the higher consciousness I get from total sobriety by smoking even one cone of marijuana a week. The longer I stay completely sober, the stronger and more developed my mindfulness becomes.

So yeah, last night instead of getting drunk and stoned like I used to, I read lots of articles and advice about how to push my career further. I almost didn't recognise myself, but I really like who I've become. Saner, stronger, more self-confident.

1372348457.0,54,self.stopdrinking,1h6nku,I never thought this day would come! TRIPLE DIGITS! I'd like to share some positive thoughts about sobriety.,iluffeggs,58,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h6nku/i_never_thought_this_day_would_come_triple_digits/,"Holy shit! What an amazing feeling this is. When I quit drinking, I told myself and my friends that I was only taking 90 days off. Day 90 came and went and I let it go. I was so proud of myself that I posted my 90-day victory as my status on facebook and was overwhelmed by the positive response. It was the first time many of my friends/family had heard I'd quit. There was only ONE person questioning ""why would you stop drinking, it's not like you really did anything that bad,"" and it was someone I don't know well. I was truthfully kind of shocked, I thought there might be more like that. The fact that there wasn't shows that most people who really know me agree that I needed to stop.... As narcissistic and shallow as a facebook post may seem, it helped. Sometimes it just feels good to know people care, even the tiniest bit. 

Here's a quick list of the great things that have happened in my 100 days: 

 * Lost 10 pounds without changing my diet

 * Started exercising 

 * Haven't had a single cold sore (I used to get them once a month!)

 * My eczema is much better 

 * I actually wake up... IN THE MORNING

 * I haven't told any embarrassing secrets to random strangers

 * I started volunteering at a great organization, building up my resume and becoming a functioning member of society

 * I applied and was accepted to go back to school to pursue my dream of one day being a doctor

 and finally.... 

 * I quit drinking because of a bad fight I got into with a friend when I was shitfaced. We started talking again after 2 months without drinking and when he saw how serious I was about it, and how much better my SOBER personality is, we became friends again.

The point is, forgiveness and redemption are always possible. Don't give up hope that you've burned all your bridges by being a drunken asshole. The people who really love you will be overjoyed to see you making strides to be a better person. 

I'd like to finish this wall of text with a request. I find that listening to stand up comedians talk about why they stopped drinking really resonates with me. My favorite is John Mulaney's bit ""whiskey or perfume."" (I can't find it online for free right now, sorry about that.) Does anyone else have any good stand-up suggestions along the same lines? I find it really helps me a lot.

It was a year ago today that I woke up early in the afternoon with my head pounding and terrified of the consequences from my actions the day before. I was certain that I had lost my dream job, my house would surely follow. My wife had told me multiple times that she could not continue the way things were going. It was apparent that I was at a crossroads. Much had been lost, but it was up to me if I would continue along my path of destruction, or give up the drink.

In the early hours and days of my sobriety, I met many others with the same problem. I could hardly imagine how those with a week, a month or six months could have possibly made it that far.

Yet here I am. Flawed as ever. Learning to face the demons I had been running from for so long. It's a long process. I often feel crazy as I ever was. I'm trying to learn to rebuild my relationships. It's not a walk in the park, but it's progress. The obsession seems to have left, but booze is a tricky foe. I am always on guard, ready for the sudden pang of thirst when the urge to fade into the black grabs me on occasion, or even the  meandering craving that dances across my brain, and is gone before I know what it was.

I frequented this sub a lot more often when I was just starting down my path of sobriety in February. Using a throwaway to separate my main account now, but just wanted to tell someone that I'm hitting 6 months in a few hours. Most of my friends don't seem to care, or acknowledge it, which is ok, but here I am feeling some need for vindication I suppose.

It's been 181 days (wtf hey) since my last sip of booze and a cigarette. I haven't slipped up once on either. Haven't even held a cigarette or held a drink in my hards. I was at a really dark point back in February and didn't even realize it. Thought the love of my life was back, was going to visit her and things fell apart 3 days before Feb 14. So, I drank, a lot, and did a bunch of blow to make myself feel better. I think the longest I went sober from around 15/16 until now was 10 days. By the next week I realized I needed to change. And I did. It wasn't easy at first. I pretty much stopped going out for 3 months other than to work and school. I initially gained about 15 lbs. I got a crazy big sweet tooth, which I still have. I've since lost the 15 lbs and dropped about 5% body fat, and began running 20 kms a week and hitting the gym 3 times per week. My body is starting to noticeably change now, can see a 6 pack coming in slowly and lost the beer gut, which is awesome to see (never had one before, not trying to brag).

I guess the biggest thing for me now 6 months on in is I'd initially thought my life would somehow be magically all better at this point, and all of my hopes and dreams would have come to fruition by now, which they haven't. But I've been a hell of a lot happier, I have my self confidence back and feel like my old self who I seem to have lost somewhere in my teenage years (almost 30 now). According to a therapist I was seeing for a bit I was self medicating for a long time, and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety from my doctor. I've been taking an SSRI which has helped a lot, planning on stopping that within the next few months. It initially cut down my cravings to drink tremendously, which is obviously personal experience only. 

If you're still reading this thank you, and if you stumble, keep on trying and it's entirely possible to change your life. It's not easy, nor fun at times, but it's possible. 

Best.

TL; DR 6 months sober tomorrow.

It's quite a milestone. I went through all this with cigarettes 12 years ago and the addiction mechanisms are very similar. I'm one of the lucky ones who never really fell too far. I saw where my drinking was leading and bailed before it got too bad. Someone posted a while ago about how ""hitting bottom"" means something different to everyone. I'm very lucky that mine was long before loss of what's important to me.

The benefits? I'm as healthy as a horse. I sleep like a log every night and wake up refreshed and clear headed. I no longer have to blame drinking for my shortcomings. I just accept who I am with no feelings of guilt or remorse. It's exceptionally liberating. My previous periods of irritability are gone. Steady, calm, rational and dependable.

The downside? I've given up a part of my social life and I think I miss it, but gradually I'm finding new outlets for my social needs. I'm getting some new friends. It will all work out. Friday nights just aren't the same. I hope to replace my typical Friday night over the past 35 years let-it-all-out with running or some weekly physical activity.

If you asked me a year ago what I thought about people who didn't drink, I'd have an unfavorable viewpoint of them.  I probably would have said, ""Well, they can't be as intelligent as I am.  If they knew what the world was really like, they'd have to drink.""  I didn't know shit back then, I still don't today.  I do know that thinking like that is an excuse.

I lived in absolute fear since for the past 5 years.  Fear that I febreezed over with vodka.  When the vodka wore off, I was left with the original fear augmented by the means of which I used  to drowned it out with.  I would be fearful until I drank, the more I drank the more fearful I got, then the more often I'd drink.  I really started to scare myself when I was drinking in the morning before work.  That fear followed me to the office, where I feared everyone could smell me from a mile away(brought tons of mints/gum). 

I'm sure most of you have heard these stories a hundred times over:

I have no idea how I still have a driver license, I urinated the bed on a nightly basis, made a fool of myself on dates, infront of family, and said horrible things about my friends to their faces.  Blacked out while ON the shift at an old bartending gig, and was noticeably drunk while working numerous other places(mostly food service industry).  Again, this is all on a daily basis.  Lastly, ruined a 3 year relationship with someone I loved.  She got to see the wholeeeee thing.  Lucky her.

365 Day Later... 

At 26 years old, I had never lived in a house/apartment other the one I was born in. I went to university 15 minutes away.  I now live 831 miles from my birthplace; Northeast to the deep South.  I work at a place and I don't dread driving to every morning and has some relevance to my interests.

I'm 22lbs lighter and my max benchpress has gone up by almost 100lbs.  I got REALLY into fitness, I cannot tell you how much I depended on the gym on the hardest of days.  I went from being chubby to having people ask me how often I work out.  I'm truly in the best shape of my life.  Smoking cigarettes went to the wayside as well.  Feel like I'm preparing for personal battle, like I'm getting ready for something that will test me further.

I've just started dating again.  It all feels brand new without the chemical relaxant.  I can tell you without a doubt that not drinking decreases maximum potential dates, but increases the quality of ones that you DO have.  After a year + of not dating, I can also tell you that you may be pretty lonely, which can be easily read by the person you are out with.  Practice.

I know I was self medicating with my drinking.  I thought not drinking would solve the problems I was self medicating for.  What I didn't know, was that sobering up would put me in a cage match with these issues.  I originally decided to post this because of my confusion as to why I'm still not happy, still can't pat myself on the back.  I've come to realize that a lot of alcoholics are incredibly self critical and fearful of failure.  After getting it out in writing, and reading it as if it weren't my own words, I feel that I'd say to the writer  ""Congratulations, sounds like your doing great!""  I don't know why that is so hard to do for yourself.  

I realize now that there is still a lot of work to be done, that this is just the beginning.  I'm willing though, and I've made some ground work.

If I didn't kill someone, I was going to kill myself, in the most heinous way possible.

Funny enough, the one thing that kept me sane and not trying to commit suicide in jail was the thought of seeing my dog one more time. Just to nap on the couch with him. My girlfriend is probably going to leave me. I can deal with anything...as long as I don't go back in that cell, ever, ever, ever again. And I know to do that I need to never pick up a drink again.

For some reason 11 years feels like a bigger milestone for me than 10. I think because when I hit 10 it almost sounded like something was over. Now that it has been 11 years I feel like I have settled into a tranquil pace that I can keep up till the end. I remain vigilant, but the triggers have far less power over me, and my life is so completely different than the time I was drinking that I no longer put myself in the situations that I used to drink.

Life certainly has not gotten any easier. On the contrary, the challenges I face now are even greater. For the past several years I have been trying to get into law enforcement, but every turn is stymied by my history of using. Every time I fill out a background packet I am forced to confront my history and am reminded of how it has affected me. I am now changing focus, and am going to start the path of alcohol or addiction counseling, as I feel I have something to offer.
However, these challenges that I face now I would not be able to handle if I was still drinking and using drugs. Being sober has allowed me to see things clearly, and when things get too difficult, I can step back, think and evaluate what I am doing, and try a different angle. Before, I would just quit and retreat and sink further into depression. The deeper into depression I went, I would not even try to accomplish anything, and felt like I was drowning. Now, I might still have a bad day or two, but I can move forward confidently and change course or tactics with a mind not obsessed with cursing itself.

To the new people and people just wondering if they have a problem: Drinking or quitting drinking will not solve any of your problems. Sometimes the problems will even seem greater after quitting, because you have avoided even looking at them for so long they have backed up. I guarantee though, that at some point, if you are drinking to avoid your problems, eventually you will be run over by them, and you may not recover. By not drinking I know that I at least can have a clear mind to face life. 

The other important factor I want to mention is that just quitting drinking is only part of being sober. If you do not change your behavior and mindset, you will start to kill yourself with the anxiety and stress. The phrase used in AA is ""Dry Drunk."" An even bigger part of sobriety is able to accept your yourself for all your strength and your faults. Being honest with yourself means changing your goals in life, changing your outlook, changing your behavior, and loving yourself. Eventually your will start to notice more and more the enjoyment you get out of life, and you will be less afraid of feeling sad.

And tonight I shall celebrate by having some yummy Vietnamese food and going to a comedy club. \o/

I am 28 years old and have been sober for a little over 14 months. I attend AA meetings roughly every day, I have a sponsor, I have worked steps 1-9 and I work steps 10-12 every day. I made a decision to drink the coolaid and have never once found reason to question that decision.

For the sake of transparency, I'll mention that alcohol was never really my drug of choice, but today I abstain from all mind and mood altering substances except for caffeine. That said, I certainly drank alcoholically. The last time I went more than a few days without a drink (before this sober run), I was like 16 years old. More importantly, when I drank, the feeling of being drunk created a craving for more booze. Once I got a couple in me, I was shooting the moon basically every time. I also smoked pot every single day, all day, from mid adolescence onwards. I experimented with every drug under the sun, and developed some serious habits with several of them. 

I built an identity and lifestyle for myself that served to keep drugs and alcohol within arms reach at all times. I was proud to be the guy who knew everything about drugs and was not afraid of any of them. I was proud to be the guy many other people came to for information about drugs. I grew up wanting to be the cool guy, afraid and convinced that I was not the cool guy, so I worked very hard to build a character that I could play who was the cool guy. 

At the end of my last run, I was utterly defeated. I owed a ton of money to people; I had alienated almost everyone who really cared about me, and those who I hadn't alienated, I had thoroughly lied to in order to keep them in my life; I was lonely; I was absolutely out of control; I was failing at everything in my life except getting fucked up. I ultimately got sober when I started to fail at getting fucked up too. The final feeling of my time drinking and drugging was terror. I was absolutely terrified that I wanted nothing more than to stop doing what I was doing, but found myself completely unable to stop. Every stopping attempt I had attempted had fallen flat in a matter of minutes to days. I was trapped. The only outlet I could imagine was death, but I didn't have the balls to end my own life. 

It was in that state that I surrendered. I walked out on the life I had built on a foundation of drugs and delusions. I moved back in with my parents at the age of 27. I entered an outpatient treatment program and began attending AA meetings. I went to 90 meetings in my first 90 days. I got a sponsor. I became willing and eager to work the steps very quickly. Meetings gave me a feeling of peace from the maelstrom going on in my head. I also rode my bike a lot. That made me feel better too. 

I worked the steps with all the diligence I could muster. Step 3 was a bit of a mystery to me, and eventually I abandoned it for step 4. Steps 4-9 took me like 5 months to complete (although I'll probably be paying some of my debts for a long time, and some of the behavioral changes I've made as amends to people should be lifetime commitments). 

Honestly, I found steps 4-8 to be genuinely fun. Certainly there was some dark stuff in there, and moments of deep anxiety and fear. But they were just moments: drops of anxiety in a sea of discovery and wonder. It was baffling to see the changes in my attitude and outlook as I progressed through these steps. It was also fascinating to see my perspective on steps 1-3 change during the work of steps 4-8.

Step 9 was tough. Fortunately I had built a pretty strong emotional foundation in steps 1-8. So even though step 9 was very emotionally turbulent for me, I was able to get through it. This step changed me and my outlook more than any other piece of the puzzle. The shift was seismic. 

Today, I work steps 10-12 every day and I find them to be a great tool to keep me comfortable and my head on straight. In fact, I have to run now because I'm meeting a newcomer who I'm helping ease into the transition into sobriety at a meeting this afternoon.

So real quick before I jet out the door:

My life is wonderful today. I live almost every day in feelings of gratitude and peace. The moments when I have difficulty and that serenity breaks down, I have a well equipped toolbelt to handle it. The best days of drinking and drugging weren't as good as my highest highs in sobriety; the worst days in sobriety are not even in the same ballpark as the every day average of the end of my drinking and drugging.

If I can experience this change, there's hope for you. 

Peace yo.

After 10 years of justification and denial, it was time to stop. At the time, I knew that stopping drinking was going to be hard. Turns out, that's the easy part. The hard part is coming to terms with the things I did, and who I am. 

I hid my drinking quite well. My wife didn't know, and neither did my family. So, naturally, there is now a problem of trust in our relationship, which I fully understand and accept. She said it felt like she was hit by a truck when I told her. When I was drinking, it didn't feel like lying. It was just me having some drinks. Nothing to tell. But, looking back with sober eyes, I realize that she is right. I lied. A lot. About what I was doing. About where money was going. And, perhaps most importantly, by saying nothing at all when I should have spoken up. 

What started as me getting help for a problem has turned into serious introspection about who I am. I always thought I was honest. I always thought I was considerate of others needs. But my actions say otherwise. 

Thankfully, she did not leave me, or kick me out, or really even get mad. She is hurt, which pains me to see. I did that to her, and I have to accept that.

I'm two weeks sober now, and I don't plan on going back. I'm in therapy for myself, and we are in couples counseling together. Eventually, this will be the past, and we will have moved on. But for now, I am stuck with the unsettling fact that I have no idea who I am. The unintended consequences of a life that I let get away from me.

Thanks for being a cool source of recovery for me when I need and/or want it. It's been a good year. looking forward to enjoying my 366th day of sobriety. 

**edit: some people have asked me to share how it works for me. If this doesn't sound anything like your sobriety, I'd love to hear about how it works for you.**

I began recovery by making 90 AA meetings in 90 days. Every now and then I would miss a day, but I would be sure to make that up by doubling-down on the weekend or whatever. I shared in maybe 30% of the meetings I attended. While that was going on, I completed an outpatient program at a treatment center near my parents house (where I moved back to at the age of 27 after my addiction became too crippling to go on). I liked the outpatient program and thought it gave me a handful of useful tools and perspectives on sobriety. But AA has been the backbone of my recovery. My drug of choice was not alcohol, but I decided AA was the best choice for my recovery for a few reasons which I won't write here, but will gladly share if you ask.

I should add, I wanted desperately to change. My bottom scared the shit out of me and left me basically ready to do anything to change myself and my life on a fundamental level. 

With some nudging from my outpatient program I got a sponsor. He was just basically the only guy in the meetings I had been going to who had reached out to me. I had made almost zero use of the phone numbers I had received in AA, though I would talk to people after and before meetings. This guy made sure to text me a few times in my first couple months and ask me how I was doing. I asked him to be my sponsor because he was like the only obvious choice. I was afraid that he was too meek and gentle to whip me into shape, but I just pulled the trigger and asked him. He told me he would be honored to sponsor me. I have since come to believe that he is among the most spiritually mature and centered people I have ever known or will ever know. I consider myself immensely fortunate to know him at all, let alone on such an intimate level. He is an absolute role model to me. 

I knew that I wanted to work the steps. I considered myself a believer-in-god already and had no qualms or difficulties surrounding prayer or faith (though I had never really engaged in either before). My sponsor and I talked about the first three steps for maybe a month, and around my 4th month, I started writing a 4th step. It took me a couple months to write, and around my 6th month, I shared it with my sponsor over the course of a couple 5th step sessions. My 4th step was eye-opening and enlightening, not nearly as scary as I had made it out to be in my head. There were a small handful of things that I was scared to share with my sponsor. But when I sat with him to do my 5th step, I shared them anyway telling myself that if I wanted to run away and never see him again, I could. It ended up being just fine, though not earth shattering, and I went home to work 6 and 7 later that day. 

At this point, my recovery started to be about so much more than just staying sober. It stopped being about working the steps so I could stay sober and started being about staying sober so I could work the steps. I started to form a whole new set of ideals and goals for my personal growth and development. My life became filled with spiritual content. This has been a continual process. It's like my life is a latex balloon being gradually filled with air. That air is spiritual structure. 

My 8th step was not difficult. I had done a lot of pre-writing for it in my 4th step. Though, it was really interesting to see how my perspective had changed since I started writing my 4th step. A lot of the rows on my 4th step now looked silly and self-aggrandizing. Others looked like cop-outs to avoid confronting bigger issues. So I revised. Then I met with my sponsor and talked about it. He told me to take some people off the list, that I didn't need to make amends with that one or this one. He and I worked together to carefully dissect some of the entries in my 8th step. In the end I had a pretty manageable list. But there were a few big debts on there that were scaring the shit out of me.

I started working my 9th step in no particular order. I had been afraid of the 9th step since step 1, but I had learned enough about the rewards of the step process that I had faith enough to just pull the trigger. I was shocked to find how difficult the 9th step was. Almost any time I called someone to make an amends, I would have to spend the rest of the day recovering. Sometimes it made me physically ill. Sometimes it was shame and guilt over what I had done. Other times I just couldn't tell what it was that would emotionally wreck me. Other times it was empathy for the pain of the other people. My sponsor and an old timer friend of mine both reassured me that this was okay and normal. My friend said it's like being covered in boils. They hurt all the time and make you unable to do stuff, but in order to heal them, you have to slash them with a knife. the slash will hurt, and the puss inside will be smelly and festering. but then they will heal. 

Sometime during the 9th step, the 10th, 11th, and 12th steps started to naturally pop up into my life without much effort or thought. I had made a habit out of daily prayer, but it started to sound a lot like a 10th step prayer. I had immersed myself in ideas about God, myself, and other people, so I was (and still am) intensely curious about God. So daily meditation became a natural part of my life just because I yearned for a deeper connection with God. And I quickly came to believe that my highest calling in life is to help ease the suffering of myself and other people on a moment-to-moment basis however possible. 

I cannot express how rewarding the beginning of my journey into recovery has been. The gifts I have received in this process have exceeded my wildest dreams. I hope and pray that this experience touches you and your life as well. And I can't wait to find what will be revealed next.

On Wednesday, I hit 30 days sober and figured, ""Hey I'm not gonna make it to the next milestone anyways and I'm going to drink after treatment ends, so I might as well have a drink tonight!"" Not such a great idea. While nothing ""bad"" really happened while I was drinking, I was still kicking myself for throwing away my sobriety. I had killed a fifth in one night, no sweat, when I relapsed and honestly that scared the shit out of me. If I can go 30 days without drinking and then ""limit"" myself to only a fifth, then how much am I going to be drinking each night when I inevitably go back to drinking every day?

I'm really glad that I have finally realized that I cannot in fact limit myself, and that the only course of action is abstinence. Also seeing that I am incapable of ""drinking like a normal person"" had finally allowed me to admit to myself that I truly am an alcoholic and I can't take that  first drink. Now I'm staying sober for me, and not for anyone/anything else. Cunning, baffling and powerful indeed!

I knew nobody else there and the amount of booze was incredible. Beer, cider, various lovely red and crisp white wines, freezer full of clear spirits, bench full of dark ones. All top shelf... Everyone was drinking. Everyone was a couple and I was single and fresh out of heartbreak. But I endured, made an effort to talk to people, to have a laugh. I ate as much as I could so I always had something in my hand. A few times I caught myself laughing and making everyone else laugh with me like I used to when I was charmingly tipsy. I had fun! It was hard but driving home from the party I found myself smiling...it felt well.

Her German wasn't good because she is originally from Columbia but anyhow we've managed to understand each others. We rode the train together and I escorted her to her destination where I've asked her if she wants so meet for a coffee someday and she agrees, so I gave her my number (I forgot my phone at home, sucks... but If she's interested she'll call me). Now I have to play the waiting game...  

You know what's the biggest advantage of that situation was?  

a) This boosted my self-confidence because I know that I'm now able to talk to woman even without being drunk... and it went fucking smooth, I knew the boundaries (didn't asked for her age or too private stuff etc.)  

b) I'll know exactly how she will look like if we are going to meet again

My long ass experience,TehSantos,54,1,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/15y33v/1_year_without_alcohol_my_long_ass_experience/,"Damn, I don't even know where to start. A little over 2 years ago, I quit drinking for good for the first time.  My girlfriend convinced me to give it up. That lasted for 8 really good months, but the problem was that I was doing it JUST for her. Eventually, it ate away at me, and I started blaming her for inhibiting my freedom. Once those mental gymnastics start, it's hard to stay good and I of course, relapsed.

8 months of the hardest drinking in my life later, my uncle dies of liver failure. Shit, it runs in the family. I didn't realize it at the time, but his death impacted me more than any pep-talk ever could. He was always an asshole; and I really do mean always, so at least his death lit that fire under my ass.

This time however, I used a crutch. I had never smoked weed before in my life, and I didn't want something to trigger my alcohol abuse. So when those familiar triggers started to hit, I avoided them and told myself I could just spark one up instead. Lots of people on this subreddit warned me that it would just bring back old urges, and even though I didn't want to, I heeded that warning and put the bong away for a few months just to see if I had cravings for weed. I didn't. I really didn't.

So I started with weed again, because if I am honest with myself, I very much enjoy being in an altered state of mind, and at least vaporizing weed was going to have the most minimal affect on my health (at least compared to anything else I could think of.) I know some might think less of me for it, and might even think I don't deserve my badge, but hear me out.

This whole passed year hasn't been about stressing out about liquor, and truly, that's what I wanted/want. Maybe substituting will only lead back to liquor down the road, but I just don't see that happening. I have had cravings for alcohol maybe 20-30 times in the passed year. Now, we all know that sounds like a lot to the layman, but really, before weed, it was like 20-30 a day.

So if I am being completely honest with myself, it's a bittersweet victory. I am totally okay with being a pothead over an alcoholic. It doesn't negatively affect my relationships and I don't fiend for it the way I did with alcohol. Actually, I am currently 2 weeks without pot just because I haven't even given it a thought to smoke. However, I don't feel like the coolest guy in the world, not having that self control and all to just quit cold turkey. Either way, I can at least say with full certainty that I am much happier now than I ever was with booze. At least that victory will always ring out.

Some awesome victories of mine last year:
I sat at BJ's brewery, at the bar and had a Coke and some pizza, even after hearing all the drink specials and awesome pricing.

Went to a friend's house who always has parties and didn't drink at all. I was the life of the party as a drunk, and still managed to be the life of the party stone cold sober (not even high.)

Went to an old friends house and he tried and tried and tried to talk me into doing shots. Didn't even get close to talking me into it.

I come from a large Mexican family, and they are always drinking. Every time they see me, they offer me something, and I politely decline. I see them a LOT too.

I have been trying to quit drinking for over 2 years now, and I rarely make it past a couple days. I did make it to 30 days once before and celebrated with a handful of xanax, and that lead to lots of booze and a 6 month daily binge. 

This time, for whatever reason, feels different. I'm no longer making promises to myself or rationalizing what I do. I quit this time because alcohol was killing me and was interfering with the way that I want to live my life. I can honestly say that I have no desire to ever drink again. I do go to bars on occasion, I want to see my friends. Luckily, they don't bust my balls too much about not drinking. A few friends don't like it, because they feel like my choice reflects on them. I make it clear that it is a personal choice and I do not care whatsoever if they continue to drink or not. This is not about anyone or anything but me. Alcohol has over the years made me embarrassed of who I have become. Now, I am ready to fight back and become someone that I can be proud of.

In my alcoholic days, I only concerned myself with the present moment and just kind of drifted through life. Now, for the first time in my life, I am extremely excited for the future. I don't really have any advice for those trying to get sober, as I am not sure exactly why it is working so well for me this time. All I can say is that it is a zen-like feeling this time. I'm just kind of at peace with the decision.

For some reason, my whole life I had plenty of inchoate ""reasons"" for not doing things. Though they were never truly articulated, these excuses were always along the lines of being ""tired"" or ""busy"". In reality, I think the real excuses were that I was either drinking, going to go drinking, or recovering from drinking. 

Now, I'm not talking about major life tasks, like trying to become an astronaut or learning computers. I'm talking the minor things in life. Going to the gym, mopping the floors, changing that burnt out light bulb, emailing an old friend, cooking food in the fridge before it goes bad, hitting on that hot guy who works in the same building. There were always excuses standing in my way that I thought were actually real. 

Since stopping drinking (only 50 days), I no longer have these excuses. I'm not tired (unless it's from the gym) and I'm not unreasonably busy (now that my nights and weekends aren't wasted getting wasted) - I just thought I was. I'm getting so much done that it's utterly astounding. And the best part is that these things aren't even ""work"" in the sense that I feel reluctance to do them. These are things necessary for a normal, happy life, and they are self reinforcing. I'm a grown ass man, and I'm *supposed* to have a clean floor, appropriate lighting in my place, etc. How I was so complacent in my irresponsibility is disgusting.

About 500 days ago I stopped drinking. This is, in many ways, utterly impossible because I'm an alcoholic. Along with the generous self-sabotaging, the drinking is sort of a big part of that title. Both of those are very big reasons why I should not be sitting at home, while my wife is at work for another 4 hours, sober as a church mouse. I should be through a 6 pack + maybe a glass of scotch at this point, which plenty of time left to drink another 4-5 beers and hide the evidence. She'll get home, I'll be showered and ""tired,"" I'll pass out and she'll swallow her fear and disappointment because if she talks to me about my very obvious problem I'll lash out and play dirty.

500 days ago we had a party, I got too drunk because I mis-judged my secret pre-party drinking (which of course USUALLY allows me to have a human-appropriate amount of alcohol in social settings). I made a scene, I yelled at my wife in front of my friends, kicked everyone out, ran out into the night and just walked around shitfaced for a few hours. I had been drunk every day for the previous 3.5 years, and before that I was just having the ole' college experience. My day-drinking had gotten to the point where the day was just getting in the way of my drinking. I'd drink while I wrote stuff for work (affectionately thinking of myself as some sort of Hemingway instead of the actual Lohan I had become), and in general I was in that slow decline where I was going to eventually lay everything I love, everything, one-at-a-time at the foot of the alter of Booze. I drank because I was nervous, I had a social anxiety, I was bored, I was restless, I liked the taste, it was harmless, it helped take my mind off things, I was lonely, I felt bad, I felt guilty.  I drank alone. 

500 days ago, my secret came out. Except many people knew or suspected, and I wasn't nearly as clever as I thought I was in hiding it. I decided to be honest with my wife for the first time about my drinking, so I lied to her and told her I had been drinking a 6-pack a night and I saw her become really scared. And then I became really scared because what if I had told her that it had been double that on weekdays and who knows on weekends. I went to AA the next night and cried at my first meeting while sitting in the back row, sweating like crazy. 

Sobriety seems/seemed like an impossible goal. But every day that you get from those dark, drunk, times things get clearer. I don't have social anxiety! Why did I think that? Why did I use that as an excuse? My level of general nervousness is about on par with the rest of this world, why did I think I had to get black out drunk to face the day? I was so fucking scared of getting sober, but as cliche as it sounds, I'm doing it one day at a time. I've accomplished things in the past 500 days that would have been impossible if I had been drinking. For folks that are still a little wet and thinking about quitting- you can too! Imagine not being ashamed anymore- it's possible!Yes, you'll save money and lose weight and you'll finally realize how shit Jay Leno when viewed in a clear light- but all those things are secondary to the freedom sobriety brings. Freedom from the smell and the taste, freedom from the worry and the isolation, but most of all freedom from the shame. There is no sweeter sound than that of opened shackles hitting the floor.

I have seen several people over the past year post their story when they hit a major milestone in their recovery (6 mos, a year, multiple years… ) so here is a bit of mine.  I personally am a bit older than the average redditor (late 30’s) and I was addicted to alcohol from my early 20’s and on.  I had a couple of failed sobriety attempts (ranging from a few weeks up to 9 months) in that time and it has taken a very serious lifestyle change for me to make it work for me now (so far).  I say so far as even though I’m sober for a year I know I still walk a pretty thin line and have to keep reminding myself of that.  As far as lifestyle changes go, it’s actually pretty simple in my opinion: I have basically done everything I can to isolate myself from the people and places that kept me drinking.  No bars, no more bar friends.  Changing those two things was quite difficult on me and I still honestly to this day miss the social aspect of drinking.  However, when I had failed sobriety attempts in the past I had initially started out very well with great intentions.  I marveled at how much better I felt, how much more money I had, etc… We all know what the benefits are.  Each time I eventually made the mistake after a period of feeling better to try to reintroduce alcohol to my life in a controlled manner.  At first I tried to go to the bar just to hang out and drink some water and socialize with my friends.  Then I had a drink or two and then after a while I spun back out of control.  I see a lot of people around /r/stopdrinking that seem to flirt with this line and I always have a lot of concern when I see posts around here saying something to the effect of “Hey everyone I went to the bar and didn’t drink!”.  Maybe I’m different, but I know that if started hanging around in bars again I would be right back to it before too much longer even if I had great intentions.  And let’s not forget about my bar friends too.  There are a lot of good people who I have completely lost contact with in the past year but I can’t risk my sobriety to let them back into my life.   I do miss some things, but I have spent the past year rebuilding my life and overall things are much better for me than they were a year ago.  For the past year, things have not been a picnic.  I went through some pretty tough times and struggled with some depression and alcohol / food cravings along the way.  I had several near-misses that I almost broke down and said “what the hell, it’s only one night”.  Despite some hardship that is to be expected I have managed to make some very good changes in my life to help combat the problems that I’ve seen over the past year.  I feel my health returning to where it should be and I’m able to exercise at levels I couldn’t dream of a while ago (although being smoke-free for 2 ½ years helps with that too).  At the end of my life with alcohol I know my health was starting to really take a turn for the worse and it’s amazing how the human body can rebound.  I really don’t think I would have made it much longer on the track that I was rolling down.  Whenever I get the compulsion to drink now I just sit around and think about how terrible I felt during my final days as a drinker and that so far has been enough to keep me sober.  So I keep going and take things ""a day at a time"" so the AA mantra goes (although I have never been to a single AA meeting in my life).  



Anyway I'm starting to ramble so I will say I wish everyone here the best of luck with their own personal journeys and thank you again for being there for me for a bit of a crutch to lean on in the harder times!  ",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,year1,True,t3_sud5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sud5g/i_made_it_a_year/,

I won't go into the minutiae of how my life has improved, but suffice it to say every single aspect has gotten better. Health? Check. Happiness? Check. Marriage? Check. Apartment cleanliness? Check. Fuckin social life? Even that gets a check.

It all gets me wondering about the larger implications of sobriety on people, society, and life as a whole. For me, it has really driven home the message that not all that meets the eye is what it seems. Friends who I used to think just liked having a good time I now realize are severe alcoholics. But even larger than that, I now walk past bar-filled streets where people are getting plastered and behaving horribly and I think ""How can they do that to themselves?"" often forgetting that I used to be that hollering blackout drunk person. But now it looks like a movie set -- the set they use when trying to show a seedy side of town that the main antagonist haunts. It looks downright *dark*.

Sometimes sobriety makes me think that I've been given a metaphoric red pill and have woken up to a larger battle going on in the world. It makes it seem like our personal fights are actually grander in scale -- they're downright *cosmic*. 

I don't mean to say that alcohol is bad for everyone, that it should be banned or anything, and I don't want to come across as a self-righteous jerk. I know plenty of people who enjoy booze in a healthy way. But there are just so many people who are killing themselves with it. And so many people who use it in an evil way to bring themselves to dark places. I know I did.

I know my life is without a doubt better due to not drinking.  But it's been hard.  I essentially gave up drinking to better my relationship with my boyfriend.  We broke up three weeks ago (for reasons that I blame entirely on my alcoholic mind and choices I made when our relationship started) and there was a hard minute where I thought being a drinker again was the only solution.  

But there was definitely an upside to the breakup because I was able to find the internal strength to keep going, that didn't involve other people or their approval of me.

I really wish I could tell him today that I just hit the six month mark, but we've agreed to keep our distance from each other for a couple of months and so I think communication like that would just be self-serving.

I went to an electronic music festival this weekend and on Sunday afternoon there was a Bill W. meetup. We all spoke openly about being part of a substance-fueled scene and finding the beauty beyond all of that.

Routine screening. He hasn’t looked good in a while. But he’s just getting older. Granted, he never took care of himself. 6 pack a day, 20 True Green. Bacon. He coughed at night. It kept me up as a child on the stairs. I always cried. Thought he was dying.

I made him pick me up to touch the ceiling. I wanted to be tall.  Like him.  Turns out, he really loved doing that. I wrote him birthday cards reflecting his encouragement. ‘You can do it, buddy’ made him cry.  As I got older,  I became embarrassed of him. He was unemployed a bit. Sometime came to soccer games drunk. But he showed up.

His father died at 53. Was his idol. Defining moment of his life. Still cries when speaking of him. That was 1965. He no longer planned. Lived for now. Not the best idea with a wife and 3 kids. I became angry at him. Wouldn’t stop drinking even though we all hated it. Like his father, he would never meet his grandchildren. So selfish. Told him how I felt. So angry. I cried. Nothing changed but I felt relief. Can’t change others. Only accept. I was 20 years old. Defining moment of my life.

Shortly thereafter, I met my wife. Started my career. Moved out. Saw dad less. 

My drinking problem surfaced.  Then fully submerged. I feared death.  Feared life. I found AA and noticed I looked like him. He made more sense. I am just like him. I love him. I forgive him. Truly forgive him. AA helped me do that. Now I see how much love he has to give.  He is so beautifully unique.  I admire that.  He’s taught me so much, good and bad. I love seeing him on Sundays. I love him so much. 

I move away. Far, far away. He comes to visit. He has lost weight. A lot of weight. He’s just getting older...

I come home to visit. Dad looks grey. Rest of family notices too. Mom finds blood stained underwear. Confronts Dad. He hates doctors. Killed his parents and want him dead too. Was pissing blood for months. Then not at all. Kidney’s failing. Succumbs to fear, sets up physical. Blood taken. Hour later - emergency room. Your father is very sick. Don’t go too far. I am the little boy on the stairs.

I feel nothing. I know it’s coming, but I can’t see it. I won’t see it. I’m so scared. I’m not ready for this. The seas are receding, I know it. I feel the water pull the back of my legs but I just can’t look to the horizon. It’s too much.

The first swell arrives but I have to go back home. To where I live now. To my life. And to my wife. I can ignore it so easily - to my peril. Try as I may, it’s coming.

I almost can't believe it. Really. It's been a trip. Truly. 14 years of binge drinking, and I've finally fucking stopped the bullshit.

 It was rough at first. Sitting in liquor store parking lots for what seemed like hours, debating if I should just buy some shooters, and see how well I could hide the boozie breath without getting caught. 

No more guilt. No more lies. No more days laying on the couch or in bed trying not to have panic attacks from the lack of potassium in my system. No more waking up with that sense of dread in the pit of my stomach. No more waking to being alone in the bed, knowing I did something horrible the night before, but not remembering anything. No more calling off of work because I'm still drunk in the morning, and want to continue drinking. No more horrible drunk photos of me circulating on Facebook. No more having to apologize for my actions that I don't remember. No more checking my phone in the morning and hoping I didn't call/text to anyone. No more mystery bruises all over my body. No more worrying how I'm going to buy more booze to alleviate a hangover that I couldn't afford. No more hiding shooters in random places in the house. No more trying to use booze to make me funny or likable. No more making excuses for not stopping. No more feeling like a piece of shit for lying to the people that care most about me.

I'm fucking awesome without that stupid bitch in my life, and I'm sad that it took this long to realize it. I used it as a social lubricant, and it got out of control. I didn't know how to stop it. 

There's a scene in Scrubs where one of the patients needs an organ transplant, but was a heroin addict. When he finally gets approved for one he says, "" Great! Let's celebrate! How do we celebrate without heroin??"" This is how I felt about booze. You're feeling shitty and had a bad day at work? Drink. You got a raise at work? Fuck yeah! Bust out those shot glasses. A 750ml should last a night, right? Fuck. We're out! Better get some more because I obviously haven't drank enough! 

Sorry, as this is turning into one of those rants. It just feels good to come here, and know that y'all will never judge, and that there is so much support here it is ridiculous. You all are beautiful.

I thought I would be able to control it and quickly failed.  The time before that was when I did some jail time for a DWI in 2007.  When I got out after 2 weeks exactly I went straight to the bar upon my release.  

Other than those two times I have been drunk ~at least~ every 3 days for the last ten or so years.  Now I look at how easy it was for me to abstain for this last week compared to the first and have nothing but desire to continue staying sober.  I finally feel like I can control the urge because I can easily keep reminding myself of the consequences and how dreadful they were, especially my last withdrawal.

When I first posted I mentioned feeling like I have to decide between sobriety and my social life.  After a few days I began to notice that I really don’t.  I just have realize that my social time can be spent sober.  I made a rule not to engage in any social events that surround alcohol.  This helped a lot because it leaves room to do so many things with my friends.  Just last night actually I found out that my best friend is now sober as well because him and his girlfriend are having a baby.  Amazing.

Moving into the future I’m looking forward to being sober for one month.  This is when I will announce my sobriety to the community by posting a picture of a one month coin.  We will see how they react.  I have a reputation for being a drunk and all so it’s sure to shock some people.  I have been making the steps toward being a key volunteer this year at both of our regional burn events.  I plan to commit at least 24 hours of time during the period of our 5 day event in may.  If that is not a promise of sobriety I don’t know what is.  I have a few months to practice not drinking.   Short term projects aside from school have been popping up like cleaning and trying to get my container garden back together.  My wife and I just adopted a conure too so now I get to spend some time training him which is usually very rewarding. 

I like life.  The urge to get twisted is still there, but I have been teaching myself tricks to try and control the urges. I think that without alcohol I can be a pretty productive person and a lot more fun to be around.

Thanks for the support guys.  This is the first thing that has actually helped me stay focused on staying sober.

Seeing that third digit on the badge creep up gave me a fantastic sense of satisfaction, but it wasn't easy.  I still have cravings, I won't lie, but all in all, I believe I am in a much better spot physically and mentally than I was 102 days ago.  So much better, that I feel compelled to make a check-in list of all the things that are at the top of my mind:

- I'm proud of myself.  I won't apologize for that.  I did something that was really difficult and I feel good about the accomplishment.

- I have lost weight.  A lot of it.  Since I stopped drinking, I have lost almost 30 pounds and I'm almost near my target weight again.  My blood pressure has dropped to well within normal levels and a recent panel of blood tests show a huge improvement in my overall health.

- I'm still a little bored on the weekends and in the evenings, and the cravings haven't all gone away (nor do I expect them to.)  However, it's getting easier and easier to deal with the urges, and most of the time I can just brush them aside.

- It has taken a long time, but I finally feel like I am able to attend social events and easily refuse a drink.  One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to remove myself from situations where drinking was involved altogether.  Admittedly, I did become a bit of a hermit for a while, but a sober hermit, and I'm getting better at being around other people now.

- My depression and axiety aren't going away any time soon, and they haven't magically disappeared since I stopped drinking.  The things that used to cripple me and make me drown myself out of reality with booze are however, getting clearer.  With the help of a therapist, I am making progress on identifying feelings, and working with them, instead of washing them out with alcohol.  It's a long road ahead, but at least I can see the lines on the pavement.

-  My friends, even the ones I drank the hardest with, have been surprisingly and remarkably supportive.  That was the biggest shock to me: not a single person I considered a ""friend"" dropped out of my life.  Granted, I don't have a lot of ""friends"" to begin with, but all the worry about losing those few folks has gone away now that everyone is aware of my choice to stay sober.

- Holy shit am I way more productive!  All that time when I was first getting sober where I was super bored, just itching for time to pass - that has turned in to extremely productive time for me.  As the obsession with alcohol subsided, my fixation on ""not drinking"" has also lessened, and I feel the need less to get through the time, and more to fill it.  To fill it with things I enjoy doing, rather than simply watching the clock go by.  It has made me more productive at work, and at home.  My house is cleaner, my shit is more organized, and I have more products of my hobbies to show.

- Warning, gross:  I don't smell bad anymore and I don't sweat profusely.  I'm convinced this was the booze.  No matter how many times I showered, I would always find myself pouring sweat all over the place.  Add to that, I feel like a malodorous cloud was surrounding me.  I could smell *myself.* (See, I told you it was gross.)  Now that the alcohol is out of my system, the stench is gone.  The foul smell that often accompanied a day of sweating isn't there.

- I have saved a ridiculous amount of money.  A few weeks into my sobriety I did a check on how much money I was actually spending on alcohol, and it made my stomach turn.  In the nearly three months I have been sober, I have found that it's a LOT easier to hold on to money.  Not only am I not spending $500 a month on liquor, I'm also not spending god-knows-how-much on Amazon while drunk.

- Overall, the impact of my sobriety on my life has been incredible.  The first parts were tough.  It sucked for a while, but after plodding through and staying strong, I have found that the effort is well worth it.

- Even though technically this is just a group of internet strangers, r/stopdrinking was and continues to be a critical part of my sobriety.  Having a support group that I could access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is amazing.  In addition, the people here have been tremendous, and I have experienced only kindness, support, and camaraderie.  Watching the membership tick over 4,000 feels great.  That means that another one thousand people have decided to make the step to stop drinking, and they can reap the benefits of an amazing, supportive and effective community.

I'm working on 90 days minus hooch.  I've been tested over the weeks, from family stress to woman problems, and my job. 
Been able to fend off the demons so far, so good.  

A bit of a side story-- I live in a trailer park currently.  It's in small-town USA, with the cliche 20-year old trucks in the driveway...mohawked youngin's and cigarettes, everywhere and in the air. 

Wouldn't you know it, 500 feet away from the trailer park entrance is not one, but two liquor stores.  That, and a hair salon and couple of sub-par pizza places that complete the set of the local ""businesses.""
Can't say I blame the store owners, they're simply profiting off from demand.  It's legal and people want it. :/ 

I read somewhere the other day about the smattering of controlled substances we have here in Western Earth, whether it be Poppy-based, Cannabis, Alcohol...it's dumb luck that some are legal and some are not.  Boggles the mind sometimes, can't help but think of the discussion about the lengths we go to ""protect ourselves and society from the dangers of _____.""

So back to the original story, I'm walking my dog and at that moment sitting with him in a grassy bit of shade, playing belly scratch and enjoying the nice Summer Day.  A thin, gaunt woman walks by me, clearly having trouble with her balance...she was about 50 with her blonde hair up, and had that stare that inebriated people sometimes get when they are fixated.  I knew immediately where she was headed, and watched her stop and settle her balance a couple of times before she reached the door of the liquor store.  

When I was still drinking I had gotten to know the nice young middle eastern couple that owns the store, I gave them good business.   I haven't been in there since I stopped drinking, and feared at that moment they might sell to this woman who could hardly stand.  After a few moments, I watched her come out of the store with a rather large bag, looked about the size of two 12-packs of beer.  I cringed, as selling to a clearly inebriated person can result in heavy fines and a loss of their liquor selling license.  Apparently, that sort of problem was ignored.  Any normal person would have noticed this woman...was schnockered.  Wasted.  Tanked.  

I continued walking and watching, and sighed to myself what addiction does and how easy it is to fill that need when you live so close to a seller.  That's me, I thought, before I wised up. 

Sure enough, on the walk back to her trailer a rather steep hill has to be ascended, and I watched back from 250 feet or so her lose her balance and do a drunken, sloppy roll in only the way a severe drunk person can.  Just at that moment, an older couple was driving by and stopped to assist her up and they helped her back to the door of her trailer.   It was just sad.

They both told me so.  It is all because I have quit drinking.  I had no idea I was having negative effects on anybodys lives.  The world was out to get me (not them) my life was sooo hard (not theirs) work was too stressful (they don't understand).  These are the thoughts that used to go on in my head.  Life was hard and unmanageable but it was because I was an alcoholic.  Plain and simple.  I stopped drinking and life is starting to become easier.  And life is getting way better for them.  Last summer break, my son never had friends over and he never did anything.  It was terrible.  He didn't hang out with anybody all summer.  This summer he has had friends over EVERY day. He has had kids sleep over and he has slept over at friends houses.  Nothing has changed in his life other than the fact that his Dad has stopped drinking.  He is the happiest he has ever been.  I had no idea that me drinking was so bad for him.  I only thought about me and the negative effects it had on me.  I didn't drink around him before (that much).  I only drank at night and I wouldn't come home until I thought the kids were in bed (little twerps messed up my drinking).  Turns out the problem was me.  I was lazy and shitty hung over during the day and could not wait until the night when I could drink (if I waited to start drinking at night I would be a normal person).  Being an alcoholic was an around the clock job.  If I wasn't drinking, I was recovering and or thinking about drinking.  I was only thinking about myself.  Self-centered asshole is what I had become.  Didn't know it.  Thought I was a nice guy, a cool dad.  Nothing could have been further than the truth.

Last night I decided to have a wii smash bros. tournament for my kids and their friends.  I set chairs up in the garage.  Sold my xbox and bought a used wii.  Hooked it up to a tv in the garage.  By 7 oclock all my kids friends were hanging out, having fun, and smiling.  My daughter had the biggest smile on her face and gave me a huge hug.  My son was having a blast too.  I just let the kids have fun.  I didn't even play.  I let the kids stay over late and just enjoy life.

This is the sort of thing I can do now.  

I wasn't angry because it was drinking time.  I wasn't pissed at the world because life sucked.  I wasn't having a pity party because something wasn't going my way.  Just clean wholesome fun.  And having a drink never crossed my mind.

This is how life can and should be.  Happy, joyous, and free.  

This subreddit helped me.  It slapped me in the face and said ""dude you have a problem.""  But that was not enough to get me to stop.  139 days ago I went to a meeting.  I haven't had a drink since.  I go to many meetings and use this sub.  That's it.  And it is working for me.

Life isn't perfect.  My wife and I have issues.  I am in debt.  Really short on money.  But I am dealing with these things now.  Not running away anymore...And life could not get any better.

But that is enough about me.

Then I decided to try moderation again. This strategy has always been hit or miss for me and in the last 2 months of drinking, I drank more than I intended every weekend. I’m lucky no real consequences have resulted other than feeling ashamed that I am once again back at square one with the inescapable conclusion that I can’t control my drinking. 

There were nights of biking home drunk and falling over, a few instances of driving drunk, 3 benders, avoiding my parents phone calls because I was too drunk to talk, slacking on gym attendance, becoming less productive on the weekends, and calling in sick to work. And for what? A lot of my drinking was done alone in my apartment, watching Netflix and periodically passing out. It’s hard to feel proud of yourself when you waste an entire weekend drunk and don’t feel normal for 2 or more days. So I’m done with drinking again. I know I can stay sober since it was fairly easy last time. I think I need to try to find some sober friends though. All of my friends here not only drink, but drinking is the main event.

I am a 22 year old single female and I've really had it up to here (i'm holding my my hand above my shoulder) with these guys. I seem to have a cluster of guys who are giving me inappropriate/unrequested attention. This ranges from guys who have 0 days to 25 years sober, with a range of ages. 

I have two starers, guys who won't stop staring at me, (and I am talking about serious no breaks in concentration) sometimes even during a meeting. Then I have several guys who seemed to be my friends, until they invited me to 2 a.m private movie showings at their houses. Then I have the 30 something year old dude, who has 4-6 years sober who befriended me but is now getting a little handsy. (extra hugs, hands on my thigh type of stuff). 

I have a guy who I had a very short ""recovery relationship"" with, who only recently stopped begging me for sex and blocking my car door so I couldn't leave. Then I have random guys who will ignore everyone else to give me extra attention when I am literally doing nothing to deserve special attention. 

This stuff happens in real life too, but its especially irritating when all of these guys are warned about 13 stepping and stuff and they are making me feel too uncomfortable/ unsafe to go to meetings. My work schedule makes it hard to hit up the women's meetings and I dislike the idea of feeling like I have to run and hide away from all co-ed meetings. Also, this is making me paranoid about befriending other males. 

I'm normally very reserved and polite, but if on one more guy stares at me in the meeting, I'm going to tell him off then and there.

It also made me laugh at myself for how foolish my inner drunk's arguments can be.

Like all of us that have got some sober time, I will from time to time entertain the notion that I'm now okay to have a drink or two.  The argument begins by recognizing how good I've been doing staying sober and getting healthy.  Sometimes there is an element of how I now deserve a drink for all that I've done.

Sounds reasonable.  Hmm, okay maybe I should.  

Since getting sober I try to be more aware of what I'm thinking and doing.  Being more mindful as some like to say.  So I asked myself, even if all that were true, why would I want that drink.  The usual reasons bubble up from my inner drunk: it would help me relax, to forget about the many minor life BS things, because I'm a little bored of thinking about things all the time, let me crawl into that comfortable cocoon of obliviousness.  

Ah ha!  There's the rub.  There's where my inner addict's argument falls apart.  There is the lie laid bare.  I could pick up a drink or two, it would satisfy all those desires but only temporarily. The repercussions would be that later I'd feel more of the same need to relax, to forget about BS, to crawl into the cocoon. This would require yet more drinking to assuage.  Having brought that temporary pleasure it could not help but reignite the habit.  The downward spiral would commence yet again. 


What I realized is that first drink is taken for reasons that will only become magnified after that first drink.  The feedback loop was made visible to me.  After I saw it, I had to laugh at just how foolish I am to entertain the notion that it would ever be possible or a good idea to have ""just one or two"" drinks.

This is probably obvious stuff to a lot of you and I'm probably not expressing it well, but I saw this reality all layed out in my head in such a flash that it really struck me and wanted to share it.

I walk up to the check out and I see one of the employees walking towards me, getting ready to approve my restricted purchase.  I held up my bag of chips and told him that that was all I was purchasing today.  He stopped and kind of stuttered an ""Oh...uh, have a good Sunday.""  I felt a bucket of icy cold shame being dumped on my head.  I gave the employee my thanks and told him to have a good Sunday too.  It was a good reminder of why I want to quit drinking.

I mean, I'm 10 days short of a year and half sober and quitting drinking was always easy for me; i went 533 days without AA, without much of wanting to drink, without any help really.

I actually really honest to God did it. And ya know what? It was even as painful as I thought it was gonna be! 

For those of you that dont know, I probably attempted this close to 6 times from late August to the end of October. My record up until now had been 12 days. 

I know theres some conflicting opinons about AA, but I can honestly say AA is 100% what made the difference this time for me. I started going to meetings in my hometown (despite the running into someone I know worry) and found myself feeling way more at home, and comfortable. These were the people I had grown up with, and they were having the exact same problem I was having. I didn't have to feel like a loser or a freak because I cant, for the life of me, drink in moderation. 

I also made a group of friends my age in AA pretty quickly, got a sponsor, and have been allowing myself to be carted around to whatever meeting or AA event they think is a good idea. I've been so busy the past 30 days, I haven't even had time to think about a drink. I've met people in meetings all over the Boston area, as well as a group I see almost every night in my hometown meetings. 

Pretty much the point I wanna make, is if you're having trouble putting more than a few days together on your own, give AA a shot. Even if you go and just sit there and think about how bullshit it is the whole time, its still an hour you are sober, and its an opportunity to make some new friends who are also sober and go do some fun sober stuff with.  

All of this being said, I would not be anywhere near here without you guys. There is truly incredible, kind, patient group of people who have all managed to show up to the same place and I love all of you. I can't express how grateful I am that the people in here were able to explain to me (ever so gently) that yes, my drinking was out of control, and yes I needed to stop. I may have figured it out eventually on my own, but you guys saved me from so many extra years of misery. So thank you, all of you, I wanna like kiss you or some shit =P

It's been two nights and three of them dropped out, mostly because of the catastrophe-manufacturing plant that our office became last night. They came up to me at the end of the shift and said ""QS, we're going to [bar] after we finish up.""

I wasn't really *that* surprised. I didn't even look at them as I responded but I thought I kept it lighthearted. ""Already, huh?"" 

""Yeah, dude. After tonight, nothing sounds better than a cold beer. You're welcome to join us."" 

""Thanks guys, I'll think about it. 

And I really, *really* thought about it. A lot. Hard. 

And I decided that goddamit, I've run around this circle too many times. No, I can't just have one. If I could just have one, I wouldn't need to have this argument with myself over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. 

It was just bizarre. Like I could divine exactly what would happen. It's the same thing that happens every time I drink. I attempt to moderate, mosey on past the second one, sneak past the third, and then the fourth catches me and it's off to the races and I'm drinking like it's my other job. 

The problem is that one is too many and a dozen isn't enough. *(DISCLAIMER: Not mine but it really hits the nail on the head, don't it?)*

I didn't drink. And I'm not going to. They can have all the drinks they want. They can even pour some out for me. 

But it's kind of like spaceflight. We, all of us here, are launching away from our need to drink. Think of something lifting off. Unfortunately, most accidents happen just after liftoff, and so we crash. We try to moderate or just go All Out, because it's The Last Time. We fall back to earth and try and try again, tweaking things here and there, making adjustments, experimenting, testing, until we're ready for another serious liftoff again. 

Thing is, once we gain enough momentum and we get further and further out, we become a littler safer until that point where we're able to just orbit. That point where we never have to touch ground again.

The first time we cross the line - be it puke, piss, handcuffs or more - we are horrified, and resolve to not do it again.   

But soon our built in forgetter - our mastery of  rationalization and justification steps in and we (I know I am not alone in this) begin to swing back to our old habits.  And from hearing thousands of stories I can tell you that it gets worse.

I have seen people die from this disease in car wrecks, from liver failure, from suicide.   I take AA into prisons where one night of drunken stupidity has put people behind razor wire for years if not the rest of their lives.

My point is any bottom can have a sub basement.  If you are here there is probably a good reason to quit.  And stay quit.  How you do that is up to you.

You wake up everyday and beat alcohol's ass. For how many days in a row without one defeat? 

Think about that.. Lots of people talk about it say they want to do it. But you're out there fucking doing it!!! 

Don't forget it!! There are millions of people out there that would trade your sober life for theirs. 

And now that we are sober what do we complain about? Being a little bored or have a little more anixtey. But I'll take those ""problems"" over all the real fucking problems I had while drinking. 

I want you all to know just how special you are for getting up everyday and battling, despite all the reasons you can find to drink you DON'T. 

My hats off to you and I am proud to have you all on the team. I'd pick every single one of you over all those drinkers out there that can't face life without the crutch of alcohol. 

And don't get me wrong I love all the posts and I fell the same way but this is to remind myself and all of you when you think about your problems sober just think  how badass you are everyday for beating alcohol.

We were at 5,000 such a short time ago that 6,000 blew by without me even noticing.  And here we are at 7,000.  Wow.

Badgebot's badge number represents the total of all of our badges.  Last time we did this, badgebot had 1,146,144 days. Today, the little feller' has 1,592,174 days. That means badgebot has added 446,030 sober days in these last couple of months.  That's 446,030 hangovers foregone, 446,030 regrets not had, 446,030 bad decisions averted, and 446,030 * $(god only knows how many) dollars saved.  A conservative estimate might put that number at around $5,000,000.  Way to go, badgebot.  You rock.

When I first started coming here, we had just over 1,000 subscribers.  It's been kinda neat for me to look back at the old milestone posts &amp; see my own comments. It's a strange feeling, really. I remember writing the words, of course, but in some ways it seems like they were written by a completely different person.  Time changes things.  Sobriety changes things.

I thought it would be kind of fun for everyone to leave a message for their future self on this post.  No format really, just anything you'd like to say.  You know, how's it going?  What are your struggles? What little triumphs have you had, and what did they mean to you?  Who are you spending your time with?  What are you worried about?  What's your general outlook like?  What changes are you hoping to make? What are you having for dinner tonight?  Whatever.

I'll link back to this post sometime in the future. When you read your comment back, you'll be amazed at how much you've changed.  You'll be reminded of how far you've come. And, who knows, you may not even recognize the person who wrote it.

Thanks, to everyone, for making /r/stopdrinking such a special place. You guys are the best.

(Sorry about that.)",FantasyDoll,54,5,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16uwl6/i_have_ruined_my_life_i_am_lonely_miserable_and/,"Hello, everyone! First, I just want to say that I am sorry because this is going to be disgustingly long, but I definitely appreciate anybody who actually takes the time to read all of it. Second, if this is not the correct subreddit to vent in, I apologize for that as well. Please let me know if I need to move this to somewhere else and I will do so, but right now I could really use some help, =’(.

I have avoided posting anything about this aspect of my life mainly because I have seen how most people on Reddit seem to treat people who are going through what I am currently experiencing. I already hate myself enough as it is, and the thought of a bunch of people chiming in just to tell me what a stupid, worthless and horrible person I am (and apparently also that I deserve to die) is something that I do not need. However, I really need a safe place with people who understand and who will not judge me, think less of me, or hate me because of my past, and I am hoping this will turn out to be what is quite possibly the only safe place to actually open up… 

I hate myself right now. Currently on probation for a second DUI that I received in 2010. After my first DUI, I was 100% sure that I did not have a problem with alcohol, but that I did have some super shitty luck. However, I was required to regularly attend AA meetings as a term of my probation, so I started going to those several times a week. I genuinely took an interest in the program and the wonderful people I met along the way, but once I was off probation I started drinking again and stopped going. I saw no problem with this at the time and continued to go out every weekend, get drunk beyond all hope, and loved every minute of it. 

It is several years later now and I have been on probation for the second DUI for just short of a year. I did not drink during any of that time, but did not go to AA either. For a long time, I thought I was doing just fine. In retrospect, I probably should have been back on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications during this time, but I was in denial and wanted with all my heart to believe that I did not have a problem with alcohol, despite some very real and very obvious signs. I had become a master at denial at this point. 

Then came one random night in October. I still have no idea what happened inside my brain. I knew I was not supposed to be drinking, I knew the kind of trouble I would face if I got caught, but I did it anyway. I do not recall how I ended up justifying to myself that this would be okay, but I know that the committee in my head had a drinking justification meeting and I decided to find their reasoning acceptable. The beginning of the night was great and I had a lot of fun. However, once my ""friend"" dropped me off at my house my entire world crashed down upon me. Before I went inside, I decided to smoke a cigarette but I wanted to listen to the radio in my vehicle because it was a little bit less cold in there than it was outside (how is that for a ridiculous justification? :/.) So I did. 

There was no actual driving involved, just me sitting with the radio on and the smoking of a cigarette. Halfway through said cigarette my vehicle is swarmed by about six cops (all on foot) who all seemingly appeared out of nowhere. (Their reason for being there in the first place is an entirely different chestnut, but one that does not technically matter.) Needless to say, the fact that I had been drinking and my keys were in the ignition outweighed the fact that I had not been driving, nor did I intend to, and the fact that my house was about ten feet away. I was arrested that night and charged with another DUI.

And this basically brings me to today, and every single day of my life for the past three months. I am absolutely destroyed. I am seriously dying inside. Every morning I wake up and as soon as I remember what is going on it just breaks my heart all over again. I know that I deserved the first two DUIs. I was being reckless and irresponsible and an all-around selfish, stupid idiot. I know this. But for anybody out there who has struggled with any kind of addiction, you know how powerful addiction plus denial can be. And even though I was not driving that night in October, when it comes down to it I know that I deserve that DUI too. Regardless of what I did not do, the fact of the matter is that, at the very least, I was still drinking when I am on probation and I should fucking know better than that by now. I am very lucky, and very grateful, that I never hurt or killed anybody because of my selfishness and irresponsibility. But that is not making it any easier for me to forgive myself for any of this.

It absolutely KILLS me that I am in this situation again. I keep thinking of all kinds of should haves, would haves, could haves... I know deep down that I do not really want to die, but sometimes I find myself wishing that I would. I am so tired of disappointing my family. I am so tired of being the bad child in the family, the one who continually does the stupidest shit imaginable to fuck up her life. It is bad enough what all of this is doing to me now and how it will affect my life in the future, but it feels far worse knowing how much I have let my family down. Again. 

I have not been sentenced for what happened in October yet, but I cannot think of a word that exists in the English language to accurately describe the level of absolute terror that I feel inside. I am facing a lot of jail time, which is the source of about 97% of this terror. I know that I am not a bad person. I am actually a very good person. A very lost person, yes, but not a bad one. But I am not strong enough for this. I sat in jail for a week after I got arrested and believe me, that was more than enough time in that shithole to know that that is a place I never want to see the inside of again. I may feel like I am destroyed now, but jail time is going to fucking obliterate me. I have so many emotions and have always struggled with the fact that I feel them all so deeply. Sometimes I fear that I feel everything far *too* deeply, if that is a thing that is possible.  Being thrown in jail to be forgotten about is not going to help me. Sitting around all day, every fucking day, doing nothing but reading shitty romance novels and watching television and walking around in fucking circles is exactly what I do not need, especially not now when I have finally stopped living in Denialville and have officially moved to Acceptancetown. 

*Sidenote: Why is it that people who donate books to jails think that all chicks in jail want to read are romance novels? Seriously. Aside from the fact that I hate them, giving chicks books like that when they are already lonely and depressed is just fucking mean. If you ever donate books to a jail, donate ANYTHING but romance novels. Trust me, they have enough of those already!*

Sitting in jail for that week did give me plenty of time to reflect though. I realized in there that I could not ignore it anymore. I have a problem with alcohol. A huge fucking problem, and as much as I never wanted to admit it to myself before, I can now. 

I am an alcoholic and I fucking need help.

I would remiss to not include something good in this post though, as so far I feel like it is nothing more than a long-winded “Woe is me” rant. My probation officer knows about all of this; I let her know the day I got out of jail and she is not only not violating me for this, but she is helping me pay for anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medications and helping me find a counselor I can speak to. I must say, it is seriously wonderful having a probation officer who does not just want to lock you up and throw away the key when you fuck up and need help. She genuinely cares about me and all she wants to do is help me, and I am incredibly grateful to have her in my life right now. I still attend my alcohol class that I have been in since August, and the counselor there also let me into her relapse prevention class, which I am currently attending simply because I want to be there. I am also going to start attending AA again in the morning. Being able to go there and finally being able to be honest with myself and with everybody else is something I am quite looking forward to. I also enrolled in college and start classes on Tuesday, which I am ecstatic about. 

One wonderful thing that came out of all of this is sobriety, which I will take however I can get at this point. The condition of me getting out of jail on bond was that I have to wear an alcohol monitor on my ankle until I get sentenced. Regardless of how much I hate this thing (it is ridiculous-looking and disgustingly expensive), it has given me 98 days of sobriety so far. Even though I still get annoyed at times that the courts do not trust that I can not drink without the help of their fancy contraption, I understand why they do not trust me. I do not deserve their trust right now, but I hope to God they let me earn it.

I am doing everything I can to start putting the pieces of my heart, and my life, back together again. I hate that I did not take any of this seriously before, but I fucking pray that the judge will see how serious I am taking this now and how hard I am working to ensure that I never have to drink again. Going to jail is just going to cause me to lose everything. Looking back, maybe jail would have been the wake-up call I needed when I was in trouble before, but that one single week in jail this time was all the wake-up I needed. 

I just… I do not know. This is the longest fucking post ever and I doubt anybody gives a bag of butts about anything I have to say. I wrote this mostly for therapeutic reasons as I do not have an outlet for my emotions at this point. I am dying inside and I guess I just needed to let all of this shit out, even if nobody cares. And yes, I already know what a horrible, worthless person I am so I really hope nobody here has the urge to beat that quite dead horse. I already know, but thank you for your concern,  :/.

I guess I am just tired. Tired of being a failure - in my eyes, my parents’ eyes, and society’s eyes. Tired of getting myself in this situation. Tired of living life in such constant fear and shame and absolute fucking misery. Tired of drinking. I am fucking sick of all of it. I am simultaneously too young and too old to still be living like this.

I am also very sorry to anybody who actually read through this whole post. I know it is way too fucking long but like I said before, I really have no other outlet at this moment and all of this woeful rambling is just a mess of emotions that I cannot hold in anymore. Thank you to anybody who actually reads this though. I know I fucked up, but I am exhausting every resource I have available to ensure that I do not have to live like this anymore. I am definitely in the midst of the rockiest bottom right now, and I need to get the hell out.

I am trying to not have a complete emotional meltdown, which I suppose is why I posted this here. I do not really know anybody out here yet so I do not have anybody to talk to, so I hope it is okay that I posted this novel of lameness here, =(. I am just a very tormented girl right now, and I do not know where else to turn. Thank you very much for listening and letting me get this off my chest though, it means a lot to me. I hope you are all having a great night, =).





**TL;DR** I am a fucking idiot. Do not be like me.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to thank everyone here for all of the kind words and advice and support. This is a seriously wonderful place with wonderful people and I am very glad I found it. Thank you for letting me get all of this off my chest, and for not judging me for it. I really appreciate everything you have done for me already, and I just want you all to know that. Thank you for the support, and thank you for welcoming me into the community. It really means a lot to me, &lt;3.

Also, according to my badge I have 86 days, not 98. Apparently I suck at counting, lol.

I spoke simply and briefly about how much happier I was, how much better I felt, and that was it...

And while I certainly didn't inspire abstinence, it did seem like most everyone dialed it back a bit on the boozing. Everyone started drinking later in the day than normal, drank a little less, focused mainly on beer instead of the hard stuff...

Part of this was due to the absence of my Brother-in-law who is the chief instigator when it comes to excessive drinking, the one always pushing for everyone else to push their limits. Part was, I think, due to my quiet example. 

Whatever the reason, the most amazing thing happened: nothing. No fights. No drama. Everyone was beside themselves on the last day talking about how this had been the most peaceful and relaxing family gathering ever. Many speculated about what could have caused such happiness. I stayed quiet. 

I stayed quiet and thought about the half a dozen times, at most, during those three days when I had wistfully imagined how much more relaxing it would have been to be floating on the lake or driving in the boat with a drink in my hand. I had missed drinking for the first time in weeks...and then was gifted with a little bit of perspective to realize I hadn't missed it at all, and that true, calm happiness is earned and not imbibed.

I've been lurking on this sub for a few months but finally decided to post to celebrate triple digits. I really love how much my life has changed in the past few months.

 I've been drinking since I was 15. Loved the way it made me feel and ""forget"" about life's problems. I just turned 29 in June, and the last few years were getting out of control. Between my divorce, losing my job, and other stresses in life I was using more and more and also abusing Adderall. I quit Adderall over a year ago and that was much easier to quit (for me anyways) than alcohol. But alcohol is everywhere so that was much harder. 

So over the past year my boyfriend was pretty much ready to throw in the towel with the way I was drinking and every attempt to ""quit"" or ""limit myself"" ended up in failure. Then in March I drank several more times and with the threat of losing my SO, I decided to try an AA meeting. I think this is where divine intervention comes in, because the meeting I chose was a Big Book Meeting, not just any hole-in-the way open discussion meeting. Nothing against those types of meetings, as I go to those now as well, but for me it was important to see the solution, and people actively working the 12 steps. I also met my sponsor there. I started going to other meetings and working on Step 1. I made it 3 weeks then gave in one day and had some vodka. The next day I was crying like a little baby. I felt so wrong. I think my resistance to God and that he ""gets all the credit"" is something I resented so I just drank. But I learned from that mistake and haven't had a drink since then (101 days ago)! I realized after that, everyone has their own conception of God and as long as I make effort to pray and have him in my life I'll be ok. I'm so relieved that I'm not ""running the entire show"" now! 

Now I'm on Step 4. AA is life changing. I actually enjoy getting up and looking forward to things. I don't even crave alcohol anymore. My depression that I've battled since a teen has pretty much vanished. I'm learning more about myself and how to ""live on life's terms"". My relationships are richer, more honest and fulfilling than they've ever been. I can't wait to go on vacation next month and go to some meetings in a different state (New mexico and Colorado) and to have my Mom give me a 4 month chip. And most of all I feel like I have a life now...my life before was less than ideal and I wasn't capable of appreciating all the great things about it. 

For anyone new, if my last paragraph didn't convince you of all the benefits of quitting booze and of the AA program I hope you will keep trying. Each day that you don't drink makes it easier to get through the next. Go to meetings, get a sponsor. Some of the steps are painful, but as my sponsor says, ""You worked harder to get alcohol so you can work hard on these steps"".  Thanks again for all the advice in this sub, hope you all have a great Friday! ",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month4,True,t3_1imock,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1imock/100_days_today/,

Apparently, my heavy drinking (1/3 of 1.75 bottle of Evan Williams a night for the past year) has given me terrible acid reflux. It was so bad that the acid shot up into the esophagus and blocked my airway. I immediately got up out of my bed and began pacing - trying to catch my breath. After about 20 seconds I knew I was going to die. I live alone.

At around what seemed like an eternity, (but was only about a minute) I was able to take shallow breaths again. It took another hour and a half to be able to breath deeply. Twelve hours later and my throat is still sore.

Over the past year I've gained 40lbs and lost contact with many close friends. I moved away to a state where I know only a handful of people and now those people have moved away after getting new jobs. I try to blame my ex that cheated on me, a job that I hated, and family members who are slowly dying - but I have no one to blame but myself.

This group is phenomenal. When I need a moment at work, at home, on the bus, I'll pull up a top post on my phone and it does wonders. You guys are the tits, you really are.

While washing the dishes this morning (already I'm out of bed at 9 on a Saturday, doing dishes, 3 loads of laundry done, pot of my damn good [borscht](http://i.imgur.com/gBgknXB.png) already stewing on the stove - is this the real life?), I was thinking about cravings. And how I kind of wanted to start drinking right then, and how quitting drinking at 22 might alienate me, and how I'd probably never have fun, andandand.

Then I realized, it was my drinking that was ostracizing me from everyone else. Normal people don't take 10 shots before going out and then have 8 more drinks. Normal people don't black out 80% of the time they drink. Normal people can have one drink without needing at least 12 more. Normal people will have a few drinks to help them socialize, to relax, or because they actually like the taste (I never have).

And I don't need alcohol for any of those reasons. I'm realizing I'm already outgoing, I've got a sense of humor, and I love to be social. Me drinking alcohol is not worth the inescapable damage it will undoubtedly cause. By quitting drinking, I'm not giving up something that normal people get to enjoy. Rather, I'm including myself with normal people, people who don't depend on alcohol, people who don't let it control them.

Thanks for reading. If any of you are in Seattle, come over for some borscht.

I'm a little ashamed, but I think that relating my tale might help someone in the same boat, and compared to that, my shame is nothing.  

I had a guest for the weekend, and I bought a modest amount of booze (2 beers and a 6-oz bottle). I stayed sober the entire weekend, and I reminded her that when she went home, she had to take the single ounce of booze that was left with her. She forgot.  

After I dropped her off, I came back home, and there it was. I've been craving like mad, and I figured, ""Fuck it. It's just one drink."" and I downed it.  

I know. I should know better, right?  

Well, Holy Shit! Did I ever get a rapid, full force re-introduction to the power alcohol has over my alcoholic mind. 15 minutes later, seemingly in a daze, I was getting out of my car and walking into the liquor store. One fucking drink...ONE...and I was determined to get more. I got within 10 feet of the door and now it was my SOBER voice in the back of my mind, and it was saying ""What the fuck makes you think that THIS is a good idea?""    

I stopped in my tracks and looked in the window at all the people shopping away, and that's when I knew that I could never, ever be one of them again. I know now the power that miserable fucking molecule has. When I was drinking, I couldn't fight it off, and after over a month of sobriety, I almost let it sink its claws into me again. So I got back in the car and drove home.  

I was strong, I was confident, I was thinking with a clear head, I was making tremendous progress, and every aspect of my life was coming together beyond my wildest expectations. And one lousy drink had me ready to toss it all away.  

So, you guys here that are new to sobriety, and struggling with it, PLEASE stay strong enough to keep away from that first drink. I'm telling you, it's a lot more powerful than you think it is.  

Maybe it took this slip to realize what I couldn't in my alcohol-sodden days, that this is a devious thing that will take all you have, while convincing you that you didn't want it anyway.  

For 36 days I thought I was done with booze. Now there's no question. I **know** I'm done. If one lousy shot can do that to me then I can't ever go near the stuff again.

I have been in a spectacularly awful mood lately, and as I run through my list of little ways to cope with life, I catch myself remembering that there's a whole other option that's not tired, and I had arbitrarily tossed it off the list (wtf right?). 

Last night, some friends were hanging out at the bar down the street, which has awesome fries, and that's good enough for me. I joined them, with my fizzy water and fries, not feeling weird at all because I've done this for about 2 years, collectively. One of my homies laughed at what I ordered, and I immediately poofed up like an irritated bird. I reminded him that I could drink him AND his drunk alter ego under the table one after the other, the point being that I just didn't *want* to because I'm fabulous and I have fizzy water. The fucked up part is that I REALLY wanted to prove it to him, just to be right, just to be awesome, just because I was two hours away from 150 days and it would be delightful to hold myself to a mediocre standard for once in my life.

I write out self-posts and delete them for fear of what I’d discovered about myself or fear of perhaps being boring/self-indulgent. I adamantly didn’t want to write out how I felt in some sort of journal, but ultimately managed to by pretended I was talking to each and every single one of you each time. Yep, I’ve had dozens and dozens of conversations with you that you don’t even know about. I’d post some self-posts and have my lies and excuses upturned, attitudes straightened, struggles supported and empathised with, and would ultimately leave with clear, bright eyes, brimming with pride at my sobriety, looking to the new future. Because we’re all the same. I came here lost and, although still am pretty lost, I know I’m on the right track. To offer you all my thanks for your stories, advice and time would be a frankly pathetic offering in exchange for what you have all done for me. 



I suppose most experience a sudden drop in strength and hope later on, as I have lately. The pride of strength and elation at the dissipation of the negative side effects, at some point, has to give in and become swamped by the monster of a problem that caused the drinking in the first place. I’m now faced with that same familiar feeling that many years ago I tried to feed with self-injury and suicide attempts and have consistently tried to treat with alcohol. We all have to face it and stop running; else revert back to the drink or some other ultimately harmful ‘treatment’ method. 



Things can change and, when I’m here, I feel that they will. Right now I can finally *see* myself for the first time, and I’m scared. I’m terrified, constantly. I’m nervous, I’m jumpy, I’m miserable, I’m terrified a relapse will knock me down forever this time, I’m confused, I’m vulnerable, I’m hopeless for the future and I’m kicking myself for the past, I’m an arse to live with and I’m pretty self-absorbed in a situation I don’t even understand. But I’m not drunk. Bloody hell, I’m glad I’m not drunk. And for the first time, I’ll actually sign off a post with my name. No internet guise written whilst pleading for help. 


No one ever wished they’d spent more time drunk. Don’t contemplate labels (*Binge drinker? Alcohol connoisseur? Alcoholic? Heavy drinker?*) or formulate more excuses. If there’s concern, act. Eradicate it. Give yourself a fighting chance to reach even a fraction of your potential. And most importantly, keep fighting. Keep marching on with us.

I quit a few months ago for about seven days. I felt great, I felt healthy for the first time in a few years. Then, one night I couldn't fall asleep, it was around one in the morning and I had to wake up for work at 6:30. I broke down and drank, I told myself I was going to have one beer and fall asleep. I ended up finishing about half a fifth of whiskey, and finished the bottle the next day. Since then I have been worse than I was before I tried quitting. Today, my mother said if I drink again, she will be kicking me out of the house. I'm 21, I'm on the Deans list in college, and work around 20 hours a week. But the alcohol has started ruining my body, my face has aged significantly and I have kidney and chest pains quite a bit. So, I'm quitting today.

I hopped into my car, went to 7/11 and bought some, came home, and within 20 minutes she was fine again.

No big deal, right?  But afterwards, I realized that I was able to spring into action at 5am on a Saturday morning.  If it had happened a month ago, I would have been passed out drunk and unable to help her (if I was home at all).

Just a reminder to me that drinking keeps us from being there for the ones we love.  This time it was a mild allergy attack, next time it might be a real emergency.  When I drink, I'm rolling the dice with more people's health than just my own.

some impressions:

I did the first 2 weeks by gorging on sugar and grilled cheeses and playing guitar till my hands cramped up.  After that it's been easier.

Tonight I was driving and hit a sobriety checkpoint.  Very surreal not to have a feeling of dread wash over me.

Went through some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms in the first 2 weeks with mood swings and insomnia, but those have settled down.  

I am more depressed than I was while drinking.  More than anything, this is disappointing to me.  I always kind of hoped the depression was something that would at least improve without alcohol.  I was depressed less frequently and less severely while still drinking. 

I haven't lost any weight as I hoped I would, and I don't particularly feel any healthier.  Apparently, alcohol didn't cause all the health problems I was attributing to it, but I quit so that I wouldn't hurt myself or someone else, not so that my day-to-day would be any easier.  I am a violent alcoholic.

All of the things I did while drinking I can still do, but some of them I don't want to, and some of them have changed.  For example: I went to a casino and played some Texas Hold 'em -- and nearly had a heart attack.  Didn't realize how drunk I usually was while playing cards.  I won for a change though.

I can perform better sexually.

I'm saving ALOT of money.

Overall, I can't complain.  Drinking looms large in my mind sometimes, and other times it doesn't.  When it's looming large, I just wait and it subsides eventually.  I sometimes will have dreams/nightmares where I get hammered, and will wake up feeling guilty for failing.

I'm lucky in that I'm actually kind of frightened of alcohol at this point.  It turned bad on me real fast, and all at once.  Hopefully, the longer I stay away from it, the more frightening and foreign my drinking days will all seem to me.  Getting beaten up by a bunch of guys in a parking lot. Getting beat up by a bunch of guys on the side of the road.  Getting beat up by a bunch of guys in a bar. Why did drunk me always have to fight a bunch of guys at once?

And I've gotta be honest, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. Because the truth is, I stopped counting when I hit 30 or 40 days.  A lot of people do.  Not on purpose, but because it becomes less of a daily struggle. I think that's why so many people relapse around the 30-day mark. It gets easy to forget the pain you went through to stack up those days.  

**Don't forget**

But I don't want to forget. Forgetting leads to indifference, and indifference leads to Day 0. [I kept a chart for the first month](http://i.imgur.com/69XBS.jpg), marking off the hours as they passed. Looking at that chart brings back so many not-so-fond memories. That's a good thing. Back then, I had no idea how I'd get to 20 days, let alone 200. It was a struggle just to make it to the next hour. I whiled away the time playing Minecraft &amp; reading old threads on SD.

**Get Educated**

It's probably not true, but I feel like I've read every comment ever posted to SD. I did it mostly because I had a lot of time on my hands, but also because [I had no idea what I was doing](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/765/b7e.jpg). When you read that many threads, you start to notice a few common themes. The big one: getting sober is about more than simply not drinking. There's a lot of hard work required. Intrapersonal type stuff. Painful stuff. But it's necessary. If you're struggling, you're doing something wrong. Figure out what it is and fix the problem.
 

**Be open**

I had a few chips on my shoulder coming in. I'm sure I still do. But back then I thought I had it all figured out. ""But wait!"", you cry. ""Didn't you just say you had no idea what you were doing?  You used a meme and everything!""  Yep. I knew nothing, and I knew everything, all at the same time.  Sound crazy? Sound familiar?


**Get Involved**

If you've got 1 day sober, you're ready to start giving advice. If you don't have anything insightful or profound to say, a simple ""I feel ya, man"" to let someone know you understand goes a long way. I feel a certain connection with the people who started out around the same time I did. We went through the same things at the same time. We supported each other. When someone disappeared for a week, we'd send PM's asking, ""Everything OK?""  A lot of these people are having their own 200 day anniversaries right about now.  I can't help but think that the sense of community here on /r/stopdrinking has something to do with that.

**tl;dr**

Listen, none of us has all the answers.  Few of us can do it alone. If it was that easy, this sub wouldn't exist. But it does.  Make the most of it.

I spent over 3 hours writing this and I hope you guys enjoy reading it!,mitchyy,60,11,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j5jrz/my_story_and_battle_with_alcoholism_i_spent_over/,"My name is Mitch N and I am an alcoholic. I am 22 years old. The day I decided enough is enough was July 13th 2013. I was born into a wonderful and very loving family with both my parents who are still together to this day who love, support, and care for me more then anyone could ever in this world. I currently have a girlfriend of almost 2 years who also supports and loves me and understands me like no other and is always there with a helping hand and a listening ear for me to turn to when times are, have, and will get tough. We've been together through the worst of my alcoholism, she has seen me at my absolute worst and has seen me at my absolute best and is always there with open arms through every situation. I love her beyond what words could explain.

My first experience with alcohol began when I was 15 years old. I still remember the rush of opening the refrigerator and looking at one of my fathers can of Busch Light and his voice running through my mind ""If you ever drink or touch my beer, I will kick your ass up and down this block"" and thinking to myself ""I wonder why he drinks this stuff, I'm gonna grab one and find out!"". I quickly snatched one from the bottom row of the fridge and pocketed it and ran upstairs to my room with a smile on my face and pure excitement running through my veins. I remember covering the top of the beer with a towel to reduce the noise it made while opening in fear he might hear me cracking one open. I opened it up, I hesitated for a moment, holding the ice cold beer in my hand, feeling the sweat of the can drizzle down the side of the can onto my fingers. I put it up to my nose and sniffed the beer ""WOHA THAT SMELLS NASTY!"" I remember saying to myself. I dabbed my finger into the brownish liquid inside the can mouth and tasted it off my finger ""not much taste"" I thought ""maybe this isn't as bad as it smells!"", I took a swig and swallowed the liquid quickly.

The taste it left in my mouth wasn't good but it wasn't bad tasting in a way. I took another swig, then another, then another and as soon as I knew it, the can was finished. I thought to myself ""This just tastes like a really bad version of water"" and never thought twice about drinking another one. Fast forward to one year later.

Freshly licensed driver with pure rebellion intention coursing through my teenage body with a no good group of friends. I was invited to a going away party for a friend of a friend who was going into the military and overseas to Iraq. I was told this was going to be a ""kick ass party"" and everyone could drink as much as they wanted for 5 dollars! I decided that day was the day I was going to really experience what alcohol was really about. This was the worst decision I had ever made in my life and wish I could go back and change it, but you just can't. Everyone was talking about their previous experiences and drunk moments amongst themselves. I chimed in ""well I drank one beer once, how are all you guys getting this drunk feeling?"" Everyone laughed at me and made fun of me and explained ""you have to drink upwards to 3 or 4 before you even feel anything!"". They called me a light weight and every other newbie drinker derogatory term they could think of.

We showed up to this party. I was absolutely amazed at the amount of people there, I remember first entering and giving my 5 dollars to the person at the gate and just walking past, he yelled loudly ""Hey buddy you forgot your cup!"" I ran back and felt flushed and embarrassed. Everyone could tell I never have been to a party or drank for that matter. People were laughing at me and heckling me from the distance ""Don't drink more then 1 lightweight!"", ""Pussy!"". I sat down at a table by myself because none of my friends wanted to sit with me out of fear of being seen with someone like me and felt pretty bad about myself. I looked around and heard the familiar sounds of technical difficulties from the DJ booth and seeing a line near the keg of beer. I got up with my cup in hand and stood out of line but near the keg and studied the way people were using it and dispensing beer into their cups to avoid another embarrassing moment for myself. I mustered up the courage and got in the line.

The line moved quickly and I got closer and closer ""now's my time to shine, try to look like you know what you're doing Mitch"" I said to myself over and over. I finally reached the front of the line and it was my turn. I put my cup under the tap nozzle facing directly upwards and pulled the handle. I began to notice a large amount of film gathering on top, I waited for the film to disperse and filled a little more ""It's like filling soda except slower!"". People were beginning to get impatient with me taking my sweet time and a man behind me said ""Put your cup on an angle next time! There won't be as much foam!"". My beer was finally filled and I stepped out of line and went back to my table by myself.

I sipped my beer slowly while looking around. I began to notice more and more people were getting louder and louder and much more active and stumbling all over the place. Some were even puking into trash cans. ""How are these people getting like this?"" when suddenly a girl appeared next to me ""How many beers have you had so far?"" she slurred, ""This is only my first one, I never really drank beer except one out of my fridge a year ago, it was my dads."" I said. She laughed at me and told me ""Chug it if you want to get drunk fast, drink slow if you want to be a pussy"". Insulted and having not really proved myself at all that night without any words said I chugged it. I felt a slightly uncomfortable sensation in my stomach, almost aching. Suddenly I burped and quickly got back in line for a refill.

The night progressed on, I got to around my 4th cup of beer and began to feel a slight lightheartedness. It wasn't a bad lightheartedness but a good one. I felt on top of the world, I felt like the funniest guy at the party. I talked just to talk and laughed at my slurred speech. My vision was waving back and forth and pulsating lightly. Things were looking up with each drink. My vision vibrated more, my body felt number with each drink, my confidence level rose. The angriest of people seemed the nicest, the ugliest seemed the most beautiful and mischievous activities seemed like the best things to do. After hours of talking with completely random strangers who did not even remember me from my embarrassing entrance, the night was winding down and I hitched a ride back to a friends house. I laid down on his cold tile floor in the basement and thought to myself ""This is the most comfortable place I have ever slept! I want to feel like this forever."" Words that proved fatal for years to come for me.

Fast forward to a couple months later. I am sitting at home by myself with nothing to do. I dumped the group of friends that I attended the party with due to getting into way too much trouble with them weeks after. I remembered that party and everything I felt from it. I wanted it again, I wanted to feel that blissful blanket of pure numbness around me again, but how? If I take from my dad's fridge he will know that I've been taking his beer. I went downstairs and searched everywhere shelf and area I could of the kitchen. Then it struck me, there's been bottles of wine sitting in the back of an old shelf in my basement that have so much dust on them, they'll never suspect they're gone! 

I quickly ran downstairs and grabbed one of the bottles and ran it under some water to remove the dust. I read the label, scanning it over and over until I saw ""Contains Alcohol"" I jumped for joy and tucked the bottle in my waistband and ran upstairs. I twisted off the cap and thinking back to those words at the party ""Chug it or you're a pussy"" - I slammed half the bottle in one go, then slammed the other half in another. A whole bottle of wine gone in under 5 minutes. I sat down at my desk and played on the computer awaiting the effects from my choice. Finally after 10 minutes or so I felt that all too fimilar buzz of my vision vibrating and pulsating, the numbness, the giggles, the slurred speech. It didn't stop there, the effects became more and more intense. I finally reached full blown drunk. I reached what every person wanted to achieve at that party.

I tried to stand from my chair and take a step but my legs buckled and I fell face first to the ground. I laughed and dragged myself across the floor over and over. The blurriness in my vision was getting more and more intense. I could not make out objects near or far, I struggled to find my bed for 30 minutes and finally found it and crawled into it and fell asleep hanging half way off the bed. I awoke 10 hours later in the same position but with an absolutely horrible headache and dry mouth and a very strained back from laying like that all night. I experienced the consequences of my choice for the first real time a hangover. All I could think about was that feeling.

Fast forward to 18 to present. I'm now what they call ""an experienced drinker"" I've tasted every beer I could get my hands on, I've drank many spirts and mixed drinks. I experienced blackouts, many hangovers with friends and began to experiment with pills (Ambien CR mostly) I began drinking beer daily at 18 as my parents allowed it, my worst time came at 20 to 22. It became out of control and on my 21st birthday I still had no friends and spent my 21st birthday sitting in my car in the middle of the night alone with my radio on drinking a fifth of Captain Morgan to myself. I told myself over and over ""This needs to stop, it's getting out of hand"". I was mixing 12.5 MG Ambien CR's with 10 - 12 beers nightly as a regimen for sleep. I would pass out for upwards to 15 - 18 hours at a time and awake confused, very hung over and millions of brain cells less. My health was deteriorating, I began skipping meals to make sure I had an empty stomach so my sleeping pill would work at night and the alcohol would effect me if I had eaten forget about it, it wouldn't do a thing to me. 

Finally I hit rock bottom on July 13th 2013. My girlfriend (who rarely drinks) and I were going to spend a Saturday afternoon with a couple of drinks and washing her car. We went to the nearest liquor store and picked up a case of beer for me and UV Blue and Lemonade for her. Forgetting she had Bud Lite Strawberitas in the fridge I got for her a couple weeks back I got the drinks and went home and started right away on the drinks at 1 PM. She mixed her drinks with little bit of UV blue and lots of lemonade, I drank my beer like the usual and kept away from the hard liquor. Around 6 - 7 PM she ran out of lemonade and was left with half a bottle of UV Blue. I decided we should take shots to finish it off. When I drink spirts I become a very violent person. She knew this and I pleaded with her ""come on I won't get like that I promise"". We finished off the bottle of UV together and went outside to talk to my family. I snuck away into the garage while she was talking to my family to grab beers out of the fridge and started chugging as many as I could hold down. I walked out each time, more and more wasted and went inside to use the bathroom and grabbed 3 - 4 Strawberitas and headed to the bathroom and chugged those all down and hid the cans in the bathtub.

The night progressed on, 9 clock hits and I grab an Ambien from the bottle and chew it like the usual, this time I saw a bottle of wine sitting on the counter, already completely wasted but still wanting more I swished down the Ambien with the wine and just knocked the bottle back and started chugging. My brother came upstairs and saw me doing this and took away the bottle away as I was obviously already completely hammered, holding myself up on the counter while chugging the wine trying not to fall. He dumped it down the drain and I quickly ran into the room and grabbed 2 beers when he went downstairs and chugged those. The last thing I remembered was walking half way up the stairs and blank.

I woke up the next morning, my girlfriend was not beside me. I was still absolutely hammered. I stumbled down the stairs to go see my mother who was absolutely furious with me. She told me ""You were walking up the stairs, fell, got up and walked up the stairs into your room and fell in your room then started smashing your head against the floor over and over in anger, your girlfriend attempted to stop you, you got angry and cornered her and tried to punch her. She ran down to me and you chased her I slapped you across the face because you were trying to get past me to hit her while yelling and screaming. Your father came downstairs and clocked you right in the face and knocked you out and put you in bed and she went home. You're disgusting, get your fucking life together you stupid drunk""

He was pressuring me to drink at the start of it and periodically throughout the day long festival. I never had an urge to drink and it was enlightening to watch him and a few other people, especially after reading *The Easy Way to Stop Drinking*. In this book, Allen Carr works to disprove the notion that drinking is sociable by writing that people who are drunk are often rude and not fun to be around--the opposite of social. 

I saw this play out as my friend got increasingly inebriated. Him and another girl we were hanging out with were fun to talk to in the beginning and became more self-focused and less engaged in normal conversation as they drank. I was actually annoyed to be around them after awhile. 

Also, my friend's stated reason to go to the festival was to see a band he really likes but, by the time the band played, he was so drunk he probably didn't remember the show. He also spent a greater portion of the day worrying about getting his next drink and standing in line at various bars than watching the shows. 

Later in the night, two girls struck up a conversation with me. Part way through, an older guy who was extremely drunk came over and tried to hit on them. It was just sad. All I could think about during this was that it could easily be me in 25 years if I decide to resume drinking. The lonely drunk old man trying desperately to establish some human contact but simultaneously shooting himself in the foot because of his addiction.

When I got home from the festival I was pretty angry because of the way my friend acted and the fact that so much socializing seems to revolve around alcohol. Then I woke up today and went mountain biking with a friend while the majority of the people who attended the festival were still in bed hungover. These are the things I need to remember when I have an urge to drink.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month2,True,t3_1gxo1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gxo1r/some_lessons_learned_from_yesterday/,

After I got sober, and even while I was still drinking, stories came out of the woodwork of exactly what I would do while drinking. Some of them shocked me. Believe it or not, that wasn't what sparked me to get sober. It was finding out that my dad got alcohol poisoning and had to go to the hospital the day after *I* got alcohol poisoning. My dad has been my hero and role model for all my life. Having him tell me his plight, it opened my eyes to the possibility that quitting would be my best option.

I'm saying all this for those of you who think there's no hope. There *is*. I can tell you now that seeking out sobriety is one of the best decisions I have made. I never had control over how much I drank. It hurt a few of my relationships and I made a lot of people worry about me.

But I left her house at 8:10, and drove straight to a meeting. I had the honor of sharing first and the outpouring of love and support was incredible.

I assured him nothing was going to happen and that I'm an adult.

While I was in the Army I had it in check because I would get in a lot of trouble for drinking that much. But since I got out of the service in July of 2011, I have essentially drunken a fifth of Vodka or Whiskey every single night. 

I live alone in a cabin in Vermont, family is close by but I am embarrassed by it. I have no idea what I am looking for out of this, just felt like posting. Every morning I dream about quitting and becoming sober but every night I get out of work at 5, my hand starts to shake and I grab that bottle. 

**Edit:**  Thanks for all the feedback everyone, guess I should of been more clear. I have been to the VA for detox before, about 8 months ago, I only lasted a week after I got out. Sense then I have lost my license to a DUI, so, while I am able to get back and forth to work, nothing else really. I live in a rural area with zero public transit. Not having a license also makes it very difficult to get to an AA meeting. My physiatrist at the VA, about 5 months ago, prescribed me a medication to help me detox outpatient, that worked, but I only lasted 5 days after that. However I can't get to the VA cause I have no license... 
So, basically I need to detox again, but this time, have a support system within AA to help me. 


I should also mention, I have severe PTSD, I am rated 80% disabled by the VA. That is my major source for drinking.

and i don't wanna preach, i've got no... i'm not prostelzting. i don't, i don't recommend sobriety for everyone. those of you who know you need to get sober, know who you are, you can fight it all you want, i'm only speaking from experience, the first few years were fucking horrendous, i was out of my mind.

people ask me how i did it. and i will say openly, and i may not be... i'm not supposed to say it necessarily, but i went to AA.  i went to meetings and i listened and i got the shit beaten out of my brain with that stuff, and i made it my own, and integrated the thoughts of the program into my own brain, i don't speak for the program at all but at the beginning i went to two or three meetings every fucking day for a year.... until uh, because it was all i had to do, all i  wanted to do.   i had to get sober. and i stayed sober somehow.

look. i know that this podcast helps people with this stuff, and i can say that my life is better because of sobriety. only you can decide whether you're fucked up.  and here's how you know if you're fucked up. if you wake up every day and you go 'goddamnit i'm fucked up again. today i'm gonna not get fucked up.' and then you get fucked up. then you're fucked up.

unmanageability. that's the core of the issue. there's a lot of functional alcoholics out there. god bless ya. a lot of people who love the booze, love the drugs. good for you! have a great time. got no judgement. i miss them myself. but if you want to stop and you can't stop, then you're fucked up. that's it. that's the whole crux of it.

if you wonder whether or not you have a drug or alcohol problem is if you're fucked up and you wanna be not fucked up and you can't stop getting fucked up. that's it.

do what you gotta do. there's other ways to get sober. you can white knuckle it, there's some other sober programs out there, do what you gotta do. all i'm telling you is, it's fucking hard. for about a year to five years. and then you finally get your shit together enough and you get the hang of being sober...

and then you just sort of live with the aggravation of it. and i know some of you are thinking 'but dude, you drink a lot of coffee. a lot of nicotine lozenges.' well here's my answer to that.  

i am a compulsive-addictive personality i also have a fucking tremendous eating disorder and complete body dysmorphia and i eat compulsively. what else do i do? i probably masturbate more than i need to. yeah, i got a lot of compulsive problems. but i'll tell you what. i'm not going to masturbate myself into a brick wall or into a tree or into a gunfight. i'm not going to do nicotine lozenges and black out for six hours. i'm not going to do nicotine lozenges and get into a fight with somebody. it's relative. yeah, i have an addictive personality.  no doubt. 

do i self medicate? fuck yes i do. am i fucked up on booze and drugs? no.  are the things i'm not relatively safer than booze and drugs and not that mind altering? yes.  you draw your own lines, people. you know who you are. if you're fucked up and wanna stop being fucked up and can't stop being fucked up, you've got a problem. all i can say is it worked for me.

i know a lot of people and they go to the things and they're like 'i dunno there's a lot of god' and well alight scratch god. lose god. take what you need. figure it out. it's possible.

am i happier? yes. am i more productive? yes. am i more happy? yes. did it take a long fucking time?

here's the deal. when you're an alcoholic or a drug addict, obviously you have a tremendous amount of discomfort with you. yes, that's you! sitting with you very difficult. frightening stuff.  accepting you. horrendous. who would want to accept this guy? who would want to accept me? i certainly don't. fuck me. fuck that. 

i'm gonna fucking drink onto that. yeah hell yeah now i can accept me. i'm cool, i'm loose, i'm good. look at me making people cry and hurting myself.

it's no minor feat. 14 years sober. or one day sober. and if you've got a problem, there's help out there for ya. that's what i'm gonna tell ya. i've kind of given you a hint of what it is. but i've got 14 fucking years sober last week. hallelujah. not gonna say it's a miracle, but it kinda is, not really a miracle guy, but it's a lot of work and a lot of self-acceptance, and i'll be honest with you, after a few years... the obsession goes away. you don't get that hunger.

You cannot stop drinking then expect your life to change.  Ultimately I realized that whatever behavior I presented to the world while drinking was lurking under the surface while sober.  The hurtful things I said were thoughts that existed before picking up the bottle.  

There is an old maxim ""In Vino Veritas""-  in wine the truth comes out""  this began to stick in my mind around month two. I didn't want to admit that my drinking could not excuse my bad behavior.  I was still acting like an asinine imbecile. 

Month three I began an introspective soul search.  I became a hugonaut. I found the things I and others liked about me,  kept those. The things I and others found repugnant I endeavored to change.  By month five people began to notice a change. 

After that point not drinking began to get easier.  Cravings?  I still get them,  but I have no want or will to act on them.  I admit I am fallible.  I could not do that a year ago.  I am now responsible for my actions and willing to change my ways.  This is the key to my sobriety.

this is my first thread ever on reddit and i'm a little nervous that i'm doing it wrong. &gt;.&gt; 

i'm 29. i drank for sixteen years. a year or so ago i had my first blackout, i don't know what brought it on, or why it took so long to happen really, but it just goes to show that alcoholism is indeed very progressive. it never gets better, only worse.  that spawned a lot of blackouts and confusion. i did things during blackouts that left me feeling traumatized, very sorry for myself, and like i was a terrible person. it took me a while to gather the motivation to stop moping and get sober. i started going to aa and na at the start of this year. i've had relapses, but they get further and further apart and today i feel like drugs and alcohol are not a part of my life. i'm still trying to figure out what is. i live in a small town and don't have my provisional license yet so i can only manage one meeting a week and one or two more when my friend decides she wants to go to one/take me to one, but i personally find they really help, and i don't think i could have come this far without them. it's really good to see that there are actually interesting sober people in the world, and they give me so much hope that life can be great without having to get fucked up.

At that point I had the idea that since I was that much into drinking, maybe I should search for a drinking subreddit. First I went to /r/drunk. On the sidebar it said ""*Are you over 30? Wasted on a Tuesday night? Then you might* *want to check out /r/cripplingalcoholism*"". 

Well, I *was* wasted on a Tuesday night so off to CA. Checking the sidebar again: ""*Have you never had the shakes, nor repeatedly put a drink above everything else till you lost it all? Then check out the good people over* *at r/drunk*"". Now I was confused. I was not that deep into drinking, not yet. There hasn't been one person that doesn't argue with me when I say that I quit drinking because I'm an alcoholic. 

But this space between the two subreddits got me thinking. Some years ago I was definitely /r/drunk material. I still wasn't a CA. But seeing how my drinking was evolving I would probably reach that point, sooner or later. That was the time that I realised that this path I've taken has a specific destination, unless I do something about it. The funny part is that this thought was generated by the lack of a specific subreddit. What was I waiting for? To reach to the point where all the stories in /r/cripplingalcoholism would sound familiar? I had to do something. 

So, I found this great place called /r/stopdrinking. Here I could feel like home. It doesn't matter if the stories I was reading were of a student who was binge drinking twice a month or of a married guy who was in the verge of ruining his family and losing his job because of alcohol. The will and fight for a change is our common ground.

You found in me someone so low, so scarred and so alone that you knew you could take advantage of me. You knew I was the perfect mate you needed, a perfect host to your parasitic needs. There was so much empty, dead space in my heart and soul that you were able to crawl in, find a comfortable place to set roots down, grow and flourish. You feed off of self-hatred, and of that I have plenty. You have led me down so many paths. The day I was told I could die because of you I was mad, angry as hell, pissed off.....but you gently talked me out of my rage. You told me that you would not let me die, you would lead me down a path we could both traverse together, safe, far away from the outcome they predicted. Every day when I was lonely and sad you were there to hold my hand. You would whisper in my ear your love for me and how you would never let me down. You slowly started changing me into a person I didn't recognize. My physical shell started turning ugly. My mind started playing tricks on me, started telling me good people were bad.....making sure I ran away from anyone that would make me believe I was strong enough to go it alone without you. You changed my heart.....filling it to a point where I couldn't feel love for anyone or anything g else. You slowly took over all my motivations, all of my dreams.....smiling devilishly because you were succeeding at slowly stealing my future....right before my very eyes.

You are a liar. You have no heart or soul.....anything that you possess you have stolen from me. My goodness, my sanity, my money, my time, my family ties, my self worth. You have stolen all of this from me an in return you have given me one empty high after another, shame, anxiety, pain and loneliness. You have slowly been taking every part of me that was genuine and whole and breaking it down, flushing it out and replacing it with your dirty, sick self.

You have led me to believe life without you is not worth living. That nobody will like me, that you need to be with in me in order to make me shine. When in fact you have stolen my light.....stolen my beauty. You know I am close to letting you go and you are getting panicked.....looking for every way to get me to visit you one last time.

Today I leave you forever. Today I take my first steps towards freedom. I am weak, that is for sure. You have done a good job of atrophying every form of strength I have ever possessed. But with each step you will realize I am truly walking away from you. Without me you will die. Without you I will live.

(crosspost from /r/redditorsinrecovery by request)
One man's story...YMMV",cymrufollies,48,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18hwwo/its_now_37_year_sober_heres_how_crosspost_from/,"OK, so it's now 37 years sober and the first thing anyone asks, that is if they're at all interested, is ""how did you do it?""

The simple answer would be that I didn't, but my Higher Power did.

A less simple answer would be that I was lucky enough to realize I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and so I did what AA in its collective wisdom told me to do.

So what was the trigger? To this day I don't honestly know. I had been hospitalized twice with DTs and was given up for dead or at least near-dead once. But, hey, I'm an alcoholic so I did what alcoholics do when they get out of the hospital -- I drank just like I always did, about a fifth of cheap vodka a day.

Then, drunk as a skunk on Valentine's Day I jumped into the car with my wife and headed across a snowy Wyoming Valley to the local detox center. No, not some expensive rehab center, but a dirty, grungy stop-of-last-resort for the area's drunks.

My wife was appalled at the treatment I got, enough so that she was launched into a near-20-year career in the drug and alcohol field. I do know they took my shoes away, all the while telling me I was free to leave anytime. Yes, sure, with 4"" of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain. Most of my detox stay remains a blur. I do know I was sick and miserable and slept a lot.

Then, on the last day -- by this time I'd earned a pair of corduroy slippers -- I went to my first AA meeting. It was mandatory, by the way. Not much registered except that the key to sobriety was 90 meetings in 90 days. I also picked up the nugget that my only job was to stay sober.

Not being a particularly religious sort I wasn't really into the spiritual aspects of the program, but deep inside I knew that something outside of myself was keeping me sober. So, OK, let's call it my Higher Power, whatever it might be.

They told me I'd probably lose my drinking buddies. They were right, I did, but it really wasn't a great loss. I had this enduring and unrealistic fear that if I went into a bar someone from AA would see me and I'd get my ass kicked. So I didn't.

Years go by. By the time I had 12 years sober I reasoned that I'd maybe gotten a little walking-around sense that could be of use to AA, which by then I realized had saved my life. So I did all the service jobs, and I mean almost all. I never became the District Chairman, but I came close.

Meetings every week became the norm. They kept telling me that maybe I didn't need a meeting every week, but it was good insurance. That was enough for me.

By 30 years it became apparent that I'd finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasn't a part of it. I was firmly convinced that I was like a black man -- I could change the status, but I was still black, only in my case the word isn't black, it's alcoholic.

Where to now at 37 years? I realize I have more years behind me than ahead of me -- life is like that. I'm still wedded to the alcoholic community -- bought tires today from a guy who'se an alcoholic. Why? Because unlike most tire salesmen, I knew he was honest. Guess that's a fringe benefit.

Why am I posting this wall of text?

Not for self aggrandizement, I assure you. Maybe it's to show newcomers or mid-termers that long term sobriety is quite do-able even though the first steps seem insanely difficult. I figure if just one person decides to challenge me and stay sober for 37 years and one day it will have been a worthwhile exercise. Especially since one day -- today -- is all we really have.

It feels weird. But also really rewarding! For a long time I thought, ""How the hell can anyone not drink for that long. They must have a secret."" I've come to realize that it's just not drinking one day at a time, and taking action rather than waiting for a light switch to go on.

For years I had been a heavy daily drinker, and didn't care (and couldn't find a reason to care) about pretty much anything. I suppose I was ""functional"" in the sense of I had a job, didn't wreck my car, and didn't do any irreparable damage (that I know of). But emotionally I was close to absolute zero, just going through the motions every day. Things steadily progressed to the point where a year ago I was dangerously close to losing my life, along with every amazing gift I had ever been given. Poof. That moment resulted in a feeling I had never felt before, and hope to never feel again - total despair and defeat. I decided that absolutely anything was better than that feeling, and walked into AA the next day. Things have gotten steadily better since then. Not perfect, but workable. And that's a pretty damn good feeling. I've learned that I have a lot more to learn about sobriety and growth. But I've also learned that sobriety is absolutely possible. If I can do it, anyone can do it. Hope is a wonderful thing.

Primarily I've gotten to a year by not taking a drink one day at a time. A number of things have made that daily goal easier - to each his or her own, but here's the stuff that's working for me: 


* I don't drink no matter what - 'Nuff said. Hard, but if there's one thing I remember it's this.
* One day at a time - More than anything else, knowing that all feelings and thoughts will pass sooner or later has really helped me.
* Journaling - There's a lot of crap in my head. It really helps to get it out on paper. Plus, feels good to go back and read previous entries to see where I came from.
* Meditation - Helps to calm my mind and gain perspective. Practicing mindfulness and gratitude has gone a long, long way towards my feeling more grounded and at peace with life.
* Exercise - Getting up early to work out not only gives me a reason to not drink at night, it feels great. The body's natural high is good enough these days.
* Being responsible - I used alcohol to avoid life. Avoiding life via other escapes puts me back in that bad place again.
* Posting here - This is such a great resource, and full of wonderful people helping each other out. I lurked for quite a while, but now find this a great way to check in with other recovering people anywhere and anytime. If you're thinking about signing up and saying hi, just do it! Talking to sober people starts to rub off after a while.
* And finally, AA - I tried most of the above (and more) in various combinations, and never got beyond 45 days dry. Real life connections have been extremely rewarding, to say the least. 

So that's it. I dig being sober, and I don't take life for granted anymore. If you're struggling, just take it a moment at a time. Things can get better if you let them. And reach out to someone - it may be hard, but it could be the best thing you ever do. I'm an alcoholic, but I'm in recovery with you all. And that feels pretty good no matter what day we're on.

Thanks SD!

Also, some ancillary benefits of sobriety:

* Returning movies to Redbox the next day because I actually remember everything that happened with only one viewing.

* The fish in my fishtank stay alive longer than, say, a week.
* My call of duty skills no longer experience a dramatic drop off after 5pm.
* The poop thing - much better. You know what I'm talking about.
* Waking up in freshly washed sheets instead of McDouble wrappers.
* Spending $0 on Altoids because I don't need to disguise my breath poorly.
* Relaxed mornings instead of a daily oh-fuck-I'm-late.
* I can reference specific songs a band played instead of ""Yeah, killer show, I think.""
* Donating all my old 'fat guy' clothes.
* I don't get enraged by birds waking me up before the break of noon.
* New hobby: ice cream.

1339183118.0,46,self.stopdrinking,us0m5,A letter to my old drunken self,midlake500,51,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/us0m5/a_letter_to_my_old_drunken_self/,"Hello Alcoholic Bob,

I now understand why people choose not to drink: they feel better sober than you do at your most drunk. I can hear your mocking laughter now: ""I fell fantastic when I drink, why not have a few and have a good time?"". Right now, I'm drunker than you've ever been in your life. I'm so high. Higher than you ever were with your favorite bottle, and not a single bit of alcohol, or any drug, is in my system. If you don't believe me we could draw our dopamine or serotonin levels when I'm sober and when you're drunk, and you'll wish you were drinking what I'm drinking.

One upon a time, people told you that alcohol was fun, and was the way to have the most fun possible. Advertising, songs, movies, television, your own friends. We were all raised on to believe that alcohol was a good time, the best time you could have. After you turned 21, you waited anxiously for the weekend to come so you can have the most fun possible. Whether it was going out with friends, playing video games, camping, or doing house work, drinking while you were doing it was the way to have the most fun possible.

Pretty soon, you started taking advantage of having the most fun possible during the work week as well. Working around the house and drinking, mowing the lawn and drinking, working on your motorcycle and drinking. All because it was the most fun. After a while you started to concern yourself and others with just how often and how much you were ""having fun"". It bothered you when people didn't drink with you. You were mad that others seemed content without drinking. You were jealous, so you told them that their happiness was fake. Your health started to decline, your mental clarity started to go, and your work performance was starting to decline. But you were having fun all the time.

You tried convincing yourself you could control it, and you tried, but you couldn't. And I don't blame you, you were just trying to feel the same way sober people feel all the time. You would search deeper and deeper into the bottle for the same happiness and fun you once had, but you could never find it. You knew you had to quit, but you were afraid, because you didn't want to play video games, go out with friends, go camping, and not be having the most fun.

But I'm going to tell you something that you won't believe, and will probably make you very angry: Alcohol doesn't work, it doesn't do what you think it does, it can't make you happy or give you a buzz, and it never did. You were deceived. I can hear you now, scowling, mocking me: ""of course it gives me a buzz and makes me happy, I feel fantastic when I drink"". You didn't, it's impossible, that's not what alcohol does. Look it up, research it. Alcohol inhibits brain function, that's it. End of effects. Every time you were drinking, you were becoming less and less conscious. It doesn't release saratonin or dopamine, it only makes you less conscious. You were damaging you brain more and more until you were no longer conscious of the pain you were in. Pain you were never aware of until you started drinking. You were just numbing yourself and (this is the important part) finally felt the way every body else feels sober.

Every warning light on your vehicle was going off and flashing, but instead of fixing the problems and enjoying a nice ride like everyone else, you choose to rip out the fuses to the dash and declare ""what a marvelous machine, everything appears to be working perfectly, I can finally enjoy the ride"". Alcohol doesn't work, you were only fooling yourself. All the Budweiser commercials showing people having a good time drinking, the songs on the radio, people having the time of their lives in the movies, your friends talking about what great times they had drinking, all of it. With all of that you were deceived into believing alcohol did something that it didn't. It doesn't make you happy, it doesn't take away your problems, and it is not the way to have the most fun.

I could have a drink today, but I don't want to. Not because I can finally control my alcohol, but because alcohol is an absolutely shitty buzz, and I don't know how I could have ever been so deceived. You were never high off alcohol, you were high off whatever you were doing when you were drunk and gave credit to the wrong thing. Each time you had friends over to play video games and got drunk, and had an amazing time, you thought: ""what an amazing night, alcohol makes me feel amazing!"". The experience was great, but alcohol got all the credit, and you were further deceived.

Don't believe me? Sit with bottle in the middle of the room, don't surround yourself with the things you normally do when you drink. No music, no TV, no video games, and just drink. Are you becoming more happy, are you having fun? No! You're becoming less and less conscious, only inhibiting normal brain function. You don't feel any happier, nor are you having any more fun. It was one giant placebo, alcohol doesn't work. That's why you look deeper and deeper into the bottle looking for happiness, because you can't find it anymore. You always think it's just one more shot away. But I can tell you why you can't find it: it's because it was never there, you gave credit to the wrong thing, you were tricked, deceived.

Today, I am 100% sober, and will never look back. I'm not sober because I have the willpower to finally say no, I'm sober because being drunk is a shitty experience, it's not fun. Alcohol never gave me a buzz to begin with, it just made me less conscious. I had deceived myself.

Today, I get the same high I use to get doing shots as I do with normal life experiences. I got my fishing license today, and feel very ""drunk"", I'm going to wake up early tomorrow to go fishing for the first time in years. I can't wait to go to dinner with my fiancee, I'm going to get ""smashed"". I can't wait to wake up early tomorrow and work on my motorcycle, and then do some landscaping, and then walk my dogs at the park, and then play some Diablo. I will be absolutely ""wasted"", and more drunk than you have ever been in your life.

You will need to make some changes though, to feel this drunk again. Start by reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Control Alcohol, that will expand upon some things I've already said. Next, I would recommend looking into the field of positive psychology. The book ""The Happiness Advantage"" by Sean Achor will change your life. It's a scientifically based meta analysis on happiness that look into what makes our brains happy, not that foofy pep talk stuff you're use to seeing on TV. I know you don't like to read, so luckily they have it on audio book available freely on a site called The Pirate Bay. Also, Tal Ben-Shahar has some great books as well.

Get back to the gym, exercise isn't just about losing weight and looking good, it has a profound affect on your mental state. You'll love getting up and exercising in the morning before going into work. You'll have a better boost than an energy drink. You'll be on a high all day long.

Also, learn to meditate. I know it sounds like woowoo, but it's been scientifically proven to reduce stress, lower your heartbeat, and improve your memory. Try a guided meditation first, because I know you have no clue what you're doing. They can be found all over YouTube.

Also, get a corgi. You'll enjoy him so much that you'll get another. It's like a double shot of tequila every time you come home and are greeted by those two. Note the rush too, note the buzz you get when they jump in your lap. It's better than a shot of jack.

Get a journal, and start writing down your thoughts. You're anxious all day long because ideas keep popping into your head that you're afraid you'll forget (and you do). Punish the pad of paper, not your brain. Keep notes, write things down.

r/frisson gives you a better high than alcohol ever did. Just compare the two. Sit in a room alone with a bottle and drink. Now watch something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtAdneAfzcc&amp;feature=related) or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9poWKKpbU) and compare how you feel.

You won't want to drink when you do any of these things because it will only lessen the experience. You'll want to be 100% conscious for every last boss kill, every last puppy kiss, and every last minute of vacation in order to feel 100% of the natural rush and buzz available. You'll wonder why inhibiting brain function while you did those things ever seemed like a way to have the most fun.

Don't focus on trying to quit alcohol, that'll only make you want to drink. Focus on getting your life on track, and you'll slowly start to note the times where doing simple things in life is giving you a better high than you thought alcohol did., and the alcoholism will shed itself.  You might as well be trying to quit drinking motor oil, there's nothing to quit. It might take you a bit to comes to terms with the fact that alcohol doesn't do the things you though it did, that it doesn't work. It'll seen a little frightening, and yet liberating at the same time. You'll be drunker than you've ever been drunk in your life.

I hope everyone is doing well and are having a good day. Today marks my 120th day sober, the longest time I haven't had a drink since probably high school. I feel very good and I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished. Not only have I started living my life, my health and general outlook on life improved dramatically.

I have been going to the doctor on a regular basis on my road to getting healthier. Before I stopped, my blood pressure was out of control and I was a miserable zombie. I have started eating better, exercise daily and it has shown. My BP is down with the help of medication and I have dropped 55 pounds. I finally look forward to the future. I have made plans to hike mountains this spring/summer like I used to as a boy scout. Something i always loved but never kept doing. I am doing the couch to 5k program and might even sign up for a race later this year. My relationships with people is great, I am far more social and confident. 

I have done the buffet approach, and found what is working for me. I never count out anything in the future however. If I am struggling, I will tune my methods until I am confident I will maintain this sobriety. I think it was a different Challenge for me than other Alcoholics. Possibly an easier one. I never went to bars, had bar friends or was really close to any heavy drinkers. I drank alone. As soon as I started to have goals and activities to replace my drinking, it became a lot easier. 

Anyways, I wanted to give an update. Best wishes to you all. Thank you all for your kindness, support and for sharing your story.

I am a man in my early 40s with kids, mortgage and the stresses that go along with it.

I've come to realize the extent to which alcohol, like weeds in a garden, prevented the healthy growth that should come with age.

Because I was always drunk or hungover, I had little time for long term planning.  I was scared to map out a plan for the future, knowing that none of my goals would likely be achieved. I had somehow managed to do fairly well without much of a plan, but over the years things started unraveling. Slowly at first, then faster. Funny how the speed of the unraveling corresponded with the volume of my drinking. 

I got laid off again? That's 4 times in 8 years. But that wasn't my fault it was the economy.

I had gained 30 pounds in the last 10 years. Oh well, I guess that's middle age creeping in.

My relationships with my wife were a mess and she was always wondering when I will grow up. What a nag.

Most troubling is that I never put any value into any of the things around me. I knew that I would eventually lose them, so why fight to protect or nurture them?

My marriage, my house, my career, hell - my self esteem, my physical fitness, my confidence - all of these things were subordinate to one Master which was drinking. That's by no means the exhaustive list - I still haven't been to the dentist in years...

I lost some of these things. Some I will get back, others are gone. But I have found a simple idea. The idea is that I deserve to have the things that I've lost. There is a small kernel of self esteem that is growing. It's like a green shoot in the garden, and staying sober nurtures it.

It is astonishing to me that I am here today and able to say that. If you are a new comer to the Stop Drinking lifestyle, hang in there, it does get easier. I was in and out of AA at least a dozen times before it stuck. I walked in to my first meeting ever and left thinking how absolutely impossible of a task I thought quitting would be and basically gave up on thinking it was possible. I listened to the stories of others about being in and out of rehab, multiple DUI's, ruined marriages etc.... and thought, shit im not that bad, I don't need this place.
It wasn't until about the 6th, ""IF you don't quit drinking I am gone"" speech from my fiancee of about 6 years now (she should have been long gone, she is a better person then I am, I owe her my life and work daily to prove to her I am worth it) that I went and sought help from a psychologist. 
I would like to share the ""Come to Jesus"" statement that she told me. I shared with her how I thought that my drinking was under control and that I wasn't as bad off as *those* people in AA. Told her I have never been to rehab, never had a DUI, never completely ruined a relationship with those I loved. What she told me resonated further then anything I have ever read or heard in a AA meeting. She told me, ""The difference between those people and you is just one more drink."" Please think about this, what difference one more drink would have made when you almost missed that stop sigh. What difference that one more drink would have made in your job, your relationships. What difference that one drink would have made in waking up, or not. 
That's what it took for me to wake the fuck up and realize I had to stop. Not that I should, or needed to, but that I absolutely had to. If I wanted a future beyond what I was headed to I had to stop. I did, I worked the system, went to meetings and kept going to my psychologist. 
I hope my writing resonate's to as many of ya'll as I can but I will take just one. Its not easy, its a long hard road and you can do it. Its been three years and I am still scared to death that I will start drinking again and I am thankful for that. I am scared to death just thinking about what that ""just one more"" drink will do. I know I can not be a social drinker, that I can not just drink on special occasions. I am an alcoholic and well be for the rest of my life.

I've been a lurker here for quite a while, but never felt like I had anything worth posting. Anyway, here I am. I don't have a lot of friends or family I can talk to about this stuff, but I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't say it's been easy, but I wouldn't say it's been hard either...it has just been life. Previous attempts at sobriety were always filled with so much rage, so much anger at what I CAN'T do, or what I wasn't ALLOWED to do. For the first time in my life, being sober has been what I wanted for MYSELF, not what someone else wanted for me.

I'm fortunate that I seem to have got myself on the right path before I inflicted any irreparable tragedy on myself, the people I love, or some innocent person, and I have so much gratitude for that, that it sometimes almost gives me a panic attack, like I survived some near death experience. What's pasted below is what I wrote to myself and my wife the morning after my last drink. I hope you're all doing well, and keep up the good fight.

*I don’t know how to start this other than say that I am an alcoholic. For the past ten years or so, since the first time I ever had a drink, it has caused me so much pain, stress, personal torment, and frustration. The fact that my alcohol use hasn’t caused the death or injury of someone, or my own death is quite frankly, an incredible stroke of luck or divine intervention. Trying to write down all the times that I’ve narrowly escaped a DUI arrest, a car crash, or an incredibly stupid and dangerous situation would be a monumental task. I’ve had the feeling over the last couple of weeks that my luck is running out.

My drinking is abusive. I do not drink because I like the taste of alcohol or that I’m a wine snob or beer geek. I CANNOT have one. The times I have been able to have a single drink have been torture, and it’s been an amazing feat of personal restraint due to social obligation. I've always wanted another one. For every time I've had a 'good' night of drinking, where it's facilitated conversation, made me laugh harder, made me funnier, or more creative, there have been ten nights where I've put my or someone else's life in danger, said or done something incredibly stupid, or just basically been a sloppy, stupid, ugly person. 

This relationship with alcohol is textbook abusive. It kicks the shit out of me on a daily basis and is hurting me all the time. Six days a week it makes my life miserable and makes me hate myself and feel like a piece of garbage, and on the seventh day, it makes me feel good for a little bit, so I go back to thinking everything is okay.

My memory of the nights before is fucking SHOT. I feel like every time I drink, I don't remember what I did or said the night before. When I wake up after a night out, if I'm talking about the night before, I'm usually faking it. Even the nights where I don't have 'a lot' to drink (less than 6, if I'm being generous), it still affects my memory. This is getting worse, there's no doubt about it. Nights I drink a lot, it ends up being a total blackout. More moderate nights still have gaps in them, and this shouldn't be happening. I'm damaging my brain.

The thing that I cannot stop thinking about is that something terrible is going to happen. The best case scenario would be a DUI arrest. I would get pulled over some night coming home from the bars , or practice or both, and I'll have felt like I was fine, but I'd probably blow twice the legal limit, because my tolerance is so high. I'd be arrested, and have to pay over $2000 in fines and fees, and I'd have to face my beautiful wife and see her disappointment. I'd have to look my father in law in the eye, and see how I let him down, and see his opinion of me change before my very eyes, and that for maybe the first time, he's wondering why he's supporting this man who married his daughter. I sit here and talk shit about my friend with DUIs, but only by chance, I'm not in his same fucking situation.

The worst case scenario in the immediate future is my death. I'd flip my car or drive off the road into a tree, and it would be a painful, terrible bloody death, where I'd be crushed and ripped apart. I'm crying right now as I think of the scene when my mother and my wife are called and told that I fucking killed myself due to my own stupidity and selfishness. My mother and father would live the rest of their shortened lives in terrible emotional pain, and I would have negated all the joy and happiness that they had ever had before. My beautiful wife would be so crushed and devastated. She would live the rest of her life wondering what we could have had together. Eventually she would move on and realize that it's pointless to mourn me, and find a new life, and I'd be forgotten. The true love that we've built so far, as amazing and wonderful as it is, would mean nothing.

But if the same luck I've had continues for a while, I'll just kill myself slowly. Lets' stop pretending that I will someday magically be some social drinker where I can have a single glass of wine at dinner, or meet up with friends for three beers over three hours with pleasant conversation. No, I have a ridiculous tolerance for alcohol, and it's been burned into my brain that I like drinking and I like the feeling of being drunk. This could just continue for another thirty years, and in that time I'll have gotten a few DUIs, lost my family, burned out my liver, become fatter than I already am because of alcohol, and spend literally hundreds of thousands of dollars fucking myself up. 

I do not want to be a lonely old drunk who pissed away my one, amazing lucky chance at an incredible life with an amazing woman and our future children. I want to be a good man, who's responsible for his actions, and present in the moment. 

I had these exact same thoughts and feelings twice in the last two weeks, the sunday before the football game, and then again on Friday morning after the christmas party. I had these thoughts but I didn't put them down. I said I was going to stop drinking, at least fucking TRY to stop for a while, and it lasted for three days after the game, and a single fucking day after the christmas party. I am powerless over this, and I need help. 

I need to get ahold of this now, when I still have time. To pretend that I can do it 'later', is naive and a fucking lie. I have ten years of awful experiences, close calls, and self-inflicted torment to pull from my memory that clearly tell me that this isn't working, and I need a change.

I need to try to love myself like I love other people, and try to be the person I wanted to be when I was a boy growing up. I'm not that person right now, but today I'm going to start trying.*",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,,True,t3_1anwmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1anwmj/90_days_sober_today/,

I don't know if you guys have experienced this, but being an alcoholic and being ~70 pounds overweight, I would almost always be sweating.

If it was somewhat warm out, or I did any movement above a slow walk for a short period, I'd start sweating.  I always wore a t-shirt under my shirt so that if I got hot, it'd absorb any sweat before my shirt started to show it.  And it worked well.

In the last 80+ days, I've started exercising, eating better, and not drinking.  I've lost 35+ pounds and had to buy new clothes.  Additionally, I no longer wear an undershirt.  I just don't get that unreasonably hot anymore.  Sure, I get hot.  I played tennis with my dad over the weekend and sweated my fair share.  But, instead of it taking upwards of an hour to cool down, I cooled down right away.  

Incidentally, I don't think this is only through weight loss.  Several years ago, I tore my ACL and went through rehab to get my knee better.  During that time, I got my weight down to 200 pounds (about 50 pounds less than I weight now).  And, I was still always hot.  But I was also still drinking like a fiend.  I think the weight loss + not drinking has helped me become a hotter version of myself that's just a bit cooler too.

I've been reading your inspiring posts for months, and I think it's time to share my own story. I've been trying every once in a while to make the first step and ultimately failing after the first couple days. At least for me, the 'kindling' effect was very real, and too much to bear so I would fall back into drinking ~15-25oz of spirits daily.

The past week's events have really shown me in some cases, the booze just needs to go. Period. I lost my job last Friday (unrelated to alcohol) which really sent me into a tailspin. I drank almost twice my normal amount over the next several days. This climaxed on Monday, which happens to be my long-time girlfriend's birthday. When she got home from work I was able to slur out a couple things before passing out. This, obviously did not go over well. The next day I was too ashamed to speak, but didn't drink. We finally did talk on Wednesday which was productive even though the withdrawal symptoms were already making me feel horrible, but I was committed.

Then yesterday I wake up early in the morning with chest pains, heart palpitations and most of the other onset heart attack symptoms doubled by the withdrawal. Called 911, got rushed to the hospital and all the rest. I stayed the day and overnight, and was given meds for my heart and withdrawal symptoms. After some tests the doctor comes in and warns that I'm showing since of cirrhosis on my liver, and most of my organs were poorer-than-average.

One thing I'll say here is that I was 100% honest about my past substance abuse. These people are there to help, and will get you the treatment you need if you give them good information.

Anyway, stop drinking or you will die was the gist of that talk. He was not condescending about it in the least.

In the end, it was not actually a heart attack but I came close. They also gave me a week's worth of medication to help safely detox from the booze.

So this is it. I'm only three days in but don't wait until someone tells you you're on the verge of killing yourself to get the help you need.

1358255209.0,44,self.stopdrinking,16m6a9,"""It's not fair!""",gibbertyflibbert,50,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16m6a9/its_not_fair/,"I was thinking today about how my internal sense of ~~justice~~ entitlement has been a key issue in trying to stay away from that first drink. There's a part of me that screams that it is unfair that I can no longer have the pleasure of liqueur ever again; whether that's a grand wine or the cheap and cheerful booze plied at parties to help you have a good time. It feels unfair that the odds have been against me. Anxiety, trauma and depression directly put me on the path of alcohol abuse. As such, I have permanently altered my brain chemistry and I will never respond normally to alcohol, but I had no idea that my binges and secret drinking would eventually result in that. It feels unfair that I've had trauma and sadness in my past. It feels unfair that I'm replicating the mistakes of my alcoholic family, that I should be pre-disposed, genetically, culturally, and in terms of my upbringing, to alcoholism. It feels unfair that I have to deny myself something other people can have with no ill effects apart from a slight headache in the morning or a depleted wallet. It feels unfair and - there's a genuine sadness in that - that the sweet social inebriation people can dip in and out of at weddings, Christmas, celebrations to help the good times go even better - is something that I can't ever, at the age of 26, do now, ever again. 



Then this morning I thought: life's not fair. Related to that: suck it up.




**I've realised that my sense that I should be allowed, even *owed* something the vast majority of people can have - i.e, a drink or two without it spiralling into blackouts, depression, and self-hatred - has been a major barrier in these first couple of months of sobriety.** There isn't an overarching ledger of justice that decrees everyone should be allowed to enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer without any repercussions. I can't have something other people can have. Big deal. In return, I get to learn how to be grateful for the things I do have. I have a family, and friends, and education, and enough money for food, to pay my rent, and tolerate my bills. I'm able to vote. I'm able to write. I'm able to walk. 




Recognising all of this has helped me start something: I'm able to take responsibility for my alcoholism because that means I can also take responsibility for my sobriety. No-one put a gun to my head and made me drink. Whatever other factors there were, I did it to myself. I was the one putting alcohol into my face. And there's been consequences. Now my brain has been altered, its receptors, its wiring, the way it releases chemicals, irrevocably. [""No backsies!"" says scumbag neurology]. No more alcohol, but not ""ever again"", because ""ever again"" is too frightening and too big a place to think about. Just no more alcohol today. And the next. And the one after that. And each day I don't, I'm making it an aim to try and be grateful: to erode the self-pity of the alcoholic, my sense of ""it's not *fair*!"" with gratitude for the things I have, for the things I haven't, and for the things I will now, with a corporeality not all sorrow-sodden with alcohol, be able to do.



Like with most things in life, [80s fantasy films (in this case, *Labyrinth*)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHpokki9sGE) articulate what I am saying better than I can. I've felt a bit like a Sarah in *Labyrinth*  (plot: bratty teenage protagonist accidentally wishes for her baby brother to be kidnapped by an aging and glitter-haired David Bowie, so I'm not suggesting it's a direct analogy for alcohol abuse), who spends a lot of her time yelling 'It's not *fair*!"" at various challenges, instead of trying to acknowledging that and trying to overcome them. I've spent these past few weeks stumbling around in a confusing, topsy-turvy, post-alcohol world, pouting about how it's not fair, and learning, essentially, how to grow up. 


**[TL;DR]** Sarah, in frustration: ""What a horrible place this is! It's not *fair*!""
Doors: ""That's right, it's not fair!"" (laughter)
Doors: ""...but that's only half of it.""

The other half is the best bit, I think. I think it means that once you admit life isn't fair, and that you have to give something up, that you gain something even better.  I think it means that the good stuff is still to come.

*Another Wall-o'-Text^™ from Ambivalent_Fanatic*



As we approach our 4,000th subscriber here on SD, I thought I would make this post especially for our newcomers and our lurkers.  You've joined a very powerful community that I truly believe is a force for great good in the world.  Together we've helped a lot of people get sober and stay that way.  I'm one of them.



If you are anything like the kind of drinker I was for most of my career, you probably suspect you have a drinking problem, but you're not willing to admit you're a full-blown alcoholic.  You have such negative associations with that word that it just isn't in your vocabulary.  You don't live under a bridge, you've never had a DUI, you aren't dying of cirrhosis—so while things aren't great, they're not nearly as bad as they could be.



For most of my drinking life, I imagined that eventually I would change.  But the flaw in my thinking was that I believed this change would only come after some major event that would force me to *grow up*.  And every time such an event would occur, I kept moving the goalposts.  These events were:

* turning 21 (because I thought drinking would lose its thrill once it was legal)

* graduating from college (because I would be out in the real world)

* getting my first real professional job (because I didn't think I could keep drinking the way I was and still function)

* turning 25 (because there was a time when this seemed really old to me)

* turning 30 (ditto)

* getting married (because that would magically make me an adult)

* becoming a father (ditto)

* becoming a father for the second time (ditto again)

* turning 35 (see 21, 25, and 30)



Each time I hit one of these markers, I would simply shift my gaze forward and wait until I hit the next one.  Meanwhile I had two long periods of sobriety of about a year each, from 18-19 and from 27-28, but I relapsed each time. I knew that I was ""struggling"" with alcohol, but I believed that eventually I would win the struggle.  I was wrong.   I thought that my self-awareness meant that I was ""working on it"" and that eventually I would work my way through to the other end.  I was wrong about that too.  



For an alcoholic like me, there was only one way to defeat alcohol, and that was to refuse to fight it.  I stopped struggling.  I stopped working on it.  One day, a month shy of my fortieth birthday, I stopped drinking completely.  No more trying.  No more thinking about it.  No more claiming that I was working on the problem.  I just did it.



Of course, it wasn't quite that easy.   What really happened was that my wife, whom I love beyond words, told me she was going to leave me and take the kids if I didn't quit.  It was a very painful conversation.  But that was when I realized that nothing was going to change until I made it change.  



That first moment of true honesty was tremendously difficult to approach.  But like all events we're nervous about ahead of time, it turned out to be not nearly as bad as I thought it would once I was in it.  In fact, it was tremendously liberating.  I didn't feel as if I was embarking on a great and perilous journey, like Odysseus sailing home through dangerous seas and fighting off horrible monsters.  I didn't feel as if I was taking on more than I could handle.  What I felt was overwhelming relief.  I didn't have to fight the fight any more if I didn't want to.  I could just drop the whole thing and walk away from it.   I wasn't taking on a burden.  I was putting one down.



So that's what I did, 812 days ago.  I've had many weak moments where I felt like chucking everything and giving in to my old self-destructive ways.  Sometimes I longed for the false satisfaction of succumbing completely to my disease and giving up caring what happened to me.  But little by little, I've made lots of baby steps in the right direction, and over time they seem to have added up to substantial change.  What I've really done is to choose life over death.  



I'm writing this partly to encourage those who feel they can't do it, and partly to remind myself of all I have to be grateful for.  Don't worry about the definition of the word alcoholic.  Forget about the word altogether if that represents a stumbling block for you.  Are you living your life the way you could be?  Are you in trouble with alcohol?  Are you a drinker who suffers shame, guilt, pain, loneliness, fear, anxiety, sadness, or depression related to your drinking?  



If so, please remember it doesn't have to be this way.  You can make your life what you want it to be.  You can do whatever you want.  But if you're like me, you can't do it with alcohol in your life.  You can't win the struggle against alcohol.  The only way to win is to refuse to play the game, one day at a time.  Today can be the first day you make that decision, if you want it to be.  We are here to help each other.  This is what we do.  And it really does get easier, as long as we stay honest with ourselves.


Much love to everyone—

I was never someone who had to drink every day, but when I drank I usually ended up getting wasted and doing incredibly stupid things. Looking back now I realize that some of the most embarrassing moments and behavior I most regret was always when I was drunk, from 18 to my 30's. Always the last one up still drinking at parties, or off to another bar after drinking with friends. In many ways I am lucky to be alive. It feels good to have some distance from that person, even if it is only 6 months. It was hard to not fall on bad habits, learning to deal with stress in more healthy ways, like running and exercising (I lost 30 lbs so far ).

The biggest difference for me this time, was really admitting to myself that I really did have a problem. I come from a family of drinkers, drinking is part of everything we do. Stressed out? Drink. Depressed? Drink. Happy? Drink. 

I had tried to quit before, but knew it was a half-assed effort and more to appease others than myself.  After one particular episode I realized that there was no way I would be able to accomplish what I wanted in life continuing to drink. I felt myself at the beginning of a downward spiral, if I went down further it would be even harder to get out and I would end up killing myself, or worse someone else. I took advantage of free counseling offered by my work, started an anti-depressant, I went to SMART meetings, I joined /r/stopdrinking and continued working with a counselor and also looked deeper at myself as to why I was drinking. 

AA did not work for me as I do not believe alcohol has a power over me, or that I need to submit to a higher power. It helped me to realize I need to take responsibility for myself. I now believe that if I put my mind to something I can accomplish it, quitting drinking is just the first step. I have regained my confidence, have a stronger sense of identity, integrity and purpose. I am not religious, but feel that I am reborn and have an opportunity to be a different person than who I was, the further I get away from that person over time the more I realize I don't want to be that person again. 

I am now a better father, husband, son, employee and human being. 

What is even better is that by being sober I can forgive myself and let go of the past, that alone has been a huge burden that I am slowly letting go of.  I still deal with thoughts about drinking, about being like everyone else and joining in the crowd after work with happy hour. But then I now know that being like everyone else isn't always the best thing, being who you are and true to yourself comes first. 

Thanks for being here guys, this subreddit helped me a few times when things were pretty dark. Now onto the 1 year mark!

I had thought he had given up on booze long ago, as evidenced by a loving wife and a bouncing baby, but I soon learned (as he confessed to me) that he, at 33, was up to ""a half gallon a day"". I knew he drank, but good lord, I didn't realize how bad it had gotten.

His doctor told him that he most likely wouldn't survive another year if he kept going. Everything was showing signs of shutting down. 

He went to an in-patient rehab center and fortunately, due to the professional help he got, (and the correct regimented dosing of drugs.) He survived.

And I say this because seizures and bed death were among the possible side-effects of his detoxing.

So 90 days for him. And he tells me that he is as naked now as the day he first arrived on earth. He can see how much he was going to lose. He is only gracious, and he, like me, and like some of you, knows that if he goes back to drinking he *will die.*

I gave him my number and told him that while we haven't been very much in touch, that that was going to change. I've set his number to a special ring tone.

I told him that NO MATTER WHAT TIME of night or day, to call me if 
there's temptation. Or to call for anything.

Quit cold turkey exactly that time ago, I have learned some points of interest along the way. 

The quick skinny on my situation is M/36, solo binge drinker, most of the time I drank alone and wanted to crawl in a dark place when I did.  Total downer and my brain was juiced with negativity most of the time. 

1.  Quitting was easy.  Sticking to it wasn't too hard, once I convinced myself that I have made the decision simply to choose other liquids to swallow. 

2.  The headaches disappeared after a week.  

3.  I loaded up on sparkling water, since I often drank out of thirst.  The bubbles helped my brain get fooled a bit, it really helped.  

4.  I am making much better decisions.

5.  I was concerned about libido; it's ok.  

6.  I love not being hungover on a Monday after drinking all day Sunday.  It's the best. 

7.  I am more focused on my work and I even get shit done around the house.

After working hard all day long on my apartment I road my bike, watched a movie or two and settled into bed giddy with anticipation of seeing my kids today and with a since of great pride of my sobriety and accomplishments to date...then...

I woke up at about 5am in a panic - the dreams were so vivid!  I drank, smoked pot, snorted coke, texted, called and emailed my wife 'fuck it all' type emails.  (when I'm intoxicated I go into fuck it all mode, which made it so real to me)  I woke up still in a daze and even found myself checking my email and phone.  It took about 10+ minutes for me to realize it was just a dream.

It was pretty much my dream job (and a dream job for most people there).  But, due to the market and other factors, the company ended up letting everyone go.

Many of us still get together at least once a year for happy hour (or other things).  This was the first time I'd gotten together with these people since quitting.  I was a *little* nervous about it, but felt confident that I wouldn't feel pressure to drink...

Turns out the first place we went to offers no food options.  So, I sat happily with a tall glass of... wait... my hands were empty.  I had a couple people offer to get me a beer (or something) and I politely said, ""No thanks.""  And, it went no further than that each time.

Later, we made our way to a Mexican restaurant.  As the nine of us sat down, everyone decided to get pitchers of Sangria (I used to love Sangria).  And, I pretty much stayed out of it until the person next to me asked if I wanted Sangria, too.  I just responded with, ""I don't drink."" (She has seen me drink before many times).  Her response to me, ""OK."" End of discussion.

When it was time to pay the bill, I realized nobody even noticed that I didn't drink.  Because we split the bill evenly and nobody even mentioned that I didn't have any of the Sangria.  I *almost* said something, and then thought: having it not be a big deal is worth a few extra bucks.

I had been prepared to say things like, ""Oh, I quit drinking 5 months ago because I had been drinking too much.""  ""Well, I felt like I was losing control of my life, so I needed to make a change.""  ""No one event led to this...""  But, it turns out, none of that was necessary.

Here are the biggest changes I've seen happen in/to myself over the past week:

* *Sleeping more:* my drinking sessions always went hand-in-hand with late-night dinners while watching mindless entertainment. I always went to bed between 1am-3am, depending on how early I started drinking that night.  Needless to say, the following mornings weren't very productive. Most mornings this past week, I've woken up early enough to cook myself breakfast and enjoy a cup of coffee, wondering to myself, ""so this is what normal people do."" It's different, but a good kind of different. 

* *Reading more:* finished three books I've always wanted to read in the last week. Once I finished them, I sadly thought to myself, ""it really didn't have to take four years to get these done.""

* *Exercising more:* simple push-ups in the morning for now. But something fundamentally changed in the way I view my health now. Yesterday, I had my first doctor's appointment in three years. (Cholesterol wasn't that great, but will get better. Thank goodness, everything else was fine.) Forgot I had multivitamins in the house the entire time, so I took one this morning. I don't know if I can reverse all the damage I caused to my body, but I'll try. Health is wealth. 

* *Daydreaming more:* I used to be a dreamer. I used to have a lot of good ideas, high expectations for myself and a reach-for-the-stars attitude. Drinking stole that away and exchanged them for instant, short-lived gratifications. Not only do I have the time back, but I also feel the person that was buried so deep is also slowly clawing back now. What will I do with all that time? I don't know exactly, but I think I will start working on those dreams to becoming tangible realities. 

I guess the big question that's occupying my feeble mind is, *""can you become a better person than you were before?""* As simplistic as that sounds. I know for plenty of people on this subreddit, the answer is a resounding ""yes."" Your success stories humble me and motivate me. But as for me, I am in no position to answer that question until I actually get ""there."" Like many of you, I'm fighting the biggest challenge of my life.

It did not go well. ,TimeForTheTruth,48,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/15p4rs/told_my_close_relatives_i_had_given_up_alcohol_it/,"**Background:** My problem is that, after one drink, I cannot stop. Now, that could mean I can’t stop until I black out and wake up the next day, or could mean I drink throughout each day for days or weeks. Any excuse to drink. My behaviour in the past has made me ashamed and frankly I suggest I’m rather emotionally stunted as a result of heavy drinking since early teens. Upset? Drink. Happy? Drink. Crying? Drink. Grieving? Drink. Deal with any emotions/thoughts? Na, pour another. I always knew I would have to give up completely one day as its having a bigger impact, but figured – “hey, you’re young. Enjoy yourself”. Except, this is not enjoyable. 


Anyway, I have a social event coming up with friends. I shall not be drinking. I haven’t decided whether to tell them or not as they’re heavy drinkers and I know at least 1 will pressure me, so I may feign drinking to keep them off my back. I intend on looking after them (where I live is…dodgy). 


Christmas was tough. I was pressured by my family (along with insults, jokes about how alcohol companies will not stay in business, ‘just have one sip’, ‘you’re no fun’) but didn’t relent. I did it! I was (and still am) a bit of a mess but taking one day at a time. I mentioned it to the family when discussing about the friends reunion and was met with narrowed eyes, a slightly tilted head and the expectation of a punch line. My explanations were vague, granted, but they arent that aware of my drinking. Due to shifts, we’re awake/asleep at different times, we generally stay fairly distant from each other  and getting wasted every night is acceptable (unless vomit is involved) if anyone so wishes in this residence.  


**The responses included:**

“Just go out drinking this one last time though. Stop after that if you want. If not, continue drinking”. 

“If you’re worried about money, I’ll give you some for taxi, drinks ect”

“You’re young. This is what you’re supposed to do”

“How about I buy you more alcohol, seeing as I noticed you threw away a few empty whiskey bottles recently”

“Well, I’ll buy you alcohol and keep it away from you…that way I can moderate for you” (Had to explain I’d simply drive and get more)

“How else are you going to enjoy yourself” (in response to me stating its healthier too)

“You’re too young (21) to decide to give up. I did the same [drinking] at your age”


**One positive comment:**

“You have more will power than me!”. 

And now I regret saying anything. And now regret giving up. Maybe I decided too soon. But honestly, I’ve had these thoughts constantly since I quit. The “its not bad enough yet” thoughts. Oddly, refusing drinks is so much easier for me than the self doubt, thought processes, craving and fear. 


My friends say I have a reputation for being a drunk. I drink more than them, and also drink differently to them. Saying no to them is more demonstrative of ‘she’s changing her ways’. 


My family? Not drinking is insane. But for the first time in my life, their perspective actually seems illogical to me. Sometimes.  Tiny achievements amongst floods of adversity I suppose. 

Out of interest, how did other peoples families react when told?

Here's the thing...I have reached a goal today that I thought was pretty much unattainable (a bazillion failed attempts) and I thought I would wake up feeling great.  My vivid imagination had me thinking that I would wake up this morning feeling like I was king of the world...that there would be parades in my honor...pinatas, clowns, jubilation...blue skies...bluebirds singing there congratulations everywhere I go.  BUT I woke up tired after a piss poor night of sleep.  Feeling let down by this being just another day...not a bad day, not a good day, just another day (where's my fucking parade?).  I then started down the wrong street mentally.  I started thinking hmmm maybe I'm not an alcoholic (20 years isn't that long for a 36 year old) maybe I should celebrate today...it's my day off after all...I owe it to myself...I can always quit again.
FALSE...IT'S A TRAP.
I caught myself.  My head is a bad neighborhood and I was strutting around by myself.  I needed to come here and vent.  This helps.  Writing this stuff (thoughts, feelings) helps me realize that I am not thinking straight.
So anyways....I'm going to lead my own parade, I'm going to treat myself today.  Yummy food, lots of soda, halo 4, and a nap :)

Recently it has gotten to the point where I drink almost every night, usually 5-6 shots of vodka, upwards of 8-10 on weekends.  It's embarrassing to even sit here write this out, makes me realize how serious of a problem I have/had.  I would wake up almost every morning with a hangover.  

Throughout the whole time, I still managed to hold down what would be considered a successful life to outsiders.  I have a good career, pay my bills every month, own a home, and have 3 healthy, happy kids.  Over time I felt like my relationships were starting to dull out - even with my kids.  I was still there to help with their homework at night, or play games with them in the back yard, but in the back of my mind I was always thinking about getting drunk and ""relaxing"" later on.  

Weekends were the worst.  Sometimes I'd black out and sleep in till 1-2 pm the next day.  I would feel like total shit coming downstairs at 3 in the afternoon and seeing my kids all laid out in front of the tv with nothing better to do than watch Sponge Bob all day long.  I felt like I was wasting my life, and that of my children as well.

My wife would drink with me, and we both recently have come to the realization that despite our denial for a few years, we have developed a drinking problem.  We have both committed to quit and are going to make sure we keep each other in check.  We cleaned out all our alcohol and yesterday was our first day.  I just wanted to write this all down as sort of a symbolic break from all that and hold myself accountable to the commitment I've made to myself, my wife, and my kids.

I've decided back than that this was my last hangover and I'm glad I've did so. [Here's my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/uzmmj/game_over_28/) from that day.

25 days passed and I'm very happy. My relationship with my family is great, everybody knows now and respect my decision about alcohol. My friends say that I'm very ambitious but they are very wrong. Quitting alcohol is not about ambition. Quitting alcohol is about building a better future for yourself, quitting alcohol is about finding yourself and conquering your own fears.

For everybody that's just starting and feeling down, you can't imagine how many good things can happen in a month. Don't try to quit alcohol forever, as they say here, just focus on today and repeat. Or just made a 30 day challenge. After this first days the benefits will determine you to quit forever.

I've read some questions about what to do on a Friday or Saturday evening if you're afraid to go out. First of all I have to mention that I'm not afraid to go out, as a matter of fact I love to go out and stay sober because I'm realizing how stupid and unattractive I've used to be. I'm still unattractive but I'm working at this :)

Here's a good advice. I don't know if you like chess but I've started to study it seriously. My dad beat me and this triggered a desire to study the game in order to take my rematch. But after a few days I've felt in love of this game. So most of the time, Friday and Saturday evening I'm reading books by Bobby Fischer or other Grand Masters. That's why I haven't checked reddit lately. This game is keeping my mind busy.

Maybe for some of you it sounds boring but I consider chess a good way to awake the dead drowned brain. It's great to see the progress that you've made.

All the best and thank you for your help from the first days. They were truly hell

I downloaded Craig Beck's *The Alcohol Lied To Me* almost immediately and it seriously just changed the whole way alcohol occurs for me. I read Allen's Carr book afterward and I didn't find it as effective, but maybe because I'd just read TALTM. 

I don't know how to describe my experience without it sounding a bit unbelievable, but over the years I would take a month a year off drinking, and the whole time it would be an absolute struggle, like I was missing out while everyone was having fun, and as soon as my month was up I'd be straight back into the partying.

Halfway through reading the book, I was out at lunch with some friends and they were sharing a bottle of wine. Normally I would have a couple of glasses but the whole scenario suddenly looked very different to me - I started to see the wine as the 'attractively packaged poison' that Craig describes in the book. I saw how socially acceptable it was to share this poison around the table, and how much agreement there was amongst everyone that this behaviour was normal - that it's normal to put this liquid in our bodies and alter our state of mind when we are out at lunch. And then I saw it everywhere. I went clubbing with some friends and saw how ridiculous drunk people look, how stupid and unattractive they are. I saw how much money people dropped on it. It just seemed surreal. I haven't craved a drink since then. 

I know that there are so many ways that a person can look at alcohol, but seeing things this way has made my sobriety not only easy but I feel so happy to not be in the trap anymore. I feel powerful around alcohol and I only wish that this way of thinking was more prevalent in our society. So many of my friends complain about not having any money, all the while spending a good chunk of their budgets on alcohol. I don't spend any money when I go out now. My wallet thanks me for my choice :)

I don't know if this is very uplifting for anyone, but I just wanted to recommend this book and share my success.

If anything I thought of myself as a connoisseur, seeking out the newest and best craft beer or cocktail bar or single malt, or what have you. I drank frequently, but never felt like I was struggling to moderate my drinking, or to avoid getting wasted or hungover without good cause. And when I decided to quit altogether, it wasn't much of a struggle either.

After giving up alcohol, I'm a lot less certain about a lot of things I thought I knew about my drinking and my life. And I've arrived at a couple of conclusions specifically on the relationship of alcohol to self-discipline. This is anecdotal of course, but I'd be more inclined to keep it to myself if I didn't hear the same sentiments echoed throughout the recovery community.

Those conclusions can be boiled down to a pretty simple hunch: if you drink regularly, in any quantity, it's probably undermining your self-discipline. And it's hard to realize just how pervasively, how insidiously, it's working against your goals until you try going without it, at least for a little while.

I don't mean to sound like Carrie Nation's hatchet here, I'm keenly aware of the positive aspects of alcohol: as a highly evolved expression of culture and craftsmanship; as a social lubricant and point of connection between people; as a warming, contemplative comfort after a long day of responsibility. What I do mean to say is, you don't have to be hitting the liquor store three times a day, or spending your weekends in the drunk tank, or puking in the bathroom at work, to at least pose the question of whether your life might be improved by the absence of alcohol. Especially if you're a part of this subreddit, looking to improve your life through conscious effort.

Alcohol is a cheap thrill. This is true as a simple matter of brain chemistry. It hot-wires your brain's reward system and drives off with it. And whereas your brain normally tends to cooperate with self-discipline, saving that precious squirt of dopamine or endorphins or oxytocin for moments of genuine success, or effort, or connection with another human being, alcohol turns that equation on its head. Those positive activities become relatively less rewarding; the carrot at the end of the stick gets smaller.

For me, there was an almost tangible sense of my reserves of willpower replenishing themselves after giving up drinking. I found it easier to exercise self-control, to follow through on commitments, to take possession of my emotional states, in every aspect of my life. I no longer struggled (as much) to not overeat and to exercise. Books and articles I had been meaning to read for months were finished and placed back on the shelf. I felt productive and engaged at work, instead of bored and put-upon. I realized how many relationships I had been neglecting or taking for granted. It was like the volume was suddenly turned back up on the rest of my life.

And that's without even talking about the surge of energy. This is something people talk about a lot in connection with sobriety, having more energy than you know what to do with in the early stages of recovery. Two weeks after giving up drinking, I had so much energy it was hard to sleep. Not that kind of awful, bleary, twitchy insomnia. I wanted to be up and about and getting on with my life and doing things. If I'm being honest, it felt a little like that first hit of cocaine, except this was my body creating that feeling naturally. My days suddenly seemed to have more hours in them. 

And that brings me to my final point. Consider how much time alcohol costs. Consider how long you had to work to make the money you're drinking. Consider the hours, days, months, spent feeling, if not hungover, then just kind of off, sluggish, down. Consider whether the bars and liquor stores you patronize are places you would consider spending a nanosecond if they didn't have alcohol. Consider whether the Good Times you had with your drinking buddies seem nearly as good in retrospect as they did at the time. At best, it's all time not spent working towards your goals.

My point here is not to claim that everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, or will become an alcoholic. That's obviously not true, and many people find it not difficult at all to drink and stay disciplined in pursuit of their goals. But my hope in posting this is that at least a few of those people are inspired to ask the question: might it be easier to live a disciplined life without alcohol? A lot of people are in circumstances and communities that can make it difficult to even formulate the question.

At the very least, consider taking a break from alcohol, if only as an experiment in self-discovery. Do it for a weekend, or for two weeks, or for a month, or whatever makes sense to you. I promise that at least some part of the experience will surprise you. And if it turns out to be harder to give it up than you thought it would be, know that [help](http://aa.org/) is closer than you might think.

**TLDR;** Even if you're not an alcoholic, it's easy for alcohol to undermine your discipline without you realizing it. Consider taking a break, or giving it up for good, to find out whether that's true for you.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,1371238180.0,,,True,t3_1gcvao,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gcvao/dont_let_alcohol_get_in_your_way_xpost_from/,

So, I'm now waiting to get some e-help (same therapist, but now only contact via a website).

Drinking for me often resulted in unexpected consequences. In hindsight I guess none of the consequences should have been fully unexpected, but I was blinded by poison and so they always felt unexpected the next day. Maybe it was a $200 bar tab on my credit card. Oops. How about damaging a relationship. Whatever, forgive and forget right? Maybe I'd do something or say something embarrassing. Who hasn't anyway? Maybe I'd black out and wake up on the floor of my bedroom (how the hell did I get home?), and, ouch, there's some cuts and bruises I didn't really need. But seriously, they heal, and I wear pants and long sleeves to work anyway so big deal right? The point is, every time I drank it was like spinning the roulette wheel of unexpected consequences. Finally though, I got the blinders off and recognized the pattern.

Now that I've been sober, I'm starting to experience a completely new set of unexpected consequences. Something here, something there. My motivation to do constructive things has been improving greatly. I've had a slight anger problem since I was a teenager and though it's never been detrimental, it's something I can gladly do without. Improved motivation has encouraged me to take the necessary steps to understanding my anger and keeping it in check. My relationship with my S/O (never bad to begin with) has gotten even better. My sleep has improved. I feel more confident. My anxiety is way down. The future excites me more. I am encouraged to try new things. Life is just... better.

I quit drinking because I was scared as hell. I was scared for my health, I was scared of where I was headed, I was scared of unexpected consequences. Now that I've been sober 35 days I can actually look forward to unexpected consequence. I hope all of you in the early stages like me are experiencing the same thing.

I've lurked here a bit every now and again, thinking to myself, ""Man, I hope I never get to the point that some of these people have.""

Guys, not only am I at that point (not as extreme as some of you, admittedly), turns out I've had a home there for quite some time.

I hit the ground running at year 21, building momentum and tolerance to the point where a few days ago on my birthday, I went through an entire bottle of Jameson 12-Year (my poison of choice) in one night. Waking up the next morning was hard. I had the morning off, and decided I would take, you know, just one more shot.

After a few more one more shots, it dawned on me that I may have a problem. It was, after all, almost noon, and already my head was swimming.

I was, at the time, using FaceTime with a beautiful girl. Even though she goes to school six hours away, she has been a powerful presence in my life for a while now. I met her last year, and we'd hit it off from the start. Words flew between us like doves, and we recently became more serious. Between you and I, r/stopdrinking, I think I'm in love.

A couple of nights ago, after ending another FaceTime chat with her, I dozed off for work the next morning. Around 7:30am, she texted me and told me we had to talk about something (no more dreaded a phrase exists in the human language). I sat down and chatted with her over Facebook. She told me that I had blacked out and called her at midnight. I was rambling, incoherent, sometimes rude, and (she granted) funny at times. But I was floored. When I got home, I checked the bottle I had opened just the previous night. I had drank through most of a standard large bottle of whiskey.

So I gave myself an ultimatum. This girl should be livid or scared of me. If I was a man on the outside looking at the situation, I'd advise her to leave. But she's not angry. There is no negativity coming from her. Only concern, love, and care, none of which I deserve for being so careless and negligent.

I've decided to stop cold turkey. It's been 48 hours since I last drank, and I poured what I had left down the drain. I'm done with it. I expect it to be difficult, but I think I can do it. I have a large support group, and I'm resourceful enough to fill in the gaps.

I always thought alcohol made me smarter and more confident, and I certainly felt so after a double or two. But I clearly can't control myself, and if I don't do a 180, I risk losing this girl I care so much about. She's given me a second chance, and I plan on getting myself to the point where I feel I deserve it.

If you read my novella in its entirety, thank you from a sleepy aspiring writer. I you didn't...

tl;dr - Check the title.

Never again.,,46,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/124hxk/woke_up_shoeless_and_injured_in_an_alley_never/,"I have wanted to stop drinking for a while, but I thought I needed a wakeup call.  I wouldn't recommend that approach, because when I got the call it could have left me dead.

I am 38, married, and a father.  I have been a high-functioning alcoholic for my adult life.  Last week, my company had an Oktoberfest celebration, a big gala in a giant tent at a farm.  I live a long way from work, so I booked a hotel, and a ride was provided to the event.  Things started fine.  During the dinner I was seated with my boss, which helped me keep things under control.  After that, I felt the need to loosen up a little.  I hit the sauce pretty hard and before I knew it the party was over.  I found two other people that were still interested in drinking, and we ended up going to a club.  That's the last thing I remember.

I woke up in an alley behind the club at around 5 the next morning.  It was still dark and I was still drunk. My major concern at the time was that my shoes were missing.  They were brand new, and the most expensive shoes I'd ever bought. I looked around for them but they were gone.  Fortunately, I still had my phone and wallet on me, so I called a cab and went back to the hotel, passing out in bed.

The next morning I woke up at 10:30, feeling like hell.  My wife had tried to call several times over the course of the night.  I was supposed to meet her and some friends for apple picking that morning.  I called and told her that I had just woken up, and quickly got dressed and went home.  When I looked in the mirror I noticed that the tip of my tongue had turned bruise-black.  I could make out teeth marks where I had bitten it.  Later, I noticed that the top of my head was bleeding.  The skin had been scraped off in a circle about 3 inches in diameter.  The best I can surmise, I fell on my head which caused me to bite my tongue.  

When I went back to work on Monday (still feeling horrible), one of the guys from the club asked me what happened to me that night.  I just told him I went back to my hotel.  He said, ""That's funny, because I thought I saw you being escorted out of the club by two big guys.""  Embarrassed, I told him that the end of the night was fuzzy for me.  I'm not sure why I was thrown out, but I was probably getting sloppy.  Maybe I broke a glass or something.  I also have a tendency to be a smart ass when confronted with aggressive people.  But it seems that I was possibly thrown out and landed on my head, causing the injuries.

The one thing I have been certain of since that day is that I am through with drinking.  I simply cannot control it, and it has put me in danger too many times.  I love my wife and kid, and they are the most important thing in my life.  For their part, I am lucky that they have been so supportive.  I am eager to regain their trust.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,,True,t3_124hxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/124hxk/woke_up_shoeless_and_injured_in_an_alley_never/,

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/s8qax/went_to_my_first_meeting_today/) was my first post, April 13th 2012. And that same date is written on the first page of my AA big book. I'm an aetheist but don't let the god stuff bother me. When I first went to AA I was in the frame of mind where I'd do ANYTHING to quit, so I am doing just that.

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for all your help along the way SD. Here are some of the things that have happened to me thus far:

1. Stopped drinking and more importantly have no desire to drink.
2. Got a great job
3. Am generally not an asshole anymore
3. No longer filled with rage, shame, guilt and depression
4. Have been sleeping like a baby every night
5. Blood pressure returned to normal
6. No more tingling feet
7. No more dry heaving in the morning
8. Lot of extra spending money
9. People are nice to me now for seemingly no reason
10. Lost 20lbs. 
11. Have plans most weekends instead of drawing the blinds and drinking myself into a coma. 
12. Have told my family and they've offered their support

I think there's more I could write but you get the point. Everything can change, we just have to be willing to put in the work to make it happen. 

My life is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but at least I no longer have to hide in my apartment afraid to confront my problems. And I'm not killing myself slowly with alcohol. I feel so much better I imagine that if I met my old self I wouldn't even recognize him.

**47** pounds lost, with blood pressure, resting heart rate and cholesterol not only back to healthy levels but ""athletic"" according to my doc.

**12** times, at least, where I could reflect back on my old life and be grateful for what each new month had brought.

**3** kids with only faded memories of what ""sleepy Dad"" used to be like, kids that have a full time father back.

To anyone on the fence about just starting out, I quote myself from 180 days:
 
&gt;You might wonder why your life is in a holding pattern, why it seems like an endless Groundhog Day repeat of grey moodiness, missed opportunities and growing regrets. You wonder what kind of super human strength others must have in order to get up every day and make the consistent, small pushes towards goals that add up to life sized achievements. You know you're stuck in a downward spiral and you suspect you know the way out but you’re just so unsure of what happens next, full of questions and choking on fear.

&gt; Start by stopping. 

&gt; Just don't take that first drink for one day. Go to bed sober and see how you feel when you wake up. Take that next day and vow to get through it without the first drink. Set a goal and see where it takes you, maybe try 90 days, one day at a time, and promise yourself you can always get your misery back if you want it. Sure, there are lots of things you can obsess about. What about my friends? What do I do for fun? What do I tell people? How can I get through a stressful time? Do I need a therapist? What program should I use? Is it even a good time to try this? What if I fail?

&gt; Start by stopping. Just that.

&gt; When you begin to show up in your own life everything else will fall into place. 

I can't tell you the joy that comes from showing up in your own life, it's worth every sacrifice I've made and difficult time I've gone through. If you're on the fence, I pray you have the courage to begin, the strength to endure and the perseverance to lay a sober head down each night.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,1340451737.0,,year1,True,t3_vh9xy,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/vh9xy/a_year_in_numbers/,

We've had more than 200 new subscriptions today, so I thought I'd post a quick note of greeting and you a bit about our community, and to communicate some important things to keep in mind while participating in discussions here.

[/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) is a place for redditors to support and motivate each other in dealing with problem drinking behaviors. We welcome anyone who wishes to join, whether you're here to ask for or offer advice, share stories or just talk with others who are going through the same thing you are.

Everyone who is looking to change their problem drinking behaviour is welcome here, no matter what their race, religion, creed, gender, sexuality, recovery method, or favorite spice girl. It's that welcoming, open atmosphere that has made this such a valuable and important resource for so many people.

To maintain the open, welcoming atmosphere, it's essential that we treat everyone who posts here with respect. As you post here, you will encounter people who may think differently about recovery than you do, or who follow different recovery methods. If you find yourself disagreeing with someone, then please find a way to express that constructively or just ignore the post and move on. 

There are as many methods of getting sober as there are people trying to get sober. Whether someone chooses to attend AA meetings, use talk therapy, rely on the support of  friends and family or retreat to a mountaintop for 12 years of silent meditation, they are welcome in this community. Understanding and respecting that diversity is an important part of the character of [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking). 
  
We are all here for the same purpose: to deal with problem drinking, and to get support and advice from others who are going through the same thing. If you can keep that in mind, then you'll fit right in!

Also, we do ask that people try their best to only post here when sober. There are many people in this community who are struggling day-to-day to stay sober. Please show respect for them and their recovery and the rest of the community by refraining from posting while drunk.

That probably covers the most important points.  I'd encourage you to make a post and introduce yourselves! The more you contribute, the more you'll get out of the subreddit. 

I hope you'll find this a welcoming and supportive environment. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact the mod team! We're also friendly and welcoming!

I had my usual tonic and he ordered vodka on ice. A few hours later he's on his fourth drink and he's already a bit tipsy( he hadn't eaten anything all day, so that had something to do with it too, I think). At some point our company is joined by my boss's brother. The guy not knowing who he's talking to, starts saying all kind of stupid stuff, things you would share with your pal. I was watching the whole thing from a distance, escalating to a disaster. I recognised the pattern (ordering a hard drink with no kicker, drinking way too fast, not having the control to stop or pace yourself), and I thought how happy I was not to be *that* guy. My boss heard of this (of course) and he was clearly not happy at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the guy doesn't stick with the company for too long.

One of my pet peeves is high pressure salespeople. I loathe their smarmy tactics to wrestle me out of a buck. Fuck those people. And fuck my brain and its smarmy tactics to try to get me to the liquor store. 

I wish I could remember who it was here that introduced me to that phrase so I could give credit where credit is due. It's because of them I'm at home sipping Perrier and lime instead of poison. 

Have a great weekend, everyone. 

ETA: This seems to happen all the time! Whenever I get cravings worse than usual and I abstain, I seem to get rewarded. This is like the third or fourth time something unusually awesome happened to me right after I make the decision not to drink. This morning it happened to be spontaneous sexy pics from my crush.

(Throwaway because the person I'm with knows my reddit username, and I'd hate them to find out how I'm feeling now through reddit.)

Not drinking for a few weeks has lead me to think that I may have a drinking problem.

I, for the last year have really took a control of my life. I quit using cocaine at the end of last year, focused on my work, my broken relationships with family, started to look after myself, quit smoking, limited getting drunk to a few times a week and in the last few months, it's really stepped up to a whole new level, I felt amazing, and so I decided to give up drinking for a little bit. Got it down to once every two weeks. More because I've been so focused with work, and trying to get into a routine, I haven't given myself time. I need to be able to wake up, and give my day 100% without a hangover.

I broke up with a guy I was with during my ""dark days"" because I just couldn't hold it together. And we decided to get back together long distance a few months back, and I was overjoyed, I had fond memories, he said all the right things about getting back together. We got along so well. Or so I thought.

So he comes to visit, and we go out, and I refrain from my usual drinking when he arrives because I'm up at some ridiculously early hour the next morning for work.

It was like sitting with a whole other person. I was looking at him thinking ""oh my god, are his clothes even washed? I made all this effort, and he's sitting there looking homeless. Does he smell? ew, oh god don't touch me"". Conversation went no where because this time I wasn't a rambling drunk, when he did talk, it bored me senseless. Also realised that he has a weird habit of cutting conversation dead when it starts to flow. He was rude. He was creepy. He was embarrassing.  

And then it hit me. He'd always been that way. But every time we were together, I would feel so uncomfortable, and embarrassed by his behaviour and feel like time was standing still in his presence. So I'd find an excuse to go drink, and then he was tolerable, even fun to be around. I didn't mind the disrespectful touching which I knew garnered concerned looks from onlookers. 

I tried again that weekend to go out with him, but it was the same. Plus he started to become hostile about it, taking me to a dry bar to make a point about me not drinking, and then taking me to a normal bar and trying to force me to drink. 

I went home and thought that night. I hardly slept. Most of the relationships I've had, I've had to drink to make them bearable because I didn't really find myself wanting to be with them, or them good to me in anyway, ~~but I felt lonely. Or not good enough for people I was interested in.~~because no one in their right mind would get involved with a mess, and I've been having to get in relationships for a long while in return for my booze, things I need generally (and formerly drugs) being paid for. I've had to drink to kill the horror of these people forcing themselves on me. I feel like I've had to basically let these horrible creepy men, who i'm not attracted to have their way for whatever reason, and had to get drunk or high to do that. 

I've saved as much money in this few weeks, in the first few weeks I was clean. I didn't realise I felt like the walking dead constantly. I've been compromising myself to the point where my skin is crawling. 

I quit drugs, and didn't realise I have an alcohol problem that is doing the same thing to me. Except my family are more supportive of me having ""just one drink, it won't hurt."" than my past drug use.

Hell, I assaulted my closest friend a few months ago drunk, and I don't even remember. (surprise surprise we're not speaking anymore.) I've never done anything, ANYTHING, like that in my life.

People haven't been laughing with me, they've been laughing at me. they think I'm a drunk. 

So yeah....I guess going back really isn't an option. This is day one I guess of sobriety.

We have kind of a fancy bathroom and stock toothbrushes, hair stuff, deodorant, etc. because a lot of clients use it and also we stay real late sometimes.

Anyway, I walked in to take a pee and it smelled familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on just what.  

Then it hit me.

Listerine.  It smells like Listerine.

Where have I smelled this before?  Why is it catching my attention?

In 2009 I was put into inpatient for an eating disorder.  At the time,  I didn't know I was an alcoholic yet, but we still attended meetings and I was told I had a ""problem."" 

Being locked away from all other people besides patients and all of my coping mechanisms, I was desperate for a way to escape.  I don't know how I got them to buy me Listerine, but they did.  I remember drinking it from the bottle before AA meetings.  

I remember not being able to keep so much of it down and throwing Listerine up into the sink.  Puking mouthwash is something I hope you haven't done and never have to do.

The funniest thing to me about this is at the time, it seemed totally logical.  

Now with sober eyes,  I'm like, ""Did I REALLY FUCKING DRINK LISTERINE?!""  Yes, yes I did.  I was that sick.  

I promise this post has a point and isn't just war stories, so here it is:  Even almost a year into my recovery, I am reminded of my previous self.  She is not gone, the alcoholic me, but she is managed by my new coping skills, which don't include alcohol.   She still remembers everything I put myself through, and she is waiting happily for the day I decide I am fed up and go back to the bottle.

But that day will not come, because when I smell Listerine, I don't want to drink it.  I feel a flood of warmth that I don't need it.  All that smell is is a memory of my past, one I never have to repeat.

When I got the call that he was sick I hopped in my car and drove the 10 hours to be at his side. My sister and I took care of him, washing, giving medicine, bathroom, cleaning… until the end.

My father broke contact with my sister and myself for so many years because he didn’t think we could find it in our hearts to forgive, but he was wrong. It took a major illness and a call from a hospital nurse to prove to him that his family loved him no matter what.

Because I have been taught to be honest about myself on a daily basis, to the best of my ability, I have to say that today I am a little bit in the weeds and feeling overwhelmed. I am facing a situation that causes me a great deal of fear. In the Twelve and Twelve it talks about two basic types of fear: fear of losing something I have and fear of not getting something I want. The fear I have today is both at once. I am afraid I am going to have to make a trade that will result in me not only getting a crappy deal but one in which I will feel completely cheated after trying to do the right thing.

I realized this only about an hour ago, because I took an inventory, the way I was taught.

Not only am I projecting out of today, I am only imagining the things that can go wrong, rather than hoping for the things that can go right. I am living in the problem, not the solution.

So what can I say about being sober for thirty years? I have learned to face my fears and do what I have to do anyway. Maybe this is the reminder of one of sobriety's greatest gifts to me, the gift of freedom. I am free to be paralyzed by fear, but I know the eventual end of that, one way or another: drinking and death. Or I can take one step at a time, one day at a time. Gather information. Ask about other people's experiences. Make informed decisions (or as informed as possible given the absurd nature of the universe). Realize that I have the right to make mistakes, especially when I'm learning (which is always). I have the right to change my mind, especially when I get new information or experience. 

I have the right to live in the day and go where it takes me. 

Fear doesn't have to be my master today. When I got sober, I couldn't imagine a life without fear. I couldn't imagine living on my own, holding a job, having a home, anything that adults frequently do without complaint. I couldn't imagine life without being completely anesthetized, and the further out of it I could get, the more unconscious and helpless, the better I liked it.

Today I can or have done all of these things I couldn't imagine, and more. It's because I came to Alcoholics Anonymous and learned how not to drink a day at a time. I learned how to be a sober alcoholic who isn't captive to the horrors of her imagination. It isn't always easy and I'm often not graceful while confronting fear, but it's the only way I know how to be free.

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1g0k08/2535_yo_alcoholics_just_starting_out_can_we_band/) just ten days ago, after I attended my first (underwhelming) meeting.  The TL;DR for that link is it's a grumpy post about how everyone was too old and how maybe we younguns on Reddit could band together and be there for each other, especially since a lot of us are probably feeling isolated and it's fueling our drinking.  That's definitely the case for me.

A few days later, despite that show of defiance, I realized I was pretty badly fucked up.  I'm a 5'3"" 125-pound female but was regularly consuming ten ""standard drinks"" a night in the form of two bottles of wine or 375 ml of whiskey or gin.  The hangovers and general state of impairment caused me to abuse my prescription ADHD meds to stay alert and functional, so I was in a pretty vicious cycle of my formerly-helpful meds and formerly-lovable booze joining forces against me, and was a jangling, jittery mess of being tossed between their two extremes all day without a modicum of obvious impulse control to stop me.

So last Friday, I told my parents, with whom I've been staying since my bad breakup that sent me off the rails earlier this year, that I had a problem - which was rough, as they are sheltered suburbanite types who had no idea and are teetotalers.  They handled it better than I expected, but it was a shock to the system right there.

We mutually agreed that detox was a good idea; frankly I was desperate for it, because the drinking had long since stopped being fun and I knew it was ruining my life, but couldn't make myself stop.

I did an inpatient program (I was lucky - great program, and really loved both the staff and the other inpatients) and stayed there for two days, from early Saturday to Monday afternoon.  The mere act of ""drying out"" was extraordinary, since it had been so long that I'd gone more than 12 hours without a drink.  I made a few friends out of my fellow patients that I'm still in touch with.  We're going meeting-shopping together.  I haven't slipped up and have only had slight cravings when something reminding me of my breakup has crossed my radar.  Liquor ads don't bother me, which I know is rare - just wedding ads/FB engagement announcements and the like.

Anyway, for those who are scared to 'fess up or intimidated by detox, I know not everyone is going to have as great an experience, but I am very glad I did it.  I also am glad that you guys suggested meeting-shopping on my last post, because it really is true - every meeting is different, and stumbling upon a lame and alienating one my first time out is not reflective of the entire organization.  I did SMART Recovery, which was both the lame meeting and the helpful one(s) I've found since then.

I've tried to go to a meeting each night, though there are none in the area tonight so I'm going to try to power through my usual Drunk O'Clock with the power of TV, books, and the company of my family who are doing a little ""baby-sitting.""  I felt pretty lame being an adult woman back home with her parents and having them look after me, but after detox and meeting hardcore drug users in detox (who, like in the movies, all had hearts of gold - your mileage may vary; I do not recommend seeking out smackhead friends on this basis) in various stages of alienation from their family members, I treasure mine more than ever.

Anyway, I probably sound a little silly right now since I was so vitriolic in my last post but am all fuzzy-wuzzy about recovery right now.  It's early, and I don't know, realistically, what I can and can't maintain long-term.  But the last time I touched a drink or the pills was a week ago tonight, so tomorrow morning, it will have been one week without alcohol in my system, a first not just in the past 4 months of depressed binge drinking, but the first generally in five years.  (I was a happy high moderate/low binge drinker pre-breakup.)  And fuzzy-wuzzy or not, it does feel good.  So feel free to take it for what it's worth, AMA if you're just gearing up for a change and want to know about detox etc or whatever, but most importantly, thanks for reading, because as I figure out how to put things back together - rebuilding a social life now that I've moved, going out and getting my own place, etc - it's nice to be able to talk to folks about it on The Internetz.

I guess the real six months is technically tomorrow (6 months after November 18), but, shoot, I can't argue with BadgeBot.

It's been a really awesome ride.  Just yesterday I had to answer the question of ""Have you lost weight? Like a **lot** of weight?  And recently?"" six times!  It feels awesome.  Just this morning, my wife said, ""I see what people mean... you look... **SKINNY**!""

Besides that, I think I handle frustration and stress a whole lot better than I ever did.  I now take a moment to make sure that I'm not overreacting because: I didn't sleep well, Jim &amp; Pam were having troubles, my dog is sick, that cloud is a little grey, someone cut me off, ...  Maybe what's bothering me at that moment isn't really what's bothering me.  And reacting to what's in front of me might not be the best idea.

Not drinking has been relatively easy (so far).  I know I'm not special.  And I know that there will be a time when I'll get that stupid idea that I can drink responsibly again (I have already had weak thoughts like that).  But I know that if I do have ""real"" thoughts like that, I need to reach into my ""recovery bag"" and use some of the things that [SMART Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/) has taught me.  And, most importantly, use the resources I have at my disposal: r/stopdrinking, #stopdrinking (webchat in the side bar), private messages with people I've grown close to, talking to my therapist, and, most importantly, talk to my wife.

I feel like 6 months is a huge accomplishment.  I hadn't gone 6 months without drinking since I was in high school.  And, it's become routine.  I'm just someone who doesn't drink.  I have no problem telling people that the catalyst to losing my weight was ""quitting drinking"".  If the response to that is ""Oh, yeah, I stopped drinking during the week too"", I say, ""Oh no, I had to stop completely... I was drinking way too much.""

Not to exclude anyone, but I really wanted to thank offtherocks and Ambivalent_Fanatic.  You guys were there early in my sobriety and really helped set the tone for the kind of non-drinker I wanted to be.  I can't thank you guys enough.

I think it's really important for people starting out to try to humble themselves and use the resources they have in front of them.  You don't have to be an ""AA-person"" and exclude your other options.  Use anything... everything that works for you.

Recently I took a medical exam and discovered I was at an elevated risk for heart disease. All of the test results indicate my liver and kidneys aren't as functional as they ought to be... From high uric acid and triglycerides due to the kidneys not working right, to low HDL cholesterol due to liver not breaking stuff down right. All of the medical examination data say the same thing- too much alcohol everyday. And this is long after I quit...

Fortunately it looks like the kidneys can repair themselves to a certain extent, and eventually the liver from what I've read. 

Just makes me wonder what the results would have been if I had taken the test while drinking as heavily as I used to. Permanent physical damage is scary stuff. Especially self inflicted damage. 

So glad I quit damaging myself in a bad way. Now off to the gym to damage myself in a good way. Stay strong and healty stop drinking superheros!

That day at work I found /r/stopdrinking and read a thread about beng in denial that resonated with me so deeply that I had to just look up a meeting and go -- all within the span of one hour.  I meant to just 'check it out' while still 'trying to moderate', but it turned out it was a chip meeting, so when they said '24 hours' I couldn't help but speak up.  They also gave me a copy of the Big Book.  When I got back to the office, I got a badge here on /r/stopdrinking.  And it's just been getting better since then!

I started off telling two of my best friends that I knew I was an alcoholic.  I told everyone else that I was on a 'detox', and within a week I was telling everyone that I was doing a 30 day dry spell.   Tomorrow I'm going to tell everyone that I've just started not drinking for good, and that boozing is no longer a part of my life.

Tomorrow I'm picking up a copy of Allen Carr's book.

The past month has been incredible -- my productivity has shout through the roof, and the mere experience of doing everything sober has been incredible.  I know I'm still floating through the pink cloud but hope that meetings &amp; this subreddit will keep me focused.

We picked up a few hundred subscribers last night, largely because [this heartbreaking post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14evxu/lady_paid_for_a_bottle_at_the_liquor_store_and/) was the #1 post on all of reddit.  I was chatting with needmorecowbe11 about it via [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/?nick=pick_a_name), where he observed, ""it's odd how one person's relapse may have helped a bunch of people open up to sobriety.""  Poignant.  Cowbell's pretty bright for a Michigan fan. 

It's an important reminder that sharing our stories, both the good and the bad, helps others to help themselves. That's all we do here - we share our stories, our triumphs, our failures. We tell others what worked for us, with hopes that it will help them find what works for them. 

The aim of this subreddit hasn't changed since Franks wrote these words one year ago:

&gt;As we go forward, beyond 1000 users, to 2000, 5000, or 10,000, I hope that we can remain true to the spirit of the subreddit. To make sure that we are open to anyone who wants to get control of their lives and tackle their problem drinking. That we can make sure that everyone feels welcome here no matter who they are, where they come from or what methods they're using.

In the sidebar, you'll see that badgebot has a number after its name.  That number represents the total number of sober days on all of our badges. Right now it stands at 1,146,144 days.  That's a collective **3,140 years** of sober time for /r/stopdrinking members. It blows me away.

It all started when I was really young and just slowly escalated into something I couldn't control anymore. I have to amount my success to my loving family. 

My parents confronted me and offered my treatment after I was a victim of sexual assault and was beaten to a near pulp (I barely remembered anything because of how intoxicated I was). I refused. They never forced me to make any choices I didn't want to, but they always left it on the table. I tried to stop by myself and went to one AA meeting on crutches, with a broken nose, and two black eyes. I never wanted to be so far away from a place before. It was hell. I felt like I could never relate to these people. After that I forget almost everything for several months. I just woke up one day out of my daze and went back to my parents for help. I don't remember exactly why I chose to sober up that day. It might have been a rough couple of weeks, maybe I was broke, maybe i really thought I needed help.

I call my mom and dad and tell that I will go. Within 3 days I was off to detox. I hated the place they sent me to. Forced religion down my throat (it doesn't help everyone) and the recovery coaches demeaned us by calling us women ""fucking cunts"" ""disgusting"". The only plus was that Kelly McGillis was one of my coaches and held me while I cried. Detox was rough. I'm sure I also sent many letters to people and I have no idea what they said.

I was really unhappy at this rehab and didn't want to move past detox. My family did some research and were able to get me a spot at G&amp;G Holistic in Miami on a ""scholarship"" and insurance covered most of it. That place saved my life. I didn't feel like a freak, cut off from the world, and they offered many different ways to look at spirituality that didn't make me give up my (non-existant) beliefs. I still have a hard time accepting a ""higher power"" other than myself and I don't think I will ever. I believe that I can keep myself sober and I have done so successfully.

About 60 days after I finished treatment, I met my boyfriend. I didn't know how to bring it up that I was an alcoholic/addict so I just blurted it out 2 minutes into meeting him. He gave up alcohol that day and has supported me ever since. It has been a journey and everyday brings on new challenges to confront. Every time I feel like giving up on everything, I remember those people who supported me. The fear of losing myself AND them is what keeps me on the right path. 

Just wanted to share a bit. I don't attend AA meetings anymore, and only NA meetings randomly. They're a great tool for people, but not everyone. We all recover and sober up differently.

1350725310.0,42,self.stopdrinking,11sj44,I am a /r/stopdrinking CHAMPION. Seriously.,,47,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/11sj44/i_am_a_rstopdrinking_champion_seriously/,"It's about 2AM right now, and I just got home from a fun night out with friends where *everyone* was drinking except for me. When coming home at the end of the night and slipping my key into my apartment door, I realized how *good* I felt. I hadn't fallen asleep during the cab ride home, I didn't stumble up my driveway, I didn't jab fruitlessly at the keyhole until I successfully made it in, and I was blissfully sober and happy after having danced and been to several bars with friends while meeting tons of new people.

To top it all off, last weekend, I had a backstage pass to a music festival where anyone in the VIP section had access to free alcohol -- cocktails, beer, wine, whatever! Guess who didn't drink? :) There was also free booze available tonight (I was sitting at a VIP table setup where they have those Orange Juice, Cranberry, and Vodka buckets spread out), but I passed on it all. While everyone was trying to get alcohol in their system to work up the courage to dance, I was already out on the dance floor boogying. I had *so* much fun!

I'm just so proud of myself. I'm at 103 days, and I've been in several situations now where peer pressure has almost pushed me into having a drink, but I've always resisted.

I think a lot of my resolve has to do with the whole ""streak"" thing. Knowing I've reached 100 days just makes me want to keep going. My friends think I'm strange because it's not like I've ever been an alcoholic or had a problem with drinking (they think I should at least have *a* drink every once in a while), but I dunno -- something about being completely clean just feels *good*.

I'm just so happy. I work out every day, I feel good about myself, I'm in great shape and I'm not sitting around poisoning my body, I've picked up tons of new sober hobbies, I'm not blowing my cash on alcohol, I'm not stressing out over what bars I'll visit during my weekends or wondering what I should do for happy hour anymore, I feel like I have way more energy than everyone around me, and I just feel *so* sexy and attractive. I feel like I *glow*. At venues where I should be drinking, it's so fun to just talk to new people while I'm sober. I feel completely in control of myself, clear-headed, and like every decision I make is *my* decision rather than liquid courage or inhibition-blasting alcohol persuading me to say or do dumb things that sober me would never do.

I love being in control of myself. I love not drinking. I love it.

I still have this little nagging feeling in the back of my mind urging me to have a drink, telling me that I'm missing out on something that has the potential to be wonderful if done right. But I've learned to ignore that little voice. Instead, when I feel the need to drink while I'm out with my friends at drinking-friendly venues, I order something to sip on like a glass of soda or water with lemon. And while I'm sipping on that drink, I notice how drunk everyone around me is getting while I remain sober, and it's almost like this *power* trip. It's like, jeez -- I'm probably the only person in the room who is in complete control of herself right now. It just makes me feel *sexy*.

I don't really know how to explain it, but I enjoy the feeling of sobriety while around lots of drunk friends. Once I get this feeling, it completely crushes the voice inside my head that's been telling me to drink. Once I feel the power of sobriety and see the people around me getting sloppy or acting like morons, I feel grateful that I didn't drink, and happily continue to sip my non-alcoholic beverage.

I'm not sure how long I plan to continue being sober, but I think the best thing for me right now is to continue putting myself in situations where I'll feel tempted to drink, all so I have more experience in rejecting alcohol when it comes up, and seeing how good life can be without it.

I have a faulty belief that just because I'm sober now, bad things won't happen. And I erroneously think that because I'm working the steps and gradually cleaning up my wreckage, nothing significant will ever resurrect itself from my past and stir up trouble.

Well, for awhile, I've been limping around and dealing with painful hip arthritis. Last weekend, I had to go to the ER with sudden, intractable hip pain that struck out of nowhere and turned me into a blubbering, incoherent idiot for hours, until there was enough pain medication on board. The ER doc couldn't say specifically what was up, so he referred me to our state's top hip specialist.

Today, I met with the specialist's PA to see what kind of rehab I could do to hopefully prevent another attack like that. He showed me an x-ray of both hips and said that my arthritic one was trashed and needs to be replaced. No amount of therapy is going to change that. But what floored me is that the PA believes that the problem is **avascular necrosis (bone death) due to excessive alcohol consumption.** He thinks that the acute pain I experienced was the femoral head collapsing and throwing all the surrounding muscles into spasm.

I *already know* that I have a tendency to underestimate alcoholism. Forewarned is forearmed, right? NOPE. My disease catches me unaware and unprepared time and time again.

I haven't regained a lot of stability in my life since getting sober. I'm desperately under-employed and only make ends meet thanks to help from family members. I don't have health insurance, so I'll need to research whether I'm eligible for any kind of assistance (Medicaid, state, charity, etc.).

I guess I'm running at the mouth here because I feel fear knocking at my door. I get real stupid real fast when I'm in pain or in fear. I'm not gonna drink or throw it all away with pain meds. But this is not the time to be my usual reclusive self and avoid meetings or talking to anyone at all. ""Better out than in, I always say.""

I know I'm fairly new to being sober compared to many wonderful people here, but I want to share a little piece of advice for people starting out.  What worked for me is not putting myself around alcohol, period.  I don't go to bars, parties where there will be alcohol, or restaurants where a lot of alcohol is served.  This takes a conscious effort and I will go to these places again someday in the future, but only when I'm used to sobriety.

In some ways thinking about these things is exciting, but in other ways depressing, and in other ways frightening.

I kept thinking about it and the more I thought about it, the faster my thoughts seemed to spin. I got home and showered. My boyfriend left to go spend time at a friend's. My mind started going over every high I've ever experienced and lamenting that none of them were available to me right now. My scumbag brain just thinks it's *so* unfair that I can't get buzzed at all. No pills around, no weed due to job search, no alcohol, no cigarettes!

My brain is pissed off and now it's just getting belligerent. It doesn't want to do anything I suggest. Read? No! Write? No! Workout? Fuck no! Already I'm eating cheese from a ziploc in the fridge and I don't know why. I reach for a bag of chips...

And thankfully all the work I put into not having the same weight problems as my mother steps up. My ""training"" kicks in. My hand is on the chips and I pause.

*Why are you eating?*

I'm hungry.

*Are you?*

A quick evaluation of my body reveals that I am not.

*Then why?*

I feel like it will make me feel better.

*Okay. Will it?*

I remember the last time I ate to feel better. It didn't work.

*What will make you feel better then?*

I don't know. It feels like nothing will.

*Then it doesn't matter what you do.*

And for some reason this thought releases me of all responsibility to make myself feel better which, ironically, makes me feel better.

*Maybe if you slow down and relax it'll come to you.*

And I took a deep breath, and I put the chips down. I put some water on to boil, prepared my tea pot, and sat down on the couch. I breathed and I just let myself start to cool down. I stopped hassling myself about all the things I wanted or needed to do. And soon enough I was feeling a lot better.

Once I'd slowed down and cooled off, it turned out I did want to do something after all. I did a half hour yoga workout, and then read a book. I felt sane and safe again.

I'm sharing this moment because it reminded me that my body falls into unhealthy patterns when I'm stressed out. My thoughts snowball until they're utterly overwhelming. It's a destructive habit that doesn't get me solutions or results, and ends with unhelpful, desperate, impulsive decisions (like running out for a six pack).

If you find yourself doing this, stop the snowball in its tracks. Get in the habit of asking why you're doing something, and if the thing you are doing is helpful or not. Take a deep breath, chill the fuck out, and stop making demands on yourself.

I want to stop thinking

I'm tired of this shit, this whole being aware thing. I just want to drown. For a while, just a little bit I swear...

I just lost my job. I should have lost it 3 months ago, but now there is no reason for me to lose it. Or there shouldn't be. Quitting drinking was supposed to solve everything. It didn't, because I have issues, and running from those issues is what got me to the point of having to stop, anyway.

If I really thought I could moderate and take care of myself, then I'd go get myself a cider today. However...that feeling of wanting to drown tells me that I am not ready for that.

idk.

stupid.

I just want to stop thinking.

EDIT:

I'm a SMART advocate. So...I'm going to do some smart homework here real quick.

**Cue/Trigger**

I lost my job. The job that gave me a notice that helped me realize I needed to be sober.

**Craving**

I want to drink because I don't want to think about my situation. I want that feeling of carelessness, where my happiness trumps everything else. I want to be free to be happy. I want to slap a bandaid on the holes in my life.
(this is the stage I'm hovering at)

**Urge**

The crisp, cool taste of a cider is (incorrect belief) the ONLY thing that will make me feel better.

**Act Out/Use**
(here, I will think about the consequences of using)

Because I am trying to drown out an emotion, I am unlikely to be content with just one drink. I am unlikely to be content with cider. When I think of the most effective way to get to the mental state I want to feel (a bit sloshed) my taste buds cringe. Actually, all of me cringes. I've taken to tasting the things I ingest, and it wouldn't be easy to return to that tasteless state where I can drink shitty booze straight.

I also can think about what kind of attitude on life this form of denial implies. I dream of becoming a parent, a teacher, a role model. If I can't buck up and look for another job, then who am I to tell a struggling child to ""try again"" when they fail?

.

.

**Beliefs about urges**

*unrealistic:* this urge is unbearable and it will only stop once I give in.

*realistic:* This is uncomfortable, and I don't like it, but it will pass. My nervous system will eventually stop noticing stimuli (or lack thereof) and if I distract myself by doing productive and engaging activities this feeling will pass sooner. Emotions are like tides, and I need to ride this one out.

.

in a little bit i'll try to make a spreadsheet for an urge log the way the new handbook has it and record this urge. if i do this i'll post a link for y'all. also I'm sitting in the chat.

* Thinking about the next beer 2 sips into a fresh beer.
 
*  A feeling of greed for more alcohol and more of a drunk.

*  Impatiently watching other people finish their drinks so I can ""acceptably"" order another
* Having a few drinks before an event or sneaking drinks at an event so people don't know the total number I've had
* Drinking more than I intend (happened more and more frequently towards the end).
* Structuring social events around drinking.
* Being jealous of others who could drink normally and harboring resentment towards those who didn't drink as much as me because I know they judged me
* Having to time each drink to avoid blackouts

In late June, I went camping by myself (alone=trigger) and jumped off the wagon. I thought I could climb right back on, but I descended in a very predictable way.  Two weeks later I drank again, then one week, then every few days, and then right back to daily. It has now been 74 days of nearly daily drinking. 104 days was relatively easy, but now I'm having difficulty putting 2 days together.

I write this only to caution those of you who have a few months sober and may start to wonder if you can moderate your drinking now.  Don't try.  There's something very powerful about that first drink, discarding your commitments to yourself, disappointing the people around you.

I hit bottom again on Friday as I stood in line at the store waiting to buy beer for the long weekend with my five year old loudly announcing to everyone within earshot *""Daddy, you're not supposed to drink beer anymore!""* Goddamit she was right and I wanted her to shut up so badly so I didn't have to face it.

Today I'm renewing my commitment. 24 hours. I'm humbled and I want to stand tall again.

I don't know if you guys remember me posting a couple weeks back, about being in Vegas and wanting to have a plan to stay sober, because I was worried about drinking there.

Well, it didn't go so well. I went out to dinner with one of the advisers to my company and I ended up drinking that night. I should have told him that I wasn't drinking right off the bat, but I wanted everything to go well because he's an important contact for our company, and I think just being in Vegas had triggered me as well.

Well after that I stopped posting here. I think because I'm a mod and because at the time I really felt like I was under a microscope it was easier to just walk away from it than to come back here and reset my badge and to admit that I slipped.

I didn't fall right back into old habits. I had that one night of getting drunk, and then I thought, well I'll just go back to not drinking. I kinda wanted to hide behind the shield of ""what happens in vegas stays in vegas,"" but it didn't quite work out that way.

A couple weeks later, I was going to watch some movies with friends, and I thought, maybe I'll get a few beers. So I got four beers and I drink them with my friends. They knew I had quit drinking, but I thought I was going to be in control, and they are supportive and I'm pretty convincing when I want to be. Well that went alright. I had my four beers and went to bed. And I was thinking to myself ""Maybe I can do this controlled drinking thing after all!""

Of course a couple nights later, I decided to stop back into the bar I used to go to, ""just for a beer"" after work. Well that night I ended up getting so drunk that I threw up walking back from the bar. I made a terribly awkward drunken pass at a friend of mine and I still feel completely embarassed by it.

Then the next week, I stopped by the liquor store and picked up a couple beers, just to drink by myself. Then that saturday I went out and got drunk and ended up hanging out with some friends who are basically bad news. Ended up doing coke and getting home at 6am.

Then last week I drank probably 4 or 5 days, and ended up hanging out with the same group of people again.

I feel terrible. I feel stupid. It's really hard to come back and post here again. I feel like I've let all of you down, and I'm sorry for that.

I guess there's nothing else to do but to start over. I hope you guys will forgive me for not being a great role model. 

When I quit drinking, my goal was to do six months of sobriety and then I'd let myself think about trying to drink normally again. I think that when I got to six months (which was in January) then I felt like I could give it a shot. 

It's really hard starting over. I don't have that same ""I'm gonna conquer the world"" feeling this time. It's just not drinking again. That's it. 

So, yeah, I'm back. And I'm trying again. I'm up to three days now, and I think that's pretty good. I still haven't completely gotten my head into a sober place yet. I definitely feel like a dry drunk, and not someone who's really actively in recovery, but I think that's all I can manage for the next few days.

I think my main goal right now is to get some sober time under my belt, restabilize and then start working my recovery again. My roommate's away and I've let the dishes pile up. I desperately need to do laundry. So I think I'm going to dedicate tomorrow to doing some self-care. Trying to get my apartment clean and give myself a clean, safe, healthy space to start working on getting better.

Again, I'm really sorry for letting you guys down. I'm really looking forward to coming back.

It was in reference to a rather minor thing that happened at home, but a year and a half ago, before I quit drinking, it would definitely have been an issue.  I realized that this little piece of wisdom that popped out of my mouth unbidden was actually far more than just a few casually expressed words.  It was a reflection of the state of mind I have slowly and gradually entered during the last 547 days of sobriety.  And I decided I'm going to say it a lot more often from now on.

I don't mean to imply that I am simply not going to let anything bother me any more.  I am not Gandhi or Superman.  But I firmly believe that repeating certain phrases like this can bring the intention behind them to the forefront of the mind, and that the more we repeat them, the more firmly entrenched they become in our thought and behavior patterns.  So, the more I repeat to myself ""I am not bothered"" when something is actually bugging the living shit out of me, the more I will become aware of my higher self, the part of me that truly is not bothered by it, the part of me that wants to live in serenity and acceptance.  And the closer I will come to truly not being bothered.

In Sanskrit, the term ""nirvana"" means ""the place of no wind"".  I have always taken this to mean a state of being in which no disturbance has an effect, not because we are bulletproof, but because we have learned to bend like the proverbial sapling before the storm.  The way of the warrior, according to Carlos Castaneda, is the path of least resistance.  The path to bliss is the practice of acceptance.

I drink frequently and heavily.  Finishing a bottle of Jameson in an evening is pretty normal for me.  If not that, 8-12 beers does the trick.  Maybe less if there's someone around to judge me.  I used to hide it to an extent, but now people associate it with my name.  And no one has a problem with it.

I'm a high-functioning alcoholic for the time being, but how long can that really last?

I've always loved alcohol since I first tried it (around ten years old, sadly).  I was slamming vodka like water by my mid-teens.  Life without booze was just so boring.

About two months ago, I realized that I can still regain control of this situation.  I'm only 26, and I'm headed down a really shitty road.  So I got rid of all the alcohol in my house on Sunday (I poured most of it into my head).  But today is Saturday.

Holy shit, this feels better.  It isn't easy by any means, but overall, I'd recommend it.

What finally was the tipping point was Sunday night. My SO and I went out to a party, and I had some wine. No big deal, didn't get into any trouble. But the thing was, on the way home, I picked up a six-pack of beer and slammed it right away. That switch was thrown.
 
Started getting the familiar anger about being so stressed at work, started feeling woe is myself, started getting an attitude. The next day I was hungover and a little snippy.
 
So last night my wife was up at 2am; I had gone to bed early because I was exhausted, woke up to an empty bed, found her downstairs by herself just worried about me... and she said something that really hit home: She said that the kiddos noticed I was drinking Sunday night and were worried that I started drinking again. That made me feel more ashamed than anything else I ever have done. What made me feel the worst was that she said she loved me and would support me, was completely understanding... that I had been drinking for years and that it was bound to happen again. I think I would've felt better if she yelled at me, but instead of anger, it was sadness. Just sadness, trying to understand why I drank again, and telling me that the kiddos *knew* I was drinking and asked her if I had started again, because they didn't know what to do.
 
She's so darn supportive and understanding that at times I don't believe I deserve her.
 
So I requested a badge reset for Monday.

I just celebrated the second sober birthday I've had since I started using alcohol. The feeling I have right now is amazing. It's something I never thought I would ever experience again. My life is a lot easier, but its not perfect by any means. I still have a lot of debt that I acquired during my 10 year bender, but I'm making progress on paying it off now.

Prior to this run at sobriety I had never put together more than a month of not drinking and I had white knuckled it the whole time. When I'd hit the 30 day mark, I was usually off to the races. This time I took advice and did what I was told. I went to meetings every day for 90 days, I talked to a sponsor I met in out patient therapy who is now one of my best friends, but most importantly I focused on the present.

Today I don't have collectors calling my phone, I'm not dodging my apartment manager because my rent is late, I haven't called anyone in over a year to apologize for something I can't even remember doing, and I keep being honest. Things don't change over night and life isn't going to be perfect, but its a hell of a lot more manageable. 

A week after my one year I lost a close cousin to cancer and 15 minutes later I received a phone call that my four month old Godson had passed away in his sleep. Not once did drinking come to mind. The only thought I had was how can I be there to help. That was huge for me, I was finally able to be there for my friends and family when they needed me the most. Never again will I be so selfish.

If I can do it, I know everyone else can. The best advice I ever heard was you can't get drunk if you don't take the first sip. Over a year now, and I still don't want to.

Stay sober everyone. Life does get good. Amazing, actually. And you won't even see it happening until your heart wakes up and sees what your work has created!

I'll leave you with a few promises, with pages to reference where they appear in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.

1) The story of how one hundred men and women have recovered from Alcoholism. (title page)

2. WE, OF Alcoholics Anonymous, are more than one hundred men and woman who have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. To show other alcoholics PRECISELY HOW WE HAVE RECOVERED is the main purpose of this book. For them, we hope these pages will prove so convincing that no further authentication will be necessary. We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living has its advantages for all. (Forward to First Edition)

3. On the other hand - and strange as this may seem to those who do not understand- once a psychic change has occurred, the very same person who seemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of ever solving them, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for alcohol, the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules. (Doctors Opinion)

4. Nearly all have recovered. They have solved the drink problem. (pg 17)

5. But, there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful. (pg 16)

6. The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us... The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join in brotherly and harmonious action. This is the great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism. (pg 17)

7. There is a solution. (pg 25)

8. But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it. (pg 25)

9. We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed. (pg 25)

10. The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe. (pg 25)

11. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. (pg 25)

12. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves. (pg 25)

13. We, in our turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of drowning men. What seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, ""a design for living"" that really works. (pg 28)

14. Further on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered. (pg 29)

15. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

We all have problems why bother fixing them?  I could die tomorrow anyways.  I'm a fun drunk.  I can sober up another time.  My friends drink way more than I do.

And then this happened: http://imgur.com/yE83P  

I went to my first meeting as an alcoholic.  I've been to many before supporting family members.  Tonight one was celebrating 27 years.  When it came time to do the chips I was terrified, I'm pretty sure the only reason I made it up there was my HP giving me a high-octane kick in the ass.

When I got up there the man asked my name, gave me my chip, and hugged me with a huge smile on his face saying congratulations.  On the way back a few members shook my hand and smiled.  I started welling up.  Then I sat back down and my brother, dad, and his girl friend all shook my hand and told me congratulations and how proud they were.  

I have never felt more proud of anything in my life than I did right then.  I felt good.  I earned this, I worked at it, and by god, I'm fucking worth it.  More handshakes and congratulations followed the meeting.  I was feeling really nervous and anxious so we left after a few minutes.

As I write this I'm looking down at this chip and the tears are coming.  I can't believe it's been thirty days.  Thank you everyone here.  You've helped me more than words can ever express.

I wish you all another 24 sober hours.

I need to adjust my expectations and realize that life can actually just be this fun without booze (and single, too).

I met up with a friend to go salsa dancing at a local nightclub.  I'd only ever been to this salsa club before while wasted off my ass and never been able to successfully dance.  This time I danced with at least four or five random guys and was actually able to pick up the rhythm of each person and have interested human interactions for four or five minutes at a time.  Some of the guys might have been drunk but I wasn't!

After a couple hours there (wow... staying on the dance floor at a bar for two hours) I realized that another close by bar was closing and I wanted to check out their music before the bar closed.

After bar closing time I hit up a house party.  This was at like 3am and instead of being wasted, I was totally alert and able to have funny, interesting conversations with several new people.  I also didn't feel weird or awkward around people I already knew.

Made it home and into bed by 5am on Saturday morning after having spent less than $10 to dance and socializing and party my way across town.  If I had still been drinking I probably would have just gotten shitfaced at the salsa club, done a terrible job dancing, and not even made it to the late night house party to meet new people.

I'm kind of in shock over how easy it was to not drink and to still have a ridiculously fun Friday night!",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month6,True,t3_1jn154,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jn154/wow_what_a_fun_and_sober_friday_night/,

Weird.",Cordless87,49,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1i7jou/after_5_years_drunk_i_am_now_5_days_sober_weird/,"Back in August 2008 I left on a Round the world trip covering the US, Asia, Oz, and NZ. I am now 25 years old and have been living in Germany almost a year. 

From day one of my trip, I was on holiday, and that mindset stuck until last Monday (08/07/2013). Of course I had to work to pay my way and I believed that the routine, of getting up and going to work before I poured as much beer down my neck - meant I was not an alcoholic. 

There were very few days where at least a bottle or two would not my lips, but heck, I was staying in backpackers surrounded by others doing the exact same, who was to say I had a problem. I began to notice I may drank a few too many looking back through my previous few months photos tagged on Facebook for 90% of them to contain some sort of Alcohol in my hand or in my close proximity (Empty bottles lying next to my lifeless body) Yet still - ""Holidays"" (A word shouted by a few of my close drinking buddies (alcoholics) as an excuse for us to drive at 6am still drunk from the night before to stock up for the day)

This is where I should have realised, the way I make up excuses even to trick myself into thinking - yea, why not. So this pattern continued everywhere I went, I would meet fellow drinkers who were exactly the same. I never stopped to think that most of the travellers I met, were just away for 6 months to a year who had there money saved up to party. I, on the other hand, had no prospects, no plans on going home to Uni, and just wanted to carry on having fun (drinking) 

In the end I met a German girl in NZ which resulted in me leaving my drinking buddies behind, having a 1 month huge bender in Thailand on the way home blowing all my money and arriving in Germany - to find the beer here is even cheaper than Asia if you know where to look. It did not take long before her family realised I was drinking daily over 3 litres of beer - to which my reply - ""I'm Welsh, its fine, done it for years"", which was pretty much true, and normal to me. After a few months binging and spending the remaining for my British money I left at home, I started working in McDonald's. If I was not an alcoholic before this, I certainly was after. Basically, I was the little Welsh shit that would do the shit jobs because he cant speak German. I survived two months, saved some cash and told them to stick it.

Its been about 3 months since then, It has been hard to find work as I don't speak German so I had a lot of free time... what to do... Yes of course.. Beer stopped really doing it for me at this point, took too long, still costly. Moved onto the Spirits and the 10% Faxe beer.. what a mess. Problems began to arise in our relationship, I was make decisions on where we went depending not just on the availability of alcohol, but drinking partners. Times have gotten quite lonely in Germany, turning to the bottle seemed a good way to escape, at least for the day, and the next and the next. 

- This is the changing point in my life -
This went like this for a while until last Sunday. Had an argument with the misses over going back to the parents, yes I can drink - but still don't like to be wasted around her mother. ´So any ways, she went home and I thought it would be fun to neck a bottle of vodka, buy 3 10% 1 litre cans and head to the last day of a Reggae festival. Long story short - Very drunk, police asking me questions, I lie (I wanted to know why they need my name, I had done nothing wrong) The ran it through and told me I don't exist, me being drunk and rowdy - ""Fuck you, I am sitting here, don't tell me I don't exist"" (cocky not aggressive) This is the point they slam me to the ground face down and saying ""fuck you ay"" whilst trying to restrain me, I guess they thought I was resisting as 2 more decided to jump on top and try to strap my hands together. This was brutal - serious - bruised eye, lump on the back of my head, huge bruises on the back of my arms and near my armpit, and still 6 days later I have no feeling in the back of my left arm. It feels like biting your tongue after anaesthetic, you feel something but its not feeling as you know it. I was taken to a police station where I had sobered up heaps during my ordeal and asking them why I was being arrested. They told me I was drunk and ""helpless"" and they were doing it to protect me! I showed a different officer my bruises and said how is this protecting me?? He simply shrugged it off, didn't give a shit. They then took me to a larger police station in the city, stripped me down and stuck in a single cell. I rang that button 20 times before getting a reply - ""What do you want, more alcohol?"" I asked for water, he replied ""50 minutes"". In the end I spend 10 hours in a locked cell with 1 cup of water and no food. I could not call anyone to let them know where I was, my bag was still at the festival which got stolen and the whole time in there knowing - I am only in here because I was drunk. I felt more helpless than ever at this point - and never want to feel so useless again. They let me out at 4pm the next day when my girlfriend came to pick me up, the breathalysed me at 12pm and said that I was too drunk to leave. This was ridiculous to me and replied ""Walk into any bar, breathalyse everyone and lock them up here with me because I never knew it was illegal to be drunk, we have to warn people!"" Again, the new officer replied it was because you were ""helpless"", so I show him my bruises and say helpless people don't need handcuffs to be take away and certainly not excessive force resulting in this. He simply ignored it and close the flap. I signed one piece of paper to get my lighter back (my only possession, to which I had no pockets and must have been carrying it, helpless?) No further action will happen from the police but the whole experience was very new for me.

So any ways, sorry Its a bit long winded. To be honest I have a fair few crazy (now somewhat entertaining) stories of my last 5 years drinking, but there for another day. I am going to a BBQ this evening with the half side of the family I have yet to meet - apparently all big drinkers and one or two other alcoholics, I thought it was going to be difficult, but now after writing all this and remembering enough is enough. No more excuses for a little sip. I need money. I need my health. I need my life back.

Post of accomplishments in 18 days sober, both selfishly looking for affirmation and altruistically hoping this post inspires someone unhappy with his/her drinking habits to find happiness.

18th day sober. I have to be at work at 11am, so I set my alarm last night for 10am, then decided I'd rather get up a little earlier, make breakfast and start the day off on the right foot.

Instead, I'm awoken at 6am by a series of emails regarding some drama in my fantasy baseball league, and can't get back to sleep. Instead of rolling around angry at my lost sleep for three hours as I normally would, I got up, stretched, brewed some coffee and ran day 3 of the C25k running regimen. Ran down the Hudson river, greeted a beautiful day, got home, stretched out for 20 minutes while I drank my coffee, then made an omelette which I'm enjoying now. I've got two hours before work to send some emails and watch a few episodes of Arrested Development. 

In addition, over the past week I've completely organized my bedroom. My dresser/wardrobe had been an unorganized pile of clothes, so I threw out anything I hadn't worn in 6 months, organized everything, and bought several new outfits with the money I've saved by not drinking. Then I rearranged my entire bedroom to make space for a dart board I've been procrastinating setting up. I bought a hamper, as I'd grown tired of the ""Laundry bag on the floor"" method. I bought some scented candles. The new layout looks great and clean, and my bedroom is a place I'm happy to spend time in and have company see. I went through piles of papers which had been piling up, I discovered, for over 5 years through about 9 different apartments, throwing away things I no longer needed and organizing what I did need/want to save so I could access them when I wanted. 

I'm using the ""Things"" to-do app on my phone again, which I've guiltily ignored for a few years, and when there's something I need to do, I fucking do it. I don't say, ""Yeah, I'll do that soon"" while I crack open a coors light or head to the whisky bar around the corner.

Let me start this off with I know I am a fuck up. I know the things I do are completely innapropriate and dangerous. I know there could be major consequences for my actions, but, I continue this anyway.  I know that while I may be a good mother in a sense, these things I do make me the worst mother and could result in my child being taken from me.  Please, constructive critisicm when it comes to my daughter.


If I don't keep this vague it's going to run miles long...I need therapy I know.


When I turned 14 I got my first serious boyfriend, and had relationships after this for a constant 5 years.  Relationships meant I couldn't really unleash my inner wild child, however when I was 17 one boyfriend and I enjoyed quite the cocaine addiction until it lead to our inevitable break up.

I immediately got into another relationship, an extremely co dependent one, where I supported us and he partied non stop. Eventually I get pregnant at 19.  My mother and I support my family, he sleeps, smokes and drinks.  Then starts to beat me when Im 9 months pregnant. The behavior lasted until my daughter was one year old until I told my mother and she made me get rid of him. Immediately after I rekindled an old flame.  

We dated for 8 months, break up because he was sketchy with his neighbor, and 3 days later I get roofied by one of his friends and raped.  

I lost him. My friends. My security. I was fearful of my future. I felt like a horrible mother. I felt worthless, tried to kill myself and ended up in the psychiatric hospital.


When I got out they had recommended in patient alcohol rehab. I denied thinking I could control myself, and I did....for about a month.   Then it all started again summer 2012 when I went off the anti depressants and anxiety medication. I had my 1st one night stand to get rid of that rapey feeling, got pregnant again and had an abortion...I didn't want the abortion. I saw it as my shot to fix my self. The guy(who remains in my life, almost as my rock, but we are only friends now) knocked sense into me and paid for the abortion.  Guilt led to drinking every night, weather out with friends or at my house. Waking up every morning to my beautiful daughter hung over as fuck, but, I worked it. I pretended to be happy and silly, made huge breakfast, got to work.  Did horrible at work, get my child from day care, be completely exhausted until bed time and repeat.


I keep this up until the new year. My resolution is to only go out for special occasions. But theres a bar right up my street so my fucked up brain makes anything a special occasion so I spend atleast 3-5 nights a week with my bar friends, still, only now, we are all greater friends since I have been drinking there so much, they like to share their coke with me. Which is where things just get worse.

Now, I haven't gone 3 days with out drinking this year.  I do coke once a week atleast (the idiot in me says that's okay because at least this time im not buying it)  

I black out atleast once a week. I have two-four boys I constantly fuck with their emotions. I'll black out and wake up with one in my bed and act like I meant to and just think ""well here it goes again with **, time to break your heart in a few days"" Not really wanting to be with any of the but rotating in and out so I can fill that empty lonliness after my daughter goes to bed. Leading them on and the hurting them....but they always come back. Every time. They tell me they want to help me. They are great guys and I am a horrible person. 

I feel guilt over everything. How I treat these men, how much Ive fucked up at work, how if something were to happen to my daughter while I was at the bar I would be too drunk to handle it, how CPS could take her from me if they figured me out, how I spend ALL of my money on alcohol to the point where I need to save up and get away from the place that enables me to do this but vodka water seems better,  how I don't deserve my daughter, how I think about killing myself every single day. 

So why...the fuck...don't I stop?

Well...Im on day 3. This crucial day I get to every couple weeks where I end up drinking at night.  I can't do it this time.  I have to wait. I have to stay my happy ass at home, smoke my free weed from those poor suckers I trap into my game, and go the fuck to sleep. Wake up and feel guilt. But get my shit done.

I got thrown into a Human Resources position at my job.  I can't fuck this up.  I can't lose my girl.  I can't keep living like this.  


I hate myself. I am going to try so hard to make it tonight, and even tomorrow.  But I promise Friday and Saturday... I will drink. Friends birthday and a concert. My daughter is going to be at her Nana's with her dad (whose actually gotten a grip on life now, at times I wish hed just get everything together because he'd be a way better parent than I, so I could just kill myself and no one would need to deal with my shit anymore)

When Sundays &amp; Thursdays come, regular nights I'd go to the bar, Im not going to do it....

I did better last week.

Im doing better than that this week.

And I haven't let anyone convince me I can just do a line of coke and not fuck my whole night up in almost 2 weeks.

But I just feel like I cant cut it out completely.  I want to be able to moderate, but I know I cant go out for just a drink.  

It's such a fucked up feeling, knowing I can't completely let it go, but can't continue like the way I am. 


When I type this it looks like that inpatient rehab might be my best bet.  But....the idiot with in says ""no, youre over reacting, just drink once a weekend...maybe have a wine night with your bestfriend instead of going to the bar to bond""


I guess, the only way is to try. I will make it til Friday, I will go out for my bestfriends birthday, I will not do cocaine, and I will not black out. I will have the bartenders cut me off when they see me do my typical ""too drunk"" things.

And if/when that bites me in the ass and proves to not be a useful tactic...it's time to go to AA and get a grip on this.  

Im 22 years old with an almost 3 year old, I am ready to grow up, not be suicidal, live on our own and have a kick ass life that I know I can create if I just stop being selfish for more that 2 days.

Other things I hate about my drinkjng is I used to tiny flat stomached and gorgeous, now I feel flabby with a beer belly and gross.  I rationalize shit in the weirdest way.  My mind is just foggy. My room is a mess.  I just got a new car, and it feels like a clean slate. I want to keep it that way. I don't want to fuck this up again. I want to function.


(sidenote- my child has never met a guy I have dated. Do not believe in introducing her to people for the fuck of it)

Wow....that came out longer than I wanted....if anyone actually read all of that....thank you.

I turned 39 today.  I also happened to have completed my 90th sober day.

This was the first birthday I've had in about 20 years without a drop of alcohol.  I didn't drink today, just like the last 89 days.

Today was a rough day at work, but I had a really nice lunch with some great coworkers and friends.

Then, I got to eat dinner and spend the evening with my three favorite people in the world (my wife and my two best friends). We ate at my favorite restaurant.  They drank and two of them actually shared a bottle of wine.  It didn't bother me at all (unlike [NYE](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/15wbm1/nye_story/)).

My focus is different now.  Instead of worrying about the alcohol I wasn't sharing with my friends, I enjoyed the time I was sharing with them.  We played Pictionary and had a blast.  It's funny how something so simple brought so much enjoyment to us all.

This was the best birthday I've had since I was a kid.  I've never been as happy as I am these days.  I've never felt closer to my wife or had as good &amp; close a set of friends as I do now.

I know that 90 days is only a drop in the bucket.  There have been times that this journey has been easy.  But I know that it may not always be that way.  I think I'm building myself an arsenal of tools to deal with that if/when it happens (starting with my wife, my parents, my therapist, SMART, r/stopdrinking, #stopdrinking, AA (I'm checking out my first meeting on Sunday), and my two best friends).

I'm extremely lucky to have the support system, friends, and family around to support me.

I want to thank you, r/stopdrinking, for the support you've given me so far.  I hope to be able to return the favor in the days to come.  There have been some people here and in #stopdrinking that have really, truly made a difference in my life -- thanks.

I simply chose not to.  This boosted my sense of self-worth and allowed me to feel that I had regained some measure of control in my life.

IN the past few months, somehow this shifted to me saying ""I can't drink again, ever.""  I'm not sure how or why this shift occurred, but it was not a positive thing.  Drinking became forbidden.  When I forbid myself something, it takes on a whole new aspect.  It becomes desirable, simply because I can't have it.  I didn't want to drink again, mind you.  But I found this point of view made me resentful of my alcoholism, and resentment is never a good thing.

I got a sponsor recently, and I shared with him my thoughts on this.  He knew exactly what I was talking about.  He confirmed what I had been feeling, which is that it is far more empowering to choose not to drink than to forbid myself drink.  

It's funny and strange to me that I had a more clear view of sobriety in my early days than I have had in the past few months.  Sobriety is not a static thing for me.  I go through various phases, and each of those phases feels completely different.  It's as if I have to rewrite the rules, or remind myself to go back to basic principles.

21 is when I would have a few by myself on a Saturday after work. 

23 was when I would have more than a few by myself every other night. 

By 24 it was a few too many every night.

At 25 it was to excess every night. 

I'm now 29 pushing 30 and more than a dozen times a day I think about how many beers are in the fridge, whether or not I need to go and buy some more, and I look at the clock waiting for 4:30pm to start drinking.

*And I hate myself for it.*

I'm using a brand-new throwaway because I don't want my wife finding this confession prematurely. 

I know I need to quit drinking. I know it's killing me. And not in a maybe-one-day it will kill me sort of way, I have been on blood-pressure medication for 2 years now, and for all of the talk of it being genetics, I know it's from my drinking. 3 months ago I lost my job because of my drinking but because I'm such a good liar I managed to convince everyone that because of the downturn in the markets they had to let me go.

The truth is I was so hungover everyday that I just couldn't be fucked to do my job.

I want so much more in my life than to want to drink, but I feel so worthless because I drink, that I continue to drink.

I know I need to talk to my wife about this. I know she ignores my drinking because she loves me. And without her I know I would dissolve into a liquid mess and disappear.

I don't want to do this anymore. I need help.

My wife and I almost divorced this summer.  Part of it was my drinking, part of it was her drinking, a lot of it was the fact that we had made each other massively unhappy because the booze changed us from the people we were into something we weren't.

In August she took the kids and moved out.  It was a wake-up call.  I went through the house that night and poured every drop down the sink.  I did it for me, not for her.  I did it for my kids, who deserved better than a father who was mentally and emotionally not there.  

The first week or so was hell.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  So much of my life had been booze, or related to booze.  Now I had all this free time.  So...I took up painting, woodworking, crafting.  I poured myself into my legal studies.  I started going to the gym and watching my diet more.  I used the extra money to buy a wardrobe that wasn't old and stodgy.  Most of all, I spent a hell of a lot of time with my kids.

And my wife.  At diners, at coffee shops...we met to talk about the kids, about what was going on.

She told me how much I'd changed.  How I was getting back to being the sweet, charming man she had first met.  

We ended up falling in love all over again.

She and the kids moved back in two months ago, as of the 22nd.  I attend Lawyers Concerned for Lawyers meetings (AA for attorneys).  We're happy, working through things but doing it like adults.  My kids have their dad back.  I have my life back, and I'm starting to realize how much of it I missed in the bottom of a bottle or a glass.

Three months sober today.  Not easy.  There are times I just want a drink, to take the edge off, because I've been a good boy.  Then I look at the picture of my family I keep in my wallet and remember what I stand to lose here.

I had my last drink Sunday evening and today I strongly felt the urge to drink. I was home alone paying bills and generally stressing about money when I received news that further distressed me. I found myself fantasizing about walking down to the corner store and getting a six pack. I called a friend and he let me vent for a while. I felt better but I still wanted to drink but I WILL NOT give in to that little demon this time. I jumped on the internet, went to the AA website and quickly found the next available meeting. Threw my hair into a ponytail and went. 

I honestly drove past the place and turned around and drove back past the meeting spot. 5 times. Then I thought ""To hell with this! What do I have to lose by going in?"" I'm so glad I did.

I, like a lot of alcoholics, have social anxiety. I relied on drinking to relax me in social situations. I hate having the spotlight shown on me. I hate speaking in front of others. I walked in shaking... sweating. (it was about 95 degrees out in my defense). I nervously sat down and fumbled to open my water bottle. I knew I didn't have to say more than my name if I didn't want to. After listening to about a dozen people share stories I found myself WANTING to say at least a little something. Again, I'm glad I did. It felt good.

When the meeting ended several people approached me in a very non intimidating way to offer support, congratulations and phone numbers. They encouraged me to come back. And I will.

I kept thinking today how lucky I am to sleep 7 hours straight a night.  How wonderful is a good night's sleep?!  It's pretty much the best thing in life after a nice big meal, of course.  

Up until 3 weeks ago every night involved me collapsing into bed only to wake up 4 hours later with anxiety and the paranoia about 'what did I do?' 'who did I email?' 'what did I say?'  And I never could get back to sleep so I'd start drinking coffee at 3 am and go to work looking like I got run over by a truck.  I cannot believe how well I sleep now and how delightful it is to feel my eyelids get heavy and my book hit my chest every night as I wind down in bed.

AA has been awesome and I also could never have fathomed how wonderful and supportive everyone has been.  They approach you after meetings, they know your name, give you their phone numbers...  I met a woman at a meeting last night that I knew 17 years ago back in my home town!  There was no shock or shame or awkwardness, just a warm hello and an invitation to sit together at the next meeting.  I am loving AA so much and bonding so well with the people I meet there.  The one thing I keep taking away from it is the incredible strength and power these people all have.  Especially the old-timers.  For someone to get through this and stay clean, and be of service to others who need help, and be calm and confident in their sobriety.  Man, that's POWER.  That's SEXY!  Such strength and fortitude.

I think I've found my home group.  I'll be there tomorrow night, then next week I am going to take a one month chip because they offer this and by God it's going to mean the world to me.  That thing will take the front pocket of my wallet and my platinum card will take a back seat to it, that's how important it is to me!

Now, my current diet.  I have to lay off the candy.  I've switched to dried fruit tonight and the jogging starts this weekend.  I had NO idea I'd be binging on M&amp;Ms and Twizzlers!  It's yummy as all hell but it can't stay this way.  I'll get fat and my teeth will fall out... but hey, I'll still be sober!  ;)

I am so happy that in the last 3 weeks I seem to have gotten so much of my life back.  I keep remembering something I saw here on Reddit in r/stopdrinking that said something like:  ""You're not losing anything.  You're getting it all back"".  And there's nothing more truthful than this phrase to me right now.  I am active, reading, socializing, cooking, cleaning, organizing, studying, making new friends, planning new projects... and I also found out I am getting a promotion at work.  Who would have thought that would happen?!  Not my old, negative, drunk/hungover self, that's for sure!

I'm going to crack a San Pellegrino and have a nice hot bath now.  And just FYI, I've also been preparing tools and coping mechanisms for dealing with bad blows that come in life as well.  Life is never going to be perfect and bad things happen to good people.  My biggest problem in life was always dealing with the bad shit in the wrong way and my way to deal was to knock myself out with booze over, and over again.  No more.  I'm going to enjoy my sobriety and when something crappy comes down the pipe, which it will, I'll have a support network to help me get through it and to talk about it with.  I am not alone anymore in self-imposed isolation and shame and I am so grateful for this.  

Wishing you all another 24 and to those about to quit, come on in!  The water's fine!

I live in Ottawa and grew up here. I won't go through all the places I moved but basically, I ended up going to Montreal and that's an awesome place for alcoholism to really take hold of you. Well, any city is, but for me, having alcohol more readily available was a curse and a blessing.

I started drinking once in awhile in my teens, but never really drank a lot because my mom was insane about checking my breath when I got home. And I was a good girl, I never got into trouble. I got top grades throughout high school and university, and am a perfectionist.

I've been riddled with addictive tendencies since I was 18 and diagnosed with anorexia. Alcohol came later. But regardless of how it manifested, I was never really able to accept life as it is. I have unrealistic expectations about life and what I am entitled to. Bad things don't happen to good people, but even more so, GOOD THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONSTANTLY HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE.

I never really failed at anything. I'm a stubborn bitch when it comes to getting my way. When I put my mind to something, it's mine and I will go to any length. This worked against me and also worked FOR me in recovery.

I found my bottom pretty quickly. I was drinking alcoholically by the age of 21 but NEVER thought it was a problem. I thought I was just a lush. A party girl. I thought I drank like everyone else. And no one told me I drank too much because they were probably afraid of the reaction I might have.

I went through the progression from abusing alcohol to alcohol dependence pretty quickly. I think dependence came about when I was 22. That's when I started to NEED alcohol at least every three days. I didn't care if I was alone or with others. I just needed to drink. Didn't think it was a problem though.

Alcohol started to take its toll. My ex boyfriend told me that I needed to stop because I was getting so fucking crazy when I drank. I'd pass out in weird places, piss the bed, act totally insane and just have the worst hangovers ever.

I tried to quit for good in October 2010. I lasted three weeks, then I have one glass of wine to celebrate my 25th birthday on November 20th and everything went downhill from there. I was back to drinking, but this time, it was different. I needed to drink. Nothing would stop me from getting what I wanted, and that was booze and cigarettes.

I stopped going to school. I thought that drinking off hangovers was a good idea, but I'd just end up drunk and spend the day at home playing WoW and doing nothing. 

This is when I started hiding booze all over the apartment. Before that I had even hidden mickeys of vodka and 26's of vodka around the house incase I ""needed it"". I wasn't allowed to openly drink, but there was no fucking way I was staying sober, so hiding was the only viable option (riiiight...makes sense??)

In 2011, my ex asked me to leave our apartment and I went back to my parent's house. That was a safe place for a month, then I realized I could sneak drinks there. My family was fucking confused and sad. I was 'forced' to apply to rehab programs, and finally decided to go to Homewood but it took me a couple months to get in. I drank hard and heavily until I got there. It was fucking hell.

I was suicidal. I wanted to die some days, but alcohol kept me going. And a very small urge to live and be better. This was my tiny tiny little recovery voice that pushed me into rehab and has grown into a beautiful white light that lives inside of me.

I had my last drunk on May 27th 2011. I went for a ""run"" which was typically just an excuse to get to the liquor store extremely quickly. I didn't want to drink. I checked my bank account and I had 20.63 left. Enough to take out 20 dollars so I could buy a bottle. My dad has access to my account and can see where money is being spent and I didn't want him to see ""wine store: 15 dollars"" on the computer screen. He checked it regularly to see if I was drinking.

So I bought a 1.5 liter bottle and drank it on the way home. I cried my eyes out drinking it. I stared at it, hated it, and didn't want to drink, but I did. And something happened that night. All I wanted to do was spend that Friday night with my parents and sister watching TV, but instead I was chugging wine in a forest.

I went to rehab on June 1st for 35 days. I learned a lot there. I was told to go in without any of my bullshit. But I was really lucky because on my last drunk, I let go of control. I accepted I was alcoholic and needed help.

I needed rehab too. I knew that AA was not going to be enough. I needed and wanted constant 24 hour supervision, direction, I wanted a plan to live and information on how to do that.

I got that in rehab. I hated AA when I was in the institution. Thought it was total bullshit. But I listened to my counsellors. I went every night, and when I got out, I went to at least two meetings a day. I had nothing else to do.

I've been through a lot in this year. I have blessings I never thought possible. I have the support and love from my family. I have a supportive and loving partner back (Kevin, the man who left me because of my drinking). We're working on our friendship. He is my partner in crime.

I've also become less co-dependent. I was so attached to men. They were everything to me. I needed their constant attention and their sex to let me know I was worthy and beautiful. 

I now go to AA meetings daily because I WANT TO. Which is fucking strange. I love the fellowship. I love my friends in the program. I love hanging out with other alcoholics and addicts because they GET ME. For the first time in my life, I have friends that love me for all my faults. Who I can be honest with. I got a sponsor at 9 months and she's been my life line.

I celebrated one year on Monday morning at my home group. I was told I wear my sobriety like a badge of honour. And I do. I am honest and open about my alcoholism. I don't hang out with people who think I still drink. I keep myself SAFE and I am adamant about protecting what I have.

My sobriety and my safety is the most important thing in my life. I live on day to day terms, doing the next right thing. This involves planning for the future, but I don't sit around and think about it much. The future will sooner or later be today, and I can deal with it then.

I got out of rehab at 50 and managed by some miracle to get a new job. This helped and still helps a lot because it provides structure to my life. 

I live alone. I am not married and have no kids. I live in a foreign country and have done for the last 10 years.

When I am not working I sleep  :) , I educate myself (learn new things), I go to AA, I play on the computer, I watch a lot of news and I manage my life.
This mostly takes care of the weekdays.

At the weekend I may have a visitor or I may go into town. I go to a couple of bars and drink coffee and bottled water. I watch the drunks. I may meet a friend. None of my friends are drinkers and I only have a few close friends. I might treat myself to a Thai curry and I might kiss a girl.

All these things I do sober and all these things I enjoy.

So enjoy your sobriety and celebrate it!

No person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been charaterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his liquor drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.""

This is from the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.

This was a big problem for me trying to get sober. I had great difficulty giving up on the idea that somehow, someway, I would be able to drink like a normal person. Admitting that I had a problem was easy, but coming to the conclusion that I would never be able to drink like a normal drinker was by far the most difficult part of getting sober.

When I started going to AA, I would buy a bottle before the meeting and tell myself that I could drink it after the meeting if I didn't feel better. Without fail, every time I went to the meeting, I poured the bottle out afterwards. But there were days I skipped the meeting and drank the bottle instead. I was still trying to find a way to drink even though I wanted the benefits that sobriety offered.

This went on for about 3 and a half months of going to AA meetings. Luckily, after finally getting about 3 consecutive weeks of sobriety, I got to the point where I could tell myself, ""If I don't feel better after the meeting, I'll drink tomorrow"" , and I quit buying bottles before the meetings. I was finally able to go 24 hours without buying a bottle. I have not had a drink since then.

I've put together a number of years of sobriety now, and even today, there is a voice in the back of my head that doesn't want to give up on the idea that I could drink normally. It isn't a struggle today to silence this voice, but it is still there.

To those of you who are still struggling with this idea, I urge you to give up. Those of us who are alcoholic will never be able to drink like normal drinkers. That's what makes us alcoholic. Surrender is the key that ultimately leads to a life of sobriety.

I rode my bike the 7 miles home, truck had impounded the night of my second dui 2 weeks earlier. I get home a decide to spruce the place up for my Dad. He was getting home the next day from the hospital. 
So I am shooting back my whiskey, playing some music and cleaning.
Thinking about what had happened to me in the last couple weeks...the eventual sentencing, the jail time, the fines, riding my shitty bike everywhere for the foreseeable future. I was starting down my usual path of self loathing, guilt and apathy. That is when it happened, the wrong song came on and that peculiar switch went on in my head. I went from getting buzzed and quasi productive around the house to downing the rest of the bottle and every downer in the house....nyquil, benedryl, whatever i could find to end it.
As usual when this would hit me I felt the need to justify my action, so I started to write a goodbye on Facebook. My oldest brother happen to be on at the time and I started a drunken text fest that led to a even worse phone call that ended in my admitting to every terrible thing I had ever done. Well he didn't grant me permission to die and had the audacity to tell me he loved me and wanted me to get to the hospital! I destroyed both my phone and my TV in the ensuing tantrum. 
Some minutes later the ambulance and police show up and take me away to the hospital. I had survived another of my half-dozen attempts at suicide by pills and booze, to say I was unhappy to wake up the following day is quite an understatement.
After a week in a psych ward I came home to my life just where I had left it...literally, Dad left everything exactly as is was. Cleaning up week old nyquil/whiskey vomit is pretty brutal.
I went to my first meeting that following friday. I look back now and I really don't know how I survived it all. I was just so beat down and afraid of failing again at suicide that I was willing to listen to the AA people. I got through the jail time, the bankruptcy, getting a car and having to blow-start it for 8 months. I did it with the help of some amazing men, a program of recovery and trying desperately not to make things worse.

you know, a lot of us have been or are just starting to or will go through the metamorphosis of quitting the drink.

some of us may label ourselves as sober, an alcoholic, addict etc. and carry the weight of that label until who knows when. 

i am a proud alcoholic, but i want and have been striving to become more than that: the self that uses kindness, patience and understanding to deal with living.  the self that i always dreamed of but due to faulty wiring, couldn't.

the ' i can't do it' and 'sobriety is too hard' gets replaced with 'what's next!?' and ' i can handle this' and:

'even if things suck, at least i'm clear headed enough to know that i am good enough for my self again and i am kicking addiction's behind by being the example i know i've always been.'

in my opinion, it's a fucking cop out to give in to your own weakness by acting like a wounded victim because you don't have a crutch like alcohol to mask your real problems anymore. 

seek help! 

kick addiction's ass on all fronts.  if therapy is good for you- do it!  if you like a group setting, try AA or SMART.  

hell, sit on an egg to see if it hatches , if that keeps you from using!

no more teetering on the edge of relapse.

no more feeling ashamed or lost because you can't have the bottle.

no more counting moments instead of living them.

no more consent to weakness.

no more looking down, or away. 

no more 'i can't.'

my armor is my clear mind.  my weapon is my new found understanding.

------------

First of all, I'm macho.  I'm a man!  I don't have feelings and crap like that, of course.  GROWL!

However, this morning, I was driving into work.  I have a fairly scenic drive over a dam, through a wooded area.  I started the day with an 11 mile bike ride, a quick dental CAT scan, and then headed into work.  My mornings used to be: press snooze until the absolute last time so that I'd only be acceptably late.  Then, rush through a shower, dress, brush my teeth, pour coffee, and drive fast.  It's still strange to do things before work in the morning (because I'm waking up earlier).

So, back to my drive... I had my windows down and my moon roof open.  I was enjoying the sun on my face and the wind rushing by.  And I realized: this is making me happy.  I was reminded of a conversation I had with my wife about 6 months or so ago.  This was while things were really bad.  I see now that it was the beginnings of the major changes to come, but I didn't know it then.

And she asked me, ""What makes you happy?""  And I answered, ""I can't think of anything.""  She said, ""That's not normal... I think you're depressed.""  And I thought so too.

Reminded of that conversation from 6 months ago while feeling the simple joy of driving on a country road on a Spring morning made me a little weepy (and by weepy, I mean EXTREMELY TOUGH).  It's amazing how much drinking had dulled my senses and made everything ""not good enough... I want just a bit more!""  And now, with 4+ months of sobriety under by belt, a simple sunny day makes me extremely happy.

I know a lot of people (including myself) keep the bad memories around to remind them of why they shouldn't drink.  But, I'm going to hold onto this feeling too.

Anyway, just thought I'd share.  Have a great day everyone!

(Cutting back, not quitting.)",sobahkiin,39,0,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1apb1v/am_i_welcome_here_cutting_back_not_quitting/,"Hi everybody. I've been lurking for quite some time. I finally decided to sign-up and request a badge. :) Here's some info about me. (I'll try to be concise!)

* 28 years old, male
* Drinking near-daily for about 3 1/2 years. (Longest stretch of *total* sobriety in this time was 14 days.)
* Diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Anxious/Avoidant Personality Disorder. The theory for my drinking is that I started as a means of self-medicating, and I do think that explains the majority of it. I did get hooked somewhere along the line though.
* Been in therapy since early last summer. Recently started medication. My doctors are aware of my drinking.
* I have an alcoholic father (though he's currently sober), and both of my grandfathers were alcoholics.
* I've been successfully cutting back on my alcohol consumption. 

**I'm tired of using alcohol as a crutch though**, and I know that it isn't *really* helping me deal with anxiety. Even it was, the negative effects just aren't worth it. Spending half to a third of every day drunk or buzzed (until somewhat recently) has negatively impacted my performance in school, hurt the few personal relationships I have, and has even stolen my other hobbies. (I used to play guitar a lot, play involved role playing video games, and I absolutely *loved* weight training. Drinking came to replace those probably 75% of the time, which kind of breaks my heart, as corny as that may sound.) 

Now, it seems to me that majority of posters here are dedicated to complete sobriety. This, however, is not my goal. (I am hoping I can still fit in here, but we'll have to see how the community responds.) Instead, I want to keep my drinking within a medically healthy range and avoid binging as a means of self-medicating. 

I completely understand that many people need to cut out alcohol completely, but I've been successfully cutting back for some time now. (I used to regularly consume a six-pack of very strong beer and a tall boy or two of average beers almost daily. I am now comfortable with a six-pack of light beer. On some very rare days, I'm even content with 2-3 light beers. My goal is for 2-3 beers to be my new maximum.) And, as someone prone to perfectionism, attempts to commit 100% to something usually gets me into big trouble. So, a successful day for me is a day when I either don't drink at all, **or** when I stick within a normal, healthy range. Should I exceed that range, I will request to have my badge reset.

Having said that all that, I would love to ultimately get to the point where I feel no compulsion toward drinking any amount. Because, in all honesty, I still feel like I *need* at least little, especially when I'm anxious. I'm really bothered by that compulsion, but I'm not ready to fully kick its ass yet. Hopefully, through therapy, medication, and continued cutting-back I'll be able to reach that state in the near future.

Anyway, I've already typed faaaar more than I wanted to! Thanks to those of you who read!

People who think it's perfectly normal because hey plans change and hey who could have predicted that degree of a hangover, eh? Maybe next time etc etc.

Makes me think how that used to be my normal as well. And then I think about all the things that I missed cause I was too hungover - things like calls from my dad while he was dying of cancer that I couldn't answer because I couldn't get out of bed. In retrospect that's one thing I will probably never be able to forgive myself for..

Looking at my friends now, thinking how I used to be just like that- man I'm so glad I quit. Instead of flaking on people, being unreliable and too hungover to ever get anything accomplished, I'm 100 percent dependable now, and these days I get more things done before 10AM than most of my friends do their entire weekends.

",faith84,36,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18ufyk/wait_so_not_everyone_in_the_worlds_lives_revolve/,"Before I quit drinking and for over a year after, I truly believed that everyone else in the world’s lives revolved around alcohol as much as mine did.  The people who I was surrounded with were either my old drinking friends or my new sober friends, and all of those people are/were heavy drinkers.  I always thought that in order to be friends/date anyone who wasn't totally sober I would have to tolerate a great deal of drinking from the other person.  I always thought someone who drank wouldn't want to spend time with me as a sober person.  My first major boyfriend after getting sober dumped me because I didn't drink and he would pound 20 beers a  night on the weekends, he literally told me that I was not very fun and he was not sure how I enjoyed life without alcohol.  My alcoholic brain told me over and over again how much I was missing out on because I didn't drink, that drinking was the greatest pleasure of life that I screwed myself on, that really, the pinnacle of everyone's life was being drunk.

Well, lately I've learned that this is simply not true.  There are people who fall somewhere between the extremes of drunk/sober.  Light drinkers, people who don't drink for health reasons, people who don't like the taste of alcohol, social drinkers, people who have grown out of the party scene, crafy beer connoisseurs who only drink it for the taste, etc.  In other words, NON-alcoholics.  In my life I don't think I've really ever had a close relationship with a true non-alcoholic.  All my friends are either sober or drinking alcoholics.  

After getting dumped because I don't drink, I've since been on dates with 3 men where drinking is a complete non-issue.  All of them said they drink rarely, it just isn't their thing, they are usually the driver, they don't like being drunk, etc.  To me, this is MIND BLOWING.  I was never a light drinker and I never hung out with people who could take it or leave it.  

I don't even know what this post is for.  I just wanted to say that I feel like a whole new section of the world opened up for me.  I guess this was prompted because I got yet another birthday invite for one of my friends in their late 20s where the focus was booze, booze, and more booze, and how many ways can we drink, how many bars can we go to, how messed up can we get.  When I get these I feel like such an outcast.  But not everyone is like that, and I want to spend my time with people who don't make drinking a priority anymore. 

Just my thoughts :)

Hell, even last year I was single and did a bunch of self-care/spa stuff, and then went out drinking by myself afterward.

I was so sick and tired of having to do certain things everyday to stay on a baseline where I felt I was comparable to other people's level of functioning.

I thought, FUCK IT, today I will not read my daily meditation books and do what a normal person would do.

I went to a meeting, hated everyone and everything in it, and told my sponsor it was a bad meeting. She let me talk. Then she bought me a milkshake.

I went home and started thinking about how my behaviour was totally setting me up for relapse. I wasn't being open, honest or willing.

I had two realizations.

1. Comparing myself to other people is just another way I stay sick. I have no idea what is going on in their inner lives, I have no idea what those people do everyday to stay productive, mainly because I have never asked!

2. Normal people probably do what they need to do to get themselves through a day. And therefore, if I wanted to be a normal person (whatever that means) it DEFINITELY means that I need to do the things that help me through MY day. 

So I read my daily reflections/meditations. I realized that I hadn't taken my medicine that day yet (talking, being honest, open, willing, doing the things I need to do).

Then I had a better day. I felt ME again. Me is working recovery, helping others, being honest, being open and being willing.

Like a lot of people I did not want to put much stock in A.A. because of the religious leanings.  It’s not that I am an atheist or agnostic per say—I identify myself as a non-practicing Catholic (20 years) that may one day get back “there”—but if I was going to get help I sure didn’t need *anything* from God, yeah?  How did He let me get here anyway if He exists and is so awesome? (**Edit:** Someone pointed out that God gave us free will and I had to apologize as apparently I have forgotten almost everything I learned in church.  It was meant to be sarcastic/self-deprecating for my own shortcomings).

We picked the closest meeting to our home because we have less than half a tank of gas until Friday and $0.42 in our checking account. We borrowed $500 from family last week for food, gas, and cigarettes.  All gone before that week was through.  At least all our bills are current and paid but that is the only good thing about our current financial situation ($8,000 in debt; not including our auto loan—all substance abuse related).  We have sold or pawned half our possessions since December of last year to accommodate our affliction.

When we pulled up to the place there were 2 cars in the parking lot with 10 minutes to go before the meeting.  So far off we were off to an uneasy start.  It turns out most people parked in the back (duh :-).  I do not need to give a play-by-play but one of the things I garnered most from the meeting was I need to talk to other alcoholics.  It was so eye-opening and even comforting to hear people share stories, many of which my wife &amp; I related too (and you would as well).  Online forums are great but you do not get to see people’s demeanor, facial expressions, and inflections in their voice…a whole group of people from all walks of life suffering the same thing as you.  The guy to our left was anti-religious from his own mouth but he said he needed to be there.

Do not be afraid to get help.  We had two moments of silences for the people not at a meeting and still suffering.  My heart aches for you and I.

Thanks for reading.  I’m an alcoholic.

**Edit:**  Re-reading this makes me sound like I might be trivializing online support groups.  That was not my intention.  I just need human-to-human interaction at the forefront of my recovery.

**Edit 2:** I forgot to mention that we last drank on July 4th.  We woke up at 8:30am with the intention of going to my wife’s friend/co-worker’s 40th birthday party.  There was going to be much drinking there but it didn’t start until 3pm (that wouldn't do!).  Before I brushed my teeth I went out for a handle of Black Velvet and accessories and my wife and I drank from 9am-midnight, with minimal food and maybe a half inch left in the bottle.

I suppose that I'm going to use this as my AA. I've spent the better part of the last decade (man, that is hard to write) drinking very heavily. The last two years it has had some periods where I was up to 2/3 of a bottle of vodka a day. Stress and a lifestyle which I really hate have been the main motivators, but really, I know it's just because I don't know what else to do.

It's all be ""medicinal"" as a way to drown out the noise of anxiety and depression, self-hate and some serious family issues. I'm trying to deal with those things with the hopes that I won't feel the need to drown myself in a bottle every time my brain decides that it is ready for a hate-fest.

Been going back to a shrink and am on some meds which are helping me to keep my cool. 

I am lucky to have a very loving girlfriend and a seriously sweet five month old daughter. They are helping me so much and I owe it to them (and myself!) to figure this out.

So, here's to 6 days sober for the first time in.. well, I can't even remember how long. We'll do this one fucking day at a time until I don't want to drink all the time anymore. If that never comes, well, we'll just keep doing it one day at a time anyway.

This is the longest I've been sober in over 2 years.,djamberj,35,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1e8f4z/5_days_this_is_the_longest_ive_been_sober_in_over/,"That is really eye-opening. While I didn't get shit-housed every day, I did most. I rarely fell asleep, I would pass out. No wonder I've been having trouble sleeping lately. 

I couldn't even sleep after taking Benedryl last night. The lack of sleep isn't helping my anxiety, but I definitely FEEL better. It's nice not to be hung over every morning. 

Today, I went to my boyfriend's friend's house and was offered a beer. I declined, citing issues with my stomach as a reason for abstaining. No one cared one way or the other. I felt I needed a 'reason' so I didn't shine the spotlight on the issue. I definitely don't want to seem like I'm attention seeking, nor to I want to explain myself to people who may not understand. My boyfriend drank one, and we went to his parent's house where he had another. 

I COULD NOT BELIEVE that he nursed ONE BEER through THREE PERIODS OF HOCKEY. I resent only having one or two because it feels like empty calories without a buzz. I honestly don't see the point. I LOVE the taste of shitty beer and craft beer alike, but I can throw back a six pack or more while watching... Well, anything. I really, really wanted to drink, but I'm glad we were at his parent's house, because that isn't the environment I'd like to be drinking in anyway. 

I had a really nice time, and was really happy I didn't drink anything because I would have just been obsessing over getting another beer. One would have been appropriate for the setting, and I would have been irritated if I wasn't able to drink more. Almost resentful that my boyfriend, 'drank like a square.' I know me well enough. Ugh, typing that out and re-reading that is awful, but the truth. 

I definitely am white knuckling it. I want to be able to enjoy alcohol socially with out the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual consequences. I want to have my wine and drink it too! To get myself on a train out of whiny fairytale gumdrop town, I remind myself of all the awful things that have happened because of my tendency to over-indulge, to black out, and to have vicious bouts of anxiety for WEEKS on end after a binge. 

Tonight, I'm going to eat, smoke a few cigs, take some Benedryl, and hopefully sleep. I may go to a meeting tomorrow. I want to do this for myself, but do not want to share it with anyone. That makes me feel like I'm being dishonest in my relationship and friendships. However, I want to help myself. I'm not sure what, and how much, information I should divulge to those closest to me.

Energy! 

Generally feeling healthier, fewer stomach aches and headaches. Face less puffy. Brain starting to work better.

I can remember what I did last night! And the night before!

No more waking up covered in shame from not knowing what I did or said the night/day before. 

Being able to make plans without worrying about if I will be too hungover to follow through with plans.

Less fighting with my boyfriend. Spending more quality time together. Watching sunsets. 

Focused more on friends instead of just getting trashed and what should I drink next? 

Saving money and being able to afford car payments now. I'm saving over $300 a month by not drinking. 

Being successful in not drinking for 40 days has given me strength to make other goals and start working to meet those goals. Weight loss goals, professional and personal goals! Which I guess would mean I just have a more positive outlook in general now. 

My home is staying cleaner. Not spotless but things like taking out the garbage or cleaning up a spill don't get ignored for weeks.

I am taking better care of my hygiene... much more likely to brush my teeth at night if I'm going to bed instead of passing out on the couch or the floor. 


Along with things I am enjoying with my new sobriety, here is a list of things I don't like about my drinking: 

Night sweats. One of the times I realized I really had a problem was when I went to wash the sheets and I noticed my side of the bed was stained with sweat marks while the other side was spotless. It was very disgusting looking at the physical proof of what my drinking was doing.

I don't wake up throughout the night and need to get up and chug water because I feel like I'm going to die without it. Also not chugging water in the morning before work to try and curb a hangover and then feeling so bloated and nauseated. Sleeping better in general now, took a few weeks to start sleeping normally. 

I don't want to smoke as often. I still let myself once in awhile, especially in social situations. Since I'm smoking much less I can breathe better and am slowly noticing being able to walk up hills with out stopping as often. 

I hate sounding drunk and slurring my words. Saying things to complete strangers that should have remained private. Talking to guys with the intention of trying to get free drinks. 

Losing hours of time. Waking up with no memory of drunk facebook/text/actual conversations. Feeling like others were gossiping about me. Getting a bad reputation in this small community. So many MYSTERY BRUISES. Making up semi-plausible stories to explain huge bruises. 

Consuming a couple days worth of calories in a single drinking binge. And then craving junk food. Wanting to lay around all day everyday. Wasting whole paychecks on one evening at the bar. 


I would love to hear any additions you have for your lists too.

It's been hard to say the least.  A few days off, then hit the road for a long weekend selling.  It's also extremely stressful as you are on the road with other girls (most of which are catty), and it's make it or break it.  We are paid 90% commission.  

I've been on the show a couple of weekends, and this new girl started with us this past one. We leave at around 10 a.m. Thursday morning, and it's her first trip.  I know she must be nervous because I was too, and so I brush off her awkwardness when I first meet her.  We get in the van, and an hour into the trip, I notice she is acting weirder and weirder.  Pretty soon she cannot string her words together, and her actions are ataxiated.  We stop on the side of the road, and she gets out for air.  Within a step she is on the ground, and the two other girls I'm with are dumbfounded. 

When we get to the hotel we are staying at, she passes out after hitting her head a few times in the bathroom. We go through her purse to find one half of a 750 mL bottle of vodka.  Basically she drank half the bottle really quickly before jumping into the van that morning.  Makes sense that she was somewhat normal when we left, but an hour into it she cannot even keep her head up.

When she comes to in the hotel, I talk to her as she enters back into reality. The other girls are done with her to say the least.  They have called the boss, and she has been promptly fired.  They say we need to just tell her goodby and kick her outside even though we are 4 hours from home in a city she doesn't know.

I take her to the bus station, and sit with her for a couple of hours.  Her mom has bought her ticket, because she is broke.  She admits she has been looking for work for a year, lives with her mom, and this was her chance out....but she blew it until another comes along.  She says she doesn't know why she stopped at the liquor store on the way to our first sales weekend together, and it is hard to pass it up everyday in her hick of a hometown where her mom drives her nuts and her life is crap.  She admits she's glad I'm there. She would never have called her mom, gotten a bus back, etc.

We wait for hours. She gets on the bus at 10:15 p.m (exactly 12 hours after we've left).  It will take her back to her hometown, but the trip will take twice as long, and she won't get there until 6 a.m.

Alcoholism is like that whole trip.  You pick up the bottle to kill the nerves, but you lose everything on the way to where you were going.  In the end you go right back to where you started from, but are in more pain and with less than you started with.

For the past few weeks, my first thought in the morning is no longer ""Wow, I'm so glad I'm not hung over.""  Instead I think about the stuff I have to do to get ready for the day.  I think I've forgotten what it was like to feel like shit all the time.  I suppose this was inevitable, and I think it's progress, but it represents new territory for me.

This has meant a shift in sobriety techniques.  Lately a familiar little voice has been cropping up, saying I'm cured, and I can drink safely now.  In the past, after my two one-year stints of not drinking, I would have given in to this voice.  But that was before I had educated myself about alcoholism and the workings of the inner addict.  Now I just observe this voice with some detachment, saying, Yep, there it is.  I feel in no danger of giving in to it.  I am not threatened by the existence of this voice.  I don't pretend it doesn't matter, because I firmly believe in the ancient dictum of never underestimating the enemy.  And this voice is definitely the enemy.  It's the enemy of my higher self, the self that is gradually unfolding day by day, now that it is free of the constraints of constant drunkenness and hangovers.   

I am surrounded by constant reminders of the rewards of sobriety.  My career has taken off again.  My financial situation has improved vastly, which as the breadwinner of a family of four means a huge load taken off.  I don't get mad much any more.  I have lost a great deal of weight.  I am no longer depressed and I no longer suffer panic attacks.  I don't feel constant shame.  I am just a dude living a life.  

I go to meetings once a week.  These have become important to me.  I have a sponsor who I call sometimes.  I see a therapist occasionally.  I reach out to others and I allow myself to be reached.  I feel that I have an understanding of a Higher Power that works for me, a lifelong atheist who was brought up Catholic and has an abiding hatred of religion.  I have been exercising regularly for six months now.  I have energy.  I have a purpose.  I feel loved.  I show love.  Sometimes I eat iced cream.  

Things are good.

Tonight at a meeting I was talking to some fellow members and one asked me how long I've been sober.  After I told him he said ""And you're smiling, well wait until the real work starts"".  This is something I've seen more and more and meetings and it really pisses me off.

When I hear ""Wait till the real work starts"" or ""Now the honeymoon's over"" it makes me feel like AA has tiers of members and I'm just a lowly bottom feeder who isn't feeling real happiness but is deluding himself into thinking that he's happy.  And I'll only feel real happiness once I've suffered through months/years of pain.

When I have a shitty day I want to be able to go to a meeting a know that I'm going to feel better, not worse.  Tonight was a shitty day and I felt worse after leaving the meeting than before.

Everyday of sobriety is real work, no matter how much time you have and no matter what step you're one.  And every day of sobriety is a God (my understanding) given miracle.  And we're all the same at a meeting, we all just want to help each other get through the day sober.

Now to the constructive part of this experience :)  Everything that happens has a lesson in it for me if I'm willing to look.  And what I think I'm being shown is that anger and feelings of worthlessness are not me, they block me from being myself.  And if I'm feeling happy, and I'm sober today then I've done ""real work"".  

My real work right now is going to meetings, praying at least twice a day, daily readings/meditations, journaling, and trying to be less of self-seeking person and look to what I can bring to people in my day instead of what they can bring to me.  Oh and laughing, fuck do I love laughing these days.

I know 90 days isn't very long in the large scheme of things but it sure feels good to me. I'm slowly starting to rise up out of the fog that enveloped my life for the past few years and it's a weird feeling looking back on the person I used to be. 

By working the steps and talking to people I'm learning what I need to do in order to not be a giant asshole to everyone that I meet. It mostly boils down to recognizing how selfish I have been and trying very hard to just care about other people and what is going on in their lives.The more I talk to other people, or do things for other people, the better I feel. 

I've heard a lot of crazy relapse stories, and saw one of my friends go back out and try to kill himself. It's scary shit and it just hardens my resolve to quit this shit for good. I don't think I could ever drink normally again and sadly the only way to REALLY know that, since this is my first time being sober, is to drink. But I don't want to risk it. I can't ever go back to the place I was in before. 

What else? This subreddit has been super awesome, both for reading posts and for helping others. I post here a lot and it's like my AA away from AA, so thank you all for being here. I'm so glad to be here - reading all the other peoples' stories really motivated me to get sober, and now that I'm at this point, I have to thank you SO much! This subreddit is what made me go to AA in the first place, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.

It's been very hard on certain levels. Not drinking has been easy, at least. I am pretty grateful for all that has happened in the past month.

I've posted a few posts, and I'm pretty tired at the moment, but I want to quickly just summarize this past month.

--

Thirty days ago I had just recently broken up with my boyfriend, my school wasn't going too well, and my financial situation wasn't in the best situation. I felt shitty about the breakup, I wasn't super motivated at school, and I had no summer job prospects. I decided to write a letter at 4am on April 12. It was to myself. I decided to stop drinking.

Thirty days later I have a new job, my school is finished, and I passed all my courses. I dealt with the loss of my grandmother, and was able to be so much help to my mom, and my family in general. I would not have been able to do that had I been drinking. I would have been an emotional mess, and wouldn't have been much help. I've even found a new guy, who, in retrospect, is much better suited for me. He's involved much more than my previous relationship. We have real dates, and are doing activities together. We do other things than just drink together.

I've had some hard moments this month. The moments where I would normally feel like having a drink are still there, however instead of feeling like having a drink, I feel shitty. But I've been learning to deal with it. I go running, biking, whatever. I've also noticed I've been building much better relationships with everyone. I'm much more open, and honest. I have made a few amends with people that I would otherwise have not made. I'm slowly turning my life around one day at a time. Things are looking up, and starting to gain momentum.

All the best to all of you struggling to make the first step. You're worth it.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,1338523259.0,,month1,True,t3_tjaso,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/tjaso/one_month_fuck_yes/,

I would be ready to pass out by about nine PM and would botch the gift wrapping.  I would wake up late tomorrow, or else I would be awakened early by the girls and stumble downstairs feeling like absolute shit.  More Bailey's and coffee.  I would fuck up the turkey somehow and would be smashed by the time our dinner guests arrived.  I would once again pass out by nine.  And everyone would be worried and anxious because I would either not be making sense or I would have had a temper tantrum at some point.

Instead, I've been out shoveling the driveway, peacefully negotiating holiday traffic, patiently waiting in long lines at the store, cleaning the kitchen, and am preparing to do some baking.  I will go to bed early and wake up at about five am with the kids.  I will not get mad at anybody for something stupid, least of all myself.

After I found a user in this subreddit abusive, I dropped off the grid in r/stopdrinking.  I realize that I should be here giving advice to those struggling like I was. 

The most powerful things that I have learned are as follows:

Alcohol is a symptom of my disease.  We hear this a lot from various sources.  I can tell you my cravings only stopped once I realized that I was having trouble with my outlook, not drinking.  I ran to alcohol as a stress relief.  I ran to alcohol as a buffer from people. I ran to alcohol to feel nothing.  The stress,  irritation, and pain was there still,  only now I was an angry asshole.  The next morning it was still there and I had a hangover to ad to my list of troubles.  Around the third month of sobriety,  I changed my outlook. People will always act a certain way,  things will always fall apart at times.  How I reacted had to change. Ultimately I needed to just calm down and look forward to tomorrow.  Sure,  people may still bother me, (and maybe they always will)  I am a misanthrope after all,  but I still have people I love.  Sad thing still happen,  but the sun still rises every day.  Recognizing the potential beauty of life and it's temporary nature is what changed my outlook.  Though life is not static,  your optimism must remain so.  Hope is what I found.  Hope that I will able to be a better friend to those I've wronged.  Hope I can be there for my family when they need me.  Hope that my soon to be born son never has to see his father disappointing him because he was drunk, and couldn't be counted on. 

The only thing that I suggest: change your outlook from one of hopelessness, to one of hopefulness.

I believe that all on this sub has the potential to live a better life.  I believe that because I believe in my ability to do the same.

1374211731.0,34,self.stopdrinking,1im4os,"Well, hello everybody...",metooiguess,37,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1im4os/well_hello_everybody/,"I've been lurking here for a good few months, but I realized I had a problem long before that.

I vividly remember talking to a friend, close to a year ago now, about our drinking habits, about cutting down. I remember joking about having a problem. 

Sure, we drank a lot, and often, but drinking less and on fewer occasions would just be a matter of exercising some self-control. Something to do in a few years when we're less young. Something to do along with better eating, working out, more discipline. Fitter. Happier. More productive...

Still, the conversation lingered in my head. I decided to prove that I didn't have a problem by making up 'rules' to regulate my drinking. 'Only in a social context', 'Only after 8', 'only x beers'. Shouldn't be too hard, right?

Of course I failed.

Even worse, I realized that most of the time I didn't even get to 'breaking' the rules. I would just forget about them. I'd start the day deciding not to drink all day (can't be that difficult, right!), and I'd end it by almost unconsciously buying some beers, drinking them, and in the process forgetting that I had decided not to drink that day.

And *that's* what scared me the most, and what prompted me to be a bit more serious about this 'stopping' thing everyone keeps being so positive about around here ;).

If my dependency is so strong that it can 'make' my brain forget about it, well, then where does that lead?

I feel my dependency crossed a line. 

I didn't mind feeling feeble all day because I drank too much the day before. I didn't mind feeling tired all day because I had to get up at four to take a massive piss and I couldn't get back to sleep. I didn't mind that most of my evening hours were wasted to films and junk food, because hey, there'd be another day and I had been productive enough anyways. 

Really, aside from the 'epic' binges that left me with massive hangovers and a resolve to never ever drink again (he said jokingly to his equally-hungover flatmate), I didn't really mind any of that.

But that's really the problem, isn't it? I didn't *mind* any of that, because my mind isn't some entity completely separated from my dependency. They all entangled, and shit.

I don't hate the drinking; I hate the thinking.

No single thing should have so much control over the mind, least of all something as stupid as alcohol.

So it's time to get back into the driver's seat, and I'm ready to admit that I probably need some help with that.

How it got to this is a longer story, and probably familiar to many of you, so I'll leave it at this. Wish me luck!

(Stopping smoking seems to have raised the stakes. I do not recommend quitting both at the same time. Even with 2.5 years of sobriety Putting down the cigarettes was almost a reason for me to drink.) 

A thousand days ago I was a wreck. Today I am making progress in a positive direction. I was unemployed, unemployable. My marriage was on the brink of collapse. I was suicidal. It was not pretty.

I found a bunch of people just like me and started following there suggestions. I've shared some of those suggestions in this SubReddit before, but since anniversaries are for the new comers (to prove that there is a solution) here are a couple bits of wisdom that literally saved my life:

When you pick up a 24 hour coin there is a triangle on one side that is labeled ""Unity, Recovery, Service.""  Those are what you need to stay sober. Unity = get a home group. Recovery = get a sponsor and work the steps. Service = get a service commitment and be useful.

Work your program like you drank. I drank all that there was, so I had to use all of the program. I drank every day so I had to work my program every day.

Do 5 things every day and you will stay sober. (There is a difference between not drinking and being sober.)

* Pray in the morning to have the urges removed. (repeat as necessary, especially at first. The urge to drink lasts 5 minutes. Learn to pray for 10.)

* Talk to another alcoholic. (Sponsor, sponsee, whatever)

* Read some literature.

* Go to a meeting.

* Pray at night to thank your higher power for another day clean and sober. 

**And all of this AA stuff works even if you are an atheist or agnostic like me.**

See, I don't NEED ALCOHOL but I can't STAND BOREDOM. Maybe that's splitting hairs, I don't know. Regardless, I'm tired of being drunk half the time. I started drinking in college and went on and off for years. Mostly off. Then when I hit 30 and had a good paying, full time job with little oversight and lots of free time...I just started to drink a lot. At home. At work. On weeknights. On weekends. Whenever there was nothing to do, I'd drink.    
I used to be happy when I was drunk, but for years I've been a belligerent asshole. When I drink, I'm alone a lot of the time now - sitting at home watching shock videos, wallowing in depression, etc. I pick up the phone and terminate friendships for no reason and then have to apologize the next day. I start fights with my girlfriend and regret it. I talk endless amounts of egoistic bullshit with my other drunk friends (when I bother to go out with them) - literally sitting in the parking lot of Wal Mart drinking a 5th of cheap bourbon talking about how we're going to start a rock band and become wildly successful. It's all bullshit and I know it -- but in that moment of inebriation, it's a humorous escape. But when I come down, I hate myself for it. I just wasted an entire Saturday on yet another bottle that I can't really afford...drinking it with someone who's just as lost and directionless as me. I'm fucking tired of this. I want to stop. I hate it. I want something more to live for than another bottle of escapism.

I hope you're enjoying your non-hungover Sunday morning as much as I have been. 

So anyways, I know I know I know I should go to a meeting, and I will. This will happen, I'm beginning to think that my take from the program will simply be to have a 'shot in the arm' in terms of my social life--which has nose dived.

But it nose dived in a way that I didn't anticipate. Most people conjecture that when you give up drinking, you give up your drinking friends too based on the reason that it's a bad influence etc etc. What I'm realizing, and this kind of sucks, is that I'm not 'giving them up' because of their drinking perse, but because they're proven themselves to be kind of shitty.  I've been blown off, flaked on a lot recently. 

But I realize is that I've probably been blown off and flaked on for years but never noticed because I was too busy being drunk and flaking on and blowing off other people. Lame, right? 

It's like I had been just sliding through life on the bear minimum expectation of what bonds friends together for so long that I never realized how lame I had become.

I hope that makes sense. 

So when I text a friend to see if they want to hang and I don't hear back for 9 hours, the disappointment wounds me way more than it used to.

It's gotten so bad that I've basically given up on reaching out to these people, because I'd prefer being lonely than flaked on and rejected.

And lastly, I forgot where I read it. . but there's an acronym in the program for four or five triggers that commonly lead to drinking. . what is it.  exhaustion, hunger, loneliness? Any help with this one?

I fucking get the loneliness part. When I knocked off work on Friday night not a soul had returned my phone calls, so I went home. Sat down and worked on some heart wrenching music. I wouldn't say I was tempted to drink, but the dark ""fuck it-- no one's going to notice if you're drunk or not, because apparently no one notices when you're alive or not, so why the fuck not?"" voice started to chime in.

So channeled into music. But christ, I'm a social animal. And I need new friends!

A quick reflection.,2dayeyechange,35,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/19x61s/365_days_a_quick_reflection/,"A year ago, I was driving in a fog - a familiar fog of hungoveritis.  It was for the last time.  After waking up pissed off that I failed to keep my drinking under control again, having what was probably a nervous breakdown in the shower, and the resentment I had towards myself for not being able to keep my shit together, I decided to quit for good.

My drinking was never one where I *had* to have a drink in the morning, but there were certainly times that I would actively search out for a reason to drink – mainly away from my family.  On business trips, I would drink with partners and when everyone would go their respective ways, I would search out new drinking friends at the hotel bar or some other bar that was open.  Those nights never generally ended well.  The next morning, I would never remember what or how I ended up where I ended up.

Funny thing is that my career skyrocketed while I was drinking.  I was the “fun” guy.  Looking back, I think I was the guy that people wanted to drink with because they wanted a drinking alibi..  I was a closeted alcoholic and hid most of my horrible drinking away from friends and family or just drank in excess with different friends at different times.  I was calculated.  

Because alcohol never impacted my career, I confused my success and related it to my drinking.  How was I to succeed and build relationships and friendships with partners if I couldn’t take them out and entertain them?
Well a year later, I’m happy to report that it’s very much possible.  Quite simply, I tell people that I don’t drink.  I can still hang out at bars/clubs/events and have my soda grapefruit and “party” until 3, 4, or 5am without drinking.  In the mornings, I’m just exhausted, but not hung over.

My biggest fear has been what would people think when they find out that I don’t drink?  Honestly, nobody gives a shit.  They really don’t.  Some people might haze you a bit, but it’s generally all in fun.  Stand your ground, don’t give in and people will know it’s for real.  Make no apology.  “Sorry, I don’t drink.” Shouldn’t have to be a valid excuse.  There’s no reason to apologize.  If someone offers you a drink, politely decline.  If they push, “No thank you, I don’t drink”.  Everyone leaves it at that.

The only time I’ve run across any issues or people *really* pressuring is generally late at night when everyone is drunk.  At that point, there’s generally “that guy” that’s pushing shots and calling me a pussy when I don’t accept the drink.  I just remind myself, when I see that guy in the morning, he’ll be hurting.  I won’t.  And they *always* hurt in the morning.  Watching “that guy” with a hangover is my form of comedy. 

It’s been a great year.  Nothing magical happened when I quit drinking.  People didn’t have a parade for me.  Balloons didn’t drop from the ceiling and there were no fireworks.  The anxiety was all in my head.  Life carried on.  My life or career didn’t get magically better, but my mornings remained clear, I haven’t ended up in questionable situations, and I have a much better outlook on sober life.

Sobriety can easily be just as fun as a drinking life.  It takes a bit getting used to, but it’s worth it.

Last time I quit for a year, it was a personal challenge to see if I could do it.  I celebrated by getting drunk.  Having quit drinking and being sober for a year, I’m celebrating by looking forward to my 366th day of sobriety.

Much love to this sub.

I'm needmorecowbe11 and this is my Saturday share. I apologize if it bounces around a lot.

**Childhood:**

I was born to a single mother who met my stepfather when I was about the age of 3. I call him my stepfather because he's been around since I was young but they never married. This man was to be my role model during my formative years. He is also an alcoholic as is my mother.

I always felt loved by both of my parents but around the age of 10 or 11 it was quite apparent that they no longer felt love for each other. Nightly fights, complete with yelling, swearing, and unwarranted accusations, became the norm for me. I saw my stepfather (and continue to see him do this) drink in excess on a nightly basis. All the while I would be dragged into their fights by my mother, asking me to take a side and watching her be hurt when it wasn't her side that was chosen. 


Because of this, I always felt like there was *something* that I could do/had to do to fix situations.


There were many many instances where I was afraid because my stepdad was driving drunk with myself and my mother in the truck. One instance of this was on Christmas Eve when we were driving home from his families house. It was icy and just generally shitty weather and my mother said something along the lines of ""Be careful."" This set my stepdad off on a rampage. He stopped the truck, made her get out with about 5 miles before the house in blizzard conditions, and told her to walk. Of course I wasn't going to leave my mom to walk by herself and got out also with all of the gifts that I had gotten from my family in tow. He eventually came back to pick us up.

I've really only recently started to learn what a healthy relationship actually looks like.

**Adolescence:**

I didn't really drink until my junior year in high school. About a handful of times, I drank a pint of 100 proof whiskey and chased it with a 6-pack of beer. That was my first experience with blacking out and passing out. After I saw my friends doing this every weekend I realized that I didn't want to become an alcoholic like my stepfather so I quit drinking completely (well *that* worked out great, didn't it?).

I never really fit into one certain clique in high school. I was always kind of on the outer edge of any given one. I went through all the different ones trying to find some kind of acceptance, and I did to varying degrees. Let me tell you, it's weird going through a jock phase, goth phase, and a punk phase all in one year! That shit is tiring! In essence, what I was trying to do was mask who I really was, someone who I wasn't entirely sure that I liked, by putting on a plethora of masks in the hope that I would find acceptance from other people. Saying what I thought would gain me the most acceptance from others so that I could accept myself. I was trying to gain external acceptance to find one internally (sound familiar?)

**Adulthood:**

Let's fast forward to about the age of 19. I've met a girl that I felt I had connected with and fast track an engagement as her parents are moving to Tennessee (currently in Michigan). I end up moving down there with her so she can be with her parents, get a job at a company I worked for up here, and we settle in. About 6 months later, we move back up to MI and I get my old job back and eventually a promotion to assistant manager. Things are going well for a bit until they're not. We start drifting apart and it all comes to a head when she finds texts in my phone to another woman. Nothing graphic but enough to push our relationship off the edge. It had been on its way for awhile and I don't blame her for it. She ended up leaving me and moving back in with her parents down South that day.

Now what was unique about the day that this happened was that it was my birthday. Specifically, it was my 21st birthday. I went out with my friends and you can guess what I did. As soon as it happened I felt the pain leave me. It was like some kind of magical elixir that numbed my emotions to a level that I could tolerate!

At that moment it was off to the races. I was drinking almost daily while I let my resentments towards her, me, life, or whatever excuse I needed, build up inside my head. Eventually I let it go but drinking already had its hooks in me. I was going out with friends and getting drunk around 4 nights a week and getting home with no recollection of how I had done it. I ended up having to move in with my parents for a little bit until I finally moved in with a co-worker and a mutual friend. (I have some pretty hilarious non-drinking stories about those two. Messiest roommates I've ever lived with. Ask me about it sometime if you're ever in the IRC.)

For the next few years my existence consisted of working and drinking. If I wasn't doing the latter in between bouts of work, I was bored out of my mind. Then I moved in with my last roommate and eventually I ended up getting my first DUI. I blew a .23, which is almost 3 times the legal limit. The couple of things that I remember about that evening was that the police officer was nice enough to cuff me in the front and that the holding cells at county are really freakin cold!

After court fees/fines, community service and being on probation for about 6 months, I was *still* ready to go back out. Only this time I'd be more careful! Shortly after I was off of probation, I ended up dating one of my exes from back in the day. Let me tell you something…there's a reason why people are your ex. That was a bad idea!

Eventually I lost my job. I worked for a company that didn't really ""get with the times"" and their model for business became outdated. Honestly, I was well on my way out anyway. Coming in hungover and smelling of booze and cigarettes isn't really conducive to keeping your job. At the time I blamed my poor performance on other people unwilling to teach me the things I needed to do/what was expected of me. Really though, it was that I didn't have the willingness to be taught.

At first everything was alright and I'd spend time with her and her son. We became close. Then it slowly started falling apart faster and faster. Instead of washing my hands of the situation, I allowed it to become a big excuse to continue my drinking. I always had an excuse but at the time I thought it was an extremely valid one. I was drinking *at* someone while hiding it from them. I know, it doesn't make much sense to me now, either.

I would get a 6 pack of high ABV beer (~10%) and a few tall cans of shitty beer for after my sense of taste was diminished. I would use the excuse that I was only drinking about 9 beers. In reality I was drinking about 15-18 drinks compared to the ABV of the average American beer. I would do this between 3-5 times a week.

This continued for another couple of years and then **BAM!** DUI number 2! That was the eye-opener I needed. It finally clicked! All the years of justifying my drinking, of rationalizing why I wasn't an alcoholic came to a head and slapped me upside mine. I'm still dealing with the fallout from it. I had to move back into my parents' house where I deal with their drinking on a daily basis. I'm never too far from my poison of choice, but today I no longer have the obsession I once had towards it.

**Sobriety:**

Since that day, exactly 9 months today, I've accepted that I am an alcoholic. I can't drink like normal people. Once I have one drink in me, I will have more and more until I am physically unable to continue. I've gone to AA and posted in this sub and used any support I can get when I'm feeling weak.

Gone are the nights of passing out while I have a pizza in the oven, only to wake up to a burned, blackened mess or the nights of falling asleep with a half drank bottle next to me only to put it in the fridge for later or being thankful as hell that the cigarette I was smoking was in the ashtray and burned out instead of burning the house down.

This didn't all come at first. I was still a mess when I first quit drinking. There were times when I felt like picking up a drink to make the pain and hurt go away again. At those times I would reach out. When I'm feeling weak, I know that there are people in my life who can be strong for me in the meantime. 

For the first several months I didn't want to get a sponsor or really work the steps, but after seeing the people who have worked them and who have found some sort of peace in their lives, I've become willing. Things may not be perfect but I'm in a place now where I'm able to accept them. I no longer feel the need to drown my sorrows and my self in a bottle to feel ""alright"".

Today I know that nothing that happens is worth taking a drink over. I can handle any situation much better without a clouded mind and stumbling over my words. Life may not be perfect, but I wouldn't give up anything for what I have today.

I want to leave anyone still reading with this:

You can do this. You can live a life that's free from alcohol. When you're weak, reach out. When you feel like you're falling, please reach out for a helping hand to support you. Whether you use AA, SMART, this subreddit…whatever, there will always be somebody willing to listen. For anyone who's still considering quitting, know this: you don't have to continue digging. You can stop this today. Today can be the beginning of a beautiful, fulfilling life!

I handled it just fine, and I handled the drink the next night just fine too, and I handled going to the bar with people from work that friday fine too, and any alcoholic knows where that led... many months of relapse. 

But today, today as they were pouring I calmly walked up to the person pouring and said ""I'll take one with just orange juice"". Someone else said ""A virgin orange juice for dave"" and I just ignored them and took my non alcoholic beverage. Several people had to have noticed, and nobody said anything else, and nobody gave me any strange looks or asked any questions. I was offered champagne refills no less than 3 more times, and I just said 'no thanks'.

90 days ago I walked into my first AA meeting. I was hesitant and scared like many of you. I'm an agnostic and I didn't want God shoved down my throat. But I didn't want to get blitzed every night either; and I was running out of options. The higher power that is AA saved my life.

1340117170.0,37,self.stopdrinking,va05k,Hello everyone! I'm here to introduce you to an exciting new drug. It's called Sobriety™,midlake500,37,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/va05k/hello_everyone_im_here_to_introduce_you_to_an/,"Hello friends, I'm here to introduce you to an exciting new drug that combines the benefits of multiple high dollar pharmaceutical drugs into one. From anxiety relief, better mental clarity, more energy, improved memory, improved relationship with friends and family, more intimacy with your spouse, and even that hot beach bod you've always wanted. The drug is called Sobriety™, and it has so many amazing effects that some are calling it a miracle drug. We're confident that after trying Sobriety™, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Here are just some of the many remarkable benefits:

* Sobriety™ completely elevates those morning head pains! 100% guaranteed to work, every time. You'll wake up feeling great and ready to tackle the day

* Sobriety™ works equally well for morning stomach pains. No more vomiting and skipping breakfast!

* Over long periods of time, Sobriety™ works to relieve gastric reflex and heartburn. You'll actually be able to eat spicy food again. Can someone say ""all you can eat buffalo wings""?

* Sobriety™ significantly increases quality of sleep, lower's your heart rate, makes you more alert, and less anxious. That's the same affects as multiple top dollar pharmaceutical drugs all in one!

* Feeling down and ashamed of yourself? We got great news! Sobriety™ boosts your sense of accomplishment and gives you a new outlook on life. 

* With Sobriety™ people will start to look at you differently. Your relationships with your friends and family will improve dramatically! It's not just a physical makeover, it's a complete lifestyle makeover.

* Lack of energy and motivation throughout the day? Sobriety™ has been proven to increase both energy level and motivation throughout the day. 

* Having trouble remembering things? Thought's a little foggy? Sobriety™ increases mental clarity, memory, and concentration! What a deal!

* No more awkward apologies the next day from embarrassing yourself the night before. Let your mind rest easy. You'll be the cool, calm, collected guy that looks like he's got his shit together

* Going through difficult times? Problems mounting? Had a stressful day? Sobriety™ gives you a power shot of consciousness, allowing you to be 100% focus and prepared to tackle every problem head on. You'll go from setting on the bench to plowing over those problems like a 400lb juggernaut.

* You'll be 100% conscious to feel every moment of excitement and laughter when you're hanging out with your friends. Partying will never be the same!

* Increased physical health and appearance. Everyone will want to know your secret. Goodbye beer gut, hello beach bod!

* And last but not least, not only is Sobriety™ 100% free, but it actually increases your available funds! It's like getting a pay raise! Time to go out to a nice steak dinner, save up for that dream vacation, take salsa dancing lessons with your lady, join the gym, and live the life of luxury you deserve

Now you're probably wondering why you don't hear much about Sobriety™ and more about our competitor, Alcohol. We'll be honest, we dropped the ball when it came to our marketing department. And what little marketing we did do came across as cheesy and disingenuous when you were a child in the form of half-assed drug education programs. We'd tried to make Sobriety™ look cool and trendy, but well fell hard on our face. We just weren't able to keep up with the amount a PR work the team over at Alcohol does. Their marketing department is brilliant and very well funded. From the time you grew up, you we're bombarded daily about all the great benefits of Alcohol and how it helps you have a good time. It's not just in commercials, but their product placement is deeply embedded in our television, movies, music, and culture in general. It's impossible to go a 
whole day without being exposed to some sort of advertising by Alcohol. What's more, friends and family will reaffirm the so called ""positive effect"" Alcohol claims to have, which makes it much easiler to be pursuaded by their marketing. Social influence is one of the most persuasive forms of marking there is. But don't be deceived, let the products speak for themselves. Who looks like they're more satisifed with life: those who are using Sobriety™, or those using Alcohol?

To be fair, we'll go ahead and list the benefits of Alcohol so you can compare:

1) Less consciousness and impaired brain function

UPDATE: I successfully made it through the entire trip without a drink! The way I got by was as someone suggested, turn it into a little game. Watch all the others get silly and sloppy. And holy shit were there some incredibly sloppy people there. I can't explain how LIBERATING it felt for me to be so aware and lucid and together. I made myself the DD for the evening and my bandmates gratitude was incredible. 

First, we were in unknown territory (First trip to Boston) Second, we left the venue LATE (2am) and had to drive almost an hour to the house we were staying in. If I wasn't sober, no one would have been at that moment. What I mean by that is, if I had caved, I would've stranded us all. So THAT was a huge motivating factor for me to stay strong. The bartender was awesome and gave me all the water/soda and even some food for free. That was a cool perk. I think he sensed that I was tasked with taking care of my bandmates.

Another huge thing was the day after, not only were they incredibly thankful that I stayed sober to drive them safely, but they were proud of the fact that I held out. We had a small discussion in the van about how I wanted to give it a rest and stay sober. That was huge, I was now not only accountable to myself, but to my bandmates too. Big help. 

Sorry for the rambling. This was a big mental hurdle for me and one that had me nervous. I was quite pleased with how it went and found that if I really put my mind to it and have the support, it CAN absolutely be accomplished. The next big hurdle will now of course be 4th of July.

1. Cravings hit hard at the end of the work day, 4:00pm or so. This typically was reward time. Work hard and stop for a cocktail or three on the way home before the evening started.
1. It is still tough telling everyone that I am not drinking. I tend to pick and choose who I can tell. I know this is not ideal.
1. I am having difficulty multitasking and handling systems and processes the way I used to handle them. I hope it comes back.

I intend to do a full check up and blood work at the 90 day mark to see what has happened to my body. 

I am feeling a bit down right now, but it is probably just the time of day.

1358461623.0,31,self.stopdrinking,16s1eu,Nine Months Today! This is my story (FWIW). ,throwaway1_17,39,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16s1eu/nine_months_today_this_is_my_story_fwiw/,"I've been sober for nine months as of today (HOLY SHITE!!!). I've been on /r/stopdrinking for a while but wanted to use a throwaway account. 

I haven't shared my whole story with anyone yet and I wanted to get it out. It was therapeutic for me and that was my motivation.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A BRAIN DUMP AND IT IS A LONG ONE. 

I am 32 and I had slowly become alcohol dependent over the course of 13 years. I also smoked pot everyday for those 13 years. In the beginning things were great. I didn't drink through High School. I couldn't wait to go to college because I had a pretty abusive father and barely any friends due to the fact we moved about 60 miles when I was 13. If you've ever been 13, it can be difficult to be the “new kid” and especially the new kid with a huge chip on his shoulder. So, I spent High School pretty much on my own which was OK by me.

When I left for college I got a fresh start and met people left and right. I was in my prime at that point. I joined a fraternity with some of the friends I made in the dorms. I wasn't a big drinker then but I was introduced to other substances. I was a Computer Science major and spent a lot of my time on assignments or studying. Alcohol was ever present and I drank my share but it didn't create any problems for me during school. My girlfriend and I eventually broke up mostly because I wasn't willing to fully commit. The last year of college I drank a ton, smoked a lot of endo, and became closer with a lot of people who before were only acquaintances. It was truly the most care free and joyous time of my life.

I graduated, got an awesome job and got my first new car. Alcohol was still there, I still got drunk on the weekends with friends at bars, but I never blacked out. I'm a goofy drunk and like to cause trouble, but not the violent kind. Eight months later I got the opportunity to move to Germany for ten months and took it. I was 24. 

I remember I drank on the flight. We arrived at 6am and I drove to my new apartment. I walked in the door and cannot the forget my first thought - “what now?” - I panicked. I couldn't sleep the first night and this is when I started self medicating. I walked to a gas station down the street and bought a six pack. I drank them all and then passed out. The next day, the first place I went was the nearest Irish Pub. I was told by a colleague to find one because everyone there will speak English and most of them know the city well. I became family there and alcohol was a huge part of every day for me. I started dating one of the servers and got close with all the bartenders and the owner. I would go to the pub as early as I could and drink all day into the night. It was fun as hell. I met a lot of great people - German, Irish, English, Croatian, Polish and the Americans from the military base nearby. It was awesome and eye opening for a 24 year old American. For nine months this continued and alcohol just became the norm. I didn't realize what a crutch it had become and the progressiveness of alcoholism.

I returned back to the states and the next eight years are a little blurry. I drank a lot and blacked out a lot. So did a lot of my friends so it seemed OK at the time. Girlfriends came and went (and went mostly due to the alcohol problem). Then I met the black widow. She was awesome – super artsy, super pretty and super intellectual. I was in love. My drinking ruined that relationship. She had dated a heroin addict earlier in her life and told me she couldn't do it again. I was devastated.

This is when I started drinking a fifth a day. I did that for two years. I got into other things – a couple months of pain pill addiction after I fractured my foot in a drunken accident. I had a little love affair with coke and fucked around with shrooms. It was just a normal thing for me by this point. The spiral continued and my work relationship got worse. I was missing a lot of it and my boss was getting pissed. I was a top performer for about seven years and he couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me all of a sudden. He allowed me to miss work and call out all the time. I was definitely resting on my laurels and used his leniency so I could spend my days drinking. 

A little under a year ago I was up to a half gallon of Vodka a day and about a pint of Scotch. I was on a business trip and at this point I was so exhausted...mentally and physically from trying to keep my life in order while being blacked out or passed out most of the time. On the last day of the trip I had a seizure and was unconscious for about 20 minutes. This was because I didn’t have a drink for about fifteen hours. I went to the ER, got some stitches and Vicodin. I downed the pills in about two days and kept up my drinking. There is a disease that runs in my family which causes benign brain tumors. I convinced myself it was the reason for the seizure and not the alcohol. I look back and cannot believe how black and diseased my thinking was at the time. I have a nice scar above my eye to remind me of the seizure and how I could have easily died that day. I owe my life to some random stranger who found me in the mall parking lot and called 911.

I lost my license due to the seizure and state law and my boss let me work from home. I was in heaven. I drank non stop for about three weeks and took heavy doses of librium and dilantin. I don't remember how much I drank in this period but it was a lot. 

And then a miracle happened. I, for some reason, texted my friend who was four years sober from a crack addiction. Apparently for a couple of days I texted him and he was slowly leading me out of the suicidal, dark, depressing, resentful pit I was in. Finally one night he asked me who runs my family. You know – the responsible one that keeps the family together. I sent him my brother number and at about 8pm my friends starting showing up at my apartment one by one. I was so dumb drunk at the time I just thought they were all coming over to keep me company and make sure I didn't kill myself. I was enjoying a Vodka and Gatorade on my back porch, shooting the shit with one of my friends, when my brother and sister in law showed up. He told me I'm coming with him and I'm going to rehab. My friends packed my bag, cleaned the red Gatorade puke off the wall and toilet in my bathroom and locked the place up. I love them all.

I got to rehab and had no idea what was going on. They were taking my vitals, giving my pills and shots, taking blood and I just went with it. I surrendered. I had felt like no one cared that I was a suicidal alcoholic and I was meaningless to them. When they intervened I didn’t feel that way anymore. I was so RELIEVED that I didn’t have to live with the stress anymore and knew that people cared about me. Surrender was easy. 

I look back at my old journal from rehab to remind myself of the small things in life. Just seeing colors again was amazing to me. Music, drawing, reading, writing. Before sobering up my eye sight was so busted colors weren't vivid and my nervous system was so screwed I couldn't control my hand to write. I could barely sign the credit card receipt at the liquor store.

I got through detox without another seizure. I didn’t sleep much and got really into the structure of rehab. I needed it and it worked well for me. I met a lot of great people and learned a ton. I was let go after 23 days and made a really tough decision to go to a recovery house instead of back home to living alone. I would have drank eventually if I went home and I knew it. This was the tough decision that I had to make, but it was the correct one. I was 32 and living in a house with 13 other people between the ages of 18 and 56. It was an experience and it was humbling. I made a lot of great friends and I got into AA and aftercare therapy. I was in the house for five and half months and then moved to the sober house where I am now. I yearn for my own place and getting back to living on my own. I really want to rescue a dog and that is going to be my one year gift to myself.

I have learned to live again – my top recovery song is probably “Walk” by the Foo Fighters (corny I know). It really is like being an infant and learning everything again for the first time. Everything is a learning experience and every time I do something good for myself I am fighting the bad side of me and beating it. Every experience, good or bad, where I don’t turn to booze or other things, I get stronger. 

I worked and continue to work really hard at recovery – rehab, recovery house, five weeks of PHP and six weeks of IOP. I do take Welbutrin for depression and Neurontin for anxiety. They work great for me. I have OCD where I have 'checking rituals' and it causes me a lot of anxiety. But with a sober mind I am able to fight the thoughts and they are getting less and less powerful. I go to the gym and do things that I enjoy. I spoil myself sometimes and that is alright.

I have to mention, as ashamed as I am now, that I did develop a cross addiction in recovery which was gambling. I lost a lot of money and put myself in a bad place financially. I was doing it compulsively until me and my therapist got to the root of it and I banged my head enough times to stop. It was delaying my recovery immensely and it would have eventually led me to drink again. But, it helped me too. I now know when I'm beginning to rely on any one thing too much. I can play a video game for 9 hours straight, I can over eat, I can go buy unnecessary things. But I realize that every time I do that I am delaying my recovery and delaying becoming the person I want to be. And none of these things make me happy.

I attend AA regularly but it's more or less to socialize and hear the stories of other people. I also feel very much at home in AA. It's almost like a party and it keeps me on track. I followed the steps the best I could and got a really great sponsor. I do not believe in God, but I studied the steps to understand the true psychological nature of them. In terms of spirituality – I now finally get that happiness comes from within. I have the nature of pursuing external things to try an obtain happiness. I now realize that things in life happen which are not satisfactory to me. My decision is to always think positively. I can always be happy if I just laugh at life...I'm not so serious about the ups and downs anymore. 

I can be around alcohol now and I don't mind telling a waitress that I'm a recovering alcoholic when she starts the beer specials. I can see my friends again while they drink and have real interactions with them. I am becoming whole again and it feels FANTASTIC. Life is good and I now have control over my thinking, attitude and outlook. I don't need to drown in booze to hide unpleasant thoughts or emotions. I look into them to understand why they are showing up. I understand who I am now.

That's all I got. If you read this far I thank you kindly for your time and the princess is in another castle. Keep up YOUR awesome work and I wish you much happiness and health.

In closing – I will always remember what my sponsor told me when I celebrated my first anniversary - “That's great...now get another day.” His point was that it's not how much time you have sober but what you are doing with that time. Which reminded me of Gandalf's quote from LoTR - “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" 

Namaste.

tl;dr: I'm an alcoholic...a terrible terrible sot. I quit drinking nine months ago today and I'm getting better. I also don't blame you because this shit was loooooong.

Advice/support welcome.,chompycoffee,40,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iqzjj/heavy_drinker_female_ready_to_stop_advicesupport/,"Hi /r/stopdrinking, my name is chompycoffee, and I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. Previous visits to this sub led me to believe that I didn't belong here because my drinking doesn't negatively affect my career or family, I've never switched stores to conceal amounts, I've never driven drunk, I've never gotten into legal trouble as a result of my drinking, and I've never vomited from drinking too much alcohol. Many of the stories here honestly don't resonate with me.

*But it doesn't matter, because I have an unhealthy relationship with booze, I'm concerned about my health, and it is no longer pleasurable to drink.* I've been a heavy drinker for about 8 years, and I've been exploring ways to cut back or moderate since 2008. My drinking isn't as heavy as it was 6 or 7 years ago, but the pattern and my lack of control are scaring me now. Here comes a wall of text. Bear with me.

Here is what has really changed things: I recently started taking a medication (SSRI) that seems to remove my ""shut off switch"" when I would normally realize I'd had enough to drink and stop. On a ""normal"" heavy drinking night, I would probably have 4-6 drinks, mostly beer. On this medication, I continue past that to 8-10 drinks until there is no more booze or I pass out. Even more distressing is the fact that I have browned out about 5 times in the last 7 months--and with the new medication, it has happened more frequently. This is something I have never experienced before. It also affects my hangovers--they aren't nearly as bad as usual, I just feel ""foggy"" and confused. This tells me that my body has changed, and I need to listen to it.

I had my first embarrassing drinking experience last month at a wedding, and that's when I really started to wonder if it was time to stop completely. Then last weekend, I drank heavily 3 nights in a row, not stopping until I crawled into bed. The first night, I had half a bottle of champagne and 4 or 5 beers. The second night, a bottle of red wine and some beers. The third, ""just"" four beers, but I had only intended to have 2 or 3. 

Counting drinks is exhausting. Trying to moderate is exhausting. Thinking about the next time I can drink, or whether or not I SHOULD drink, is exhausting. I'm so tired of it. If I spent this much time thinking about peanut butter, I would stop eating it. Why put myself through this for something I don't need?

I quit smoking a little over a month ago, and realizing that I don't HAVE to smoke at social gatherings has been huge for me. This has given me the insight that not drinking at social occasions is just not the big deal I thought it would be. I CAN become a non-drinker, just as I've become a non-smoker. It's not the end of the world. This was a huge revelation for me.

Today is my 6th day without a drink, and I'd like to continue. Unlike previous attempts to stop for a specific period of time, I'm going to take the advice here and just concentrate on not drinking today, and then the next day. I have a lot of thinking to do. I'm 2/3 of the way through the Carr book.

I told my partner last night that I am strongly considering not drinking anymore. She is supportive. I'm not going to make a big deal out of it or tell the whole world. My very valid excuse not to drink in social settings is that I'm on medication that interacts with alcohol. So...here I go. I could use advice from anyone who considered themselves a heavy drinker or a problem drinker, who never really ""hit bottom.""

I had gladly accepted the role of the designated driver, so I was sitting, watching the chaos ensue.  It wasn't really until then that I started re-thinking my position on what alcohol is and what it does to people.  I have been reading a lot lately about diets, industrial chemicals used in food, and as I was watching people pass out, vomit, and fall all over the place, I thought to myself, ""alcohol is straight up *poison.*""

I don't know why that never occurred to me in all the years I was drinking.  I suppose that's part of addiction.  Standing there with music blaring and drinks being spilled, I had a sudden clarity clarence moment.    That shift in the way I perceive alcohol has made it easier for me to turn down drinks and respond to people who ask why I don't drink or look at me sideways when I say I don't drink at all.  Now, it has simply become a matter of fact thing that I say when questioned:  *You don't drink.... at all?*   'No.  Not at all.  Pass the butter please.'  And that's the end of it.  I don't have any feelings of judgement toward them and I don't expect any from them.  I only expect that I give them my answer and we move on.  

It's taken me the better part of a year to get to this point, but when I am asked about it, that confident, matter of fact response tends to disarm people.  It's like I stopped caring what people thought when I told them I don't drink.  It's a good feeling.  Although I thought it would happen more often, not once have I had to respond to the ""why don't you drink?"" question with ""because fuck you that's why.""  The best answer I have come up with so far is *""Because I don't""* and that has worked surprisingly well.

I chose not to use an alt account either, so if you know me and you're reading this, please don't go telling everyone about my problems. 

I'm a 22 year old male and I am, or was not, an everyday drinker. I never have been. I will say that I am, or was, a certified binge drinker. Every weekend, special events, or sometimes random days in the week, I would start drinking. When I started, it was impossible for me to stop until all the booze was gone or I was passed out. I've been doing this probably since I was 18 with no negative repercussions, only ""good times."" That is until, things started changing...

I have an anxiety disorder and alcohol can completely mask my anxieties. All my worrying, and physical symptoms seemed to disappear when alcohol was involved. It was such a relief to feel normal for a change. I felt like I could finally be myself with a few drinks in me. I felt like people liked me more. But one day, and I'm not sure when it officially started, my anxiety started to become worse the morning after a heavy session. It started off small, I would feel just a little panic'd, but gradually it has become horrific. The next day becomes a write off, I can't move, my heart beats super fast, my blood pressure sky rockets. I literally feel like I could have a stroke or heart attack at any moment. I've gone to the hospital because of this COUNTLESS times. I'm tired of feeling this way, and its taking me less and less alcohol to feel like this the next day.

Well no more. I'm done, fuck it. I can't drink alcohol. It is not worth the next day anxiety. I'm tired of feeling like i'm dying all the time. I'm ready to live. I still have my worries though. Now that I'm done drinking, I don't know what I'll do on the weekends, I don't know how I'll explain to my friends that I don't want to drink. I don't know how I'll meet new people, let alone girls (which is hard to do to begin with.)

When you tell people who drink that you don't drink, you're treated like a lepper. Any reason I tell most people they think i'm ""over exaggerating"" and I'll probably lose a couple friends because of this. But I can't continue on this way. Not to mention I'm completely irresponsible when I drink. I'm actually a fucking idiot, and its taking me awhile to realize this. I make poor decisions that I won't go into detail about. 

Is there anyone else like me? Anyone who is young, quitting, and worried about the future? I'm finally starting college this september and I'm worried about losing the social aspects of quitting. How do you guys cope? Thanks for taking the time to read this, even if you don't reply I appreciate you hearing my plight.

Then it clicked. I realized, why am I poisoning myself every single day without so much of a thought as to how destructive this behavior is? Why does every event have to involve alcohol or I'm not interested? Because I think I need it to be ""normal""?

I am so grateful for this ""moment of clarity"". I'd always heard the phrase in relation to substance abuse, and always sort of balked at people who would preach out against alcohol. Because, or so I thought, I was in control. But I am not in control of alcohol, alcohol is in control of me.

IN the years before I got sober, I used to hate it when people made me feel like I had one of two choices: I could either live miserably as an alcoholic, or live miserably as a member of AA.  I resented this so deeply that I just kept drinking and avoiding the issue.  

I was sure they were completely wrong.  They obviously didn't understand me, because I was simply not capable of ""forgetting"" my skepticism concerning religion and swallowing the same stupid Kool-Aid as all the other thumpers.  It was a totally stupid and unreasonable expectation for them to have.  How could I just pretend to believe in God?  This was no different than what had been asked of me as a Catholic, and I had rejected that religion since I was ten years old.

Also, I hated the two meetings I'd been to. The rooms were grungy and smelled bad.  The people were low class and had sunk far lower than I ever had, or would.  The ideas I heard floated around were simplistic and unworthy of someone with my superior intellect.  It was clear to me that AA was a safety net designed to work for the lowest common denominator of human being, i.e. the bum who had been rescued from the street, or the addict who had been pulled back from the brink of death.  I have a university-level education and a long list of professional accomplishments in my field.  I had no business in the same room with that scum.  

So, I kept not going.  And I kept not getting sober.

I did eventually stop drinking, and I did it without AA, for a while.  For two years, in fact, I was sober without AA, and I was making decent progress.  That is, I wasn't just ""dry"", but I was actually doing honest work on myself.  I was not a total noob at spiritual development.  I had done a lot of reading, a lot of meditating, a lot of seeking, and some genuinely humble self-exploration.  In my quest to heal my wounded soul and arrive at the peace I knew must exist somewhere in the world, I had tried everything.  

(Except quitting drinking, I mean.)

At the two-year mark, I decided that I was going to try a meeting again.  I felt this was important precisely because I resisted it.  I knew by then that my ego was the part of me that made me feel I was better than everyone else in the rooms.  I also understood by then that my ego was a major reason why I used to keep drinking in the first place.  I had sort of forgotten about the heavy reliance on God and prayer.  I was more interested in simply talking to other alcoholics.  That was the main reason I wanted to go again.  I was getting lonely in my sobriety.  I wanted to find out what other people thought about and talked about and how they stayed sober.

So, I went to another meeting, tentatively.  It was sort of okay.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.  I still felt the same resistance to all the bullshit about God and a Higher Power (I mean, really?  come on, this is the fucking 21st century, and you expect me to believe in some omnipotent deity who will just zap away my problems if I get down on my knees and ask him?)  But it wasn't nearly as prevalent as I remembered.  And if I reminded myself to live and let live, I found it didn't bother me at all.  No one was actually trying to force me to believe anything, after all.  They were simply sharing what they believed.  And if I had a problem with that, then I guessed I wasn't really the tolerant, open-minded fellow I made myself out to be.

Anyway, I've been going to meetings on and off for about 10 months now.  There are a lot of things about AA I don't like.  The Big Book is ridiculously outdated, for one thing.  The Our Father at the end strikes me as completely out of place and inappropriate, and I don't say it.  But this stuff takes up about 1% of meetings.  The rest of the time is when the important stuff happens-—the talking, the sharing, and the helping.  These are why I go to meetings now, and why I feel energized and stronger every time I come out of one.  I now feel as if I am finally making the spiritual progress I used to strive for throughout my teens, twenties, and thirties.  And it's not nearly as hard as I made it out to be.  All I had to do was open up.

Think about it this way.  It is entirely possible for someone to get sober and stay sober all by themselves.  But why?  What is the point of being that super-smart guy who has the smug satisfaction of knowing he did it alone?  How did he grow?  What did he prove?  Who does he have to share it with?  Where is the laughter in all that?  Who does he share it with--his stereo system?  His carpet?  His furniture?

So, if you're trying to get sober but having a hard time, and if you're deeply resentful of the false sobriety-or-AA dichotomy, just remember: there's a lot more to it than the higher power stuff.  (And I do have a higher power kind of thing going on these days, but since it's highly personal, I won't get into it.)  In general, the more open I am in my willingness to get sober and stay that way, with AA or any other program of growth, the less likely I am to relapse and the easier things will get for me.

And life lately has been wonderful.  Absolutely wonderful.

This has been my experience.  I thought I would share in the hope that it resonates with some of you.  If you don't want to try AA, that's totally OK.  Just consider trying some sort of group.  The human race would like you back.

* insist that I'm only drinking x amount of times a week, while supplementing with other mind alternating substances - ALWAYS.
* have legitimate back pain and say my doctor gave me non-narcotics for pain when in fact it was the opposite.
* have legitimate migraines  - not addressing they might be the result of alcohol withdrawal - sneak pain pills from doctor again.  When confronted with a non-narcotic solution to migraines, not following through.
* asking for benzos for anxiety every other month from my doctor - hiding the pills from my wife.
* say I'm going out with work friends and only having a couple - knowing I could only have a couple on the bill, I'd stop at the store on the way home and slam 22's of high alcohol content beers.

This list is so very short of the lengths of my addiction.  The only time I didn't lie about my addiction...I've never drove under the influence of alcohol or benzos with our kids nor did I ever drink or take benzos when I was watching the kids while she was out of town.

Every day was either a drinking day or a hungover day, and starting to become both. Unlike some heavy drinkers, hangovers would still destroy me. Like, unable to stop puking until 8 pm. Then one night, a month ago, I blacked out and slapped my friend and we got into an enormous, teary, insane fight IN PUBLIC that I only remember parts of. He still won't talk to me and I blamed myself for it and chose to quit drinking a few days after the fight.

Now, a month later, that problem has not solved itself. But I realized something-- the fight wasn't entirely my fault. Our relationship wasn't healthy. The fight would have happened sooner or later, drunk or sober. This was a huge weight off my shoulders, and I have forgiven myself for a lot of things.

But-- and this is the part I didn't see coming-- when one problem lessens, another seems to take its place. Now a sense of self-pity and loneliness has taken the place of my alcohol-fueled self hatred. Without the drinking to blame, I see how my life is stagnant and when my mind is quiet all of my failed past relationships with men seem to flash before my eyes. I used to be so caught up in the drama of my immediate existence, usually because of something fucked up I'd done the night before. Now, sober introspection and the resurfacing memories of my failures are coming back to haunt me.

I grabbed the dog and took him out in the hopes of shutting up that corrupt mind.  I go into the shop to grab a couple of cigarettes and ol' brainy starts going wild.  There's the beer, it says, right there in the back.  I casually stroll to the back and glance up at the selection and think ""What the fuck am I doing?""

I sleep much better. Most nights I don't take anything to help me sleep and I sleep like a baby. 

The only thing that's really bugged me, was once or twice that I was physically shaky for a little while. It's only happened twice, the 2nd time being 2 nights ago for whatever reason.

Then another two months or so passed before I sipped again.  They weren't worth it.  Shortly after that I fell off the wagon completely and got drunk a few nights.  

Nothing too bad has happened (missed an assignment in a class, but that can be corrected in the long run), I haven't embarrassed myself too bad as most of the drinking happened while I was alone, and I still have my awesome boyfriend... So fuck it, I'm quitting (again) while I'm ahead.  Last time I was here I was in legal trouble because of alcohol and had to quit for a while. Thankfully I got through the whole thing and my case has been dropped, but I'm realizing that it's harder to stay sober now that the probation officer is gone and not breathing down my neck.

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck alcohol. Seriously.  I'm going to save myself the trouble, the embarrassment, the legal trouble, the failing classes, the letting my family and friends down, the hangovers, the health problems, the self esteem issues.... Just fuck it.  I'm not going down that road again.  The sober months I've had lately have been absolutely LOVELY compared to all the crap alcohol has done to my life.  So I'm putting the bottle down again and saving myself a lot of heartache.  I don't know about anyone else, but moderation doesn't work for me.  Oh sure, I can stop at one drink.  I can do that for a few nights, actually... But sooner or later there comes the time where I just say ""fuck it"" and get wasted.  The only way for me to stay sober is to not drink alcohol at all.

I had beaten myself down so much emotionally that I had stopped taking care of myself all together. I didn't care about my body at all, which at the same time depressed the hell out of me because I was so unhappy with how I looked. 

The first thing my counselor made me do was set three goals to achieve in 90 days. The first goal was to attended as many AA/NA meetings as I could, and while I didn't do 90 in 90 I was pretty damn close. The second goal was to learn how to be happy with what I can do for myself and not have others set expectations for me, I needed to do things for myself rather than rely on others to motivate me. My third and final goal was to take better care of myself physically. This not only included making myself more physically active, but also focus on my eating habits. So in addition to exercising, I also wanted to eliminate fast food/bar food from my diet. Pop was only going to be acceptable when I went out as a substitution for alcohol. 

Well I'm just over 6 months in and have made lots of progress on my goals, I just didn't realize how much. I take a picture on the 15th of every month to keep track of my progress but I've never looked at any side by side until today.

All you need to know is I was a highly functional alcoholic whose life revolved around when I could get my next drink. I wasn't drinking handles and blacking out, but I was drinking enough to realize it was too much.

I stopped cold turkey (do NOT do this), and I went through mild withdrawals. Even though they were considered mild, they were scary as hell. By the third day after my last drink, the symptoms were enough to make me visit the urgent care clinic. They sent me to the emergency room. I got there, they stabilized me and sent me home with some lorazepam to counter the withdrawal. I can tell you that the emergency room was the last place I expected to go. I didn't realize I was that dependent. It sounds cliche, but it scared me straight.

The next few months were hard. My body was trying to stabilize itself without the alcohol, and that manifested as random panic attacks, being really tired, and general uneasiness. I began taking lots of vitamins and eating healthier to help replenish what alcohol robbed from me.

After a few months, I was able to start going to the gym without fear of inducing a panic attack. Since then I've lost 30+ pounds and have never felt better in my life; not only physically but also mentally. I am no longer waking up hungover and spending the entire day recovering, only to start it all over again. I wake up refreshed, work a productive and pleasant day. I work out. I cook. I read. I think. Before I quit, life was just waiting around until my next drink.

Made it a week with some really satisfying personal goals accomplished, but this past weekend was my biggest so far. 

I went on vacation with a group of friends who drink, to a festival where there was tons of drinking, and stayed sober the entire time. 

I was pretty worried that going on vacation would be my breaking point, that I would just cave and say screw it, but I didn't. I didn't drink at all. And man, does it feel good.

It was really hard the first two days. My brain was hardwired to think, oh shit, I'm on vacation, lets get drunk! But I resisted the urges. I reminded myself that I would actually be able to remember everything that happened, not make any rash decisions, and be kind of the responsible one that helped everyone get around. The only other time I was tested was when I went to a restaurant that had my favorite beer (that I couldn't find ANYWHERE where I live). Even my friends who said they wouldn't drink were drinking, so it was really hard. I removed myself from the restaurant a few times to just stand outside and get my head in the right space, and made it through the night. 

The rest of the time was easy, there were so many drunk people acting a fool that I was REALLY glad that I wasn't one of them. I got up early each day and got way more done in each day than I would have if I had drank. No hangovers, no shitty feeling, no worrying if I pissed anyone off. More sightseeing, more band watching, more memories.

I'm really proud of myself. My husband is really proud of me. My friends didn't pressure me to drink once and supported me when I told them I was having a bit of trouble. When I came back from vacation my friends at home were really impressed that I didn't drink. Some of them didn't think I could do it. But I did.

Sorry if this is a bit of a gloating post, but I just wanted to share - I'm finally learning the self control that I've needed all these years, and its worth it. I had a great freaking sober time these past five days, and I'm no longer counting the days until I feel like I can let myself drink again - I'm just enjoying being alcohol-free, paying way more attention to things in life I would have otherwise just let pass by me because my head wasn't really screwed on right due to alcohol. 

Thanks for the support on this forum - checking back in here while on vacation and reading posts by people of encouragement and self stories really helped to remind me why I am doing this and the personal rewards involved.

 I lost 6 pounds just by quitting. My skin looks amazing, and my weekends no longer have to revolve around partying and/or hangovers. 

 As an added bonus, I went from smoking half a pack a day down to a single cigarette when I arrive home from work. Eventually I'll quit doing that too.

At that moment I felt all hope was lost. This was my job. My money. My livelyhood. I got fired for being late one too many times, so I did this to myself. What did I do as I walked out of the building, throwing my uniform in the parking lot?

I called someone. I told on myself. I called my sponsor and I told him in a message that I had gotten fired and I wanted to drink BADLY. Then I continued to call other people I knew who were trustworthy and sober. I told on myself again and again. Hey I want to drink bad, please call me back. After a few minutes fuming in the car, the calls came pouring in...

""Don't drink!! Losing your job is not as bad as drinking! It only gets worse if you drink!!!""

These things I already knew. I practiced them daily. I helped others with these same issues. But for myself, I couldn't completely understand these concepts. It wasn't fitting at that time and in that mood.

For some strange reason (I don't want to offend anyone but I know it was my higher power) I knew that at that moment, sitting in my car driving home, that I needed to reach out so someone or I would drink again. I was so focused on it. I was thinking things like ""I'll show them, those bastards.. They know I'm sober and I'll drink and I'll make them feel bad for firing me...""

Right now, after some wise and helpful phone calls, I understand that the thinking I had when I was in a rage was completely insane. Why would drinking make things better for me? I've always believed that my best day drinking is still a thousand times worse than my worst day sober. The most important thing in my life that I have is my sobriety, hands down. 

Tonight I got a kick-start from life. I'm beginning to see that now I can find a better job, and I will know that I have survived something as saddening and depressing as losing a job. If I can do that, the minor things that life throws at me become automatic. Think about this the next time life throws you a major curveball and you have the urge to drink.

Occasionally I go through these spells of feeling rather pissy and sorry for myself because I can't drink normally.  This, of course, is my alcoholic brain trying to trick me into boozing again.  

We may think that we are giving something up by making the choice not to drink booze today.  We feel a lack of something.  This is just an illusion. The less we drink, the fuller we become.  It's booze that causes the horrible emptiness we seek to fill from outside.

Because I chose not to drink today, my life is not less, it's more.  I don't have less, I have more.  I haven't done less, I've done more.  Everything is increasing, even when it feels like things are going backwards... or when I feel like I'm just barely managing to hang on by the fingernail of my left pinky.

If alcohol has caused you problems, you are not losing anything by giving it up... except your problems!

I went to an AA meeting!,TaraBeara,36,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/tugbf/i_did_it_i_went_to_an_aa_meeting/,"So a week or so ago I posted about having a hard time finding friends, and after reading the awesome responses I got from that (thank you all) I decided to take action.  I found a young persons meeting that met tonight at 6pm.  I was nervous, actually I was terrified!  My past experience going to an AA meeting was not amazing, and I was going alone.  It ended up being a small gathering (10ish people) and it was good, not amazing but good.  I caught myself thinking it was ok, I would go back again but not 100% sure that it was the right place for me.  At the end of the meeting we were all talking and one of the guys mentioned another young people's meeting that was gonna start in an hour on the other side of town.  So three of us decided to go, and we all rode out together (talk about trust in a group, we didnt know each other at all and all got in a car together).  When we got there it was a huge group of people (50+), much more lively then the previous meeting.  Everyone in there was youngish, it was great!  The meeting was awesome, and while I was there, laughing at some of the jokes cracked and relating to the things people were saying I thought to myself 'this is where I belong'.  At the end of the meeting I decided to find myself a sponsor!  She seems like a great lady, and is driven and excited about being my sponsor.  I also found out there there is another young people's meeting tomorrow night, any guesses where I will be tomorrow?!  
I talked to my mom about the meetings tonight, and she told me that while I was at the first meeting she was praying that I find where I belong, and if its not my fit, that God help direct me to where I do belong.  And thats what happened!

TL;DR  Today I went from being terrified of going to an AA meeting, to going to **2** meetings, getting a sponsor, and getting 2 other AA friends/allies! ",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,year1,True,t3_tugbf,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/tugbf/i_did_it_i_went_to_an_aa_meeting/,

Just emotionally raw, but not in a bad way. I'm feeling something, and it's some kind of mix of elation, and sadness, and remorse, and excitement, and empathy. I just can't put a finger on **any** of it, but I thought I'd write about my experience in case it inspires someone else to go. Also, just to get it out in writing.


This isn't my first time quitting, but it's the first time I've made it 8 days, and it's the first time I've felt truly committed to making this change. This has been the first time I've believed the ""hype"" that the only point from here is down if I keep on drinking. Maybe it'll be fast, maybe it'll be slow, but I'm certainly not going up from here with the way I was acting. So tonight, I took the advice of this subreddit and I made the choice to attend an AA meeting. I thought the best one to go for the first time would be a young persons' AA and I feel I made a good choice. I'm 24, so before today I'd say I'm in the smaller age group of alcoholics, but after tonight I feel a bit differently.

I was nervous going alone to a place I hadn't been before (something that always makes me nervous/socially awkward.. but especially for this type of thing). I walked up to the church  in the middle of the city and didn't know where to enter and began thinking I might not be able to find the room. Then I saw a ton of younger people smoking outside, all different races and genders and ages and I thought.. **wow**, this must be it! I waited around a bit until people started heading inside the building and I sat down and more and more people poured in. at least 50 people, young people (and some older people) in this meeting! I couldn't believe it. There were barely enough seats to house everyone. They began with one girls story, who had been through a lot and had been sober 7 years and was now back in Philadelphia and still fighting the good fight. I wanted to break down and cry hearing her story. I didn't feel that way because of the emotion of the story, but because of the feelings we shared throughout this journey and what I saw of myself in her. Feelings I haven't faced before. Feelings I couldn't put into words before, but there they were falling out of her mouth so eloquently and nonchalant and it really felt like an epiphany. It scared me to feel these emotions, knowing its just a crack in the floodgates and the real hard things are to come, but man it was ... amazing.

They then went on to give out chips. 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 1 year, more than a year. Everyone clapped as people went up. A huge, loud round of applause. I'm normally shy and don't want to be in front of everyone, but when they asked ""24 hours or still counting days?"" I had to get up. I needed to know what it felt like to be proud of myself for that time, but to feel the support of this group, even if I am still just a stranger to them. It felt really, really good. 

People then went around and shared their thoughts about the main speakers story. They talked about their own situations and what resonated with them. One person had just gone on a bender the night before and seemed to be making it in maybe just in time to save his life and his career. Another was about to restart his career tomorrow if he could prove he was sober.

At the end everyone stood in a circle (or what could be made of one, there was no room to even squeeze in :P) and repeated a prayer of some sort. A lot of people remained and talked, but I ran out of there. I knew if I stayed I'd get into conversation, but at that moment I just felt so... raw. As I've mentioned. And not in any negative way. I'm feeling happy. I'm feeling hopeful. I'm feeling scared for whats to come but knowing I need to get through the fire to get to the other side... this magical place that people in the room were talking about. Where they were relieved of their worries, their past transgressions. A place where they are completely happy with themselves and feel whole. It didnt sound somewhere where you wouldnt still find temptation, but it sounded like somewhere where the temptation just couldnt hold a flame to the happiness and wholeness they feel now. Tonight I've begun the journey, and I can't wait to get there. 

Thanks for listening and for your support here! I wouldnt be here a week ago without this subreddit, and who knows where I would have been a few months or a year from now. thank you thank you thank you.

Last week I posted amidst all the guilt and shame that comes after a serious, 5 liter wake and drink lapse. I had, at that point, fully admitted my powerlessness.

I was very lucky to get an early admission into an inpatient program the next day. I have little doubt that without that stroke of luck I would still be raw swigging the cheapest vodka I can find or in hospital dealing with the worst that withdrawals has to offer.

Before I came I was terrified. I would have to admit the full extent that I had fucked up. My family would know and I would be handing my fate over to the system. Now that I am here I could not be more relieved. The support is amazing, there is no shame in what I have done, I can let go of the guilt and I don't need to face this on my own anymore.

I know that I am lucky to live in a country where a program like this is not much more expensive than what I'd be spending on booze anyway. I know that I am lucky to have got here before something really bad happened. I know I am not a bad person, just someone with a disease that needs help.

I feel so fortunate and just want to ask you to seek any help you can get. Doctors, meetings, outpatient programs, books - just avail yourself of everything you can find. Rehab was the most terrifying thing I could think of and so far it is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

Father is an alcoholic and I did not want that to become that so I mainly used drugs.  Followed the Grateful Dead.  Had no direction in life.  Just wanted to party.

Fast Forward.  Had my first kid when I was 24.  Quit drugs except for pot shortly there after.  I did not want to get arrested again.  Didn't want to be a dad in jail.  Marijuana use cut way back.  Cue alcohol.  Alcohol is legal and as long as I didn't drive I couldn't get into trouble. So I started drinking every night.

Fast forward. I had second child when I was 29. Still drinking every night.  Didn't think it was a problem.  Still no idea of having an actual career or anything.  Just work, drink, and act like I am a great dad.

Fast forward. A couple years ago I realized I had a problem and could not stop.  Found subreddit. Got badge. And it wasn't enough to get me to stop.

Fast forward. 5 months ago.  I could not stop drinking.  Every night.  Depression.  Anxiety.  I thought I was a loser.  I thought I was a weak.  I thought I was a mental defect.  Contemplated suicide.

And I decided to go to an AA meeting.

The first meeting I went to I could not get out of the car.  Too much fear and anxiety.  I went home.  Later that night (about 6 o'clock) a lady came up to me and asked me to do a shot of vodka with her. Honestly, this lady came up to me and pulled a bottle out of her purse.  I was shaky and sweaty.  I just ran.  Literally.  Ran to my car and found the nearest AA meeting.  I ran inside.  I was a lump of sweat.  Sat down at a table.  Every time I moved my arms there was a pool of sweat on the table.  The gentleman chairing the meeting were talking about the mental obsession and physical allergy.  A light bulb went off in my head.  A miracle.  These guys knew what I had, they've been there themselves, and they say there is a solution.  I went home and did not drink.

I kept going to meetings.  I kept not drinking.  

Then I started to feel shitty.  I knew that I had to do something that I did not want to, but for me the alternative was drinking and that is misery.  So I did it.  I got a sponsor.  I started working the steps, honestly and thoroughly.  And the mental obsession disappeared.

I still go to meetings everyday.  I chair meetings.  I talk with any newcomer I can. And I still don't drink.  Hell, it never even crosses my mind.  

Sometimes AA pisses me off.  Sometimes AA confuses me (atheist). But I just keep going.  And I keep not drinking.

5 months now.  Life isn't perfect.  But it is beautiful.  Some days I am happy, joyous, and free all day long.  Some days I struggle with trivial issues (like the crazy assholes in this world). 

But everyday has been sober.

And that is a fucking miracle.

That's my story.  That's how I got better. Thanks for listening.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month6,True,t3_1h9au6,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h9au6/5_months/,

The last few months before quitting were filled with that horrible feeling of impending doom. After 8 years of daily drinking my liver was tender, and the thought of drinking myself to death in my early 30s scared the shit out of me. So I gathered my courage and went to an AA meeting. It was a great experience, the group was very welcoming and it was reassuring to be around people suffering from the same problem. I have only been to one meeting but I intend to start going on a semi regular basis, maybe once a week. I know that it will get harder when the newness wears off, but it was that first AA meeting was incredible because it made me really feel like I was confronting the problem that I had been denying for years.

After 30 days without drinking, I feel healthier, I am enjoying life more, and my relationship with my wife is at an all time high. I was worried that we were actually just drinking buddies and that things would get bad when the alcohol was taken out of the equation, but so far it has been the opposite. No more late-night drunken fights. Less financial stress without the huge monthly spending on alcohol. We are enjoying each other's company even more nowadays. We are even starting to think about having children. 

Like many stories I read here, I initially had a problem with boredom. I am happy to say that the fog has lifted and every day I look forward to the massive amounts of new free time that alcohol used to waste. Reading, video games, exercise, I look forward to them all.

And finally, I love this sub and everyone in it. It has been very encouraging to read other people's stories and know that I am not alone.

He is ten years my junior, but is fantastically mature and bright for his age. Like a lot of creative people, we both struggle with addiction.

While we were hanging out in the backyard catching up, I sipped on a Coca-cola (my childhood vice is *so* fucking kind to me) he sipped on a beer and then basically brought up the whole sobriety thing. He was like: ""You know, you don't talk about it much. But I wanted to say 'congratulations', on what, 2 1/2 months?"" I thanked him and said that it had been the best time of my life so far.

He then asked me: ""Will you ever drink again?""

And my answer, for the first time in my life, as soon as I uttered it, I couldn't believe JUST HOW much I meant it: ""Drink alcohol? Fucking never again.""

When I said it, it felt empowering. It didn't feel scary. It didn't feel sad. It felt awesome. 

The conversation continued, and he then asked me kind of pointedly: ""Well, if you're not into drinking, and you don't need it as a distraction, I guess you'll be getting new friends, eh?""

This point I had thought of, because I realize the dangers of old habits and the normal social pressures brought on by people we're close to.

I thought about it and answered thusly: ""I don't think I'm *getting* new friends at all. I just think that my priorities are changing, and whether you or anyone else is part of that change is up to them.""

He was perplexed, so I continued:

""You guys went to the bar last night, and of course, knowing that I'm sober, you invited me anyway to 'have a club soda'. I appreciate the social invite, but the simple fact is: Really, going to a bar does nothing *for* me at all anymore.

When it comes down to it, I'm not going to severe my old friends because I'm changing my lifestyle. However, it's pretty much a guarantee that I'm going to find new activities to do with like-minded people. So in other words, I'll still be your friend, but we won't be spending much time together if all you want to do is get drunk.""

I left it at that. 

The cool thing is (and this of course depends on your friendship and the habits of your friend) that he instantly tried to qualify himself as ""a great friend to go to the gym with"", he then went on to talk about how down he is to hike, create music, write comedy. . to do all of the things I find fun in lieu of drinking.


I think it's awesome, in a way: rather than 'turn my back' on a homie who enjoys his booze, I'm demonstrating that a sober life can be fulfilling, and something almost to brag about.

The fact that he's very keen (almost trying to insure) that we stay friends, that he would adjust his methods to accomodate this, *almost* surprised me. It then dawned on me that it's simply because *being sober is **bad ass** and I'm really way more fun to be around, so **of course** he's going to make an effort.*

tl:dr: Be clear with your drinking friends about what you're doing. You may be surprised at how willing they are to make changes in themselves to accomodate your new sobriety.

Previously I had gone almost 6 months without so much as a drop.  First, I had one excursion back into the drinking world that lasted about a month.  I wasn't drinking every night - maybe 2-3 nights a week - but when I did, it was beyond any semblance of moderation.    I'm embarrassed to admit that I just couldn't control myself.  One drink always turned into too many.  I still can't believe it, but it's true. 

About 3 weeks ago, I quit again. I reset my badge, got excited again and went through about 16 days without a problem.  Then for no reason at all, I found myself in the liquor store again.  It felt like I was a teenager again, sneaking around, breaking the rules...  It was a rush.  It started with a pint.  Then that wasn't enough, and I had a couple of days off, so I said to myself, ""fuck it.  I'll deal with this later.  I can still sneak around and *get away with it.*""  That was what was really driving me.  The alcohol haze was just a bonus.  That didn't last for very long though.  I sank back down into depression.  I got suicidal.  Then I drank more.  When I ran out of whiskey, drunk me thought it would be a great idea to drink lemon extract.

LEMON EXTRACT.

I DRANK GOD DAMN LEMON EXTRACT.

There, I said it.  I'm super ashamed to admit it, but now that I have it does feel a little better - even just to type the words out.  But if that's not a wake up call, I don't know what is.  I just can't drink anymore.  At all.  I've done my experimenting with it and I have found conclusive proof that booze and I don't mix.

It's been quite a while since they made a cameo in my life. It's not exactly Brad Pitt in Fight Club, but I'm pretty happy. I fully attribute this to the gift of sobriety. For some reason, without drinking, there are about a hundred fewer reasons to not go to the gym. 

When I was a drinker, exercising was going to be future me's problem. Sure, someday I know I would have to get back in shape. But obviously I can't today, because I'm hungover and I'm going for brews with the bros. 

Sunday would be the perfect day, so long as I ""take it easy"" on the booze the night before (that occurred with Halley's Comet-like frequency). 

It'll have to be Monday then. After all, all good things start on a Monday. Come Monday though, I'm still pooped from the weekend. Besides, Monday's are the worst. So are the rest of the weekdays. Besides, who starts anything in the middle of the week? It defies logic. 

It's decided then: next Saturday will be the day I start exercising; all I have to do is not go for drinks after work on Friday. Wait. The beers will be *cold*, you say? Well fuck me in the goat ass, how often does that happen? Pour one up for me and keep the tab open. 

What I've learned is that exercising makes ***every single aspect of life better.*** I shit you not. Even if you take out the aesthetic and strength reasons, it just makes you feel terrific.  

For those of you not exercising, why not?

I knew my license plate tabs were expired but as a result of the drinking bender I was on I had let a lot of bills pile up on me causing me to use my entire last pay check to keep myself in my apartment.

The thing is, that former addict in me was so scared when he pulled me over. I knew I really hadn't done anything wrong other than the plate tabs. I was also a little upset because I clearly wasn't drunk and he kept insinuating that I might have had one or two until I finally told him if he didn't believe me he could bust out the breathalyzer.

The longest I've been since Christmas.",ColGoDuckYourself,31,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ztyi3/so_3_days_sober_the_longest_ive_been_since/,"I'm 25 years old, I've been drinking on and off since ~17. In high school it was limited to the weekends but it was still a lot every Friday, Saturday, and most Sundays. I took a break for about a year and a half after graduating high school. I moved away from the people I drank with and it was a hassle to get someone to buy me booze. Then around 19/20 things got kicked into high gear. I started drinking everyday although drinking a whole bottle of liquor was an exceptionally heavy night. Not unheard of, but not usual. Over the next several years I started losing real friends and replacing them with ""drinking buddies"".

Then around 22 things got kicked into higher gear. A bottle a night was a heavier night but not unusual. A year later and a bottle a night had become the norm. Since then I've fluctuated between 4/5 of a bottle and 1 1/5. For example, I went through a period of several months earlier this year where I was trying to lose weight and went through a handle every 3 days. By my calculations that's around 4/5 of a bottle, that period was the lightest in a couple years. But of course it didn't last and I went back to a handle every 2.5 days.

Then it got to a handle every 2 days. With the exception of the recently mentioned several months that's been around the norm for the past ~2 years. There were a few separate days where I didn't drink anything because I was dating someone who didn't like me to drink around them. And, hey, I'll trade a night of boozing for a night of sex after such a long dry spell. That being said, until this past month I've been a ""high-functioning"" alcoholic. Well, except for one time where I got kicked out of college - but that was due to depression and the booze was just an accessory.

Since then I've had a GPA of something like 3.4 and I haven't drank and drove since I was ~20 and much stupider than I am now. But the past month has shown me just how much alcohol has taken away from me. I've been going on benders and missing classes, enough so that in several I've already got enough absences for a grade point (e.g., A -&gt; B, B -&gt; C, etc) reduction. And in the ones that don't have mandatory attendance? When you only attend 1 out of the first 5 classes then you're sure to effectively have a serious enough grade reduction.

But it isn't just that. I've slowly come to realize that I effectively have no identiy, no hobbies, there's nothing that defines who I am. I go to school and get hammered in my apartment every night. I walk among people, and hell I don't even have bad social skills per se. When I talk to people for awhile - when it isn't months between conversations - I remind myself of someone who has taken the advice of Brad Pitt from Ocean's 11:

&gt; Don't use seven words when four will do. Don't shift your weight, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, be funny but don't make him laugh. He's got to like you then forget you the moment you've left his side.

I forget where I was going with that, but the point is that my identity has become centered around getting wasted every night. I've neglected nearly all the friendships I've had (and God knows why the one that's stuck around has). I've neglected my health, I've neglected reading, I've neglected writing, I've neglected maintaining a decent apartment, I've neglected just about everything.

Other than the class thing there were two other major recent events that have made me decide to stop drinking:

1. Eyes/Vision
2. A scrape on my arms.

My vision has gotten horrible over the past year or so. I haven't been able to drive at night for most of 2012. I'm reasonably certain the reason is that along with obesity, and all the other wonderful gifts alcoholism has brought, I've also developed diabetes. When I went to the doctor this Spring and took a blood test his response was basically ""we don't know the cause, but your liver whatnots are high, did you go out and drink last night?"" Well, of course I had but we all know that wasn't the only reason they were high. So he asked me to come back after not drinking for a week. The longest I've gone without drinking has been 2 days except for today (the third day sober). Well, I just sucked it up and accepted I wouldn't drive after dark.

I was willing to give up functioning at night if that meant I got to keep drinking. Then over the past month or so my vision has deteriorated even more. Specifically, one eye has gotten particularly cloudy and is constantly bloodshot. It has also began discharging whatever that goop eyes discharge at night, and my eyes have gotten that night crap on them whenever I sleep. This is a serious fucking thing! This isn't something I'm willing to sacrifice for alcohol (anymore).

The other day, during one of my recent benders, I was sitting outside my apartment smoking cigarette butts I found on the ground. That alone is demeaning enough but I have a brief memory where I was trying to stand up and I couldn't. So I fucking crawled like a goddamn infant to a support and used that to stand up. In the process I scraped my arms up on the concrete. (280 pounds pushing your arms down and twisting them against concrete will do that to you.) It's not a serious injury by any means; it's slightly less bad than falling off a bike as child. But I got it while crawling like a goddamn infant! Adults don't do that, responsible people don't do that, normal people don't do that. It's an outward manifestation of the harm I've been doing to myself.

Anyway, I haven't drank any alcohol since Monday night. Incidentally, I'm pretty certain I texted my dad something that night (he doesn't/didn't know I drink) because every day since he's texted me something about loving me or hoping I'm having a good day which seems awfully fucking coincidental. Although that's embarassing it's probably for the best.

I've felt like complete shit all Tuesday and Wednesday, and although I feel better today I still feel pretty shitty. I'm able to get out of bed for something other than a shower. By the way, is it common when first stopping to take 3 or 4 showers a day? I haven't eaten anything since Monday, nor have I smoked a cigarette. These aren't intentional things I just haven't had the motivation to eat or go buy cigarettes. I was going to do that today until I nearly vomited water up (again, just like yesterday). I suppose I still might because the day is young as they say.

At any rate, I'm doing better today than yesterday or the day before. I e-mailed a professor about missing an exam and got an extension. I've been doing some back homework, I won't get credit for it but it's still the responsible thing to do. I haven't vomited yet. While I'm still exhausted - fuck you to hell for not allowing me to sleep decently - I'm not as lethargic or apathetic as I have been. I'll probably take a nap but it won't be all day. And... now I feel like I'm rambling.

I can usually manage about a month without help from the good folks at AA or anything like that. My friends and I were all heavy drinkers, bourbon and beer, but we were never fans of the bar scene because the town we live in doesn't have much of a night life and we would rather kick back with a bottle of Jim Beam with our guitars and what not anyways. 

Well I didn't come outright and tell them when I quit this time, instead I just waited for them to figure it out after I skipped drinks a few weekends in a row. 

Now, this is where I need to point out that my friends and I do not behave like normal people, aside from the blatant alcohol abuse that many of us are guilty of; we are also assholes to one another. We like to insult each other, shoot each other with bb guns, wrestle, occasionally we fight. I know that it is immature, but keep in mind we all hold professional jobs and relationships just like other adults, but it is when we get together that we resort to this state, because in all honesty, it is a lot of fun for us. 

Well, these friends of mine caught on that I haven't been drinking and promptly proceeded to arraign me for it. Constantly offering me a drink, calling me a pussy and things of that nature. The thing is, it had the opposite effect. I hate peer pressure more than anything so I took to blatantly not drinking as a priority. I even fucked with them one night by drinking sweat tea on the rocks and telling them it was bourbon. They got their hopes up and I found that hilarious. 

But eventually they started to wear on me, kind of eroded me down to the point that the joke just wasn't funny anymore. So I asked one of my closer friends to kindly knock it the fuck off, that I had been going to AA, that I was more serious this time than I ever had been. 

His reaction baffled me, ""no shit, we know.""

So I asked him why they had been such dicks about it, and he told me flatly that they knew the best way to get me to do something was to tell me not to. He would probably never admit this, but he said that he was happy for me, that my life wasn't as big a pile of shit as it had been previously. Then he called me a pussy and asked me if I wanted a drink. I told him no, and today I am still sober, 65 days, and I have a good set of fantastic asshole friends.

It's kind of personal to me, but I thought it might help someone else. Sorry if this is long.

Reasons not to drink.
•I have set a horrible example for the boys, if I don’t stop now, they may end up with the same issues I have, or worse.
•I have wasted far too many years doing nothing but waiting for that next drink, I have abandoned all my dreams, and hopes, and I want them back.
•I am killing myself, and I don’t want my legacy to be the miserable drunk, that never accomplished anything.
•I want to see all the kids grow up, and I want to be there for all the important times in their lives, that won’t happen unless I take control now.
•I want to be a person my family can be proud of, not pitied, or worried about.
•I want to do something meaningful and lasting with my life, and I’m not getting any younger, and alcohol has just brought me failure, and misery.
•I’m tired of feeling like crap, wondering how I got that cut on my head, or if I said or did something I shouldn’t have. I want to take back control over my life, and my actions.
•I must be “The Hero of My Own Story”. Thanks to TheCourageWolf for this, he sent me this link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mOZ9ATMg-U&amp;feature=related

Things to remember
•The smile on my youngest boys face the first time I played with him after I stopped drinking.
•The boys saying they thought it was “cool” that I could quit.
•You’ve had the first day in long time you haven’t puked at least once.
•I’m a lot less anxious and paranoid than I thought I would be. It’s really nice.
•I’m not alone in this struggle; many have faced it before and made it through.

In so many ways I feel like I am just learning what it means to be me.  Sometimes I feel like discarding the word ""sober"" altogether, just because it seems to define my life in relationship to alcohol (or the lack thereof, I mean).  The first six months were definitely all about living without alcohol.  Now, lately, it just seems to be about living.

But I still make the decision every day all over again--""Today I am not going to drink.""

If any of you had known me when I was drinking you would probably be amazed that I've gone 500 days.  You might have been amazed that I made it a week.  All I really want to say is this: my life was a complete fucking mess when I was drinking, and I have made 500 baby steps toward living it authentically and on my own terms, not as dictated to me by a bottle.

I want to say one more thing, and I really really mean this:  if I can do it, anyone can do it.

I been trying to post this for about 3 hours now and I don't know why I have not been able to.  

I quit drinking on 09/08/2012 and have made it through all the major holidays, my birthday, losing my house, having to surrender my dog, moving to an undesirable location and other crap with no true temptation or desire to drink. I mention this as with the exception of Halloween and Christmas its been relatively easy...today...as Adam Sandler said in his first comedy CD, ""Fuck me in the goat ass.""

I truly have no desire to drink and I do not fear a lapse nor relapse whatsoever. I don't have an issue with being around alcohol 98% of the time at the bar, social gatherings such as BBQ's et al, the club days...yeah tried that twice and I'm not able to handle; time will tell if that's lasting. This is the first 4th of July in 20 years, since 17, I am sober or not drinking today and what fucking sucks is I am missing everything.

My brother lives on the largest lake in the TC and is having a pool/lake party today. I passed. This time last year I was there having a blast with family, friends and a woman I almost got engaged to and the love of my life. The sting of knowing that was one of, if not **the,** last truly happy event/time we had is overwhelming. Seeing hundreds of hundreds of people out on the lake, having fun, the vast vast majority of whom are drinking, happy (yes, I know that's an assumption and subjective) so I feel/felt, well I know, it's/was in my best interest to not have gone and those REM shiny happy people piss me the fuck off and make me angry as I cannot be one of them.

There was no pressure, no ""Oh come on...just come out for an hour"", I simply cannot handle it nor want to break down as I am doing right now in my ""home"" tearing up as I type this out.

I try hard to not regret my past actions/decisions are they are what made me who I am, for better or worse as yesterday is gone and I cannot change it. I made my bed, I'm sleeping in it, took ownership over the situation and am doing my very best to not repeat not repeat (yes, twice purposely) my mistakes in my previous life and make the wrongs right or liveable. But today, today is fucking overwhelming and just disgustingly **FUCKING MISERABLE!!!!** It just flat out fucking sucks. I'm sorry for the cursing but I have a potty mouth as is but its just what's going through my head.

So here I am, alone, trapped in my head, the regret reel on repeat, missing the LOML, regretting the pain and suffering I caused to those around me and I am very very disappointed in myself (I do know that I should not feel this way but I'm just in this state of mind) that I am letting an arbitrary date impact me like this as I have not really experienced this thus far. 

I know this was a long post and thank anyone in advance for reading. I don't expect replies. I don't want a pity party. I just finally could get it out in a place I feel pretty safe that I won't get trolled nor judged.

Happy Independence Day, please be safe. I cannot toast/cheers to you (bad luck, little Italian in me =0), instead I tip my cigar to you all and thank the men and women of the armed forces past and present for their service to keep America free.

Be good to each other.

Edit: Thanks for the support, everyone!  My brief and boring story:

The first feeling I recall having is fear.  I was painfully shy, fearful, and anxious as a kid.  I hid behind books and in a world of fantasy (which I still haven't left, haha). I could not interact with people at all.  People are scary.  I could maybe say ""hello, how are you"" but did not feel I had anything to offer after that.  I became afraid of committing to any sort of conversation.  This discomfort and fear were always present and did not subside until I had my first drink.  It was definitely that sigh of relief for me.  Immediately, I drank alcoholically.  I don't mean that I drank everyday or in the morning....but my first drink was by myself in the closet in my room.  I drank cold medicine for the effect.  I stole pain medication from my grandparents.  Once I realized I could feel differently I did everything I could do make it happen.  Luckily for me, the fear kept me from going to crazy.  I couldn't get in trouble....(I did a few times...nothing too big)...my parents will hate me!  

I had a best friend in high school. Finally.  She completed me.  She was loud and uninhibited and I could cling to that.  I would go to parties and drinking was the only way I could feel comfortable.  I remember clearly a conversation with her that mostly consisted of her desperately trying to understand why I couldn't talk to anyone.  In high school I drank and drugged when I could...which wasn't as often as I liked...plus the fear kept me under control.  There were times when I drank before/during school...bought cocaine from a dealer friend and did that before school for a while in total secrecy.  Went to college and was a black out drinker.  Drank often and never controlled myself.  Woke up in random dude's beds.  Gave up drugs because once I turned 21 it was so much easier just to drink.  Got one obligatory DUI.  I did not have many consequences aside from general self loathing and hatred.  

I am a musician and decided to move to a city to study for grad school.  Part of my identity was that ""I am a tortured artist....I am just going to be depressed and sick from drinking""....as long as I could perform I felt like life was ok...screw the fact that I was no longer enjoying music in any form.  Two years of grad school....four years of post grad....all the while hating myself and performing because I was supposed to...not even really knowing that I didn't enjoy it anymore.  I didn't do as much black out drinking here because I was trying to be respectable.  But I could not spend time at home by myself without drinking.  I became a daily drunk...if I could just get through my practicing for the day then I could get my reward.  For me...the hangover was just as important.  Being sick meant at least I felt differently that usual.  My world became smaller and smaller...get up too late and hungover...get through the minimum amount of work/practice....maaaaybe ask one of my few friends to get a drink...walk around until I was too tired to move and maaaybe I wouldn't need to drink as much....drink.  That was it. 

The obsession was overwhelming, as was the compulsion.  I began having clear thoughts of ""I do not want to drink this, but I don't know how to stop.""  People in my life told me they were worried.  I pushed my family way and only received angry messages from them .  I didn't care.  One friend told me they missed seeing me smile.  That meant a lot.  I hated everyone and everything.  

I had a friend in AA.  He was a crazy, recovering drug addict that had been sober 12 years.  I know AA isn't for everyone but I recommend giving it a try, at least.  I was so scared that it took me almost a year to actually walk INTO a meeting.  There, I found hope and people that cared....people that felt just like I did.  I didn't understand most of AA or what the steps were or what these silly slogans meant.....but I just kept going and eventually things started to sink in.  I got a sponsor who is now one of my greatest friends.  The first thing she told me that changed my life was ""It's ok.  It's normal to feel the way you do."" WHAT.  And....""Your feelings will change."" I was so overcome by the fact that I was abnormal and nothing would ever change that that truly blew my mind.  I think all I needed for the first few months was for her to repeat that over and over.  

The past year has been hard...I've had to feel my emotions...I've had to learn to talk to people....I've had to learn to be uncomfortable and fearful and move through those emotions.  I have had to learn (I am still learning) to be grateful.  I do not want to be grateful or humble....but I owe AA and the people of AA my life and the contentment I feel (on most days).  Happy 24! 

Thank you for reading....it really helped me a lot to type this up because I am sharing at my home group meeting this afternoon and I am SUPER nervous and fearful.  But I know they love me. :-)

1368045320.0,29,self.stopdrinking,1dydk1,This is the first time I'd admitting what I am. Sorry for the length.,Winogirl,30,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1dydk1/this_is_the_first_time_id_admitting_what_i_am/,"This is certainly not something I ever expected to be doing, but who cares? It’s what I have to do. There’s no choice here anymore. 

After my first year of college, I started working at a restaurant, where I stayed for 6 years. During that time, my drinking went from seldom and moderate to party style bingey. All of my coworkers drank heavily, and often, and so did I. It was a lot of fun at the time. I was hanging out with new friends, older people, and different faces. It was a new chapter in my life, and a lot of the people I met during this phase of my life are still my best friends today. **I don’t regret those years at all**, I only regret that I couldn’t handle that lifestyle the same way my friends could. Back then we drank a lot, but drinking wasn’t all we did. The conversations, experiences and relationships were important, and the booze was secondary. Picture it as background noise to the rest of the story. 

I can still remember the first time I bought a bottle of wine for myself. It felt so special and grown up to be drinking a bottle of wine with sushi, curled up in bed watching a movie. That was probably 6 years ago. Back then, drinking *was* special. 

2 years ago I moved into a house with some friends. We lived by the beach and spent the first year drinking a lot, having parties, throwing BBQs and just making the most of our situation. I started dating my current boyfriend during that year, and we would stay up all night talking over a bottle of Jack. He would drive drunk to my house, where I was also drunk, and we would stare at each other, have sex, laugh. Friends would comment on how awesome it must feel to be in a relationship where you can just sit around drinking and laughing; as if every day is a good day. We were irresponsible – absolutely-, but we were also all capable of stopping. We didn’t think about drinking, we didn’t monitor ourselves, we didn’t feel like there was some secret hidden problem. It didn’t interfere with anything. We weren’t “functioning alcoholics”. We just drank a lot on the weekends.

But in the last year, everyone else stopped. They started to focus on their relationships, their jobs, their health, and their futures. They just grew out of that phase. Everyone that is, except for me. I didn’t slow down, and in the last 6 months my drinking has escalated so completely that it terrified me. I would notice the amount of alcohol in other people’s cups, and would count my drinks against theirs, “I’m on my third glass, and he’s just finishing his first. Slow down so they don’t notice…” “They only drank a half bottle of wine last night? How the hell did they stop at a half bottle? That’s like 2 glasses each. I could never do that…”

I drink by myself and get wasted at least 3/5 days during the workweek. I then drink to excess on Friday and/or Saturday. I wake up more days than not with regret, shame, and fear over what I may have said or done the night before. I never want anyone to know, so I hide in my room. Worst of all though, is the feeling of total lack of control. This isn’t a choice for me anymore.
 
I’ve been rationalizing this away for a while. The term “alcoholic” was like a death sentence to me, and I started to make rules for myself to avoid that reality: “You can only drink when your boyfriend is with you” or “You can only drink on Friday and Saturday”. But these bargains made me feel even worse, because I was completely setting myself up for failure. I was musing control over an area of my life that I had no actual control over.

 Last month, I woke up next to my boyfriend, completely hung over (secretly – I drank before he came home) and just started sobbing. I told him I thought I had a problem, but because I kept it secret, he didn’t understand the severity and told me that if I wanted to stop, to just stop. I didn’t want to tell him how severe it was either, because I was so ashamed. So I instead took his suggestion and nothing changed.

Yesterday I woke up feeling all of the usual horrors associated with the morning after. It was Tuesday, I had a big meeting, my face was swollen, my skin was greasy, my mouth was disgusting, and I just had enough. I finally decided I was an alcoholic. 

And suddenly! I feel so free. Just admitting that I couldn’t control my drinking took a huge weight from me. As in, I can finally stop trying to win a losing battle. I can’t handle my drinking, so why try? I know abstaining is my only choice if I ever want to feel happiness again. Internally, I have been craving  peace, tranquility and stillness, and I finally realize that in order to make room for those things, I need to remove this demon.

I ordered Allen Carr’s book and hope it arrives before my brain starts convincing me I’m really “okay”. Already today, Day 2, I heard myself saying I can go bowling with my friends and have a few beers tonight. It’s hard to wrap my mind around this new lifestyle, even though I’ve known what I am for a while.

The truth is, everyone in my life, all the old drinking buddies, my roommates, my boyfriend – they all stopped drinking for the most part, and I think I will eventually lose everything if I don’t stop. My boyfriend will eventually have to leave me if I continue. I think I will eventually lose my job. I know it will tear away at my relationship with my sister, whom I’m about to move in with. And, my decision to continue drinking will steal from me any chance at achieving the life I deserve for myself.

I know this won’t be easy and I am a little nervous, but I’m 26 years old and have never once practiced any form of self-control or discipline. It’s time.

I hit 30 days of sobriety this week. I have been trying to get to this point for two years. I know how hard it is to really quit, like a lot of you. I am no seasoned old timer, but here is why it is working for me now, where in the past it failed.

I recently moved back to my hometown and started going to AA meetings. As luck would have it, I found two very old friends of mine inside those doors, buddies of mine from college.  They found me a sponsor, recommended meetings, took me to lunch, listened to my story and just fucking HELPED me during this phase. 

So when I am alone and want to drink I now have one more tool- I can call somebody, and I feel accountable to these guys and the group.

I've been going to meetings daily and establishing that routine. As they say 'half measures availed us nothing' - I know that all too well. 

I really have taken drastic steps from which I really can't go back from. I told my parents and my wife and friends, and for the first time I embraced the help that is so freely given by others rather than staying apart and trying to do it on my own. I realize that by trying to go it alone, I was really giving myself an escape clause on the contract I made with myself. Fuck escape clauses.

I can only imagine that there are even more people lurking that have similar questions. What I have to say is simple but I think it might be of use. So, to anybody contemplating whether they have a drinking  problem or not, I will ask you this simple question: Why are you reading this right now? I mean, why are you in this subreddit, called /r/stopdrinking? The answer is quite obvious, don't you think?

When most of us think of alcoholics we get the ""Leaving Las Vegas"" type of guy in our minds. And then we can feel better about ourselves because we are far from that type of person. Of course there are worse cases, there will always be. But that doesn't mean we should get there before we do something about it. What I'm trying to say is that we wouldn't be involved in this subreddit if there wasn't something wrong in our relationship with alcohol. I'm 6'2'' and I weight around 170 pounds. You know how many times I've visited /r/loseit? You've guessed it, zero. 

You don't need to score over 30 on the sidebar's test before you do something. I've been reading some posts here from people who had drinking ruin their lives. This was my inspiration for quitting. I wasn't that bad, I've never lost a day of work because I had that bad of a hungover and I could go days without having a drink. But I know that there is something wrong in the way I've been using alcohol. We all know it and there isn't any test that can explain it better than that little voice inside our head. So if you actually were wondering if you have a problem with drinking before you read these lines, look at the bright side. Chances are you're not that deep into alcoholism, the harm that's been done to your body is minimal and it will be much easier for you to treat your problem right now.

About 20 hours later, at about 8 am on December 10th, I took a slug of tequila to ward off shakes and panic and stabilize myself a bit. That ended up being my last drink.

Ten days later, dry but scared shitless, I walked into a local meeting of AA. I'm not sure what compelled me to go, but it was in my mind early on that as soon as I was able, that's what I would do. It's all a blur, but perhaps a doctor recommended it. Somewhere I my haze, I figured that was the correct next thing to do.



AA didn't make any sense for probably the first two months. In that time, the memory of a very bad detox kept me far away from any desire to drink. Eventually, program started to seep in, at first just as a bunch of tips you could use to keep yourself from getting pissed off, then eventually as a way of maybe seeing some of my problems from the other person's point of view. This was months of work for me, just getting to the point of knowing the difference between facts and feelings, or figuring out that every one of my emotions didn't require a reaction.



As I started to get deeper into this recovery, I discovered SD, just as I had decided to embark on the steps and just as I had begun devoting time to spiritual matters. SD was like hitting five meetings a night, and I was privileged to join in just as this space began to expand to become what it is today. Since I first stumbled upon it, this place has become a second home to me, and I'm eternally grateful to every one whose post or comment I learned about myself from. It's been only in these relationships that I've been able to find myself, and only by listening to you all that I've come to hear my own voice.



Little things matter. The person that I am today, for better or worse, is all thanks to the people, the places, and the events I have placed myself in in search of my new life. I've tried to pay attention, abandoning expectations but expecting surprises, and consistently, the universe has shined on me. Life today offers me so much promise and so much love that I can't believe that I'd been missing this all these years.

Completely distraught. I had locked my keys in the car, everyone was gone, my phone was dead, and I was completely shit faced. Bright idea flashes, hey, I'll just break out my car window. As I staggered around the side of the building to find a brick, I stumbled, and caught myself on the pavement with my chin. Fuck, don't stop now! You're bleeding everywhere! Get the fuck out!

Proceed to smash my drivers side window, get in, find keys, drive 22 miles to my house. In the process of this, however, I hit a low spot, and smacked the whole bottom side of my car on the pavement. Decide I need to stop somewhere and check it out. For whatever fucked up reason, I was right by my sisters, and stopped in there. She was still up, and instantly wakes up her husband, who is a sheriff. Now, I've got cops all over the place thinking I stopped someone from breaking into my car. Great. Just fucking great. Also cracked the transmission pan (hopefully thats all, still haven't been back over there to fully assess the damage, just snuck by yesterday to clean up the transmission fluid that was everywhere and push it out of the driveway.)

Lets take a small trip back in time. When I turned 16, my mom threw a huge fucking party, all my friends came over, and she bought copious amounts of alcohol for us. Thus, began the ordeal. I never really drank much until I moved a couple states away, and wound up in a little tourist trap with 190 drinking establishments in a town of 1500.

Still didn't drink all that much until I started bartending. Whooooweee. I had so much fun at that job. I married another bartender. She was wonderful. She had two kids, who took to me like flies on shit. I quit drinking the day she told me she was pregnant.  Had two seizures in the first three days, went fine for 8 months until she lost it to FAS. Hey wait, you were drinking this whole time!?!? How the fuck did I not notice this!?!?!? We got through it, tried again, but I had started drinking heavily.. Another failure at 8 months, but not do to alcohol.

 The entire duration of our relationship, 5 years, I had become a bartender, line cook, worked my way up, became a chef (by title, it haunts me to this day), and further onto kitchen manager, at 25, drinking all but 8 months, daily. Her kids called me Dad. They still do, on the off chance that she lets them call me. Two weeks after I become manager, she picks the kids up from school, and leaves the ring at home, with a post it note that says 'Goodbye.'

That.. that's it? A week later I got the divorce papers. At work. Broke down in my office. Same day, when I call my mother to let her know, I get the wonderful news that she's going into the hospital for chemo, for multiple myeloma. Completely lost it at work, I was a babbling wreck when my sous chef came in for dinner service, curled up in the corner of the office with a bottle of Crown. She said nothing to my superiors, just used my login info on the computer to clock me out, and alter it so that I 'didn't come in for family reasons.'

I went to a bar, and got drunker than I'd ever been in my life. Being a small town, I knew the owners of every bar. I went to all of them. Bought rounds of shots for tourists I didn't know. Spent over 500 in cash that night. Wound up sleeping on the floor of one. Woke up, bloody mary at 9am with the owner, called in, and drank all day. Drove 12 miles back to my house. Got a call from my new ex, and we had mediation that day, which is one I'll never forget. One of my good guy friends, someone that called me bro for 8 years, drove her there, and I soon found out that he'd been sleeping with her on and off for over a year. Great.

I let her have everything except my truck. I turned around, hopped into it, and drove 900 miles back to west texas, to try and take care of my mother. Drank the entire way here. Got shit faced nightly with my step dad while I ran through my savings binge drinking, paying there rent, and sleeping on there couch.

 I've been here 6 months now, and I don't even recognize the man in the mirror. Who the fuck is that guy with a mohawk, black shadows under his eyes, and a busted up chin? What happened to the suits? I own blue jeans? Where's my truck? Did I really trade it in on some piece of shit beater, just so I had more money to drink, before I finally found the only good thing in my life, my current job? Have I really been poisoning that well too, like my fuzzy memory is telling me I have?

When I came here, I told my self I would quit drinking. My ex told me that was allot of the reason for her leaving, and finding solace in another mans arms. After Sunday night, I decided I would sit down last night, and go out the way I came in - With a 40 oz of Old english, like that night when I was 16. Before I even cracked it, I sat there thinking back on the night I drank the first time. All the good, supportive friends I had going the high school. My phone buzzes at me. Txt? From who?

""Did you ever live in Carrollton before?"" From a number I've never seen in my life.

My response : ""Yes, who is this?""

My phone starts ringing.

""Hello?""
""Name the girl, who, when we were 16, you stole a dozen roses off that assholes car, gave to her, and we spent the whole day at your house skipping school.""

Mother. Of. God. ""Amber."" Cue that last, delicious sounding crack.

It was my best friend from high school. The guy that gave me more courage and had my back 1000 ways from sunday, and same from me to him. We had gone completely opposite from each others expectations. He expected that I would have graduated with bare minimum of a Masters in anything IT related, have kids, a wife, all of it. I would have expected him to be a total junkie. Talk about opposite. Turns out I'm basically a junkie that might as well be freeloading on my mothers couch at this point, with no prospects in bettering myself. He's a 5 year, 2 time combat vet, Army man, has two kids with his highschool sweetheart (another amazing friend), just bought his first house. We talked for hours. I'm supposed to go down to his place for thanksgiving.

I drank that beer, and passed smooth out in a recliner. Woke up at 3 am, puking, shivering, shaking uncontrollably. Every glass of water I drink, I sweat out almost instantly. I don't ever want to drink again, but I'm sure after work tonight, I'll be staring longingly at the taps behind the bar as I clock out, and I just hope I don't slip up.

I have been debating on where to post this to, /r/offmychest or here for about an hour now. Any comments, of any kind, are genuinely wanted and appreciated.

TL;DR I walked the drunken dinosaur. Lost everything I had built up in 9 years in roughly 9 months flat. Just trying to figure out how to fix this mess I've created. Other than sobriety, I have no fucking clue how to do this. My best friend from high school just got a hold of me, and it's probably the best thing that has happened to me in the past 5 years, and that gives me more courage than I ever thought I had to do this.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month9,True,t3_12qme6,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12qme6/day_1_my_long_battle_with_a_bottle_a_woman_and/,

The weekend is here and I wanted to stop in real quick. Weekends for me area always the hardest. Mostly because there's so much spare time. I don't have to be up early for any particular reason, lots of time in between plans, etc. For some of you, this is your first sober weekend. I want to remind you before it kicks off fully that you do not have to drink! (This obviously goes for everyone here!) 

Those cravings you might feel are only temporary. That's your addiction speaking, not you. You've tested these waters before, haven't you? It never ended well for me when I would try to moderate. If I dipped a toe in, I'd find myself fully submerged before I knew what was happening. 

This weekend you don't have to wake up with those same feelings of remorse and shame that you've felt in past days. Those days are behind you. Don't forget them.

If you feel the bite coming on, try to remember how you felt the day after. Try to remember the crushing hangovers and the guilt you had. Try to remember what it felt like not knowing what you had said or done the night before and who you might have to apologize to later that day.

The person you are today isn't the same person you were when you were an active alcoholic. The person you are today is stronger. The person you are today has the choice to not drink. There is nothing in this world that is so cataclysmic that it is worth taking a drink over.

For any AAer's out there, try to make a morning meeting if you feel like you're going to have any issues with abstaining this weekend. Anyone who doesn't attend AA, plan a morning run or a nice breakfast out with a friend. There's also SD's very own IRC! There are some incredibly awesome people in there who want to help anyone who asks for it. I'm personally going to be meeting up with some people from AA and having a delicious greasy spoon diner breakfast and then going to a meeting. I'll also be spending a fair amount of time in the aforementioned IRC, so if any of you want to talk, just hop on there or feel free to PM me at any time.

I wrote this blog entry, if anyone is interested in some thoughts: [one day at a time](http://www.s4m4nth4x.com/2012/07/one-day-at-time.html) It's about my struggle with AA and finding a program that worked for ME. 

As a disclaimer, I've said before and I'll say again, AA should be the first line of defense because it works for so many people... I don't think you should knock it until you try it. I tried it, and it just wasn't for me.

I AM an Atheist... But it wasn't the higher power that turned me off. I found the AA focus on the past to be difficult, and the program Women for Sobriety focuses on the future, which worked for ME. [Women for Sobriety](http://womenforsobriety.org/) These ladies saved my life.

Just checking in. I've been keeping myself super busy lately, since cravings have come back with a vengeance. I took the advice I was given last time I moaned about cravings and looked them dead in the eye, squared my shoulders and said ""WHAT?""

It's better that way, thank you for the suggestion. This way I don't feel so helpless against it, because I've turned around to look at it and told it in no uncertain terms that I'm not afraid of it anymore. It can keep whinging at me and tempting me and coaxing me to drink, it's allowed to. Likewise, I'm allowed to laugh in its face. Not today. Not this day. Try again tomorrow, Imp, I'll be ready for you.

I feel great. When I woke up yesterday morning I was aware of this almost tangible ball of joy in my chest, swelling up and singing somewhere in me. I'd say it's like being drunk off life, but being drunk has never been like this. When I was drunk everything was slightly removed and fuzzy around the edges - this is clarity and presence and yes, sometimes I feel low and *that* is sharper than when I was drinking, but I embrace actually *feeling* things properly, even sadness. Besides, the joy is just so.. *joyful* that it's a trade-off I willingly make.

After the first drink, I knew it was over. I finished the bottle. I drank everyday up until last night. A full week of hellish pain, vomiting, depression and all the other joys us alcoholics put ourselves through when we aren't managing our condition. 

It is amazing how terrible alcohol makes me. I hate alcohol. I started drinking during what normally should have been a week of excitement. I had started a new position, better pay and its something I wanted for years. Maybe it was sabotage. A plan for punishment for doing so well the past 5 months. I grew complacent. I put in jeopardy all my success. My 80 pound weight loss, my happiness, my career, my relationships. It is very fitting alcohol is a poison and alcoholics believe in self destruction. 

The silver lining is that there is absolutely zero question I am an alcoholic. I knew after that first sip (or gulp). The most painful part I do believe is I feel I let many of you down. I felt that I was sharing my experiences to help others but I couldn't put my money where my mouth was.

It doesn't really matter the substance, for me sobriety encompasses everything. 

About a year ago I checked myself into a pshychiatric ward because I thought I would never be the same, I had given up all hope and was a complete wreck and couldn't function and thought I would have to be institutionalized permanently. I had been in AA before that for a bit and was a hardcore atheist and tried my best to work the program around that but it still wasn't enough and didn't have a sponsor who took me through the big book of AA so I didn't understand what I was suffering from.

In the hospital I met a man who brought a meeting in who would later become my current sponsor. I didn't know what to do but was completely hopeless and desperate and prayed to a god I didn't believe in. After a couple months later of hospitals, rehabs, and halfway houses I met up with the guy I met in the hospital and asked him to sponsor me. We went through the 12 steps directly out of the big book. It was straight forward and simple and only took about 2 months and my life completely transformed. I had a spiritual awakening and my whole attitude and outlook on life changed. I experience total peace and comfort today which I had never experienced even before I started drinking. Now I try to carry on this message and attempt to sponsor as many people as I can. 

I've recovered and am completely free of the obsession to drink and use today and it's amazing to be able to go anywhere and do anything. I'm still pretty new at this but I jumped in and did the work, it doesn't take long to get better with good sponsorship and some desperation. 

I no longer consider myself an atheist and have absolute faith in a power greater than me, I have no idea what that is an it doesn't really matter but it's not what I used to think the word god meant which used to make me cringe.

Alcohol is about twice as expensive in this city compared to what I've seen when I'm travelling in other states and it's sucked up almost all my disposable income for the last four or five years.  Besides that I haven't bothered to take care of my apartment or any of my things.  None of this kind of stuff matters to me in and of itself but it is embarrassing when I have friends and colleagues over or worse when I bring a date back here.

Ok, enough complaining.  The awesome thing is that after 26 days of not drinking, some of my paycheck from the end of June is still left which is a brand new concept for me.

For all the weeks and months of sobriety that have snuck away from me, you're the ones who got me through the single days that wouldn't end. 

I've been sober for months at a time before, but I don't believe I've ever had 250 days in a row. I've reached a point where I don't want to drink, even when I do. WTF does that mean? I mean I still have shitty days, I still cry at work because strangers scream at me on the phone, I still get apocalyptic PMS, and I still fight with my boyfriend. These are situations that any alcoholic knows are fan-fucking-tastic reasons to drink the day and night away, but they're also just a part of life. Getting sober means finding new ways to accept and deal with life, instead of drinking in response to the things that happen to us.

I'm not sure if it's the fact I've gotten used to experiencing stress without drunkenness after, or that I've taught myself that the shitty days end even if you're not drunk, but I go through life without feeling like drinking is really a thing. It's odd, I guess I'd compare it to being 16 and working full time but not having access to booze (I was a loner). It just wasn't an option then, and it's not now. I sort of think of alcohol as a food item I'm allergic to rather than a drug I have a problem with.

If you're having a shitty day and it feels like a drink is the only way it'll ever be over, remember that when you end that day without a drink, you're forming a new habit. You're learning to deal, and it's a bigger relief to know how to deal with life than any drink ever will be.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month9,True,t3_1j4utu,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j4utu/250_days_without_regret/,

Unfortunately, I didn't read the terms and conditions properly, and my expectations of having excellent health, a dazzling job, a delightful social circle, and a publishing deal land in my lap have not yet come to pass. 

















In this time,  however, I have to come to terms with the following (most of these problems, of course, have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol). Financially I'm in the pits. A major healthcare crisis and the need for rent has whittled away my savings. I'm attempting to finish a degree that might be physically impossible to complete in the time I have, despite extensions, making my chosen field of work a (probable) impossibility. I have a CV that shows me as over educated and under experienced. I'm seeing the cracks in my family (riddled with alcoholism and enablers), and the possibility of having to become a carer for at least two members in the near future. Every mental health issue I have shoved down into the Pit of Subconscious with the Stick of Alcoholism is bubbling unimpeded to the surface. Most of my friends have moved away to do sickeningly normal things, like pursue careers and have babies. Some cocktail of hormones has conspired against me to make me break out in grey hairs and spots *at the same time*. I think my nose has put on weight. This morning I stood on an plug. 

















If I was still drinking, I would semi-acknowledge these problems, let a slow panic build up on my brain, and then, by 5.30, just have one drink to 'take the edge off'. Now I'm not drinking, I am able to look at them in the eye.  I recognise that my upbringing and past and even genetics have magnified the potentiality for substance abuse to horrible proportions. But I also recognise my own agency. I take responsibility for my failures and my faults. When I was drinking (this is hard to admit) I would play with fantasies of success, of being loved, of being a functional and admirable human being (probably engaged in while I was lying face down drooling and surrounded by bottles). It was easy to do with my mind in a black fog. Sobriety, on the other hand, has forced me into humility and clarity. The curtain over the Dorian Grey portrait of my soul has been yanked off. It ain't pretty, but if I can see my wounds and weakness clearly and unshrouded by alcohol I know I can start to fix them.  














For every problem I have there is a solution. It might take a long time and a lot of effort, and the solution might not be what I originally wanted, but anything can be resolved. I am alive. I have a full working set of limbs and even an almost full set of teeth. My ambitions might not come to pass, but I have come to terms with my failures. My current situation, in terms of prospects and money, is the 'worst' of my life, but I feel quite cheerful. I am working to change it. I'm growing into a proper human being. I'm applying for any job I can and happy that I at least have the resources - a computer, internet - to do so. I am grateful to be sober and for all the support and all the people here. I know if I was drinking everything would be worse and this is the only way it can get better. I try to keep in mind these pieces of wisdom from two of the greatest philosophers the West has ever known: ""Man never achieved anything without great labour"" (Horace, Epistles) and, also, ""Be excellent to each-other"" (Bill and Ted). Failure only continues to be failure if you keep dwelling on it. Going sober might not fix everything instantly, but it will give you the tools to fix things over time. Don't be disheartened if things don't seem to get better, or, indeed, if things seem to go from bad to worse once you take up sobriety. [There's a positive side to the worst of situations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Wx230gYJw). Without alcohol, even if you don't see the results straight away, your body and brain is churning away to become better, quicker, faster, more intelligent, more empathetic, more motivated. You are basically level grinding your Human Being stats without even realising it. I have absolutely no doubt for anyone who chooses to give up drink, or if you are considering giving up drink, Your Life Will Get Better. Maybe not immediately, or easily, or quickly. But very much definitely. It is actually impossible for it not to.

I was released from jail at 5:00am this morning after serving 28 days for DUI number 3.  (*between the arrest and conviction of said infraction, I was able to slip in a fourth DUI for good measure*) 

The only establishment open at this ungodly hour within walking distance of the jail house was a 24 hour Casino with a well stocked bar and cocktail waitresses galore and the Greyhound station, from which my 8:30am bus would be leaving for my 2 hour trip home.  

Against my better judgement I wander into the casino, cutting through the air conditioned building, to save time on my way to the Greyhound station you see...  and the sounds and smell, even the feel of the carpet beneath my feet take me back to that week I spent in Vegas  (*which I hardly remember*) with eight of my best friends, celebrating our comrades' accention into the holy bonds of matrimony.  

As I walk through the casino, I'm well aware there is a part of me that would have loved an excuse to kill three hours belly up to the casino bar with built in video poker and scotch in hand, but I've just spent 28 days telling myself that part of me has to be buried in my blurry, sad past of lost jobs, loves and a formidable mountain of legal fees and expenses.  So I make a lap around the casino floor twice, admiring the dedicated drinkers and gamblers who see nothing odd with a early morning coors light and 2 cent slot machine at 5am on a Friday morning and I realize I'm really not temped by the brown bottles and rocks glasses and honestly the Starbucks in the distance is really what draws my eye.  

So even after being bumped from the 8:30am bus to the 12:30pm bus, I spend my morning with a 26,000 calorie fap-a-chino and a collection of essays authored by writer, director Kevin Smith and keep pushing through to day 29.

Well, today is Day 61 and counting. Every hour, every minute, every second that goes by sets a new record for my Longest Time Sober.  

This weekend has lined up some really excellent opportunities to craft an excuse to relapse. I've treated one person badly, and two have treated me unfairly. I've dealt with all three situations honestly and immediately, and therefore have no excuse to seethe with resentment.  

One was my ex, who is celebrating her 50th Birthday at a barbecue with her family at a city about an hour's drive away. I told her I would like to go, but only if we take separate cars, as this is a trigger zone for me, and I need to have an exit if I need one. She replied that she hadn't really told her family that we are on ""the outs"", and that arriving in separate cars would cause them to raise an eyebrow. I guess I'm going to miss the barbecue, then, because my sobriety is paramount and will not be risked for any reason.  

Another person who was supposed to spend some time with me this weekend bailed out because she ""wasn't feeling well"". I just found out that she's now feeling well enough to be grabbing a pub lunch as I type this. Oh, well. I am refusing to let this get under my skin. I look at it as having been given a precious gift...rather that having the time blocked out, I now get to decide what to do with it at the last minute. I think I might dart over to a meeting in a nearby town where my cousin hangs out. He's got 9 years in, and he doesn't even know that I've joined yet. No rejection, no hurt feelings, no reason to drink.  

I broke my record today, and I will keep breaking it, just as long as I identify the reasons for a relapse, and deal with them as they occur. It ain't easy, it ain't fun, but it has to be done.

Exactly a week prior, I had my last drink on a red-eye flight from the west coast. Earlier that morning, I had awoken up hung-over, ashamed, miserable, and for the first time, ready to make a change. I flew more than 200,000 miles last year, and for the longest time, thought that at the end of the day, hurtling through the air at 500 knots, buzzed and on my way home, was my reward for a job well done. Last night, the reward was walking into the house and not disappointing my wife and toddler daughter. Today, I woke up refreshed, before I needed to, and with no anxiety to begin the workday. For those of you out there lurking (like I did), I can tell you that 95% of the anxiety I thought I needed to numb with alcohol dried up as I did. A few other thoughts one week in:

1. There is no better feeling than knowing I am prepared to face whatever daily challenges get thrown my way. Paradoxically, addressing them head on, rather than in a haze makes them all seem so much less paralyzing. 

2. My biggest fear, being able to sleep, turned out to be a non-issue as my body took advantage of the opportunity to catch up on years' of debt. 

3. Beyond the fact that my wife, family and friends are proud of me, I have, for the first time in a long while, felt dependable, and deserving of their support.

I knew I was at the end of the road a little over 500 days ago. I had to make a decision whether I wanted to keep my job, keep my health and go to rehab or continue to drink. I knew I loved drinking. I really loved getting drunk. I loved the feeling I got after putting down a few drinks. 

Toward the end I had zero patience for pacing myself. I wanted to get drunk as fast as possible. In the end withdrawal symptoms from taking a day off from drinking (yeah that's right one day) After going through rehab and then going to meetings i realized this was one of the signs i was an alcoholic. I didn't drink for fun. I didn't drink socially. I drank for one purpose, to get that feeling in me. Intoxication.

AA has done a lot for me and I would absolutely recommend it to those who are trying to get sober. But that's where my preaching stops. I don't have a sponsor and have been rubbed the wrong way by some of the people in the rooms. But I'm still going to meetings and hopefully I find a sponsor and become willing before i slip into bad habits again. That's just my take. We've done online meetings on this subreddit and I know this subreddit has gotten some much deserved recognition from posts in other subreddits of people recovering.

I remember I use to epicly lurk this subreddit as if i was window shopping. To see what it was like for those recovering. I didn't think I could relate to any one who was recovering. I mean how can one not drink and call themself an alcoholic? If you're reading this and you're wondering whether you should quit or not, it IS better on the other side. My health has improved drastically. I've lost weight, I look much better and my body is recovering from the abuse i put it through. My family, and especially my kid, have really connected to me over those 500 days. They say you do this for yourself and it's made me such a happier person. I can enjoy those moments that i can bond with my kid instead of blowing them off for a beer. That might not make sense to some but i feel like a better husband/father.

It fills me with quiet pride. 80 days ago I could not have imagined today, or all the days in between. What a ride! I feel like I have gone through every available emotion. 

Today I feel solid. I feel real, and smarter. Self-respect isn't something I have to fake anymore. I'm far from perfect and I am far from done, but there is a sense of hope and pride to my life that I can't remember ever feeling before. 

I just wanted to say thank you, guys. Every single person here. Even if I have never spoken(written?) to you directly. I might have stayed sober anyway, who knows, but being involved in a community like this has changed the flavor of sobriety for me. I get this weird and totally corny sense of pride being a part of this group. Every day I watch total strangers support each other, make time for kind words, advice, compassion. We live in a world that is pretty damn harsh at times and being able to inhabit a small corner like this, *having* people in my corner has been amazing.

1367197038.0,27,self.stopdrinking,1db1dz,First weekend with old friends after telling myself that I wouldn't drink. It didn't go very well.,starting1over,30,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1db1dz/first_weekend_with_old_friends_after_telling/,"A few months ago I started a diet to lose some weight and become a more healthy person. Up until that point I was the definition of a weekend warrior. Coming from a small hick town in southern Ontario, when the weekend rolled around me and my friends would all be excited to get together and put away a case of beer each, wake up the next day and repeat until monday rolled around. Now that I was on this aforementioned diet, I found that my body just couldn't handle the amounts of booze that I was pounding into myself and I would get very sick, blackout, act stupid and be so hungover that I couldn't get out of bed the next day. At the time the decision to stop wasn't hard. I knew I had a problem having grown up with an alcoholic stepfather, father and stepmother, I could recognize the patterns in my behavior and I knew this was not me and I could do better. The first few months were great, no drinks, losing weight like crazy, much happier and my depression became very manageable. Until this point, every time my friends asked if I wanted to put a few back I just politely declined and said I was busy with school (which I was) but this weekend my brother-in-law's band was playing in my hometown so I decided I would test the waters and go out. When I got there all was good, we catched up for a few minutes and had some laughs, after all, I missed my friends very much. Once the waitress came around to take the drink orders and I just opted for water the dynamic changed. They honestly looked at me like it was a stranger they were staring at and not their longtime friend. I explained my situation to them and they thought it was nonsense, one of my friends told me to ""suck it up pussy"" and even though it may have been in a joking manner it still stung. The rest of the night they spent their time trying to buy me drinks, scoffing every time I ordered a water, saying I changed and belittling my problem. It seemed that they don't enjoy my company now that I don't drink and it hurt a whole hell of a lot as I have known some of these people as long a ten years. I don't think I will take them up on their next offer to get together because I know I will feel obligated to drink to feel accepted. I don't know how to feel about all of this. Have any of you had a similar situation and have advice. I am going to keep the path I am on, there is no doubt about that but I can't help to feel sad when I seems like my company can't be enjoyed without a drink in my hand. Anyways, thanks for letting me rant r/stopdrinking. In the last three months I have not blacked out, urinated in public, made a fool out of myself, passed out in my own vomit, or spent all of my money in one night and I'm proud of that.

I usually drink before work, after work, wake up and drink, take a nap, wake up and drink some more. Been a heavy drinker for about 5 years now but this past year took a turn for the worse.

Due to certain events in Oct of 2011 (wont get into it, trying to get over it.) I fell into a deep depression. I got my first DWI in OCT of this past year, my grandma, who was pretty much my mom, passed away shortly after. My drinking binges started happening more frequently and more severe. After getting arrested I skipped out on court because I was too depressed to get out of bed. Most of my money went on alcohol which meant I fell WAY behind on my bills. I couldn't pay my car payment, my rent, all of my utility bills were neglected. As a result, I lost EVERYTHING these past 2 months. I lost my car, my apartment, most of my friends. All because of my addiction to alcohol. Now I'm on probation for 1 year for my DWI. I had to move back in with my alcoholic father. I don't think anyone in my life knows just how addicted I am. 

I haven't had a drink in 4 days and that's a huge step for me. I reached my ending point. I lost everything. I have NOTHING now and it hurts. It hurts because I was on top of the world just a year ago but because I'm so weak I let the alcohol and depression consume me. I always thought I was a strong woman and I could overcome anything. I can't believe how far I let alcohol and depression bring me down. I mean, hell, I had 5 beers just the other day before heading to my first probation meeting with my officer.

I was sitting in bed in the dark with a beer in my hand at 8am the other day when I started thinking about all my problems and struggles. I realize now that ALL of my major issues at the moment have been caused by alcohol. I didn't even finish my beer. Right now alcohol is the enemy. I haven't even been tempted to have a drink. No dreams about beer, just relief... I've never had an addictive personality. I'm ready to be sober for the first time in 7 years. I'm ready to drop any people from my life who are negative influences. I wont look back. I've already changed my phone # and I have no problem staying home on weekends and watching TV. Saving money.

I'm READY. 

I have short term goals laid out for me. Within the next year I will finish my probation &amp; move back to California where I was born. I plan  on continuing my sobriety after my 1 year of probation is finished. 

I know I'm only 4 days in but the only side effect I've had is anger and frustration on my second day. I plan on quitting cigarettes some time soon. One step at a time.

My body has done for me what I couldn't do for myself. In November I was found unresponsive at my home, and rushed to the hospital with what they thought was a cardiac event. The EKG turned out okay, but the ER doc suspected something else. I dismissed things as acid reflux and told them that I was too young to have these issues. Hell I do 3-4 miles of cardio a day and work out, so impossible right? WRONG!

On a whim I went to see a cardiologist just to verify that I was fine. Turns out after an ultrasound and a heart catheter, I was not fine anymore. My body looks great on the outside but the inside was in serious trouble. MY heart function was 35% or lower and I had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. They feel my autoimmune issues are what caused the heart failure and many other issues.

So I have gone from someone who could go to sleep at night and not worry about croaking in my sleep to someone that worries if tomorrow might not come. I hope I can get my function back fully, and in April I will know if there are any improvements. Before all of this got so serious, I took naproxen for my arthritis, worked out for joint stiffness and pain management and would drink to cover my pain and illnesses. 

Even though now I'm on 40 plus pills a day to control heart issues, arthritis, Lupus, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, and the chronic pain that comes from all of it. I'm no longer having to self medicate through alcohol to get through the tough times, and it's been nice to not wake  up hungover. I also had no idea how much physical pain I'd been living with for so long. I actually feel human now. I have my good days and bad days, but I really do have a new lease on life with how painless I have manage to become. Sure I have my main big aches and pains, but the small over all white noise pains are now dulled and almost completely gone! 

That being said, I was told by the docs that I would have probably died within the next year had I kept drinking with my heart in the shape it was in, and that's a scary thought. Due to the meds I take, I can't drink, but even if I could, I feel like it would just be instant suicide. 

What works for me is my body forcing me to take care of myself, using proper meds for proper medical issues, and the knowledge that if I fuck around, I'm not just relapsing, I'm committing suicide. Today my quality of life is much better, and I feel like living. And tomorrow I'm pretty sure I'll be as excited about living as I am today.

Thanks for listening!

Or you could shake your head in disbelief at how far you've sunk in yet another year or how you've simply yet one more year slip through your fingers.

Make this your year, make this your day. Today, a day like any other but different in a way that could change your life. Grab onto it - that first piece of resolve and hope you've had in a while. Cling onto it with all you're worth and resolve to get through January 1, just today, without a drink.

This quitting drinking business is, for me, pretty overdue. I drank beer to get drunk for the first time when I was about 13. Through the rest of high school, my friends and I continued to do this; we liked it. We liked the sneaking around, we liked getting away with something, and we liked being drunk. As far as we were concerned there was nothing wrong with any of this, since we thought we had everything under control. We weren't going to jail, we were keeping up with school. 

By the time I got to college, I was a seasoned drinker. I was also undergoing a lot of typical adolescent crisis stuff and I was depressed. My method for coping with these issues was getting fucked up. I nearly failed out the first semester. Managed to pull it together and eventually graduate. I was drinking pretty badly throughout most of that period, but a lot of people around me were too, and, again, I thought I was basically OK. I later found out that I had a reputation as a keg-sucking fool, which is probably because that is what I was. By the last year or so, however, I was partying much less, and focusing on academics. 

In my 20's I was doing a lot better. I was playing in a band, living with a girlfriend, working. The band was with the guy I first got drunk with. By that time, he had quit drinking, and we were all sober at practices and shows to support him. If I was ever a normal drinker, it was in this period. But I would still throw pretty excessive binges from time to time. 

As 30 heaved into view, it seemed that the phase of life where I was content playing in bars and driving pizza needed to come to a close. I decided to do what I had always had in mind, which was apply to graduate school and try to become a professor. A philosophy professor. I found that I was unable to gain admission to top programs, although  got pretty close. My spotty academic record was just too much of an obstacle, perhaps. By this time I had moved to a different city with the same girlfriend and broken up with her. I was 30, with more or less no practical job skills and  with no idea what to do. Some more personal stuff happened that didn't go the way I had hoped. I fell into another period of crisis.

I decided that academia wasn't going to work out and started thinking about getting into computers. This was a lucky break: by now, it was about 1998, and there was a ton of demand for people who could do anything at all with programming or web design. You didn't need credentials, you just needed to show up. This chariot swung low and rescued many people in my situation - liberal arts grads who couldn't do anything else except work in restaurants, retail, or as office temps. 

But this is also when the real bad drinking resumed. There were a few dramatic incidents, but mostly it was like a tide slowly getting higher. I was still mostly drinking beer, but now I was drinking  at least some almost every day. I began to enjoy some professional success, but I was just lost as a human being. Depressed, self-pitying, brooding about the past and about my missed opportunities in life. I gradually started drinking more hard liquor then beer. Beer now was just inconvenient; I had to drink aboout 12 of them to get as much alcohol as I wanted. I didn't like feeling bloated and pissing every 15 minutes. Whiskey is a much more efficient drug delivery system  By about 2004, I'd often head straight to the liquor store for a pint right after work. I started calling in sick with hangovers. I knew what I was doing to myself but I eother didn't care or didn't want to stop. I'd tell myself I'd stop, but not yet. The pints became fifths. I noticed that it had been a long time since I had even vomited from drinking excessive liquor; my system was used to it. 

Sometimes I'd drink in a way that you might call normal drinking. I'd have a glass of wine, or a beer or two, and stop. I'd go a week or two without getting blackout drunk. But the trend was inexorably going to the worse. I decided to stop for a month to see if I could do it and to try to break the cycle. It wasn't that hard to do it. At the end of the month, I remember thinking: I could just go on like this, I don't have to start again. But I wanted to drink, and I did. I guess I was playing the familiar game of ""proving"" to myself that I wasn't an alcoholic. At first I was more in control. I'd drink only on the weekends, and I'd drink less. A year later, I was worse than I had been before the month off, which is a dead giveaway, but I wouldn't face the facts. The controlled drinking that I could do was an illusion. It was only possible because I knew that, in a day or two, I could drink to a stupor like I really wanted to do. 

No dramatic consequences ever happened. No arrests, no DUIs, no heart attacks. But I was living a dismal life of increasing social isolation, ongoing misery, solitary drinking. There was no rock bottom, it was just a gradual slide into despair. Drinking with other people was just an annoyance by now; they'd be sloppy drunk and a problem, while I was still getting started. I went on like this for at least three years. 

The thought started to occur to me more often that my bullshit about how I wasn't an alcoholic, and how I could, one day, pull out of this, wasn't coming to pass. I was getting old, in my early 40s by then, and I wasn't getting better. I was getting worse. The 3 or 4 days between huge drinking sessions was becoming 2 or 3 days. Sometimes 1 day. I started ""quitting"" drinking. I'd go for a week or so, and then decide that I could drink again, then, after that, I'd REALLY quit. 

To this day I'm not sure how I snapped out of that. I guess you could say it was a moment of clarity. It occured to me that it was possible that I actually couldn't stop. When you are still youthful, you have the luxury of thinking that you have plenty of time to start living your real life, to change. When you're over 40, the reality hits you: this IS my real life. I was on track to become a sick, broken-down drunk. Or maybe a suicide. 

I'll tell you another thing that truly scared the shit out of me. I got drunk one night and passed out. Woke up the next morning, headed to work. I was driving on a busy road, in the right lane. A bicyclist was riding on the shoulder. He hit a rock or something , and fell off the bike. He fell away from the road. If he had fallen the other way, there is absolutely no way I could have avoided hitting him. I don't know if I was still legally drunk, but I probably was, and even if I was a little under, I would have gone down as the drunk driver who killed him. Never mind that the Pope couldn't have avoided the accident - he'd be dead and I'd be in prison right now. Or maybe I'm kidding myself, and that accident, which never happened, but could have, COULD have been avoided by a driver who wasn't impaired in his reactions. Then I truly would be a killer. It occurred to me that I was doing this a lot. I was very careful not to drive during a drinking bout, but the next day? Time to punch the ""high functioning alcoholic"" clock. All those mornings when I was remarkably hangover free? I was still drunk from the night before. That means I was habitually showing up at work drunk AND driving drunk to get there. That is no way to live. 

So I decided, once again, to quit. But this time it worked. I said I am going to see if I can really do this. If I can't, I'll check into rehab or something, I'll do whatever I have to do. I drank a fifth of Jameson on Nov 11, 2011. I didn't even enjoy it. Alcohol had become about need, not pleasure. After a few days, when I normally would have done the same thing again, I  just didn't. I started reading and posting here. I learned to focus on a goal of not drinking for one single day.  After a few months, I was honored to be asked to become a moderator, I think because I used to jump on new posters and encourage them. It's a year later and I have not had a single drink. The thought that maybe I can one day drink normally has crossed my mind, but I don't entertain it. Total abstinence is working very well for me, and I see no reason to screw around with risking going back to the living death that alcohol had become. 

My life has improved so much in every way. I feel better, I look better. I feel pride again, I feel that I like myself again. I have a lot of issues to work on still in life, but it seems to me that I now have a chance to actually make progress. When I become depressed, I can bounce out of it. I value what I still have and what I can still do in life, instead of wallowing in regret and self-pity and in thinking about the chances that I missed due to my own folly. Why didn't I do this years ago? I guess the answer is pretty obvious - because I'm an alcoholic and I still wanted to drink.

I'm 41 years old and have been drunk since I was a teenager.  I had stolen beers from my dad and other people when I was a wee lad, but didn't get my first, real taste until I was 16.  My best friend's dad had passed and he was left home, alone, for a week while his mum flew home to be with relatives.  We got into the beer first and then the vodka.  Well, that was for me.  It warmly washed over me and I felt like I was home.  We challenged each other to see how many bubbles we could make from continuous swallows.  
 
 
We blacked out, sprayed the place with vomit and, the next day, found it hilarious despite the crippling hangovers.  We sought to recreate this experience in every chance given.
 
 
Without surprise, I developed behavioral problems and began suicidal thinking.  My parents put me into an asylum, of sorts, for young people. During my interview, they asked me questions about my drug use and drinking.  I didn't think much of it.  I was young and fighting for my right to party.  It's what we did.  It's what everyone did, right?
 
 
Due to my honesty in the interview, I found myself in my first A.A. meeting.  I sat there with people twice, three and even four times my age.  I heard the message, but it didn't stick.  *I didn't have a problem.*
 
 
Flash forward past the insanity of my school years to my early twenties.  I'm 23 and getting married to a woman I proposed to, while drunk, on a beer run.  The next day, she tells me she has informed her parents of the good news.  ""Good news?  We're getting married?""  
 
 
Ahh, right.  Cool.  Fuck it, let's do it.  I'll get drunk.  And, so I did and so we did.  We both got blackout drunk at our own wedding.  Hardly anyone else drank anything.  The marriage lasted, surprisingly, 7 years and I feel the reason it lasted so long was because we drank at every chance.
 
 
There was abuse -- on both sides.  Physical from her and mental from me.  The divorce was ugly, as they usually are.  In a moment of lucidity, I listened to a business associate and came along with him to another A.A. meeting.
 
 
That meeting didn't stick.  I heard what they were saying, but I was proud to call myself a hard drinker.  I had control.  I could hold down a job and, while hungover all the time, I felt I was at least managing.  I was still driving this train.
 
 
A few drunken years later, another marriage and another divorce.  I piled lots of mental abuse onto this one.  I picked up a nice pill habit: benzos, mostly, and opiates when I could get them.  I drove her away in proper fashion with a drunken attempt to fuck her sister.  A right, true gentleman!
 
 
I decided I would only date drinkers from here on out and wouldn't get married again.  Brilliant!  That's when blackouts became my regular thing.  I would visit my haunts and complete strangers would greet me either with open arms or verbal threats, depending on whether they had toasted with my Jekyll or Hyde the night before.  I had no recollection of these people, but they knew me as if we were old mates, singing songs of debauchery and buggery on the high seas.
 
 
My drinking escalated and a corporate lawsuit came along at work.  I was involved, of course.  I would drink all night and wake up to the warm, loving embrace of Percosets.  The trial came and I passed through, unscathed -- at least in a legal and civic sense.  The Percosets ran out and I didn't really care.  I had my other ""medicine"", as I called it.  Again, the drinking escalated. 
 
 
I tried to leash it, but it didn't work.  I tried to stop, but would never make it more than a few days.  I'd feel proud of my new-found sobriety and would pour one back in its honor.  As Jane might say, ""I'm going to quit tomorrow.""
 
 
I finally managed to stay sober for all of a month.  Now, I needed a nice, sober girlfriend to help me stick.  I signed up on a dating site and wouldn't you know I labeled myself a non-drinker?  I believed it to be true!  I finally had control!  
 
 
I met a very nice woman.  She didn't drink and didn't have an addiction.  She was just what I needed to cure myself.  In fact, she even works in law enforcement.
 
 
I had a drink on our second date.  By the time the date was over, I had five drinks under my belt and was wanting to call it a night so I could go home and drink in proper mad fashion. 
 
  
Months passed, along with selfish behavior.  One example: her dad had to go to the hospital for emergency surgery, but I couldn't be bothered to go with her because I needed ""me"" (i.e. drink) time.  In between the fights and mental abuse of this new girlfriend, I tried to stop drinking again.  ""Babe, I promise.  I will stop.""  *I never lasted more than a few weeks.*
 
 
Last week, I drank three bottles of wine at work in just under two hours.  I stupidly drove home and even stopped to buy more liquor.  The idea was to get good and plastered before my girlfriend got home.  This was my daily plan of action but, like all things, it had escalated.  My girlfriend came home and was wondering why I was acting fucked up.  I lied and told her I only had three beers.  I did have three beers -- three beers and three bottles of wine!  I was planning on drinking another three beers and have at least half of the bottle of Riesling that I had bought for her.
 
 
The inevitable fight started.  I remember some of it.  I was out of control and about to lose a very good woman, as well as what little stability was in my life. 
 
 
I was sorry, of course, and I promised her I would go to meetings.  
 
 
The next day, I was violently ill.  I couldn't leave the house.  All I could think about was getting a drink.  The day after that, I attended my first meeting.  I was going to go to the evening meeting, but a voice in my head told me to get my ass to the meeting at 12PM.  I went and was so scared, you could have seen my heart beating through my skin.  I left halfway through it.  Later that evening, I went to another meeting and stood up to get my 24 hour chip.
 
 
Since then, I've been going to two meetings per day and I'm taking it one day at a time.  Yesterday, I got a sponsor.  He bought me the big book and told me I have to call him once per day.   I've done a lot of physical damage to my health and my blood pressure is dangerously high.  I've done a lot of mental damage to people I love.  I'm an alcoholic, but I'm going on 8 days without a drink thanks to the fellowship and unity of the meetings.  I'm an agnostic and not one to believe in fairy tales, but there's something going on at these meetings.  I don't understand it, but I want what they have.

- I drank to numb some painful and strong emotions which are now starting to bubble up
- I don't have many good friendships.  I spent most of my free time around people who would tolerate/encourage/be blind to my drinking.  These are people who, last time I tried to quit, told me I need to drink since I'm more fun

And I've discovered a few really awesome things:
- Bad moments and stress pass without me getting obliterated, or looking forward to getting obliterated
- Have two whole days on the weekend without being hungover is AWESOME
- My life doesn't have to be something I just endure, I can change it to be something I enjoy

The biggest realization is I have to change more in my life than just not drinking.  I have to learn how to like myself.  I need to find friends who I can not only have a good time with, but can rely on when times aren't so good.  I need to get hobbies.  I need things to look forward to.

I have more money, I feel healthier. I'm able to go to sleep without being drunk. I don't have a headache in the morning that's only fixed by a shot (or six), I remember everything from the previous day. 

I used to be waved into every single bar in town without an ID check, in a city that heavily checks IDs. I had three - five different stores I'd go to to purchase alcohol so that known of them knew the full extent of my alcoholism. I'd be up at 5:30am waiting for 6:00am so I could buy some beer. 

I'd have to down two tall boys before work sometimes just to get through. Sometimes I'd bring in two or three of those little one shots. 

I drank every night, and at my height I was drinking a pint of whiskey every day after work. I went to a music festival one weekend and managed a fifth of whiskey a day, plus about ten beers. 

Now I'm sober. I went through withdrawals for five days straight. It's very weird being sober, like I said. Today's my day off. Normally I'd be plastered by now. But I'm not.

This post really has no point, except to maybe ramble. I don't know. I just felt it was important to say I have stopped drinking. It was something that defined me for longer than I care to think about. All my friends said I was the biggest drinker they knew, and some of my friends are big drinkers. I get asked daily if I've had a drink yet, presumably because they assume that, eventually, I will. I'm happy to inform them that I have not. 

I honestly don't know if I'll ever drink again. When I was in the hospital for withdrawals, the nurse asked me if I would drink after that and I said ""I don't know"". She paused for a few seconds and said, ""That's a very honest answer."" I think she was expecting a ""No"".

But that of course was WORSE somehow, because she knew that I'd just walked past my favourite brand of red wine on half price and was looking at me like I'd gone a bit mad and that she was doing me a huge favour by gesturing at the Special Offer stand. I had a two minute, excrutiating conversation with her where I couldn't think up an excuse fast enough and let her put a bottle of wine in my basket. Little Bastard Wine Imp shrieked with joy, of course. After my friend left, I looked at the wine in my basket and thought that it would be all right if I bought it, because TECHNICALLY I didn't pick it up off the shelf myself.


I mean, come on. Talk about splitting hairs. 'It's all right because someone else put it in my basket'. Luckily, my resolve was louder than the Imp, and I sort of stood there like an idiot for five minutes battling with myself. The OTHER thing is that (sorry about this TMI, gents) it is the beginning of *that time of the month*, it started this afternoon. I can never predict it because I've messed my body up so much with alcohol that it doesn't come regularly, and sometimes it doesn't come at all, but when it finally does it is excrutiating and awful. It's like torture. I usually drink more when it's my period because I think that I deserve to, what with all the pain and hormones, etc. So NOW, I have this wine in my basket that is my favourite, is half price, that someone else put in my basket, and it's my period.


Come on. I practically HAD to buy it, it was practically a sign from the heavens.


I walked about six paces away with the wine, stopped stock-still and groaned at the ceiling in general before turning around and (with ill grace and zero humour) slammed the wine back onto the shelf and *ran away* before it could start talking to me again.


I bought about a million ice pops and Jubblies instead.


Even after ALL that effort, right now my overwhelming feeling isn't of relief that I made it out without buying alcohol, or pride that I managed it or anything like that - the overwhelming feeling I'm feeling is 'My GOD, I could really do with a drink after that.'


FOR GOD'S SAKE. YOU ARE NOT HELPING, IMP.


So yeah.. That was my second sober evening. Thanks for listening to me rant. Again.

I was in a bad mood and isolated myself this weekend, went camping by myself, and drank on Fri &amp; Sat nights. I knew several hours beforehand that I was going to drink, but I was in a self-destructive mood and didn't seem to have the motivation to fight it.

I'm embarrassed to be resetting my counter after 100+ days, but my only real regret was breaking my promise to myself. Sure, I've done that many other times in my drinking career, but I felt so certain that I'd licked it this time.

Since I can't turn back the clock, here's what I learned from this relapse:

1. Beer tastes like shit. My previous ""favorites"" now taste like sour piss to me.

2. I don't like the feeling of being drunk. Of course, I knew that before, but that lesson really hit home as I stumbled around, got the bed spins, nearly vomited, and considered doing other stupid shit like boating in a thunderstorm and driving to the store for more beer.  I hate the diminished motor skills, cognitive abilities, and lack of judgement. 

3. Drinking did nothing to improve my mood or help solve the problems I was having.  I knew it wouldn't before I took that first drink, but I did it anyway.

4. Being alone when I think I may be in danger of drinking is a fatal mistake. If my family would have been with me, I'm certain I would not have relapsed.

I'm not glad I made this mistake, but I am glad that I'm learning something from it and now I have a renewed commitment to not drink. Now I know exactly what will happen if I have that first drink again and I don't like it.

My name is Chris. I am an alcoholic. I am not going to drink today.

At some point celebrating this sort of thing is like patting yourself on the back for not burning down your own house on a regular basis, so I'm not looking for congratulations on not drinking and drugging for so long but I thought I might tell a little bit about how I got here.

Addiction got me like it gets everyone else - I practiced it for a good amount of time and it became a natural thing for me to do. My costs were pretty much like anyone else I suppose: lost jobs, lost relationships, lost opportunities. Going into detail with all the ""drama and glamor"" of my story isn't something I do, but I will say this: DUIs led to mandated AA for me, and I spent 10 years in and around AA with various levels of resolve and motivation.

I had heard of the old Rational Recovery groups (the ones that became SMART Recovery) and searched for them on the internet one day after yet another binge.  This led me to SMART Recovery and I've been there, and have been abstinent, since the day I did that search.

Here's the point: You have a choice. I don't care what you choose, but find something that works *for you* and stop wasting your life in the circle of addiction. Stop telling yourself ""It's too hard.""  Stop telling yourself that you're somehow not worthwhile or not deserving.

You're just another fallible, imperfect human that needs to learn to deal with other fallible imperfect humans in an imperfect world.  That doesn't mean life and the world isn't somehow worthwhile because it doesn't currently meet your demands and expectations.

Stop telling yourself that the things you really want are too hard to get and work on changing the crap you tell yourself. It seems we can have a lot of conflicting thoughts: positive thoughts about the behaviors that harm us and negative thoughts about working to get what we say we value.

You cannot change the past no matter how much you howl at the moon, but you can start to make positive changes right now.  Find what works *for you* and get on with it.  Your own self-regard will thank you.

Best to you all.

This isn't my story or anything.  I will only say that I've drank too much for the past decade and struggled to curb it for quite a while.

It was time to quit (again -- previous attempts always ended up being rationalized into ""breaks"" rather than quitting, and it'd start up slowly again but sure enough end up habitual and regular).

I did something I hadn't done before.  I took the last beer in my fridge.  I looked at my girlfriend.  And I said, I'm going to pour this out.  I want you to watch me.  And when I'm done, I want a high five.

So I poured it out.  She high fived me.  I felt empowered by this -- the pouring it out and also having a supporting witness.  All the other times I ever quit drinking, I felt like I was just abstaining from something I enjoyed -- not *doing* something but rather simply *not* drinking, and that bothered me.  But here I actually felt like the act of pouring it out was so substantially empowering that it felt good to me, and I think it has helped me stay alcohol-free (I think I'm at week 4 or 5, not sure) and have no urge to drink anymore.  

So, I thought I'd post this here, maybe something like this could help someone. 

*[edit]* I'd also add that this reminded me of a similar empowering action I've heard of with letting go of anything in your life: where you write whatever it is down on a piece of paper and then you burn it.

I had a great experience. I went to a meeting for young people-- everyone there was in their 20s which was fantastic for me. And because it was on a Saturday night, it was just as much a sober social gathering as it was an AA meeting.

As a skeptic of AA, I encourage anyone who's interested to at least give it a shot.

Well, it's been 3 months since my trip to the ER and then detox.  If you feel like some entertainment feel free to take a look at my comment history.  I'm an alcoholic that was physically dependent on alcohol and currently, I'm enjoying the freedom of sobriety.  

I wanted to get some sobriety under my belt before posting here.  I'm damn proud to be 3 months in.  This is further into sobriety than I had ever dreamed I could get.  I've been lurking for too long, figured I'd finally post.

Now none of them are alcoholics. but they do drink. I went to a friends going away party this weekend and took off my shoes and had a seat in the corner (I am rather anti-social) and then it hit me. I could smell the beer and wine. I looked over to the table and it was COVERED with boxes and bottles of wine. I KNEW the fridge was stocked with beer. Everyone had one in there hands and EVERYONE that talked to me smelled like alcohol. I stay neatly planted for one hour aside from asking someone for a can of coke, then i left. I felt horrible that i couldn't handle it. my friends that know my problem looked at me with pity and kept asking ""does this bother you? what are you feeling right now? what is it like to be around alcohol and not drink? Are you craving one being around it?"" I know they were just checking in with me. but i felt stupid and broken. I gave the person who is going away a hug and excused myself and cried in my car. currently wishing there was a switch to make this go away. 

Thanks for reading for all those that did.

A new personal record.,spaceman_37,31,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1eg9q7/38_days_a_new_personal_record/,"Two years ago, I had a blackout at a friend's house. I realized at that point that I had a pretty serious issue and decided to quit drinking.

I lasted 37 days. 

I used a positive excuse to attempt moderation, the Bruins winning the Stanley Cup, which I'd been waiting almost 20 years to see. I then later used a negative excuse to completely fall off a cliff and want to be wasted drunk again, my hairstylist at the time who I was insanely attracted to asking me out while I was in her chair, and then later blowing me off which left me believing that I'd screwed up and wasn't good enough. It was so bad that the next (and last) two times I saw her, I wanted to be drunk going to see her so I could act aloof and that it didn't bother me.

Here I am two years later with a new resolve and a new record.

This time there will be no excuses, because that's all they were.

Thank you all for being there.",,False,,t5_2s7yr,False,,month4,True,t3_1eg9q7,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1eg9q7/38_days_a_new_personal_record/,
