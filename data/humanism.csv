*Much needed edit: Quote isn't vonnegut, its Iain Thomas or /u/pleasefindthis. The original posting of this was here. http://www.iwrotethisforyou.me/2007/08/fur.html. 

To Iain specifically, I admire your reaction to this. There have been thousands of hits to this quote across the web, all usually attributing it to Vonnegut. It has been painted over, which actually spurred my post, but I am considering painting it back up (although admittedly it would probably look like a kindergarden class tried to write it). This quote has been essentially a mantra I've used over the past several months. I've truly been through hell and back this year, and this quote has been a constant reminder of how important it is to approach life with the appreciation it deserves. I wish you the best, and I'll do what I can to ensure you receive the credit due for your quote.

So, a survey recently popped up in a couple of subreddits on the subject of religion but people weren't too happy with the questions. I've attempted to compose a more versatile and inclusive survey. 

This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.

Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Survey Link: http://www.screator.net/showform.php?f=620542889

A full list of the subreddits being surveyed follows:
r/Christianity, r/Atheism, r/Buddhism, r/Hinduism, r/Islam, r/Pagan, r/Judaism, r/TrueAtheism, r/Agnosticism, r/Deism, r/NeoPagan, r/Satanism, r/Scientology, r/Humanism, r/Taoism, r/Shinto, r/UUreddit, r/Pantheism, r/DebateReligion, r/ExploreReligion, r/Catholicism, r/NewAge.

If you have any subreddit suggestions, please comment! I'll probably post it there as well. The survey ends Sunday, July 22, 2012. 

Also, it may take a little while for me to get ALL of these topics up. There is a wait between submissions. But they'll all be up tonight.",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,,True,t3_wqr7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/wqr7j/religions_of_reddit_survey/,

(x-post from /r/atheism),Denny-Crane,54,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/154362/doctors_without_borders_would_like_to_thank/,"Hi, /r/humanism!

Your mod /u/Iamducky sent me a PM asking that I make sure this community was aware of a message I posted in /r/atheism regarding our annual humanitarian relief drive for Doctors Without Borders.  The information is below...

Doctors Without Borders has a message filmed by its director in the USA yesterday specifically to thank our community (read: nonreligious redditors, for /r/humanism).  **[You can view it here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msk3xVNXLQE).**

Two years ago, the /r/atheism community talked about creating a charity drive to make a positive impact in the world.  With 100,000 subscribers in 2010 and 250,000 in 2011, we have banded together to raise more than $210,000 for MSF.

Why Doctors Without Borders?  It is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning international aid organization that explicitly steers clear of religious and political affiliation.  It has been a clear consensus choice for a charity drive in the past when the question has been asked, although, being freethinkers, everyone knows other people do good work and we will never reach unanimity on - well, pretty much anything.  But, for those interested, MSF staff would also like to make themselves available some time in the next few weeks for an /r/atheism -hosted AMA.  If you have very specific questions about MSF, please look at that when it happens.  (I can meanwhile answer any looming questions about the campaign, either on reddit or on email at rDennyCrane@yahoo.com)

This year, we have decided to reach out to a new vendor, CrowdTilt, to reduce the overhead in our processing by 67%.  In fact, CrowdTilt waives all fees taken in by this campaign, with the only cost being the processing of a credit card.  So if you decide the mood hits you and you'd like to make a donation to the continued campaign, **[please follow this link to donate](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/atheism).**

I know a lot of you weren't subscribed to /r/atheism in the past, and maybe people in /r/humanism weren't aware of this drive's history, but this drive has been a real force for good in the world, substantiated by the nonreligious specifically to band together and make a difference in a way that theists use religious-affiliated organizations to do so.  It's the end of the year, a time where people tend to reflect with friends and family, and we hope to continue to make a difference with this campaign.

In fact, we have been so successful with this drive in the past that [we get a mention on reddit's Wikipedia page - see the first bullet point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Community_and_culture).

I would love to see this continue, and will do anything I can to help facilitate it.  If you're considering making a donation to charity about now, please consider making it to Doctors Without Borders alongside your fellow atheists.  Let's continue to set an example that we can be charitable for purely humanitarian reasons - that we are good for goodness sake!

*EDIT1* **[The U.K. site is here](http://www.justgiving.com/atheism)**

*Note* The U.K. has a program called ""GiftAid"" which supplements charitable donations.  If you aren't donating from the U.K. in GBP, please use the **[CrowdTilt site](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/atheism)** since it has lower overhead.  The U.K. site is a benefit to people taking advantage of GiftAid, but it is not a preferable option if you do not have the U.K. GiftAid incentive.

*EDIT2* **[MSF prefers the use of this video, which fixes some audio scratchiness from the first link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnmQqMN7Lrg).**  We'll be linking to that going forward for clarity's sake, but the content is the same in both.

While it is often debated whether or not Obama is an atheist or not (Mainly in Conservative circles), I have always believed that he is.  I, as I assume he is, am aware that at this time no openly atheist politician could become President in this country.  And so I lean to the side that feels that he ""pretends"" to be Christian and uses pieces of scripture for analogy and empathy with most of the country.  So when I listened to this speech, I found myself feeling something was different.  There was the normal God Bless America and scripture quotes, but there was something truly non-religious about his appeal to America. 

Starts at 13:18
&gt;You know, all the world’s religions, so many of them represented here today, start with a simple question.
&gt;Why are we here? What gives our life meaning? What gives our acts purpose?
&gt;We know our time on this Earth is fleeting. We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain, that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it’s wealth or power or fame or just simple comfort, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped. We know that, no matter how good our intentions, we’ll all stumble sometimes in some way.
&gt;We’ll make mistakes, we’ll experience hardships and even when we’re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God’s heavenly plans.
&gt;There’s only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have for our children, for our families, for each other. The warmth of a small child’s embrace, that is true.
&gt;The memories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves and binds us to something larger, we know that’s what matters. - **Barack Obama**

Am I the only one who sees pure humanism?  It reads almost word for word as an existential definition of humanity, with love as purpose.  Yes, he says ""God's Heavenly Plans,"" in a way that is interchangeable with fate, but I see this as again, just the painting of humanism with God tossed in for his audience.  That line ""There's only one thing we can be sure of..."" just breathes non-belief, we can't be sure of God's existence or good will or divine plan, we can't rely on heaven above to lead us to the promised land, we must do it alone.  This is not the Christian narrative of obedience, trust, love, and faith in God to see us through I hear from believers...  This is something different.

Am I alone in this line of thinking?  Am I twisting this speech too far?

His response: **""No, the point is to advance humanity as a species, sometimes at the cost of other humans' quality of life.""**

**Which of these is your humanist ideal?**

I certainly thought it was the former, but I'm beginning to suspect that my views are more radical than I think. I'm mostly asking this because of the AMA on Welfare http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z7pzz/iama_government_welfare_employee_i_help_people_in/ which has been nothing but scathing criticism of those who ask for government assistance to live.

Someone in the thread was kind enough to link to this article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee It would be sad to think that the only reason a system like this isn't in place is that nobody will vote for it because, despite our belief in the power of humanity, people aren't prepared to accept that the 'masses' will work for anything less than the risk of starvation.

As humans, I think we should be far beyond this. Must we be a hive mind that ignores the needs of many to ensure that the fittest survive? Do we not believe that humans work and create for more than just sustenance? That art and skilled labour are performed for more than bread? 

Every human has a valid inner life, a need to be more than just an automaton. An unnecessary race just to survive is surely responsible for reducing people's potential.

**Discuss!**

Fully expecting a torrent of downvotes, people calling me a communist (which I'm not, labour isn't the highest purpose), a socialist (which I may be), or an idealist who doesn't understand the necessary brutality of human life (possibly also true).

But in that same spirit of honesty, I feel like I'm at the end of my resources. 

After well over a year of marginal or outright unemployment, I'm losing my home to foreclosure - probably in the next 30-60 days, and there's no where left to go. Landed a new job in March, but at 100% commission sales going into a slow summer, the income just isn't there. I'm likely losing that job, as fighting through this foreclosure process has required more flexibility from my employer than they really wanted to provide. Fifteen years of marriage is being tested to the limits. Credit is, obviously, shot.

Humanists, I need something to stand on, because right now, I feel like there's very little reason in our world. Overwhelmed by it all, actually. What do you do, when it seems like every step you're taking is the wrong one? 

Please understand, I'm not contemplating self-harm or any of that nonsense; nor is this a plea for unwarranted bailout. Rather, I'm looking for your methods of coping with, adapting to, and overcoming the uglier times. 

Thanks. 

**EDIT:** Thanks, everyone, who's commented thus far. I'm grateful for your insights and advice.

And it worries me, honestly. I think that part of the attraction to Humanism is that it can only really be defined by each individual. I understand the need to have a basic agreement, but for organizations, blogs, and/or publications to claim that ALL Humanists think ____ about a particular subject or issue worries me. 

We (Humanists) give meaning to our own lives, not the lives of others. The idea of a centralized view, or a view dictated by a group or an individual for the whole of Humanism sounds a lot like a church to me. I personally am a Humanist with Libertarian leanings, who believes in an equality of opportunity but not an equality of outcomes. I have been told by other Humanists that Libertarianism has no place in Humanism, and this irks me to no end. Who are they to dictate how I shape my faith in Humanity?

We are not a religion. I hope we never become one, to be honest. I don't think we should tell other people how to think, or how to be a Humanist. That's for them to work out.

And while I may get downvoted to dust for expressing these thoughts, I hope that my fellow Humanists have the respect to consider this. I would love to hear all of your perspectives on this!

Camp Quest OK was going to hold a fundraiser tonight at Oklahoma Joe's BBQ, where 10% of the proceeds from dinners bought by their supporters would be donated to the group. After the group and its guests arrived and began ordering food, the owner approached an organizer and told them that he would not be giving them the verbally promised 10% because OK Joe's was a Christian business and did not support their beliefs.

A sign was posted on the door to OK Joe's indicating that CQ OK never fully revealed their beliefs to the owner, despite the fact that he had previously approved a flyer for the fundraiser and its connection to his business which plainly stated that CQ OK promoted 'secular humanist values' (among other things). One of the organizers from CQ OK had also spoken with the owner and told him that CQ OK was a good alternative for people who were looking for non-religious camps for their kids.

He also called the owner of OK Joe's to get his side as well.

She has been attending church (Christian nondenominational), looking for answers I think and hoping for understanding, peace, etc. She is grieving in anticipation of his death and one of the things she wants to hang onto is that he will go to heaven. 

I am an atheist and she doesn't really even talk to me about this (death) because she doesn't want to hear anything contrary to the only consoling idea she has in this (that her brother will go to heaven). 

Can anyone suggest any humanist sources/writings/etc. that can either help me help her or that I can pass along to her?

I'm not looking for counseling (for either her or myself), looking for reading material that provides non religious view of death and how we can deal with it. 

Thank you.

I decided to still approve the old articles because this subreddit isn't that big and there's still some relevant information.

We grew up in LDS (mormon) families. I consider myself a Secular Humanist and I don't accept supernaturalism. My wife is probably somewhere between a deist to agnostic. She is completely on board with providing a *humanist upbringing* for our future children.

At any rate, we are creating a written outline of our family values that we hope will help steer our moral outlook and cement our traditions for years to come. I want these to last but also be easy for a grade school child to memorize.



&gt; **LOVE**

&gt; * We love and respect each other.

&gt; * Every human is important &amp; unique.

&gt; * I try to be a good person because it makes the world a better place.


&gt; **LEARNING**

&gt; * I am curious.

&gt; * Science helps me make discoveries.

&gt; * I learn from the world around me by using my senses and my mind.


&gt; **REASON**

&gt; * I am free to question.

&gt; * I seek reasons for what I believe.

&gt; * I am responsible for my choices and my actions.


I like that there are three principles under each of the three main categories. I'm still trying to find a way to possibly include the word *""education""* within the values. I am also struggling to figure out how to incorporate *self control* or *impulse control*--in a way that a child can understand.

We will be creating traditions such as regular visits to museums and libraries on weekends.

I found it much more difficult to abandon some of the rituals and practices I'd done my whole life than it was to abandon the beliefs themselves. Ritual binds believers to their religion and reminds them of the beliefs and principles they value. Now, as a secular humanist, I find myself wondering about ways I might incorporate some kind of ritual into my life to refocus myself on the things I most value and provide some of the comfort that religious rituals once did. I wonder if this is a good idea and if it's even possible. What are your thoughts? Does anyone know of anything written on this topic I might read? Does anyone have any such practices of their own?

Unlike in many religions, of course, I wouldn't place supernatural significance or expectation on any of these rituals. I would be fully aware that any emotional or mental value I take from it would be the result of psychology rather than external influence. And I don't think that fact would necessarily diminish it.

This philosophy is based around the idea that the human race has well exceeded it's carrying capacity on this world, and will continue to do so in the future. This massive overpopulation of humans will result in the further decline and extinction of other species and enormous degradation of the Earth's resources to an extent that will eventually cause the complete collapse of the entire world ecosystem and the extinction of the human race. The basic premise of ""dark humanism"" is that in order to save the human race from itself, it must drastically reduce it's population numbers, preferably by removing those members of the population who are causing the most damage so that those members remaining will be able to live better lives and practice sustainability measures so as to ensure the long-term survival of the human race.

I'm sure others have had the same idea but there probably just isn't a name for it, I guess.  Basically, I read a little bit about buddhism a while back before I found out about Humanism. I really liked a lot of what I read and felt that the 4 noble truths really made sense to me.  Granted I could never buy into the supernaturalism of it, with all the Karma and whatnot.  But I still like the 4 noble truths. Does anyone else feel this way?

For those that don't know here are the 4 Noble Truths:

The Four Noble Truths

1. Life means suffering.

2. The origin of suffering is attachment.

3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.

4. The path to the cessation of suffering.

Basically, to me, all that is saying is that life sucks and there ain't shit we can do about it, so move on and stop focusing on what sucks.  If you can do that, things might get better for you.  I like to give some credit to these 4 ""Noble Truths"" for helping me quit smoking.  I was reading about these when I quit smoking and I used this philosophy to help me.  Whenever I got a craving I tried my best not to focus on it and instead focused on the idea that within time this craving will go away and I will become healthier.  Well I quit cold turkey in one day and haven't had one since.  That was over 5 months ago.

That was bad. And my former colleague wanted so badly to keep his rich client that he just asked me to roll over in exchange for my old job. So, I guess we all walked in here pretty bad. But now, Shirley's gone good. Shirley's helping me; it's that easy. **You just stop thinking about what's good for you and start thinking about what's good for someone else, and you can change the whole game with one move.** Now, if you like this idea, you can make it true by doing something good for everyone here.

Hello everyone! It's me again, with good news! Since yesterday, you've helped us rais ~$150 out of the $500 we needed to reach our goal of $3000, meaning we're ***just $350 away***! 

Also, we're only $100 away from a $250 donation from /u/NukeThePope, who yesterday said that [if /r/atheism raises $250, he'll match it](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/115mar/my_student_group_at_a_religious_school_in_the/c6jjazv)!

Presbyterian College is a small, church-affiliated college in Clinton, SC. How small is this school? Well, we have only 1300 undergraduates. We're one of the smallest (if not *the* smallest) Division I school.

As a result of this (and the whole church-affiliated college bit), our student group, [Secular Student Alliance at Presbyterian College](https://facebook.com/SSAPresby), is extremely small. Yet here we are, currently the top-raising SSA affiliate for Light the Night, with the potential to be one of the top-raising LtN groups *in our region*. This would be **huge** for the secular groups in our area, as they'd get a ton of publicity for this.

After all: a secular group in the Bible Belt? At a church-affiliated college?! Raising a ton money to beat cancer?!? You can bet that this would be a huge media event, giving us a chance to dispel those nasty rumors that nonreligious people don't do any good.

But it's not only that; this is more personal. Most of us have in some way been touched by some form of cancer. I lost my grandfather to bone cancer, and both my mother and grandmother have had bouts with breast cancer. Luckily, thanks to organizations that fund research to fight cancers and the treatments that come from that, my grandmother has now been cancer-free for several months. 

This is why we fight. There is no good cancer, so we need to do our best to fund research to eliminate all of them. Thanks to [Foundation Beyond Belief](http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/), we have a special opportunity to raise a lot of money to fight leukemia and lymphoma. For those who are unaware, the Stiefel family has graciously offered to match donations up to $500,000, for $1,000,000 total. It'd be silly not to take advantage of it.

So that's that. If you'd like to donate, please go here:  [Secular Student Alliance at Presbyterian College's Light the Night Page](http://pages.lightthenight.org/sc/Greenvil12/SecularStudentAllianceatPresbyterianCollegeFBB) and use the form on the right side.

It was a tragic and preventable death.  After 9 hours of beating, this boy was vomiting for hours before he went into cardiac arrest.  When we examined him, he was covered in old and healing wounds, signs of years of abuse.  One laceration was crudely sewn at home.  The family did CPR for a half-hour before they even called the paramedics.  This boy had no chance, and I can't stop thinking about him.

How do you cope, when you know this happened without a reason?  Even worse, I know that the ""reason"" is probably the sad, violent, and hopeless situation that the abuser grew up in.  It's the fucked-up world, and one fucked-up person that made this happen, and it's making me hate humanity a little.  Tough times for a self-described humanist.

I've been an atheist for a while, but only recently started identifying with humanism and reading about it.  But I'm asking a more personal question here-- how has your humanistic worldview helped you cope with something like this?  I'm having trouble maintaining my love for humanity right now.  Any humanist thoughts that might be helpful to meditate upon?  Thanks for your support-- right now, you are the closest thing I have to a ""religious community.""

Although, as i carried on with the semester, i wasn't too sure if it was still the same english class i signed up for; but i liked it. My teacher was a philosophy major and secretly teaches it in his class. I was introduced to fundamentalism, nihilism, and humanism. Taught us alot about the anxieties in our life and the wisdom we can learn from it. That true sacrificial love is the most powerful thing in the world. To remain curious through out life. Even we believe we have everything figured out, there's so much of the unknown world of knowledge we can discover and help share it among each other. Basically what i'm trying to get is that ever since i've been introduced to humanism, ive always been really passionate and enthusiastic about it. It's something i've always felt i had inside me but never really understood it. It allowed me to opened my eyes from a life i have blindly been living. I'm not here to show off how much i know or anything, but i hope to share and hear about interesting things to ponder about and quiet curious to hear others thoughts as well.

The last line about the greater good of humanity sounds just like what a utilitarian would say.

Additionally, it seems like utilitarians, as opposed to deontological folk, don't settle for foundational morals and wish to relate everything to the good it brings the human species. To me it seems counter-intuitive almost to be anything but utilitarian while also being a humanist. I say this because humanism is so focused on bringing about the good of human beings. There is no faith, no foundational beliefs necessary at all -- it all just comes back to what in the end brings about more human flourishing.

What brought on my conversion to humanism is the issues with the feminism movement because it just doesn't work now that the rights of females are equal, but discrimination and ignorance still abounds. So I realized that feminism couldn't help as much anymore.

My question to humanism is how big is the movement and what is it doing (and how can I help) to help diminish the fighting that is going on with homophobia and misogyny. These two seem to be of equal greatest importance and even have great similarities, especially when they come together as child abuse. At least in the United States, with racism following very closely after that.

I think the United States and other ""First World"" countries are the most important to settle these disputes, because if we do so for ourselves, then we'll at least know how to counsel other countries IF they ask for our help or act as a role model IF they follow in our footsteps.

Lastly, does humanism have anything to do with non-interventive ideas? Or does it not care how it settles these disputes?

Specialization is for insects."" Robert A. Heinlein

Recently I've been distracting myself from midsessional exam revision by reading about [renaissance men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man) (polymaths if you prefer). The title quote is what I imagine the basic idea of renaissance humanism to be and while it is certainly an attractive proposition, the quote from Heinlein got me thinking about the practical implications of saying that anyone can do anything (I'm assuming here that Alberti wasn't just being a sexist dick and meant a man/woman).
With that in mind, my question is:
Do you think it is possible for any given able-bodied individual to become at least competent in any given skill?
(or conversely, can you think of any skills/activities that some subset of the population would unable to accomplish because of their genetics or whatever?)
My first thoughts are that singing could be a contender for non-universality but I don't know enough about singing.
People also quite contend that mathematics is a closed community, but I personally believe that anyone could pursue maths if they tried hard enough - in much the same way as I believe that I could probably break my PB of learning three notes in a year on the clarinet if I made a concerted effort.
**TL;DR** Do you think Alberti was right or is he just a sexist Italian who doesn't know jack?

First comes simple elements and compounds, then stars and planets, then life with bacteria and plants, then intelligent life, and, if we could create artificial intelligence, inorganic life that would not be limited by a need for food and oxygen.

There is a library near where I work where various groups often set up informational displays as part of an outreach program staffed by a few people.  All sorts of groups use the time and space but two notable to me were Mormons and Muslims. 

They all have very good material available for passers by to pick up and read up on later. The material is well designed and well presented (and of course full of nonsense :)). Every time I pass them I think about how I would love to make similar materials available that promote Humanism in the same way.

I've registered a domain and have started trying to figure out how to create a custom Wordpress theme. I have found a decent plugin that I think would help to make the Download Area work. This will be challenging for me as I don't have a lot of experience in this but I am pretty sure I can pull something together.

That said, what I really lack is material. I am thinking I would like to offer a variety of materials including posters, flyers, pamphlets, etc. covering a range of topics from Humanism FAQs, history, famous Humanists, Humanist contributions' etc.

Consider this a plea to any creative Humanists out there who might be willing to contribute. Be it writing or design, any and all help would be greatly appreciatedand full credit will most certainly be given.

Ideally I would love to have this end up being a crowd-sourced repository with a rating/tagging system in multiple languages, etc. but for now I would be happy to launch with a couple/few pieces to start and work from there to grow it based on its reception. 

If you don't want to contribute, I would also appreciate any input you may have.

I am a feminist.

I believe in egalitarian relationships and marriages.

I support same-sex marriage. (The Baptist church in the city of Clinton, MS where I am a student marries same-sex couples and welcomes them into their congregation.)

I am vehemently against the death penalty.

I do not interpret the Bible literally; it is full of symbolic language. Not only that, but it was written during a time when the world was very different, and what would today be injustices we're considered acceptable by even the people who wrote the Bible.

I do not believe in a literal heaven and hell. In a tiny nutshell, heaven and hell are qualities of living that we are in charge of bringing upon ourselves. You cheat on your partner, sure you're going to be living in a hell on earth, a spiritual darkness. You deny the poor and oppressed, you are going to experience a hell. We've all experienced hell. Heaven is the opposite. You speak for those who have no voice, you promote equality, you feed the poor, help the oppressed, you will experience a spiritual wholeness, a closeness to God— heaven.

God is love. I believe not that God has love or is made of love, but that God IS LOVE. 

Religious diversity makes us all stronger, not weaker.

I believe in science. 

I do not support prayer in public schools.

I believe coexistence is essential. 

I am against war.

I believe in government social welfare programs.

I believe sin is anything that dehumanizes a person, or one's self.

I believe the Bible to contain insight to the nature of God, who is love, as manifested through Jesus of Nazareth, rather than the literal ""word of God."" 

I believe God is everything I listed above. I see God everywhere I see love, help, peace, joy, rest. 

Iit is my duty as a Christian to love the people in the world with the same selfless, sacrificial love in which Jesus loved us. *That* is the essence of the Christian identity. Sadly, we have forgotten that. Many Christians of today are — I have to say it— not real Christians.

I've arrived at my positions not by being lax in my faith as many conservative Christians would accuse me of, but, rather, by digging deeper into the Bible, opening my eyes and ears to the voice and sight of God in the world as manifested through acts of compassion and words of love. It is my duty as a Christian to see that no one is starving, that no one lacks a roof over his or her head, that no one is lonely, that no one is denied equality because of gender or race or sexual orientation or religion, that no one is ever again feels oppressed, and that *everyone* knows what it feels like to be loved. 

*That* is what it means to be a Christian. Not converting people over and condemning people who do not adhere to Biblical laws (which, in reality, would be most Christians out there who deny women positions of leadership in the church and equality at home because Paul says so in the Bible, and then chose to ignore what he says two lines down which is for women to not wear makeup and jewelry and to cover their heads). 

Christianity is about love. And God is love. 

I hope you all have a happy day.     — Benjamin",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,,True,t3_13fv3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/13fv3z/what_it_means_to_be_a_christian/,

A Day Dream

""You work too hard.""

""I have a family to support.""

""Not with this kind of work. This is the worst kind of work. You're not going to get anywhere with this work. Put in your two weeks today and then come work with me. I've seen you here every time I come. You work very hard. I'll give you $10 per hour, profit sharing, and advancement opportunities.""

Her face lights up as she snaps out of her work stupor...


1 year later

She looks much better, healthier, and happier. Thoughtful man has yet to break even from new business, but still pays her as promised. She is extremely grateful and offers to make up the difference. He won't take it. She works extra hard, but now she is happy at work.

5 years later

Company is a successful chain. The women is now an executive, hardly recognizable from today. Her family is doing well. She always remembers the man's strangeness and helps others as he helped her.



Reality

""Can you make change for a $20?""

-she's making change-

""You work too hard.""

""I have to.""

""You need to take a break sometimes."" ::hand her tip::

""For me?""

""I never tipped you before. You've made me like 20 sandwiches. ""

Confused, but smiling. ""Thank you.""

I'm guessing she thinks I want to get into her pants, because no one does anything for other people in her world. Naturally, I must expect something in return.
Truth is, I care because I understand her situation. I won't go into detail. All I can say is no one deserves that fate. 

My day dream is hardly connected to reality, and I may need a slap in the face or two, but I believe that people like the man in my day dream are everywhere.

My friends I would normally call and discuss deep philosophy with are not available... so i figured I would look to the internet for advice and discussion.

So I was raised a Christian and later in life became an atheist.  I studied other religions all through school and learned a lot from their profits and parables on how you should treat others.

I am now running into a problem now of being to caring and to helpful. To where it either puts people off or I get massively used.

This use to not bother me because well... I guess I never really thought about it.  

But now I'm getting ""older"" (26) and getting tired of the same thing over and over.

I don't want to stop caring and I don't want to detach myself from people. But how do you guys deal with everyone always coming to you for help?

""Why did religious moral movements crowd out the
secular ones, such as found in parts of Stoicism and
Confucianism? Experimental evidence suggests that
religious systems are more congruent with intuitions,
because they describe morality in terms ofthe judgments
of superhuman agents who have access to all relevant
information about our actions, and who seem to reason
in ways consistent with our own intuitive psychology. By contrast, non-religious moral movements lack
this compelling connection to intuitions. Indeed, they
engage the kind of analytical, non-intuitive thinking that
diminishes people’s religious commitment in experimental settings.""",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,,True,t3_1f8hjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/1f8hjn/explaining_moral_religions/,

I am a very recent subscriber, exploring the realm of humanism in finding my moral stance in this world. Some branch of humanism I would like to investigate is one of environmental awareness and sustainability. It basically falls on two lines of thought:

1. Future human populations ought to have a good life better or comparable to that we know. 

2. In order to do so, we ought to be wary on how we use our resources and plan for what can be the most sustainable future such that human life can maintain a fairly constant level of success.

I have zip for money or assets, but I am willing to work hard and am (fairly) intelligent. Every government in the world puts human concerns second to nearly everything else, especially money. And I found myself completely unable to function in a capitalistic society. Losing jobs for putting people ahead of the dollar, or simply lacking the capacity to focus on the dollar rather than the goal (I was once fired for putting a contract at risk of being completed early).

I have thought hard about what I could do. I would be willing to make a few unusual sacrifices to have the political power to affect some changes, such as giving up my privacy and making my entire life open to review by everyone via constant survalience, but I have no illusion that would actually work. I am too abrasive, too confrontatinal, and lack the financial backing to ever get any kind of recognition in that arena.

I have thought about abanding this country, and its rotting political system, and trying to start up a school in a third world nation to try and fight illiteracy, but I see that as a long shot at best, never mind the obstacles I face merely escaping this country, surrounded on all sides by ocean and a single neighbor that frowns upon outsiders passing through.

I see capitalism as a blight on our great species, something that only gets in the way of progress as does anything that places value of something above that of humans. Especially since the only way to make enough money to affect genuine changes would neccessarily come at the expense of other people.

So what else can I do? Is there any group in canada I could go work with directly? Or another group or nation I could join without having to content with berueacracy, immigration and other pointless obstacles?

There is a farming town that realizes Earth has been impacted. They have crops and some resources, but are afraid of allowing outsiders into their area and sharing their resources because they know it will be impossible to grow more food or feed their animals. There is a reverend who tells everyone that it would be a against god to turn anyone away and they need to help as many people as they can. But they eventually try to set up road blocks to keep outsiders from getting in. 

So as a humanist what would you do in this situation?

* comet destroys almost everything
* millions are left without resources
* your community has food / shelter / weapons
* have to decide who to accept / turn away
* what about the children?

This is an extreme situation, but we have all seen smaller disasters in our lifetime (I live in Tokyo and was here in March when the tsunami wiped out the north east).

Now, I should preface by saying I don't agree with everything said in this article. I do think there are legitimate concerns with how women/minorities/etc are treated in the larger atheist community and I do think there are problems with some of the assumptions the author makes about the motivations of the feminists mentioned toward the end. What I'm SPECIFICALLY curious about is: the blogger basically says that Humanism encompasses the ideals of ""social justice"" that Atheism+ focuses on, and further seems to claim Humanism does a better job of handling those ideals than Atheism+ does without being as immature or divisive. 

Do you think there is a fundamental difference between Atheism+ and Humanism, and if so, what? Is it the approach? Are there actual differences in the philosophy? Have you run into a lot of bad behavior from Athism+ers or have you more or less gotten along with them? 

On a broader scope, do you think Humanists in general are insensitive to, ""too permissive"" of or blind to bigotry against non-white-males, as is the suggestion of some Atheism+ bloggers? If so, what could be done to give Humanism a social justice facelift? If not, what examples could you offer to refute the claim?

It would be interesting, too, to see how many non-white-male humanists are actually out there. Does anyone have good statistics on that?

I'm a Muslim who believes that religion is something personal and spiritual, and despite the lack of a religion, people such as atheists or agnostics can still derive morality without religion. Ergo, a person can have no religion and still have morals.

I recently got into a open discussion for fun with a Muslim friend about morality and religion. He argued that it's nearly impossible to prove morality using reason and logic alone, and that ""divinely inspired law"" is necessary.

I on the other hand argued that some things in morality are universal and do need a religious justification. Examples include murder, rape, theft, etc. Regardless of whether you follow a religion or not, whether you believe in a God(s) or not, EVERYONE will agree that such things are wrong.

He however argued back that secular humanism and all other related ideologies, not a negative phenomenon, are a recent phenomenon. Thousands of years ago, people from certain societies, empires, and civilizations raped, murdered, and pillaged never thinking it was really wrong. So isn't religion a source of morality?

And for the sake of discussion and Devil's Advocacy, he asked to prove using reason and logic 'Why is it wrong to kill another human being?' 'Why is rape wrong?' 'Why is theft wrong?'

I replied explaining that his questions themselves were somewhat fallacious in nature, and argued using the concept of 'Live and let live,' 'Each to his/her own,' and that anyone can do anything as long as he or she isn't infringing on someone else or physically or mentally harming them.
He asked me why is the line there? How can you use reason and logic to prove that the line exists there?

So basically, I wanted to hear your perspectives and answers to these questions:

* **1.) Why does the line for actions stand at 'Do what you want as long as you aren't harming others or infringing upon them?'**

* **2.) How do you prove this line exists here and is right using logic and reasoning?**

* **3.) In that case, how do you use reason and logic to prove that intentionally killing someone for fun is wrong?**

Just to be clear, we aren't debating whether secular humanism is right or wrong. We are arguing over morality and whether it can be proved using reason or logic, and whether religion is necessary to confirm it. I say that it's not necessary, but it can confirm morality, he argues that without it, morality cannot be reasonably or logically proved.

With that, I look forward to your answers, and look forward to learning more about humanism, and the reason and logic behind moral philosophy myself.

Now, as I understand it, naturalism is a philosophy that completely disregards all that is ""outside our universe"" (i.e. supernatural). I suppose the argument is that this stance is not open enough, that it is logically irresponsible to assume that no supernatural entities exist. I completely agree with this and that's what's been puzzling me- when did we become known for our naturalism?

All of the self-described humanists I've know, who are usually 50+ years old, members of the AHA, etc, seem to have a very agnostic stance as to the existence of any of the supernatural.

1330914006.0,5,self.humanism,qhyih,This cartoon has been bothering me....,Internet_Erasmus,6,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/qhyih/this_cartoon_has_been_bothering_me/,"Here is the image in question:
http://i.imgur.com/cqOZ8.jpg


	I have beef with the above picture. And I've seen it enough times that it's going to bug me if I don't talk about. First lets make an assumption about the picture, this picture is not simply meant to represent to women walking past each other on the street. Its an allegory for two cultures looking at each other over a cultural divide. So when I refer to the woman in the bikini I am talking about American, British, Canadian, or other women in a more or less secular society. When I refer to the Woman in the Hijab I am talking about women in Saudi Arabia or any country were Islam (or any religion really) is enshrined in the law. I don't think it's  that big a leap. Now, on to my beef.
	So one can see that each woman pities the other, one because she sees the other as playing a severely limited role and being denied her full personal and sexual expression. The because she is  being objectified by men and denied an identity outside her sexual identity, which is imposed on her by males anyway. 
	The first thing is something I normally don't get too vocal about because people who aren't me usually get pretty vocal about it first, and they have way more business talking about it than I do(because they are women), but I haven't heard it brought up yet so I'm going to. Female sexuality really shouldn't have only two extremes of slut and ice queen, which is kind of what this cartoon implies. I understand that a cartoon has to punchy and clever, but would it kill the cartoonist to draw a moderate figure in the back ground? Would that destroy the message of the cartoon?
	Now then, on to my real problem with this cartoon. The woman in the bikini can probably go home, throw on a hijab and go about her day. Her friends might find it a bit odd, but none the less she can do it if she wants to. The woman in the hijab cannot go home and put on her with out facing serious trouble from the authorities, at least in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Here is the meat of my beef.  I am not going to pretend that the woman in the bikini doesn't have to deal with some elements of a     greatly weakened patriarchy, but the woman in the hijab has elements of fairly healthy patriarchy enshrined in law in two countries that I know of.  Also, the woman in the Bikini can drive a car if she wants, unlike women in Saudi Arabia. So this is not simply a matter of perspective. It's a matter of the role that legally enshrined cultural and religious taboos play in shaping the lives of women (and men, but they aren't in this cartoon) in a given society. 
	Finally I am aware that some countries have banned the wearing of face coverings when getting government I.D, entering public buildings, etc. France and Belgium spring to mind, and I think Holland has or is debating something similar. Canada forces people to take off face coverings when taking the oath of citizenship. The French and Belgian (and maybe Dutch) laws are against overt religious symbols so you can't wear you're giant rosary in a public place either, but you can do what ever you want in your private life, and a government asking that your face be uncovered for an identification card is really not unreasonable.

Apparently, one driver saw the other one stuck, and then he turned his car awkwardly and dangerously to help. The two drivers were of different races, and their dress suggested dramatically different socioeconomic classes.
This being the place it is, odds are that the one guy probably grew up being steeped in stories such as the Good Samaritan and the notion that serving a random stranger is like serving Jesus and being Jesus all in one. For a second there, I actually thought to myself, ""Thank goodness for Christianity. Sort of.""
Now, it isn't every church that stresses the social gospel--others ignore it, and a conspicuous minority even espouses the opposite. Moreover, humanity is not a religious concept. Certain organizations, clubs, families, and individuals make it their mission to propagate kindness.
But many--particularly in this neck of the woods--are drilled by their religion into believing that you should almost reflexively help when someone needs it, whether it's the ""holy spirit"" acting through you, you're bearing the good fruits, sharing the love of God in action, or whatever.
My question: Can humanity (a society, a government, a club, whatever), through some institution (school, maybe, but not chuch), instill in people the habit of being nice and helpful as a reflex? I'm not talking about altruism in general; it's simple enough to join a group that does good things, such as Red Cross or United Way. I'm talking about the kind of altruism that affects how we interact with the people we encounter on the road, in the grocery store, on the street, etc.

Very recently, while having a conversation with a very good friend, I was somewhat accused of being a narcissist because I stated that I like to do good and be good because it feels good. I was taken aback for two reasons - one, because I somewhat understand his point. Am I the way I am because I benefit from it? I've always thought of the feeling that comes from knowing that you tried to avoid inflicting pain/hurt/sadness/confrontation/drama unto others as a sort of automatic reward, and I've never really had any reason to feel guilty about it until he said that. The second reason, which is somewhat related to the first, is because I really do go out of my way to be as polite or thoughtful or not malicious as often as I possibly can. This is bothersome to me because I always put an emphasis on sincerity and being genuine. Does the fact that effort is involved in being and doing good mean I'm not good at all? Am I, in fact, a bit of a phony? The very thing that I dislike about others? Any input would be great. Thanks for your time, busy humanists!

1353634484.0,4,self.humanism,13na18,"The Case for Thanksgiving, or the Problem with Holidays [warning: 1000+ word essay]",iyunkateus,5,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/13na18/the_case_for_thanksgiving_or_the_problem_with/,"**Thanksgiving.** As I read the posts people make about it, I see that opinions about it vary widely. It is no doubt often used as a vector to transmit a myth of the greatness of the European settlers of the Americas, ignoring the myriad atrocities they committed against the Native Americans. It is no doubt celebrated by many in a shallow and insincere way, affecting attitudes for the remainder of the year exactly none. It no doubt offers a cruel irony in the form of Black Friday, in which, as an image I've seen shared states aptly, ""people trample each other for sales exactly one day after being thankful for what they already have.""

﻿However, it's interesting to note, Thanksgiving is really no different from other holidays in this respect. One may groan to consider the images of church leaders preaching about the ""real meaning of Christmas"" this conjures up, but each holiday can be a meaningful celebration with an intelligent and thoughtful interpretation. The presence of the 90% that Sturgeon's Law dictates obscures, but doesn't obliterate the potential quality 10% that remains. It's tempting to dismiss holidays out of hand, as perhaps meaningless superstition further corrupted by rabid consumerism.

Though the 90% of Thanksgiving is the most readily visible, be it in the propagation of self-congratulatory myths, the incessant repetition of ""I'm thankful for this ﻿﻿**food**!"" and similar statements failing spectacularly to be humorous by virtue of their exuberant display of a lack of any attempt to thoughtfully consider the meaning of the holiday, or the momentarily pardoned gluttony of the Thanksgiving meal, for those willing to search for it, the 10% is there, at the very core of the concept of Thanksgiving. The core purpose of Thanksgiving is, as the name would seem to indicate, to be an occasion to give thanks for the many gifts of fortune we all possess, regardless of our perceived misfortune. The most obvious is the mere fact of being alive. I'll hand this one off to the late, great Carl Sagan:

&gt;*Every cell is a triumph of natural selection, and we're made of trillions of cells. We are, each of us, a multitude. Within us is a little universe.*

﻿Like all good messages, the message at the core of Thanksgiving is rife with potential for corruption. It is important to recognize the duality of the human condition: we are all capable of both great good and great evil. But Thanksgiving is not a time to excuse injustices. It is not a time to become complacent, to abandon the great human ambition that is the driving force behind every major advance and change across all of history. Thanksgiving is, in its purest form, a time to recognize what is really important, and to face the great truth that all things, great and small, are only temporary, and knowing this, to appreciate the things we have.

So this Thanksgiving, I'd like to offer, as many choose to do on this day, an overview of some of the things I'm most thankful for.

**I'm thankful for my existence.** I'm not thanking anyone in particular for this (except perhaps my biological parents, as the humans most directly responsible for it); as a Humanist, I don't believe in any supernatural consciousness or deity that could receive my expression of gratitude. I merely recognize the uncommon nature of consciousness, and how amazing it is to even exist at all, to be able to write these words.  
﻿**I'm thankful for my friends**, because, as the philosopher Aristotle remarked, ""without friends, no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods."" That the human is a social animal is certainly a fact. Where a single person may falter, friends provide the inspiration to carry on in worthy endeavors.  
**I'm thankful for humanity in general.** Though, as I've noted before, humans are capable of both great good and great evil, the potential for good is in all of us, if only we allow it to manifest itself. And to once again quote Carl Sagan:

&gt;*The cosmos is also within us. We're made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.﻿*

﻿**I'm thankful for the Internet.** ﻿It may seem strange in a list consisting largely of abstract ideas, but the Internet is a realization of one such idea. We live in the first time in history when, though certainly not *all*﻿ of the world, much of the world is connected through a system that allows information to traverse the entire globe in a matter of minutes or even seconds. The ubiquity of access to this amazing compendium of knowledge from all across the world has played a key role in the formation of my worldview and in my growth as a human being.  
**I'm thankful for books.** Libraries were the original Internet. In the words of Carl Sagan, who, as you might have guessed by now, is one of my major idols:

&gt;*What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.*

**I'm thankful for language itself.** Be it in books, verbal conversations, music, or anything else, language is a mechanism by which an idea is transferred from one mind to another. Effective communication vanquishes ignorance, questions assumptions, and can even change the world. Edward Bulwer-Lytton was right to state that ""beneath the rule of men entirely great / The pen is mightier than the sword.""  
And finally, though a list like this could never be complete, **I'm thankful for Humanism.** Humanism, without requiring any supernatural beliefs, affirms the inherent dignity of every human being. Humanism recognizes the dual potential for both good and evil in every person, and realizes the importance of striving for the good, lest the evil take root and rule our lives. And my Humanism, though it's arguable whether this is true for Humanism in general, is accepting of other beliefs. So long as a belief does no harm, I'm okay with it. One last Carl Sagan quote for good measure:

&gt;*If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.*

The works of Chris Stedman and others have helped me to realize that Humanists must reach across the divide and work with like-minded religious people to make a difference and recognize our common humanity. And that's what Humanism is all about.

So from one human being to another, happy Thanksgiving.

The following is the text of the [Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.org/), a document created by British author and religious thinker Karen Armstrong, starting a campaign of the same name. The official website of the campaign is [here](http://charterforcompassion.org/).

~

**[The Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.org/the-charter/#charter-for-compassion)**

**The principle of compassion** lies at the heart of all religious, ethical and spiritual traditions, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves. Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the centre of our world and put another there, and to honour the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.

**It is also necessary** in both public and private life to refrain consistently and empathically from inflicting pain. To act or speak violently out of spite, chauvinism, or self-interest, to impoverish, exploit or deny basic rights to anybody, and to incite hatred by denigrating others - even our enemies - is a denial of our common humanity. We acknowledge that we have failed to live compassionately and that some have even increased the sum of human misery in the name of religion.

**We therefore call upon all men and women** ~ to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion ~ to return to the ancient principle that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, hatred or disdain is illegitimate ~ to ensure that youth are given accurate and respectful information about other traditions, religions and cultures ~ to encourage a positive appreciation of cultural and religious diversity ~ to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all human beings, even those regarded as enemies.

**We urgently need** to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensible to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,human,True,t3_r689b,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/r689b/the_charter_for_compassion_xpost_from/,

With a pretty split Congress, the crazy parts about Ron Paul that I hate, wouldn't have gotten through, while the President does have a lot of say in foreign policy, the drug war, and civil liberties.

I feel Obama is hardly better (if at all) than Romney on most humanitarian issues (foreign policy, drug war, civil liberties). I give him credit on Obamacare and the environment, but even on Obamacare he failed to fully deliver the single payer system he promised. My biggest beef is that he caves in to special interests and doesn't keep campaign promises. Especially the ones about supporting the middle class (Why did he pass all this corporate welfare!? Extending the Bush tax cuts?) I actually hate him for pretending to be the champion of the middle class this election after failing them so badly in office.

1. MOST IMPORTANTLY, women don't owe you sexual favors in exchange for you being a decent human being. Learn how to be friends with a girl without expecting her to get you off.

2. If you do expect sexual favors in exchange for being a ""nice guy"", you're not actually that nice, are you? In fact, you're an asshole.

3. Why do you assume she doesn't want to sleep with you because you're ""nice"" (see point 2)? Maybe you're just unattractive. Maybe you smell weird. Get over yourself.

4. Getting ""friendzoned"", believe it or not, is actually a compliment. It means she wants to be friends with you and doesn't expect anything sexual in return. You could learn from her.

As one example, the FAQ over at [Atheism Plus](http://atheismplus.com/) states:

&gt;Humanism has a rich tradition of promoting ethical living, but many people interested in changing minds find that it does not adequately stress the reality that there are almost certainly no gods and that this is almost certainly the only world in which we will ever exist.

I suppose this is a valid criticism, although it's not one that matters all that much to me for exploring and articulating my own lifestance. I've also heard people worry that Humanism sounds too anthropocentric.  Has anyone come across any other criticisms of Humanism, or do you have any yourselves?

I would like to let you know that I appreciate humanism as a nonreligious organization and celebrate its existence as a movement that promotes justice and peace. I would like to one day see humanism and Christianity work together for the cause of what we share (or are supposed to share) in common: doing justice. 

I apologize to you on behalf of my Christian sisters and brothers if you have ever felt judged or condemned because you do not share the same views as them. Such judgment and hostility is entirely unchristian. I love the people in your community, not despite the fact that I am Christian, but because of it. 

And... historically-rooted contemporary Baptists and humanists probably have more in common than one would think: belief in science (imagine that!), feminism, affirmation of homosexuality, knowledge of historical contexts in which the Bible was written, freedom of thought, use of reason, and an understanding that humanity is on a slow journey to discover the truth using reason and intellect (and add for us, prayer). I think together we have come to understand the truth that justice, love and compassion are what we should be focusing on here.

Have a nice day. --Benjamin",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,1375208590.0,,,True,t3_1jbzwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/1jbzwg/a_word_from_a_baptist/,

This review is for: [The Good Book: A Humanist Bible (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Book-Humanist-Bible/dp/0802717373/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp)

----------------------------------------------------

I bought this book with no expectations. I had read an article about it, as an atheist I liked the idea and wanted to support Grayling's work so I bought it. I really was pleasantly surprised.

This book is not a compilation of work. You will not open it up and find passages from various works called out by author. It is truly written in the style of the Bible - Grayling has taken the collected wisdom of hundreds of secular philosophers and melded it together in the flowery prose form typical of the Bible. There is no reference list at the back to tell you where anything came from, he has taken the ideas and the texts and melted them together.

The Good Book begins with Genesis, where you can see the ideas of Darwin laid out in an inspirational way. Reading through this I was really pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. I'm used to this language being peppered with things I don't believe in, and listening to it at weddings or funerals generally gives me a lump in my stomach. Here was the same kind of lofty language, but saying the things I believed! I didn't realize how much I would enjoy hearing Darwin's theory of evolution told as a beautiful story of how we began and the cycle of life.

As you make your way though the book, you can clearly see where he has incorporated Plato's dialogs, but without specific references. Characters are mentioned in the same way as the Bible, introduced without preamble, just snippets of conversation or story which attempt to showcase an idea. There are passages on grief and death as well.

If you are looking to learn the works of these philosophers in an intellectual way, this is not the book for you. This book is meant to absorb the ideas they upheld in a more spiritual feeling way. I wish this book had been published before I got married, I would have looked for a passage from it to read at my wedding. I could see reading it at a funeral, there really is something cathartic about having grief and death and moving on with life written in this way.

I feel in some ways as an Atheist this may have been what I was missing and didn't realize it. I didn't have anything to help me find a way to feel good about my place in nature's greater story, I just felt the absence of the belief in an afterlife. I also feel like this is a book I could read to my kids to help them figure out how to be a good person in a world which is not always good and in which you cannot rely on an all powerful being to save you from your problems. The language is flowery and poetic, but it's also much more accessible than say Kant's Metaphysics of Morals. I minored in philosophy in college, I'm by no means an expert, but I have read some of these works and they are by no means easy to absorb.

So, I think for what this book is trying to accomplish, what it says it is in the description, it is a great work. ",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,,True,t3_11k87m,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/11k87m/an_atheists_review_of_the_good_book_a_humanists/,

Before humans developed language as a way to reproduce concepts, knowledge died with its owner. Pythagoras figured out that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, and he told someone who told someone who extended the idea a little bit, who told someone who told someone who taught my computer science course.

Due to pressure to improve over time, 21st-century worldviews are more advanced than any have ever been before. Our system is called logic; parts of it include science and math. This system makes sense to a degree that no prior system or system of systems has, in terms of scope and internal consistency. The entire world agrees on this system (jungle-dwellers excluded).

You should learn algorithms. That's what thought is: a sequence of well-defined steps. A procedure operating over a list should be able to handle an empty list.

The world is made of concepts. Concepts are caused by the world. The brain exists in the mind as one of many things that the mind thinks exist. The mind exists in the brain as intersecting hierarchies of categorization/classification. Somewhere along the line, due to language, a grey organ made of neural circuits developed the concept ""grey organ made of neural circuits"". Things went meta.

Have you ever noticed how similar 'thing' is to 'think'? When your brain interprets speech, it acts as though you were moving your own tongue and throat to say what you heard said. Words are represented in the brain as sequences of mouth movements. And 'thing' and 'think' are vocally the same word, except for one voicing distinction on the last consonant.

Everyone else has a world in their head, too! You'll usually find that inconsistencies between your world and someone else's, and elsewhere in your world (because when you're understanding someone else, it's unavoidably you doing the understanding, and you only ever have access to the world you know) can be fixed. You can usually think up a unifying explanation that accounts for everything you think is true.",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,,True,t3_10xe4h,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/10xe4h/the_human_experience_understanding/,

What I need to fund the group are at least 4 other people and a piece of writing outlining what we are about. Oh, and a name.


I'm not looking for anything specific - I'm just very much on my own with this, so I thought I'd ask if anybody has experience with founding and/or running a student group, and if there are any pitfalls I should be aware of. Anything is appreciated, even if it's just kind words of motivation ;)

I was adopted from birth and I am so grateful for my birth-mom and I know she was willing to make the sacrifice for me.  I would plead with women who are considering abortions to accept the responsibility and at least bare the baby for 9 months until they can give it up for adoption.

As far as I'm aware there are more couples trying to adopt than children being adopted.  I personally never felt like I had issues because I was adopted (although my adoption is very open, which is not always the case).

In the end, although I wish that mothers would consider adoption over abortion I always end up agreeing that it is their decision and I can't control that.

Humanism seems to seek to give people tools to think about things objectively, and through that to limit or ideally end inequality and unnecessary human suffering, e.g. through the condemnation of genocide. 

However I find myself often considering Buddhist philosophies in the context of humanism because in my mind they tend to seek to eliminate the root causes of human suffering, the kind of suffering that happens regardless of quality of life, the kind of suffering that prevents people from reaching the top of Maslow's(?) pyramid of needs. 

In turn this suffering causes more suffering usually through some sort of desire, or mutually playing into societal norms in order to ""fit"" and be ""happy"". To me this sort of ""education"" does not seem to be really a part of the Humanist life stance, but based on the declaration (included bellow for reference), it should be based on ""Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion"", and ""a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible fulfilment"" (paragraphs 7 and 9 respectively), but I have yet to hear it addressed?

How do you personally deal with this ""rift""? Are individuals left without guidance to deal with these problems? I understand that there isn't one ""dogma""/solution for this problem, but I find it oddly absent from any of the literature that I have read, and seems that every other religion tries to address this problem of emptiness, of desire etc. 

*Amsterdam Declaration*


Amsterdam Declaration 2002

Humanism is the outcome of a long tradition of free thought that has inspired many of the world's great thinkers and creative artists and gave rise to science itself.

The fundamentals of modern Humanism are as follows:

Humanism is ethical. It affirms the worth, dignity and autonomy of the individual and the right of every human being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights of others. Humanists have a duty of care to all of humanity including future generations. Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic part of human nature based on understanding and a concern for others, needing no external sanction.

Humanism is rational. It seeks to use science creatively, not destructively. Humanists believe that the solutions to the world's problems lie in human thought and action rather than divine intervention. Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare. But Humanists also believe that the application of science and technology must be tempered by human values. Science gives us the means but human values must propose the ends.

Humanism supports democracy and human rights. Humanism aims at the fullest possible development of every human being. It holds that democracy and human development are matters of right. The principles of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human relationships and are not restricted to methods of government.

Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility. Humanism ventures to build a world on the idea of the free person responsible to society, and recognises our dependence on and responsibility for the natural world. Humanism is undogmatic, imposing no creed upon its adherents. It is thus committed to education free from indoctrination.

Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion. The world's major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for all time, and many seek to impose their world-views on all of humanity. Humanism recognises that reliable knowledge of the world and ourselves arises through a continuing process. of observation, evaluation and revision.

Humanism values artistic creativity and imagination and recognises the transforming power of art. Humanism affirms the importance of literature, music, and the visual and performing arts for personal development and fulfilment.

Humanism is a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible fulfilment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living and offers an ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges of our times. Humanism can be a way of life for everyone everywhere.
Our primary task is to make human beings aware in the simplest terms of what Humanism can mean to them and what it commits them to. By utilising free inquiry, the power of science and creative imagination for the furtherance of peace and in the service of compassion, we have confidence that we have the means to solve the problems that confront us all. We call upon all who share this conviction to associate themselves with us in this endeavour.

I feel as if humanity is missing something big, HUGE even. Humans just seem weak to me, pit us against a bear, shark, even a dog with no modern technology or help, just a naked human vs. an animal much simpler than us and you'd die in most cases.

I think we need to unlock something that our bodies can do, a hidden potential no-one has reached yet. It could be some-what of a super power like telekinesis, levitation, ability to alter our environment with just ourselves and mind NOT super strength and physical attributes just mind. We are so complex and the sheer complexity of the human just baffles me and makes me wonder why can't one of our billions of cells do anything spectacular. Admit it telekinesis would actually make life extremely easy but has the potential to be misused of course but our world would adapt to that and find a way to stop these people in the right manner.

Healing is one, we can heal ourselves if damage is not great but that's already one step closer to being a super healer or invincible even. Drugs can give you this sense so maybe they get us closer to that special potential? Ive heard people say they feel as if they can rush through hallways at immense speeds when on mushrooms. I know its just a drug altering but why does it give this feeling? Surely there is a reason it could make you feel like anything but everyone I know says the same thing, super speed.

Mary Jane unlocks our mind in most cases giving wide spread imagination and though from my experience and many others I'm sure you've heard of, Catch my drift?

Now besides drugs sure we maybe able to do these ourselves they may just be an ""aid"" to help out before we can really do them ourselves. 

Now imagine this, a biomass that is linked to our minds that can be put into objects so that we can control them just like limb. That is being really scientific though, I like the idea of begin able to use your potential no matter what, just a matter of concentration, thought and will power. 

Anyone have anything else to add to my theory? We always imagine these things so why not be able to do them? Natural magnets, and the earth have some what of a super sense to them so why don't we a product of the the same source that the earth was made from.
