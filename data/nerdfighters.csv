I, like John and probably 85% of all people, am a chronic pizza eater. Obviously I didn't end up weighing 280 pounds just because of pizza. I drink a lot of pop and eat a lot of food that is so bad for me it's unbelievable. It doesn't help that I'm forced to eat at the dining centers on my campus, but even when there are healthy options, I always end up reaching for the pizza. 

Anyways, I have put my pizza John shirt which is 3 sizes too small (I wear a 3XL. The shirt is a Large) on the head of my chair as a constant reminder that things have to change. With John's cold, dead eyes ever staring at me, mocking me with the notion of pizza until the day when I can comfortably put him on my chest, I think I'll be able to achieve my goal. 

tl;dr Pizza John will stare at me until I lose weight. 

edit: I thought I posted a picture with this. Here he is just staring at me with his eyes as black as night:

I'm a substitute teacher and I have two week placement at a high school and they're (supposed to be) reading The Great Gatsby. The teacher left me lesson plans and such, but I really wanted to show them John's Crash Course video on Gatsby because I felt it was more informational and educational than just watching the movie (that was the plan). So Friday, instead of starting with the film, I started with the Crash Course video, had a discussion and then watched The Great Gatsby movie. 

After the Crash Course video a couple students asked me who the guy talking was and I explained to them who John Green was and some of his books. Some seemed interested, but being teenagers who hate reading I didn't expect much after that. 

Fast forward to yesterday and a student came up to me before class and said she bought TFIOS after school and finished it that weekend. She said it was one of the best books she's ever read and she's never cried and laughed so much from the book. I felt awesome after that and I hope she continues reading and maybe even joins the Nerdfighting community. This is why I want to teach, to make an impact on student's lives and have them enjoy literature. And to educate our future I guess. 

Best wishes everyone. 

TL;DR I told a student about John Green after watching Crash Course and they read TFIOS that weekend because they're made of awesome like all of us :D",,False,self,t5_2rocp,False,,,True,t3_17hswh,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/17hswh/turning_students_into_nerdfighters/,

My name is Emily, and I'm posting today to beg you to help my mother. She is very sick, and is in desperate need of sinus surgery. Her insurance has gotten incredibly expensive, deductible wise, and there's no way I can come up with the cost of it. The doctor is refusing to perform the surgery without upfront payment, and unfortunately my credit isn't good enough to take out a loan.

In the last two years, she's had a half dozen surgeries and proceedures already for her various pain conditions, and my budget is 100% tapped. I'm doing everything I can just to keep us afloat. I'm asking for help in raising $2,500 for the surgery, medication, and replacement parts for her BiPAP (hose and mask are infected). 

I'm not asking you to personally donate, though any donates would be greatly appreciated. I'm here to ask you to spread the word. Pass it on to friends and family. Post it on Facebook. Tweet it on Twitter. Do what you can do to make sure the world knows.

The Indiegogo campaign is located here: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-price-of-a-steady-breath/x/3279480 

Please, my mother's infection has been untreated for almost six months now. She's getting weaker and I'm afraid of what is going to happen if she doesn't get medical attention with it soon. Since it isn't a well-known lethal condition like Cancer, there's really no where to turn to raise funds.

Hopefully Yours,
Emily",,False,self,t5_2rocp,False,,,True,t3_1ebs1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1ebs1e/calling_all_nerdfighters_to_help_me_save_a_life/,

I'm a longtime Nerdfighter, LGBTQ activist, graphic designer and English nerd. Some combination of these things brought me to conclude that ""That's so gay"" needs to vacate the English-speaking vocabulary for good, and that I want to help make that happen. So, I created this [design for t-shirts and posters](http://www.indiegogo.com/thats-so-not-gay?a=982751), and I've started a [campaign on IndieGogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/thats-so-not-gay?a=982751) (like Kickstarter, only it doesn't discriminate against Canada!) to try to collect enough preorders that getting this project out in the real world won't make me broke.

That's where you guys come in. If you could take the time to draw a rainbow and write your name and where you're from on it (city, country, anything is fine!) and mail it to the address in this facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/MarandasRainbowConnection it would mean the world to me, and would definitely increase the amount of awesome in this little girl's life. Also if you know anyone who would be up for mailing one as well, feel free to spread it around! We want to get rainbows from as much of the world as possible.

I'm currently writing my master thesis about participation and culture in online communities, and decided to do a case study about Nerdfighteria.

I chose this community because I believe there is a lot to learn from its unique history and dynamics. Nerdfighteria has shown time and again that it is capable of reaching great goals, and I think it is important to explore and understand *how* it does so. With that in mind, I prepared a survey that inquires about Nerdfighter culture and Nerdfighters' participatory behavior in order to better understand the inner workings of this community... And now I need YOUR help.

If you watch Vlogbrothers' videos and consider yourself a Nerdfighter (or not!), please take the time to take my survey. It takes around 15-20 minutes to fill out, and you would be helping me out enormously.

Once I finish my study, I will be sure to share my findings on Tumblr (sittingonanmm.tumblr.com).

Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about the questionnaire or my research at all.

Thank you all so much, and DFTBA!!!

You might remember a post I submitted a few months ago showcasing a tool I created to fight depression.  The tool, a website called [TheWorstFeelingInTheWorld.com](http://www.theworstfeelingintheworld.com), was something I created to combat my own depression.  Basically, the tool is an empathy engine.  Users post their lowest, most depressing moments, in order to remind all of the readers of the site that even when one is sad, he or she is never alone.  The ad revenue generated by the site is, after cost of hosting in covered, donated to local suicide hotlines in my area.

I checked my google analytics page for the site recently, and was greeted by [this](http://i.imgur.com/g1yY2aW.png).  Nearly 7,000 of you viewed the site more than 50,000 times, and you have submitted almost [1,000 times](http://theworstfeelingintheworld.com/quotes.js).

I'm nearly in tears.  You guys are wonderful goddamn people, and I'm so glad I could create something that some of you found useful.  Nerdfighters really don't ever FTBA.

Thanks for everything, you're incredible and I love you all to death.

My name is Shawn - I'm @uncultured on Twitter and UnculturedProject on YouTube.

If you know me and follow-me on Twitter or Facebook, you know today in particular I've been dealing with some massive parental rejection and heartbreak because I [recently came out as gay](http://www.queerty.com/watch-bangladesh-activist-comes-out-in-live-web-stream-20130102). This post is **not** about that. But if you have questions, I suppose I could answer them in the comments below.

I'm asking for your help trying to take my work to the next level. It's work that, with the help of Nerdfighters, has [provided a clean water system to a village](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJubQzKYMGg), [provided emergency relief during a disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kJEGvY6_QY), [helped to rebuild a school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dsjtJMqsE), [helped minority groups victimized by Muslim extremists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzi2BNkyq7s), [helped over 10,000 children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50dnGnoj6A),[ provided 10,000 pounds of food to those in need in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaPyP2tsmwg), and (recently) built [a school named after John Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHBkNN7gNIQ).

This work - all of it in it's entirety - has been nominated for a Webby Award. Nomination doesn't mean I've won anything though. There are two prizes that will be awards: a judge's prize and the People's Choice. I'll be honest: I got no shot at the judge's prize. All the other nominees are well-funded organizations or corporations with staff and production teams and have all the stuff I wish I had. My only shot at winning is through the People's Choice award. Which is entirely vote based. 

That's why I'm asking for help.

Hank Green, Michael Buckley, and Tyler Oakley helped me take the lead. I was at 60% because of them. But my well-funded competitors are running a well-staffed campaign to rally votes. And my support dropped nearly in half. EffYeahNerdfighters helped it get back up to 55%, but it's dropping again. Voting doesn't end until the 25th of April and without all the help I can get I am not sure I can win this.

It would mean a lot to me - both personally and for the future of my work - if I can call my work a Webby Award winner. Previous winners have included Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Wikipedia, and Skype. So this is a big deal. They call it The Oscars of the Internet. 

You can vote [here](http://dft.ba/-webbyvote). But this is important: **it's not one click.**

You actually have to click ""Vote"" multiple times, login (using Twitter, or Facebook, or Google+, or email), click to confirm. Only when you see the percentages of each nominee has your vote gone through. My friend Jory Caron explains it in a YouTube video which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbU46EEhqV0&amp;list=UUG6P2bQZ-8gkdEQpaIc2KZA&amp;index=2). And, if you've vote already, would you please consider voting this up so others who haven't can see this? 

Best Wishes from Bangladesh - I'll see you in the comments below,

-Shawn

**tl;dr** - *Please [vote](http://dft.ba/-WebbyVote) for UnculturedProject in the Webby Awards. Voting needs a login and you have to click vote multiple times. Only when you see percentages and whose in the lead has your vote gone through.*",,False,self,t5_2rocp,1366317575.0,,,True,t3_1cmodz,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1cmodz/asking_for_help_from_rnerdfighters/,

I'm part of a team of international volunteers trying to translate Crash Course subtitles into a bunch of different languages to make them accessible to more people (because they're awesome and not everyone speaks English that well). We currently have teams for Danish, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish (eta: that doesn't mean we don't need more translators for these, we do!), and single volunteers for Arabic, Dutch, French and some other languages, but any language is welcome.

You don't need translation or proofreading experience; you don't need to be a native speaker (to translate, proofreaders have to be native speakers), and you can take as much time to translate or proofread your video as you need. And if you end up not being able to finish, no biggy, just hand it over to someone else :) (so basically: no pressure). We also have a bunch of experienced translators and proofreaders happy to help out any newbies with questions or problems.

So basically, if you speak a second language besides English well enough, and have some time to spare, we'd be very happy to have you on board :). Sign-up link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11jnmE8a0vIr1Q3soN0KSQpRLmd-jSyQeiGyULVMnEPA/viewform


ETA: Great to see so many people have signed up already (yay). I'm going to wait another day so I can process most of the sign-ups in one go. Expect an email on Sunday at the latest :)

He references a picture on his wall called ""Leonardo's Leonardo"" and a TON of people jumped on there to comment that the red mask is Raphael. Here is the item in question: 

http://i.imgur.com/X7Yg1v5.jpg

Here's the knowledge grenade: The original comic run of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had all of the Ninja Turtles in red masks (technically they were all in grey masks as the original, original run wasn't in color). Quite accurately it would just be Leonardo's Ninja Turtle since all of the weapons are shown, but Leonardo's Leonardo isn't ""wrong"".

Hello NerdFighters, Nerds, Nerdians and whatever else may be hiding on our site, a little moment of your time, if you will. 
It's been brought to our attention that one of the profile questions is rather.. well, limited. With all the identities in our sexuality, can we really confine it too the two bracket system? Lords know, people would have a fit if this were to be kept as such in public sector on forms and so on. 
So! As of the next thirty six hours, we've introduced a change that will add 'Other' to the mix. You can pick, Male, female or other. Why other? Well, there is so much to chose from in this day and age, if we were to include every single group, we'd be out of our minds. Other is simpler and easier. 
What this changes means, is that all of our gender questions will be reset - or so I'm led to believe from my control station -. Again, in the next thirty six or so hours, this will be rolled out and everyone will have to re-pick their gender. 
Now, while some members may have an issue with this, please keep it civil on the site. We'd hate to have to deal with any trouble user because we're trying to make this community even more open and welcoming than it already is. 
Best wishes,
The NerdFighter Ning staff

&gt; 16. This man was once run down by a car driven by Rikishi. He is not Mongo McMichael, but this man was once married to Debra Marshall, who accused him of domestic abuse. This man once attacked Santino
Marella for mocking his movie The Condemned. His entrance features the sound of glass breaking, and he celebrates victories by chugging beer in the ring. This athlete’s finishing move is called the “Stunner,” and he once fired a toy gun at Vince McMahon that read “Bang! 3:16,” a reference to one of his catch phrases. For the point, name this wrestler known as “Stone Cold.”

So in this format, one can answer anytime during the question, but nobody in my room did - after all, who expected a wrestling question? But after the last two words, I buzzed in. Steve Austin? Correct.

""So bobidou23 obviously knows his wrestling,"" said the moderator. Ha.

recently, I have realized how inactive I am. Just the other day, I watch two seasons of community - not getting up once. 

So I decided to change that and start do excise. But it wasn't that easy. It was actually real hard. I didn't want to - I much prefer sitting in front of the computer. So I looked for motivation and when to Tumblr. 

 I was horrified by what I found. It wasn't cute pictures and motivational quotes. It was thinspiration and weightbashing - NOT HEALTHY. It wasn't about the work out, it was about losing weight. 

So this is what I want to do, make a healthy blog (or vlog if anyone wants to) that is about movement and active - not reaching a number. 

I want to get 2 to 8 people paired up - we would all have a tumblr and posted activities we have done. 

But heres the catch - so it's for one month at a time. For every hour one person works out/ does activity - the other person does a 1/2 hour. at the end of the month it switches. 

Activity can be biking, running, jogging, swimming, walking - movement. The idea is to get away from the screens and get your body to move. 

Anyone want to give it a go?

TL:DR I want to create a niche on the internet that is about movement - not reaching a number of lbs. Let's get up and go play!",,False,self,t5_2rocp,False,,,True,t3_1k12lo,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1k12lo/inactivity_among_teens_i_need_some_nerdfighters/,

However I feel like they avoid talking specifically about controversial topics like politics, religion, sex and drugs. I know that Hank kind of gets fired up on Hankschannel and he talks more in depth about things that might possibly piss people off (see his Adblock rant) but John seems to steer clear of it all.

It even seemed like coming out and saying that they support gay marriage was them testing the waters. Obviously I understand that they are both christians and they don't really want to be politicised because they might lose viewers or offend some people but I think that many people would actually want to see what their views are on some controversial topics.

So, without further ado: Lets use this thread to suggest some 'controversial' topics for these guys to cover.

- Julian Assange, terrorist or media champion

- Was the War on Terror justified?

- Opinion/information on The War on Drugs

- Are the Tea Party crazy?

- The Westboro Baptist Church

- Opinion on pornography

Might add some more soon when I think of them.

So I've been watching Hank and John since late 2007 and I have the highest opinion of both the two of them and also this entire amazing community. Just finally got a reddit account this week and hopped over to this subreddit right away.

So here's the thing. I find myself, after reading comments on the videos and seeing videos of groups of nerdfighers meeting the Greens, creating a certain image of what a nerdfighter is. I don't like that I'm doing this! Basically I imagine a sort of quirky, goofy kind of girl who struggles to connect with boys and probably loves Harry Potter a lot. This among a lot of unnecessary assumptions I seem to make. 

This is a problem for me for a few reasons. 1. Anyone can be a nerdfighter and it's super silly to think everyone in this community is the same. 2. Because I'm not really like that, I find myself not feeling as much a part of the community as I could be simply because I have a dumb notion that I won't particularly click with a lot of nerdfighters.

SO my solution is this. I'd love for you all to just tell me about yourselves. Even if what I described is you, I still wanna learn about you. I really wanna let myself get involved with everyone and everything and I feel the more I understand how truly diverse this great group of awesome people is the more I can contribute to it.

So I recently started dating this girl who I've gotten to know really well and see she's amazing. Really the whole package. She's the one who made me a nerdfighter and I wanted to do something huge for her to show her how awesome I think she is. I decided to make it my mission to show her I'd put in the effort to contact John Green and surprise her with something from him. 

I sent the following message to him:

Hi there Mr. Green!

My name is **** **** as I'm hoping was clear through my Facebook name. So before September 2012, I had no clue who you were, what the vlogbrothers were, and I assumed a Nerdfighter was a new term for ""bully"". I started dating a Nerdfighter in September (officially in October) and suddenly, she brought me into the vlogbrothers world! I originally started watching your stuff (Crash Course, Swindon Town swoodilypoopers etc.) to impress her but I genuinely love it now. It's one of those things that grew on me just as she did. She's an amazing girl, beautiful, smart, silly, and she's my Yeti.

""Why are you telling me this ******?"" That's next!

I know you're a busy guy but she loves your books, and due to her fantastic memory for books, music, and fun facts, she can quote your novels like there's no tomorrow.

I was wondering if you could find some time to write something out for her though. A short story, a letter, a text, anything really! You wouldn't believe how amazing a smile looks on her face (I could send you a picture, though that's a weird kind of pen pal), and something sent from you would put her on the moon.

I understand that you can't just do this for everyone who asks, you'd never have anytime for yourself. So why for me? I thought about it and what's gonna set my request apart is that I'm not asking for something in exchange for nothing. I'd like you to issue me a challenge in return. As big or as small as you'd like and I'll complete it. And I'll post the proof of completion on FaceBook. It could be something to promote Nerdfighters, DFTBA, you, or just something random that you think would be awesome! (FIFA match?)

Please let me know what you think about this!

****** *****

______________________________________

but I get it, he's a busy guy getting lots of messages. So I need your help to get him to see this and hopefully he replies!

It's not a Christmas gift or anything like that (I've already got that down) but it's just a random act of ""hey, you're awesome and I like you.""

Thank's guys!
**EDIT**: **TL/DR**; I need to talk to John Green about making my gf's year.

**EDIT**: I realize there are a couple of grammar mistakes in the title. I didn't catch them when posting but thank you Rowan93 for pointing it out. I'll make sure to double check my posts next time!

(No real reason it just doesn't feel right) So i logged onto reddit and decided to come to the nerdfighter reddit. Reading these posts made me feel better. Being part of nerdfighteria changed my life for the better. So i would like to thank you all for not forgetting to be awesome. I know now that as long as i am a nerdfighter i will never be alone.

As much as I like John Green's books (and the vlogbrothers videos), I can't say that I've had much experience in the world of Nerdfighteria. 

I'm an English MA student, and this semester my research assistantship involves creating a young adult literature class. After much gentle encouragement (or excited babble), the professor I'm working with agreed to teach The Fault in our Stars and Will Grayson, Will Grayson (we have to get some David Levithan in there somewhere!). For the unit involving John Green, I'd like to include some outside materials that better inform the class about where exactly he came from, and how Nerdfighters inspire his creative process. Basically, I'm interested in the ways that the internet collide with authorship.

And so now I turn to you, awesome nerdfighters, to point me in the right direction. I've been sifting through the vlogbrothers videos and have found a couple TFioS related posts to include in the module, but what else should be included? 

I'm open to anything, really. PDFs, videos, websites. 

Thank you in advance for all the help! I'm excited to spread the Green love to a slightly younger generation of university students!",,False,self,t5_2rocp,False,,,True,t3_17mkbb,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/17mkbb/teaching_tfios_a_question_to_nerdfighters/,

1333996974.0,28,self.nerdfighters,s16du,An opinion about submitting to r/nerdfighters:,therealfancyone,38,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/s16du/an_opinion_about_submitting_to_rnerdfighters/,"Many of us nerdfighters are video-bloggers, too. I've seen a couple of vloggers putting their work out here, and I've even subscribed to them. It's just that many of those people putting out their own stuff are getting demolished in either lack of upvotes or some downvotes in comparison to Vlogbrothers related material (nothing at all wrong with that; I like that, too). 

It's just that I feel that we should really support our fellow nerdfighters that share their own videos and little bits of themselves, because Hank and John really wants more people to vlog and because it's an awesome thing to do. 

I can understand the stigma of trying to rally up subscribers, which is inherently dishonest in a way, but there are many nerdfighters who put up a video of something they did awesome. For example, I posted a video on here about me sharing a flash fiction story I wrote (which required so much work and thought and courage to post). I could have submitted it out for publication, but I decided that it would be kind of cool to share it for free on YouTube. When I posted the video, I got a few upvotes, which was awesome, and I got a few downvotes, too. It kind of breaks my heart, considering I've coaxed myself into sharing it with a group of people who might enjoy it. 

True, maybe the people who downvoted didn't like the short story. But what I'm saying is that we should definitely give each other a chance and comment and interact with each other's work. We tell each other to not to forget to be awesome, but what does being awesome mean? It is called r/nerdfighters, not r/vlogbrothers. 

What are your opinions? Should we submit our own work that has no relation to Vlogbrothers, or does everything have to be Vlogbrothers related? Can just being a nerdfighter with something to share be qualifications to submit?

Can Reddit and Nerdfighteria help?",embolalia,28,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/pl1dh/benton_harbor_mi_public_access_station_being_sold/,"Just a little [background](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#46349557): Michigan has this ridiculous law under which the state can strip towns of basically all their democratic powers. Benton Harbor is one of these towns.

One of their last vestiges of their democracy is the publicly owned radio station that broadcasts from their city hall. The now-powerless mayor still broadcasts from it, trying to help his people even after his powers have been completely removed. But now, the station is up on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/FM-Low-Power-License-Broadcast-Transmitter-and-Broadcasting-Equipment-/160732906720?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item256c6d84e0).

As the Maddow piece linked above says, someone could buy the station and keep it running. This has me thinking: Could we do this? Could we raise $5,000 to help this town keep the last thing they have?

**tl;dr:** Last bit of oppressed town's democracy up for sale. Can Nerdfighteria raise the money to keep it running for them?


I've cross-posted this to [/r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pl17j/benton_harbor_mi_public_access_station_being_sold/). If you like the idea, upvote it there, too, so that more people can see it.
