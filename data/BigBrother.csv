They are also being watched 24/7 and everything they say is broadcast to the world.

Now with that in mind, look at yourselves. Do you from time to time say something that would be deemed politically incorrect? Have you ever laughed at a joke that would probably offend someone else? Have you ever witnessed a dark humor reddit comment and chuckled a bit to yourself? 

If you don't say yes to at least one of those, you're a liar. No one is perfect, and no one is completely innocent with their senses of humor. So why is it a big deal when Amanda says something like her joke about Puerto Rican showers? Maybe if she had said ""So and so is a dirty puerto rican and he should take a shower"" it'd be offensive, but that's not the case.

I understand that people like Aaryn have blatantly said horrible things about specific people, which is not right at all, but it seems now america is jumping on everyone who says anything slightly politically incorrect and calling them racist, homophobes, or something else.

I think we all need to chill out, and stop judging these people we think we know so well. Remember the situation they are in, and remind yourself what goes through your own head on a daily basis. That is all.

I really cannot understand how Spencer is being branded a bigot for saying that Hitler was a great speaker. Maybe it's just because, like Spencer, I'm also a fan of history, but what he said wasn't bigoted, it was historical fact.

He never praised Hitler or said he supported him in any way, he merely pointed out that he was a good speaker, which he was. Had Hitler been inarticulate it is extremely unlikely that he would've been able to get millions to follow him.

Furthermore, Spencer wasn't saying that Nazi medical research was GOOD or that he approved of it, he was pointing out that through the disgusting ""research,"" there were beneficial outcomes with regard to things learned by the medical community. Which, again, is historical fact.

The ""cunt"" and ""faggot"" stuff may be a bit off color and I can see how some find it offensive, but IMO it's not comparable to comments made by Aaryn or GM. Granted I haven't watched every second of the live feeds, but from what I've seen it appears that these are his attempts at humor rather than hateful mean spirited comments.

People are ruining this guys life by branding him a bigot for a couple of naughty words (I've known more than a few people, more so females than males, who like to throw around the ""c"" word), and his discussions about history. Stick with attacking the real racists and stop being so sensitive that every single comment is dissected and warped until the actual meaning is lost.

Look, I'm not saying he's a bad dude or that he wouldn't have been good for TV but the dude was not a great Big Brother player and if he was he'd still be in the house.

Dan and Will Kirby would have NEVER given that shitty answer to Elissa, or ignored Jessie the way he did (who eventually voted him out) or gotten too attached to the blondentourage. 


Overall, he was a good dude with a ton of charisma but I don't think he was this enigmatic next coming of Dan that everyone is pinning him to be now that he's gone.

SPOILERS,PHILtheCANADIAN,123,30,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1k14az/why_the_move_during_the_double_eviction_was_the/,"You hate Amanda and you want her out of the house, cool. That doesn't mean that getting her out ASAP is the best move for every person in the house and you guys need to realize that.

**Aaryn** may have just solidified herself a final 4 spot. Andy, Amanda and McCrae all agreed that now they officially trust Aaryn 100% and they all want to be in the final 4 together. Then they individually went up to Aaryn and explained how much they trust her now.

**Andy, McCrae and Amanda** now have a good person to take to the end that will win comps to keep power on their side while being significantly less likable than Judd. 

**Helen and Elissa** took out someone who was much more loyal to Amanda/McCrae than them. They also had the discussion earlier that taking out Judd would be a good first strike to weaken Amanda's position and give McCrae less potential allies once Amanda is gone

**Jessie** officially severed her ties with Judd yesterday after they got into an argument, he was probably her #1 enemy. 

**Spencer** ... Well, Spencer would have benefited from Judd staying. At least he's not gone though!

**GinaMarie** ... I have no idea how she fits into all of this, LOL

If you agree/disagree on any of these points let me know I am up for some game talk!

[Possible spoilers],yellowwbird,137,51,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1k23lq/mental_illness_this_season_possible_spoilers/,"I am not an expert on psychology or mental illness, but Big Brother absolutely fascinates me as a social experiment. I also have not watched any of the seasons very closely since about season 4. My mother has always been the die hard BB fan in the house, so most of the knowledge I have about past house guests is from her.


   From what I can see, it seems like a couple of the house guests this year suffer from serious mental illnesses (though every year we see probably has at least a couple varying degrees of narcissitic personalities in the house). Before you downvote me, please provide your input because this is something I'd really like to see discussed. I also don't have a lot of the information, and am only stating my opinions on the subjects from my personal experiences. If you would like to add or dispute anything, please do.





Let's start with GM. 
When I saw the froyo competition and how hard she beasted through it, my mother turned to me and said that she HAD to have struggled with bulimia. You could see that she legitimately has no gag reflex left, which is why she had no problem winning that comp for her team. I kind of shrugged it off, but then my mom noticed something else on the feeds on the night she won HOH. She was sitting in her HOH room eating some kind of taffy, but then kept spitting it out instead of swallowing it. This is another thing that is common for people who struggle with bulimia. I read on jokers that Andy and Aaryn have discussed her eating disorder as well, so I'm under the impression that this is a known thing?





  I really don't like that CBS would knowingly let someone struggling with an eating disorder or who had struggled with one in the past be on the show. I don't think there have been any house guests in the past who have struggled with anorexia or bulimia (correct me if I'm wrong), but I don't think they should have GM on the show if she's going to be throwing up in the bathroom after she eats. (also something that my mother told me she has witnessed on the feeds that I have not seen) Bulimia is a disease. It affects your mind and your body, especially when under stress. I cannot imagine the magnitude of stress she will be under when she gets out of the big brother house or how she will react to it. I feel that the house is the last place GM should be if her ED is legitimate.




   Another house guest I would like to bring up is Amanda. I do not know Amanda's history and I am not a professional, but I feel that she often shows strong symptoms of [borderline personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder). I am NOT saying she has a full blown case, but I think it makes an interesting topic to discuss. BPD is something I have been exposed to my entire life and have even been diagnosed with myself when I was 18. I know the classic signs very well.




  The biggest red flag to me is her explosive relationship with Mccrae. They became VERY close, VERY quickly, which I guess is a common thing for a showmance. But Amanda will go from being absolutely attached to Mccraes hip to storming off in a rage because he did not want to sit next to her. They will go from honey moon phase to almost breaking up after each fight they have.




  Another thing is her impulsivity. Her fights with Candice and Jessie sort of came from left field. If I am correct, Amanda was the aggressor during each argument, which she did in a fit of rage before consulting anyone in her alliance or thinking about the consequences. She also tends to open her mouth without thinking about the consequences when making racist jokes.




  This brings me to another point. We all know that Amanda has been hypocritical on the subject of racism, calling Aaryn out one week and then directly saying racist remarks to Candice's face a few weeks later. I think when the DR asked her about Aaryn's racist remarks, Amanda felt it was her duty to take on the role of ""Social Justice Warrior"", and confront Aaryn. A few weeks later and Amanda is more comfortable in the house, she slips into the Amanda that we've gotten to know. This could be due to having an unstable identity and sense of self, which causes her to value different things during different weeks in the house.




And I cannot ignore the fact that she is highly manipulative, another trait of someone with BPD. This is something we have all seen and I don't feel the need to further explain.


So, these are just my thoughts. I'm not saying any of these as fact even if it has come off that way. I haven't seen these issues discussed in depth and am curious about what you guys think.

""8:00-9:00 PM: McCrae, Amanda and Andy had previously discussed that they would tell Helen and Elissa that the plan for next week is to backdoor Aaryn. In actuality, they would backdoor Helen. The goal of this was to try to keep Helen and Elissa from striking at them and also to have Elissa use the veto if she won it, thinking that Aaryn would be going home. Amanda and McCrae each had talks with Elissa, bringing up that Aaryn is dangerous and will be tough to beat in the end. They made it clear that backdooring Aaryn is high on the priority list. Spencer and GinaMarie's names were also thrown out there as short term targets. Amanda later suggested that they throw GinaMarie's name out there more often, to hopefully save the fake Final 3 of Helen/Andy/McCrae when Aaryn ends up staying. The goal would be to make it seem less sketchy that they kept Aaryn around.""

It will be 18 super fans competing against each other. Basically the whole season is to commemorate the past 15 seasons, with a twist/theme each week to honour a past season.

Week 1: Week goes as normal with HoH and PoV, but America will choose to evict one of the two nominees. 17 remain.
Week 2: A reward competition will be held instead of a PoV competition. 16 remain.
Week 3: Houseguests play for the silver power of veto, which cannot be used on the winner themselves. 15 remain.
Week 4: All houseguests play for PoV. 14 remain.
Week 5: Houseguests will play for family rewards a la Survivor. 13 remain.
Week 6: Week goes as normal, at the end of the week one evictee is voted back into the game by America. 13 remain.
Week 7: Houseguests all compete for a coup d'etat usable only that week. 12 remain.
Week 8: America votes for America's player much like Dan in season 10. 11 remain.
Week 9: Houseguests win, are nominated, and are evicted in pairs. After the eviction the evicted pair will be renominated and only one player will be evicted. 10 remain.
Week 10: No twist. Perhaps a double eviction. 9 remain.
Week 11: Can't think of anything for this week, maybe a high school themed week. 8 remain.
Week 12: A saboteur released onto the house; no one will actually be it, the producers will sabotage the players. 7 remain.
Week 13: HoH is crowned; all other players choose a partner like with the Pandora's box twist during Porsche's HoH week. 6 remain.
Week 14: Returning players enter the house to coach the houseguests like Dan in Big Brother Canada. 5 remain.
Week 15: America votes for an MVP to make the 3rd nomination. Person not nominated or HoH has deciding vote. 4 remain.
Then the rest of the game plays out as normal. Also they will not be informed about the twists so it's up to them to figure it out, which they should fairly quickly.",,False,self,t5_2r4zz,False,,,True,t3_1jltho,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1jltho/big_brother_16_twist_idea/,

Here's my question:

Why are so many people so upset and horrified by the way Dan has played this game? In my eyes, the way he has played is pretty much the embodiment of what Big Brother is. You are there to play a game. You are there to win money. You aren't there to make a few new friends and get locked away for the summer just to hang out and have a good time.

Basically, lying and manipulation, persuasion and competition are vital aspects of playing this game. Why are people attacking Dan so personally and making him out to be this horrible, awful human being in real life for being good at a game show? Big Brother isn't real life. It's a game. Dan played the hell out of it. 

I'm perplexed as to why people who are offended by lying and manipulation even watch Big Brother in the first place. ",,False,self,t5_2r4zz,False,,,True,t3_zvpqo,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/zvpqo/question_for_big_brother_fans/,

Can someone please tell me what the fuck is wrong with floating?
For some reason, there's this notion that forming an alliance and making ""big, bold moves"" right off the bat is a sign of a strong player and if you stay under the radar, you're a weak player and a floater that doesn't deserve to be in the house. Really, all you're doing is making yourself a bigger target.

How well did that work for nick, hmm? 

I keep seeing so much criticism on Andy when he isn't even on anyone's radar to get voted out! Isn't that smarter game play than, say, Helen or Kaitlin that make these big moves and now have limited time in the house?

Floating is a great strategy to be able to scheme, manipulate, and keep peace with all sides of the house while staying under the radar. Shelly was a good floater up until the end when she couldn't keep up with her lies. Jun Song was pretty much the perfect floater and won BB4.

Just so sick of that buzzword being thrown around without people even considering what it means.

Shane's right foot ""burning"" and he's squatting. Ian still solid. 

Shane and Ian can't talk game because they are on opposite sides. they have to talk loud/yell just to hear each other.  Only way they will get to talk game is if everyone else goes inside.

Back. just general chat. Ian still solid. shane looking good. 

Boulder/asteroid thing hitting them as they go around. causing them both to spin. Ian says he's shorts are going to fall down

He didnt do it just voting them out. He stabbed them in the back. he even said he did. They are the people voting and they decide who wins. if you can't keep a good relationship with the jury you're going to lose. The jury also doesnt know everything you know. They know what they've been told by other house guests and production. some of us watch the live feeds and see different things from different view points and have our own opinion. They all know the funeral was a ruse but they don't know the extent of it at all. They ahve to vote on what they know. They know Dan played a good game but he stabbed them in the back and didn't keep a good relationship with them when they left. Not a single person in there was happy with Dan or at least neutral with Dan when they went to Jury. they were all a bit mad or pissed(well maybe not Ashley).

**But first...**

We have gotten a lot of questions regarding where episodes of past seasons can be found. You can find them by clicking [here](http://m.youtube.com/#/user/TheQuirkyDude?&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fuser%2FTheQuirkyDude), which is referenced in the yellow section of the sidebar, which is along the right-hand side of the page. In that section of the sidebar, you will also find a link to the [Live Feeds](http://www.tvnutters.com/files/bbus.htm), as well as links to other 'Big Brother'-related sites, including [Joker's Updates](http://jokersupdates.com/)

Above the yellow section of the sidebar, at the top of the page, you will find the status of the houseguests as the episodes progress (who wins HOH/POV, who is on the block). At the the very top of the page, the picture of the evicted houseguest will be darkened in line with the episode progression. We try to update this information within at least a 24-hour time frame, so that no one is possibly spoiled.

In the pink section of the sidebar is where you'll find the all-important rules of the subreddit. We all do our very best to follow them, so please read them and adhere to them, especially the 24-hour spoiler rule.

We're very glad that you're here to enjoy the show along with us!

If you have any questions about /r/BigBrother, please feel free to send a message to the moderators, click [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBigBrother), or click on 'Message The Moderators' above the moderator list at the bottom of the sidebar.

Thank you all for the read!

**Please upvote for visibility. Thank you.**

EDIT: Fixing and adding links, and formatting on my phone. Thanks for your patience.

Reasons they should;

1. Judd. this guy is playing a good game except that Amanda and crew think that he's the MVP. I would hate to see him go because this twist threw undue suspicion upon him. I mean Amanda, Helen, and Andy are all ""100%"" sure that Judd is MVP. He has quickly become a fan favorite and it would not be smart for production to let him get run over by the twist bus. Don't tell them before the DE tonight, and Judd is going to be backdoor-ed, which would suck. 

2. Amanda. It would be so sweet to see her freak out over the fact that for 2 weeks America has chosen her to get booted. even when they could have put up Aaryn. She might embrace the villain role and go off completely, or have a nervous break down and implode. Either way it would be great to watch. 

3. Mccrae. I love this dude but he needs to drop Amanda soon and I don't think he would if he's not forced. The house may decide once they know that America wants Amanda gone that they should give them what they want. Then Mccrae can be free to make alliances without Amanda. He has wanted to align at points with Judd and Spencer but Amanda shuts it down. FREE MCCRAE!!

Production has made it very clear that they don't like Aaryn as much as the rest of us, they know she is a racist biggot hated by all and probably want her gone also. I am also 100% sure that production is aware by now that she cheated because when you search #bb15 every other tweet is about her cheating. I think what BB was doing with not DQing her by now is letting her burn her own bridges. She has already put Helen on slop even after McCrae offered to take it for her, she is just showing how much of a bitch she is.

So far we've definitely seen one of the oddest-paced seasons ever, because we've usually cut it down to a couple of solid, well-defined groups by this point, and many are attributing it to the MVP. While the mvp twist is causing a floater-heavy period and diminishing the importance of the HOH so far, we forget just *how big* this season is.

We had 16 HGs at the beginning. We are halfway through and we have 11 HGs with 6 or 7 (please correct me on this one) weeks left. we're about to see this ramp up really fast.

""But Madwolf, that just means it will be played too hard and too fast!"" Maybe by some, hypothetical naysayer, but the HGs have already had a long time to feel each other out on a purely social standpoint, rather than gameplay itself. I feel like that may actually be a good thing for the rest of the season because after this double eviction week, they'll start clinging to each other based on the social connections and it will make for much more entertaining alliances.

Hold onto your butts.

So, agree? Disagree? Thoughts or questions? More importantly, where do you think the power will come from in coming weeks?  I'm willing to bet that Candice leaves, followed by either spence or elissa, and the house will break into two camps: Hellen v Amanda. That will be my dream come true, because I think that Helen can swing into the final three, and it'll make GREAT TV.

PS Andy's my favorite person in the house, he'll be able to sleep until he turns on Amanda and joins forces wholeheartedly with Helen.

If Helen takes out Amanda right now, with 11 people in the house, that means she becomes the biggest target for the next 8 evictions... I don't know about you all, but that doesn't sound like a good idea to me.


Also I will say the hate Andy gets is dumb also, if things can remain smooth from here he has an easy final 5 spot waiting for him. A competition win here and there and before you know it he's the winner of BB15. Did you guys forget that the ""snitch"" last season won the game?

The reasons I've heard is because they would have to completely replace all of the cameras in the house with HD cameras and the costs would be outrageous. With the prices of cameras nowadays, I don't feel like it is out of the realm of possibilities.

Big Brother (US) probably spends around $1million to pay out to contestants every year. This is counting prizes, stipends, etc. I have no clue what production costs are. With advertising revenue and the money they make off America's votes ($1 per text message), I think they should be able to afford some new cameras.

Dan did NOT take this into account, he went too far with people throughout the season and it bit him in the ass.

(again, without telling anyone prior). frank has now convinced Jenn to use her veto on Dan so that they can backdoor brittany. danielle will stay over brittany because dan, shane, and jenn will vote for brittany rather than danielle to go home.
after that they plan to pick off ian, followed by shane, followed by joe (the most easily manipulated one.)

according to dan, ""people don't see big moves being made when they're angry."" he had to get the whole house mad at him to keep this subtle, and ensure that danielle would stay in the house as opposed to brittany.


so now dan will end up in the final four easily, along side danielle, jenn, and frank.
jenn won't win.
if danielle gets out, frank and dan duke it out for 500k.
if dan gets out, either frank wins and america loves it, or danielle wins and dan looks like not only the one of the best players, but also the best coach in bb history, pushing his newbie to the victory.

as Dan said ""that solitary confinement was the best thing to happen to me in this game""

shit is about to get really real. really. real.

Edit: one important detail i left out: how did Dan get frank and jenn to be on his side?
Before going upstairs with frank, he brought his bible and said in front of all the HGs that he wanted to read a scripture verse to frank. When he got upstairs alone with frank, he put his hand on his bi le and swore to god that he was telling the truth. He then told frank that it was Ian all along, and about how before the silent six, there was the quack pack.

* Though his nominees were safe choices (and a sad loss for him in Jessie), his target(s) were clear, and he didn't allow the houseguests to impact his decision-making.

* He drew the line. As opposed to the others before him who turned the HoH room into party central, he clearly designated time to himself there because it was, in fact, HIS room. Even after McCranda's wedding, he basically told them to ""F**k off"". Establishing a boundary like that garners respect from people, if that boundary is set diplomatically and firmly.

* He wasn't a pushover. He knew when to share his treats, and when not to. I can understand HoHs sharing their rewards out of charity, good will and perhaps currying favor from the other houseguests. But there comes a point when that HoH has to enjoy what he won for himself, and Andy did just that. Besides, no matter who the HoH had been, the other houseguests came to expect that person to give out the lion's share of the prize, and Andy wanted to break that cycle. (There are two certain houseguests who have been complaining about this. No need for names.)

* There was no disgustingly blatant HoH-itis from Andy. Unlike others (again, no naming names) who have maniacally wielded this temporary power over many heads, Andy knew how to balance control and fair gameplay.

What do you think?

Mainly just suffering from a lack of interest / motivation for that until something major changes.  

But I have been keeping myself informed, and came across the following gem of a dialogue on jokers.  Read from bottom up.

	
- Sun 6:08 PM BBT	McCrae says he doesn't like to talk about family or home, it takes home out of the game. 

- Sun 6:04 PM BBT	Andy says there is no sense worrying about it, you can't do anything about it here. 

- Sun 6:03 PM BBT	He says that he went to see her before he left and as he was driving away he saw her flip him off. NT - webcookie

- Sun 6:02 PM BBT	McC says hes depressed. **He says he has been thinking about home and Jessica a lot.** NT - webcookie

- Sun 6:01 PM BBT	**He calls her a maneater and says he is like the ""girl"" in the relationship.** [yes, like we've all been saying all along, glad McCrae is self-aware] He said it's weird and he has trust issues. She wants him to move to Fla when this is over. **It's fu*king weird...**

- Sun 6:00 PM BBT	McC says he has trust issues and and can't trust Amanda 100%. He says Amanda is totally in love with him. **She has talked marriage.** [WHOAAAAA!!!!!  STAGE 5 CLINGER ALERT] 

- Sun 5:59 PM BBT	Andy ask what will happen with him and Amanda when they get home. McC is not really sure.

- Sun 5:58 PM BBT	McC is talking about Jessica back home. **He is worried that she is watching him and Amanda.** 

- Sun 5:53 PM BBT	McC says the hard part is getting away from Amanda. 


So, anyone watch this as it happened?  It seems like he was only just talking to Andy, who is his closest ally.  I don't think this is part of some game maneuver.  We all know McCrae has been pretty standoffish around Amanda as of late, and seems like he is being ""dragged"" into this stupid ""bb wedding"" charade.  But this is the first time I have seen him essentially hint that he is weirded out by the whole Amanda ""falling in love with him"" situation.

Let me begin by saying that I never cared for his personality. He's said some downright mean stuff about GM, has called Candice and Jessie bitches among other derogatory terms on ***multiple occasions***; looked through Howard's personal belongings when he suspected him of having MVP yet still wasn't satisfied when he found nothing. That's not even mentioning the fact that he called him a ***""fucking pussy""*** behind his back. I understand his whole gimmick on the aired episodes depicted him as an innocent and loveable oaf, but that really was never the case, and I fail to see why he's so generally loved on this subreddit.


That's all irrelevent and beside the point when it comes to his actual eviction and overall gameplay though. Yes, he played his HOH week brilliantly, but that was pretty much it. From that point on it's been a weak, disorganized and at times sloppy rollercoaster. He fucked up the first time when he took too long to inform his superior (let's just be real here) Amanda about Howard and Spencer's plot to pick her off. Andy simply beat him to the plate assuring his own secure position in their final 4 alliance, and only thickening the target on Judd's back. He and the rest of the Goof Troop began to cozy up to Aaryn, who had won HOH twice by that point, failing to realize how that could easily illuminate her strategic importance to the alliance and how it was now waning his own ranking on its totem pole. 


Then came the warnings and suggestions. During the POV competition, Candice (although her pathetic gameplay could've chosen a better place and time) warned Judd about Amanda's murmurs to 'backdoor' him and the now ridiculously huge target on his back. Then came Jessie, who was now safe and in a position to gather just 4 votes (her, Elissa, Helen, and Judd) to make a big move and evict Amanda, who now held very little leverage and was on still on the block. But instead of jumping on the opportunity and heeding her advice, he essentially ended whatever mild showmance they had and broke ties with their 'alliance'.

This subreddit becomes a ghost town during the off season, so I was thinking that we should watch previous seasons during the off season.  We could vote for the season to watch, and all watch the episodes on the same day (or near) and comment on them.

I was thinking we could follow the typical format of BB, and watch on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday.  We could comment on our thoughts, and some of the veteran viewers could enlighten us about what the live feeds were like at the time.

* Howard - Ned Stark: They fell from grace due to their honor and their mutual penchant for making boneheaded decisions. Both are considered to be fan favorites.    
* Judd - Robb Stark: You can't tell me that the Double Eviction that Judd went out on was not reminiscent of the Red Wedding. Judd thought he was in a great position like Robb and fell to those he thought of as allies like Robb.  
* Helen - Tywin Lanister: These characters are acting as the masterminds of their respective shows. They've planned out and executed everything that's happened thus far.   
* Amanda - Cersei: These two are deinitely the Queens of their respective shows. They know what they want and are willing go out and get it by any means necessary.   Amanda delivering her verbal smackdown to Jessie reminded me of Cersei's spats with Ned or Maergery.    
* Jessie - Sansa Stark: These characters have an eerily similar personality, at least in my opinion. They both recently have noticed that they are in bad positions and are now trying to rebel against the system.  
There are definitely more comparisons to make but I think these are the most obvious ones.

It's eviction night once again and I want to take a minute or two to discuss something that's been a hot topic around here lately:  spoilers.  After a few seasons of trial and error, we've come up with our current rule which is:  
   
No Spoilers in Titles for 24 hours.  
   
###A quick FAQ   
   
**What is a spoiler?**  
A spoiler is anything that reveals gameplay results before those results have aired.  Typically, these items include contest winners, in-game twists and other major events in the house.  
      
**Why do we need a spoiler rule?**  
Around here, we have a wide variety of Big Brother fans.  Some of are up-to-the-second with things on the feeds while others are hours, days, and even weeks behind.  Since there are many different progress points among our subscribers, we needed a rule that trended towards the side of caution.  By allowing titles that have explicit spoilers in them, we run the risk that those users will have results prematurely revealed to them.
   
**Can't people who want to avoid spoilers simply stay out of the subreddit?**  
No.  When you subscribe to a subreddit, the top posts from that subreddit appear on your front page.  Results can be revealed to users who simply visit reddit while logged in.  
   
**Can't people who want to avoid spoilers simply avoid reddit or not log in?**  
They can, but we will NEVER suggest that in part because other TV subs have tried it and run into problems with the brass.  I personally recommend that someone trying to avoid spoilers for any show avoid the internet all together but, hey, people get bored.  
   
**Is Spoiler Discussion allowed?**  
Absolutely.  We love discussion about the show and full discussion is allowed immediately.  Simply keep the facts out of your titles and mark your title with the text [SPOILERS] to notify other users that they might want to avoid the content   
    
**What do I do if I feel my post has been removed unfairly?**  
Let us know!  You can message us via the link in the sidebar.  Make sure you give us a link to your thread if possible and a quick justification of why your thread shouldn't have been removed.  

**You're applying the spoiler rule unfairly!  This post was allowed but mine was removed...etc**  
The team here does our best to mod fairly but we each have our own interpretation of the rules.  If you have a complaint, please message us and we'll work out a solution that is fair to everyone.

Let me start by saying Elissa has gone mad (words from Helen's mouth not mine) and imo she's turned into what Reddit talks about when they say don't stick your dick in crazy. It seems she hates Arryn and was told today by her alliance they've decided that Arryn is not leaving this week (less likely to win hoh) and instead Kaitlyn is leaving. 


She did not like this and really wanted Aaryn gone, so Elissa pulled Kaitlyn aside and said pretty much... hey youre the target and are going home.

On top of that the rest of Howard's game is also great. People think he isn't a real threat because of early competitions and he has made no real Enemies in the house.

Candice: Is disliked by everyone with the exception of Elissa and maybe Andy (who likes everyone). Could probably float around for a week or two before the inevitable arguments with Aaryn/GM and especially Amanda happened. Amanda would use all her efforts to get Candice out ASAP (and Candice isn't even a huge threat, but Amanda would take it personally).

Jessie: Again, a non-factor to win it if she came back. The way she went out of the house ensured that she'd have no one on her side if she came back into the house. I really can't see her making a comeback if she made it back in.

Helen (assuming she's out this week): Would have a great shot at going deep if she returned, but she'd need a huge HOH win out of herself or Elissa immediately to ensure her safety, otherwise 3AM is right after her again. Spencer would most likely ""vote with the house"" as HOH instead of trying to go against the power alliance.

This leaves us at Judd. Honestly, the Judd double-eviction happened so quick that I don't think people thought through exactly what they were doing. It was an accumulation of people thinking Judd was playing both sides (he wasn't) and Amanda's paranoid notion that Judd was MVP (he wasn't). Aaryn/Andy/McCrae have all mentioned how they felt terrible about getting rid of Judd as well.

I could honestly see Judd coming back into the house and still be safe if he didn't win HOH right away. He blames Elissa and Helen for leaving anyways, and would be an extra vote for the 3AM alliance to get out who they want. Judd also is going to cause the least amount of tension in the house as he gets along with everyone. He's also a huge fan-favorite who just happened to get backdoored the week after they showed that segment about Judd's little town rooting for him.

Again, I'm not calling conspiracy, but we all know production has SOME kind of influence on the game. And I could see their reasoning to wanting Judd back the most. Candice would provide highlights of girl-arguments for at most 2 weeks before getting booted, same with Jessie. Helen is a close 2nd to Judd, but Judd coming back could really be huge (especially if a Judd/Spencer/GM alliance could be made to go after Mcranda with Elissa as an extra vote",,False,self,t5_2r4zz,False,,,True,t3_1kmcvq,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1kmcvq/does_anyone_else_think_the_table_is_set_for_judd/,

Also the houses are way better and games they play are much more fun to watch, and there's barely any gameplay its mainly socializing, having fun and drama. 

I also like the fact they don't bleep out any swear words.

This does not mean that it's right or fair to vote Elissa as mvp each week just because of this though...

Her only redeeming moment was admitting that Rachel was her sister-- a long time after everyone else knew already.

Vote for people who are ACTUALLY playing the game well, like Amanda or Nick for their good social games.

Amanda had foresight to realize that McCrae was easily bullied by people alone so she didn't let Elissa keep intimidating him, as well as is well liked by everyone while being honest.

Whereas Nick has been rooting himself into the game with his alliance, playing it rather low-key yet pulling off strategical things(Or trying to since McCrae is scared of everyone else's opinion) and is pretty much the reason the MC got together.

Does anyone think the Howard/Spencer/Jeremy alliance would've actually been anything if Nick hadn't gotten himself and McCrae involved? Doubtful.

Both of these contestants are playing the game in a way far more deserving of MVP than Elissa.

I remember this shit back when I was watching BB5. And during BB6 everyone fucking HATED the show because of the Nerd Herd, it was the worst season ever, until after the season when suddenly everyone had a warm remembrance of it.

My point is that this season is awesome, it's been awesome up until this point and will continue to be awesome.

2. we play big brother on here. we pick 20-26 of us to play big brother. we can create alliances through PMs, and someone could be julie chen. we would have games made for the vetos and hoh. those with have nots would get a slop flair, and maybe they get another punishment that I don't know how we would be able to create.

1374460813.0,27,self.BigBrother,1iscrp,If I was Aaryn and I truly wanted a real shot at winning... This is what I would do.,aaoun,38,11,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1iscrp/if_i_was_aaryn_and_i_truly_wanted_a_real_shot_at/,"At this point it is clearly inevitable that she will not win this 500k$ grand prize because of the mean stuff she has said or done to the other house guests. Why on earth would anyone give all that money to someone as horrible as her? I know I wouldn't... Well if I was Aaryn I would use this as my advantage and hopefully get me to last longer and potentially win this game (If possible!) Here is my take on what she should do...



**Step 1: Get everyone to use me as a pawn for final two**

Everyone knows that Aaryn with her attitude and her personality will not win her the game with the jury sitting next to someone who seems like an Angel and definitely deserves the victory over her by a landslide... Even Aaryn knows that she has bugged a LOT of people and whether she chooses to admit that she has done something wrong or not, she is going to have to suck it up and deal with it and use it as collateral. Telling only the strong players of this house to keep her and make a final two deal. Tell them ""Listen I know I already lost, it is inevitable for me. I have pissed off a lot of people and no one wants me to win 500 000$. No one will award all this money to me, especially because I have made all these racial slurs and have been mean to everyone, so I propose to you [insert strong player's name] make a final two deal with me. I am a strong player in this game and so are you. I can keep you safe and we can work together in secret to better ourselves in this game. I clearly have nothing else to give but this and I hope you can respect the game enough to want to work with me. I understand I may not deserve it but this is my plea. Thanks for listening."" Hopefully, if she gets a solid two players in on this, she will surely get further than where she is headed now. 



**Step 2: Talk less! and be much nicer to people.**

She has got to work on her social game now. It is all or nothing. After she has done some of these final two deals with people and convinced them that they are going to win this game 100% sitting by her side, she has got to get on people's good side! Every Big Brother fan knows that living in that house can mess you up, and even change you in a positive way. USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE! You fucked up with the guests, with America, now is the time to redeem yourself. Be nice to people. People respond to kindness and admire it. You've got no where else but up to go from here so take this opportunity and make amends with everyone! When she was on the block and was nice to people, they all noticed and admired her for it. WOMAN WORK ON THIS AND YOU COULD DO WELL IN THIS GAME!!!



**Step 3: Win competitions and keep your promises**

At this point in the game, she has got to keep these deals in tact. Keep the one or two final deals she made and work on building that trust so they know that it is worth it!  Winning an HOH and putting some of the strong competitors would definitely help her social game because those are the people who manipulate easily. Putting someone like Amanda up would definitely be the smartest move, or even Helen. 



**Step 4: Give the most epic and godly speech of all when you reach that final two**

You've made it and your have accomplished your plan. You followed through with your final two deal knowing that you had no other chance of winning this game. You grew as a person and your morals have changed and understand where all your faults are and want to take full responsibility of your actions. Apologize to the people you have hurt, hope for forgiveness. Expose this plan and explain to the jury that your mistakes in this house most likely have cost you the game and knowing this, you made a final two deal with [strong player] in hopes to use this as your advantage to grow as a person to make peace with the people you've hurt and to become a stronger strategic player. 


If she has successfully executed all of the above, while being able to be genuine about it, I believe she may be able to redeem her self in this game in the eyes of the house guests, and hopefully us viewers as well. I, in all honesty, wouldn't mind giving 500 000$ to someone who seemed genuine with their apology and deserved to win based on their ability to win competitions, their ability to turn themselves around and make it that far with this solid plan that has been carefully elaborated!

Gina Marie didn't seem like a particularly brilliant strategist to begin with, but she is doing almost no game playing at all since Nick left.  Aaryn let her feelings for David determine her nominations when she won HoH afterward.  Amanda is a strong player, but she seems to factor McCrae in over anything else.  Kaitlyn is still spending all her time with Jeremy even though he's all but officially evicted instead of trying to network with the rest of the house.

Of the strong personalities, only Helen and Elissa seem to be playing for themselves.

Do the men do this too and I'm just not seeing it?

Bonus question: Who have some of the strongest female players been (strategically)?

I think this is a pretty good move for Aaryn game wise and she seems to be shaping up her play style. My concern is that CBS hasn't shown very much of Aaryn's new play style and are still casting her in a pretty negative light. With the way she is being portrayed I think that the pure CBS Big Brother watcher may think that there are racially motivated or negative intentions behind these noms.

If I was Jessie, the first thing I would ask Andy is ""why did you tell Amanda about that plan?  are you in an alliance with her?"" and I would explain to Helen the same thing, that Andy must be allied with Amanda to bring all this information about evicting her back to her.  

It seems like that should have been a crippling moment for Andy's game, getting outed as someone who could never be trusted when talking about Amanda/McCrae.  Yet for some reason, this seems to have completely escaped the others in the house and they continue to put their trust in him.

* Last week she kept trying to flip the house which caused a huge argument between her and Amanda at the start of the week, that made Jessie a huge target and caused her to be put on the block instead of Spencer.
* Jessie was playing a half-decent social game before this, she was not a target
* Before she did this, the house wanted Candice, Spencer and Aaryn out, Jessie was tight with Judd, and the two of them would have the opportunity to either pick Elissa and Helen's side or Amanda and McCrae's side to work with
* Jessie flipped out about not being invited to the BBQ and had another huge fight, she will be nominated again next week unless her or Judd wins

So basically last week this girl was sitting pretty and was in a good spot in the house. Then she opened her mouth, tried to get Amanda out now twice, freaked out about the BBQ like a little girl and now she's the biggest target in the house.

&gt; **9:51 PM -** Topaz tried to talk to Alec about the shower incident but Alec starts to tear up &amp; says he doesn't want to talk about it. [*video*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=EPF4Lp7Mm2A)

 

&gt; **9:54 PM -** Peter visits Alec and Topaz at the couches: ""You want me to stab [Tom]? I'll do it"" 

 

&gt; **9:55 PM -** Alec is really having a tough time with the Shower Incident. He just broke down crying.

 

&gt; **9:55 PM -** Alec went to the bed room crying. Andrew saw him and they are hugging. Feeds went out. [*video*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NxGdbNxoD-g)

 

&gt; **9:56 PM -** Topaz came outside and started yelling at Tom about the shower incident and producers went to Foth. [*screenshot*](http://i.imgur.com/OI2sCXB.jpg)

***Feeds back @ 10:49 PM***

&gt; **10:55 PM -** Liza is telling Suzette that what Tom did was inappropriate and she saw it go down. She said Alec covered himself and that she ""saw nothing."" She also said Tom did it because he saw BBAD on the TV screen.

 

&gt; **11:00 PM -** AJ, Gary and Talla in the living room talking about what happened to Alec.

""When this game was reset I knew I was in trouble cause I looked around me on the pirate ship and saw Shane and Frank...2 huge physical competitors I knew I couldn't beat. I saw some great social gamers in Jen and Joe...I saw an absolute wildcard in Ashley, I had no clue what she was doing...I saw an underrated coach in Britney that I knew scared the life outta me...cause she was that good. Of course I had my loyal warrior Danielle through it all. And I looked around and said 'you know what, I can't be better than these people in any of their areas and expertise cause they're just that good, so what could I do to beat them?' My answer, although you might not agree with it, is I had to play a ruthless game. Not because I wanted to, because I had to. I had to build relationships, get you to trust me, get you to do something for me, like share a power or use a veto on me...and then I had to stab you in the back. Not because I wanted to, because I had to. For a couple reasons. 1...I knew if I was hated, at the end people would want to sit next to me as I have a chance to explain myself like right now. Like why did I host a funeral? I had to host a funeral because what it allowed me and Danielle to do was make you think we would never work together again... And Joe actually had it figured out. Joe came up to me and said 'was that an act, dan?' and I said 'no', and of course Joe was right. I had to create chaos so Britney wouldn't think I was striking a deal with Frank because if she thought I was still playing the game she would've been able to stop me very effectively. At the end of the day I played this game 24 hrs a day and I never wanted my game depending on my winning a competition...because I could never depend on always winning a competition against any of you..cause you guys were that tough. I hope you guys can respect the fact that I played this game 24 hrs a day and always tried to out think myself out of situations...even in the bleakest of scenarios. I don't have a photographic memory but what I do have is a burning desire to play this game as hard as I possibly can with the tools I've been given. All I can ask for is that you vote for the best player. Thank you for your time.""

They strategize, entertain, are quirky, and they all have a will to win (floaters are mostly gone now). But .... then they had to add the coaches. What boils my blood is watching these coaches go on a power trip because they feel that they have this all-important role of coaching the players. They act as if the players are brainless and can't play the game or make moves without their full consent. Almost like parents.

What's unfortunate is that you have these great ingredients (players) and they are being spoiled by these big-headed coaches who are manipulating them to play their coach's game instead of their own game. Granted, that's the player's faults. 

I don't know why BB and Survivor have this undying need to put former players on the show. What's even more odd is how the producers use nearly everything in their power to preserve at least one of the former players until the end. This was blatant in BB13 when Rachel was nearly gone and a major twist was custom-made to save her from elimination. 

I wouldn't put it past the producers of doing the same thing this year with Mike Boogie. Just looking at the cuts that they are giving him, it makes me believe that the producers have a hard-on for the guy. Maybe it's because he projects this image of being a grade A douche know-it-all.

Anyway,does anyone else think Aaryn will coast to the Final Four or perhaps further?

* She has no real alliances; she has GM but she'll throw her under the bus in a second. We'll see where this Helen/Elissa thing goes, but I think they'd keep it behind the scenes if they work together. She's not associated with anybody which eliminates the danger of being put up in effort to break up a duo (Amanda/McRae, Candice/Howard, Elissa/Helen, Judd/Jessie)

* She's a huge target. By keeping her, she will always be the #1 target in the house, which is good if you're worried about going up, you'd assume she'd go home over you.

* Everyone hates her. This plays into the huge target thing, and they also know she has no chance of getting any juror votes if she make it to the end, so why not keep her around? She has changed her attitude, but people won't forget what she said. She'll almost always be the most hated in the house unless Elissa keeps this up.

* She's not a huge threat. She's won some comps, but she's not as good in comps as Kaitlin was. She will never have a Frank-like run and start winning every comp because she's in danger of going home. 

* There are bigger fish to fry. The house sees this; Amanda, Howard, Elissa are all probably on peoples lists to get out before Aaryn; because again, they think they can get her out whenever they want. Why waste your HOH on someone like Aaryn when you can send her home almost any week? This season has been incredible in that they're going after power players early and it's worked.

* They think they can use her. Much like Elissa/Helen this week, when people don't have a solid alliance, there more likely to suck up to the HOH that week and do whatever they can do to stay. 

* She's an easy pawn. If you're the HOH and have to put someone up and aren't sure who and don't want to piss people off, Aaryn is the easy choice. You really don't have to state a specific reason of why she's there, and without an alliance, you won't be pissing anyone else by putting her up (besides maybe GM)

But when push comes to shove, if she's on the block vs. someone like Howard, Amanda, Spencer, McRae, Elissa, etc, Aaryn stays everytime.

She's going to be around for a while.

Edit 2: Andy went to Amanda, who brought Aaryn and McCrae into it. Andy told Amanda that Helen is getting spooked, Aaryn told her she knows Helen is lying to her face. Amanda has now asked Aaryn if GM would put up Helen, Aaryn said no. Multiple convo's going on now. Amanda swears she won't say anything, but we will see.

Edit 3: Helen realizes she can't get votes. She tells Andy ""We can't do it this week. I'm going to tell Jessie and Elissa it's a no go""",,True,nsfw,t5_2r4zz,1375670145.0,,,True,t3_1jphti,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1jphti/spoilers_live_feed_discussion_right_now/,

They have decided to block my access to the live feeds due to the ongoing dispute with Time Warner Cable.

It all started when CBS raised their prices to air their network. Time Warner Cable told them they will not pay those prices. NORMALLY, they reach an agreement minutes/hours before the contracts expire at midnight. That didn't happen last night so CBS is no longer broadcasted on my TV.

Here's where things turn south. Because Time Warner is a TV AND Internet provider, CBS decided to block website access for all people connecting through Time Warner internet.

Trust me, Time Warner is miserable to deal with. But CBS is turning a price increase disagreement in to a miserable deal for their customers. For the rest of the season I guess I will watch BB from youtube the day after and I am debating never paying for the live feeds again. BB Australia has been better anyways...

[SPOILERS],swemoney,52,25,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/1jjslq/why_i_dont_think_they_deserve_the_hate_spoilers/,"Amanda has been the recipient of a lot of hate during the last couple of weeks and I don't understand the reasoning behind it from most people. I understand if you hate her personality because she's a bit abrasive and I (personally) like that about her. I understand some of the hate from the inappropriate things that she's said because some people are sensitive to that kind of thing and I've worked in a comedy club for 6 years so I'm not too fazed by words.

The reason that I really don't understand is when people say she's running the house and high jacking everyone's HoH. Basically, you hate her because she's playing the game? If anything, I would think the animosity would be directed at those people who are allowing her to do this. If I, personally, was in the Big Brother house and I was being allowed to control people as easily as it has looked for Amanda, I would definitely continue to do so until I was forced to pivot and change my strategy. Bottom line, it just feels to me like everyone is angry at Amanda when they're supposed to be angry at their favorites for allowing people to use them as puppets.

So basically, I'm on Team McRanda because I feel like Amanda is playing a solid social game and has aligned herself quite well and I feel like McCrae had a giant meat shield in front of him in Amanda and could go really far so long as he's not all alone when (if?) Amanda ever does go home. I'd love for them to finish 1st and 2nd, but I'm realist, so I'm just pulling for one of them. And I can't wait for Ellisa and Candise to go home.

What is that?""  As a teacher in community college, I see this sort of thing all of the time...someone has a slight physical disability that seems to point to a mental one, and people judge the brain for the body's deficiency.  He was probably sent to Resource classes or the equivalent in Tennessee.  They assumed he wasn't as smart, and so he was pushed into lower classes than he could have handled.  

But, to hear this guy talk about game and relationships and see his instincts?  He extremely smart.  In all honesty, I think he can really utilize that he's underrated.

Former contestants:


Danielle Reyes S3, considered the best player to never win.  

Eric S8, was America's Player and is now making his own decisions.

Brian S10, played to hard to fast, first out.

Memphis S10, got to final 2 and got no votes.

Annie S12, was the first saboteur, now playing on her own.

Lawon S13, got himself voted out hoping he'd get a power.

Jodi S14, got into the house but never got to play.

Kara S14, evicted because of who her coach was and not her game.

Elissa S15, (barring she doesn't win) was carried by MVP vote, now showing she can play her own game.

Any ideas for other people, comments, suggestions.

Just thought it would be something new to talk about besides racism, especially because it's a predictable week.
