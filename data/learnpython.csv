1372286981.0,195,self.learnpython,1h51wt,I want to provide Python mentors for people looking to get better. Who could use this?,cjbarber,216,21,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1h51wt/i_want_to_provide_python_mentors_for_people/,"**Who are you?**

You've been working for 20 years and are learning programming to change jobs, you're a kid just learning to program, you're a computer science student looking for some real world project experience, or you're trying to start a startup at some point in the future but need to become a better programmer first.

**Why?**

From personal experience, both as a mentee (student) and a mentor, mentoring is an extremely awesome way to go about learning programming, and especially to supplement the *tons* of existing resources that are already out there.

Having access to a mentor enables you to get help quickly, break through sticking points in your building/learning, and ultimately build more cool stuff.

I would like to help connect experienced developers who want to help out aspiring programmers, or even experienced programmers just looking to pick up a new language (e.g. a rubyist trying to learn functional python).

Existing methods of finding mentors are not easy or user friendly in any way. And unfortunately, if you are lucky enough to find one, it's extremely easy for the relationship to fizzle out just as quick as it began - and then the motivation dies off and you find yourself regressing :(


-------

**To potential mentors**

Potential mentors - hopefully a few potential mentees will comment below and explain why they would love to have you so much - but let me try. Not only is mentoring extremely self-rewarding (and studies have actually shown that helping others will make you happy - I personally believe if you want to help others selflessly that's amazing, but if you do it because it makes you happier then there's nothing wrong with that!), but will also give you access to an inspiring and dedicated individual who will be able to give you not only energy, but also feedback and ideas on your own projects.

------

**What will this cost.**

**$0.00** (No catches. Mentors will be volunteers, and mentees will not pay)

Later on to ensure that this stays alive, I'll explore ways of making money, but the core mentorship offering will always be accessible for free to driven individuals. And ultimately I'd really love to be running a program like this!  

-------

**How will this be structured?**

That's something that I'm currently working out. I've worked on two mentorship programs with Stanford University (one that I started, and one that I work on the team of), but I can really use your help with suggestions and ideas, especially in how we can make this as amazing an experience as possible for the mentors, and also how we can entice and attract more mentors.

-----

**What's the status?**

I already have a few mentors and mentees that have expressed interest! I think to keep the experience as good as possible, I'll do the first class with a specific language only - so please do fill out the survey below if you want to be a mentor or mentee and indicate that you are interested in Python and whatever other language you want to learn or teach :)


**What now? How can you help?**

If you could use this service, let me know! Comment below, do the survey, hire a blimp to send me a message, etc :)

Indicate that you want Python and help me work out what people need most by filling this out.

I'll need a bunch of people to fill this out - but the fact is that large groups are always made up of lone individuals! *Your* response alone will make a difference, and will help me shape the program in a direction that is useful for *you*.

If you have experience running mentoring programs, being mentored with programming, or mentoring students before, please send me a message on reddit or email me with [myusername]@stanford.edu

*Cheers guys*

All right then champions, thanks again for all the great questions and the enthusiasm. I hope to stay an active member on this SR and hope you'll keep me in mind if you or your company have any teaching needs!

Which brings me to my shameless plug: I am developing an online course and I hope to generate interest in my own personal approach, which is geared toward giving beginners a from-zero start and get them writing small programs that build into larger ones in graduated steps. I'd like to see if there's any interest in taking a course like this.

One advantage over online tutorial resources is that we would have a weekly interactive session to go over the material, a set number of sessions like a regular semester course, and the ability to email the instructor with questions. The object is an intermediate-level working relationship with the language, up through user-defined classes.

The downside is that it would cost a little money! (Definitely less than what many in-class or online courses charge.) This project is really just in the development stage, but I'd like to hear from those of you who might be interested... you can send me a private message if you'd like to keep in touch about it.

Explain object oriented programming.,AYNRAND420,80,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1iw2c1/tutorial_massive_what_is_a_class_explain_object/,"There are several ways of thinking about/using classes, and several benefits to using classes. I believe that classes can be such a slippery subject to grasp because the advantages are sometimes not very well complimented by examples; some advantages to classes only become apparent when your project becomes massive. Hopefully I can write an all-encompassing tutorial that sells you on the value of object orientated programming. Here is a story that is roughly based on true events and set about 6 years ago. Each numbered point is a benefit/use/concept.

* In a World Without Object Orientated Programming!

AYNRAND420 loves chess, so he plans to build a chess program in python. The first task is board representation. He needs a way for the program to store the data for the chess board in memory so that it can manipulate the data when someone makes a move or sets up the board. He initially does not use classes:

    squares = []
    
    #there are 8 ranks in a chess board (top to bottom)
    for temp in range(8): 
    	
        squares.append([])
    	
        #there are 8 files in a chess board (left to right)
        for temp2 in range(8):
        
            squares[-1].append([])
			
The squares list looks like this:

    [[  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]  ]]

This is a great start, until AYNRAND420 realizes that every time he wants to create another board, he has to cut and paste the code. This starts to make his program really long. Then he realizes: he could put the code that initialized the board in memory as a little function which would return the board. Score!

    def makeBoard():
        squares = []
    
        #there are 8 ranks in a chess board (top to bottom)
        for temp in range(8): 
        
            squares.append([])
            
            #there are 8 files in a chess board (left to right)
            for temp2 in range(8):
            
                squares[-1].append([])

        return squares
    
    board1 = makeBoard()
    board2 = makeBoard()
    board3 = makeBoard()

Now, AYNRAND420 wants to get ready to start storing pieces in the squares. There are a number of ways to do this. He decides on using their letter value.

    #PIECE REFERENCING SYSTEM
    #P = pawn
    #N = knight
    #B = bishop
    #R = rook
    #Q = queen
    #K = king
    #E = empty

Crap, what about their colour?

    #REVISED PIECE REFERENCING SYSTEM
    #BP = black pawn
    #BN = black knight
    #BB = black bishop
    #BR = black rook
    #BQ = black queen
    #BK = black king
    #EE = empty
    #WP = white pawn
    #WN = white knight
    #WB = white bishop
    #WR = white rook
    #WQ = white queen
    #WK = white king
	
The squares list looks like this:

    [  [""BR""],[""BN""],[""BB""],[""BQ""],[""BK""],[""BB""],[""BN""],[""BR""]  ],
    [  [""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""]  ],
    [  [""WR""],[""WN""],[""WB""],[""WQ""],[""WK""],[""WB""],[""WN""],[""WR""]  ]

AYNRAND420 thinks things are just beginning to heat up. In no time, he will be playing chess with this beast of a program. However, things will soon stagnate. Why? Because he realizes that there are a number of other ways to describe squares. The program needs to know what colour the square is to render it in a GUI. The program needs to know what diagonal 
the square belongs to to conclude which moves the bishop can make. He needs to implement a flipping function which will flip the board if the user draws the black side. Pawns can only
move forward. How on earth is the board going to know if it is flipped or not? Furthermore, how does he store the move list in memory? Does he append it to the board list after the final rank? Does he create a board1moves list and a board2moves list, etc?

At the first obstacle, AYNRAND420 quits. Let it be known that he could have made his list mad elaborate. Each square could have looked like this:

    [ ""piece code"", ""lightsquare/darksquare"", ""diagonal ID l# and r#"" ]

And he could have appended his move list after the board. It is a valid way to do things. But it is not the best way. Firstly, it makes his code a mess. If he gave his code out to somebody to inspect and the person was a beginner, they would edit a minor thing and the whole code would break. If the person was an expert, they would be embarrassed for poor AYNRAND420. Secondly, had AYNRAND420 gone through with the project, he personally would have spent far more time on debugging, error handling, and defensive programming than he should have. His solutions to the large list of chess programming obstacles would need more code than an OOP project. Programming it just wouldn't be fun.

* Classes as abstract data types 

AYNRAND420 loves to organize and group things because it is in his nature as a human being. He eats in his kitchen; he sleeps in his bedroom; he watches TV in his lounge room. There is ultimately no greater evidence for the fact that people like AYNRAND420 love to group things than the fact that there are 70+ subgenres of metal music. Because he loves to group and sort, he will have a much better time if he does that with his code also. The art of dealing with grouping similar things and getting these groups to work together in computer science is called coupling, cohesion, and modularity.

In the last section, AYNRAND420's details for each board were stored with the data for the rest of the program. The boards' details were stored among each other, even though they're 
separate boards. If you step back to think about this, as a human being who loves to sort and group things, this is gross. Why should AYNRAND420 use python's inbuilt data types 
(string, int, float, boolean, list, dict) to describe something as complex and fascinating as a chess board when python lets him create his own data types, which are a combination of 
its own inbuilt types?

    class board:
    
        def __init__(self):
            #the __init__ function automatically runs whenever you create
            #a new 'board'. So, you can put all of your setup code in here.
			
            self.squares = []
            self.moves = []
            self.flipped = False
            self.whitesTurn = True
			
            #the self argument must be included in all functions defined in the
            #class, so that the class knows which of the possibly many created
            #boards are being 'worked on' when the class is called

AYNRAND420 has now defined board as an abstract data type! The class definition above is the ""blueprint"" for any board created. Working with a board is much simpler than sifting through lists within lists within lists, trying to figure out what each of the data types mean.

    a = board()        #create a new 'instance' of board
    print a.flipped    #will print ""False""
    print a.squares[n] #will print whatever is stored in the nth square (by default, it is not set)
    print a.whitesTurn #will print ""True""

And AYNRAND420 can put anything in the blueprint that he wishes. Player 1's name and rank? Sure. The clock time left for each player? Why not? But, by now he is starting to realize that while each board contains 64 squares, and each square can contain a piece; a board, a piece and a square all have very different properties. They're described and behave in different ways. He can do things the hard way,
by trying to cram everything into the board class, if he wants. However, things may soon begin to look as complicated as they did in the very first part. Or, he can separate them into a number of different classes that interact with each other like real systems do in the real world.

* Classes as miniature programs

AYNRAND420 can access his class' attributes from outside the class as shown in the very last code snippet. However, if he wants to manipulate the data, he should define functions that
do the manipulation from within the class. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, to keep things neat and tidy: AYNRAND420 is only going to have to do certain operations on certain types of data. He should put them within the class, with the data, so that he doesn't have to worry about them when working on different parts of his program. Secondly, it will be easier for him to isolate an error and reduce the total number of errors if he limits the external code that can mess with the internals of a class instance.

    class square:
    
        def __init__(self, rank, file):
            self.rank = rank
            self.file = file
            self.lDiagonal = self.setDiagonal(rank, file, 1)
            self.rDiagonal = self.setDiagonal(rank, file, 2)
            self.piece = None
        
        def setDiagonal(self, rank, file, axis):
            #add code here to derive the diagonal
            #of a square from the rank and file
            return None #fix this later
        
        def setPiece(self, piece):
            self.piece = piece
        
        def emptySquare(self):
            self.piece = None
		
    a = square(3,5)	   #create square where rank=3, file=5
    a.setPiece(""Pawn"") #put a pawn down on that square
    print a.piece      #prints ""Pawn""
    print a.rank       #prints 3
    a.setPiece(""Rook"") #put a rook down on that square
	
The best way to think about a class is that it is a miniature program. You have it optionally perform some task when it is started, you create a bunch of functions to manipulate the data within that class, and then you create functions which report the data back to the point where it was accessed from.

* Classes as systems that interact with each other.

I think I need some text here to make my formatting consistent.

                        sq.setPiece(col, ""King"")

                if sq.rank == 2 or sq.rank == 3 or sq.rank == 4 or sq.rank == 5:
                    sq.setPiece(None, None)

        def getPiece(self, rank, file):
            for sq in self.squares:
                if sq.rank == rank and sq.file == file:
                    return sq.piece
					
                
    class square:

        def setPiece(self, colour, type):
            self.piece = piece(colour, type)
        
        def emptySquare(self):
            self.piece = piece(None, None)

    class piece:
        def __init__(self, colour, type):
            self.colour = colour
            self.type = type

    a = board()	   #create new board

That board is automatically decked out with the lot.
	
Additions AYNRAND420 can make:

Move Class:

* Pass it a board, and have it automatically generate the valid moves for a specified side

Square Class:

* This is pretty much complete for now. He just has to add more interactions from the board to the piece.

Board Class:

* Add a function that will 'move' a piece from one square to another
* Add functions that allow it to 'talk' to a GUI

But this is besides the point. The main point is that each class is its own little world. It knows nothing of the world outside, except that it is supposed to get certain types of data, operate according to its blueprint, and return specific data. Classes can simplify very convoluted code.

This tutorial assumes you are using OSX and know how to use the terminal ([iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) is fantastic).

### Project
[Github Project](https://github.com/robertjanzen/random-bitly)

### Setup
**Step 1:** Create a gmail and twitter account. Once you have a twitter account you'll need to connect that account to a [development account](https://dev.twitter.com/). Once you have a dev account click on 'create a new application'. You'll be given a consumer key and consumer secret right away but you have to manually create your OAuth credentials. Once you do you should also have an access token and access token secret. These 4 credentials are used by your script to log in to your Twitter account automatically.

**Step 2:** Create a free account on [Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). This will be used to automatically run your script once every hour (or whatever time frame you choose). Once you're logged in you'll want to head to 'EC2 - Virtual Servers In The Cloud'. Go to 'Instances' and click 'Launch Instance'. I chose the 64 bit Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS. Create a keypair and place it somewhere you'll remember. This is going to be used to connect to the server via SSH. From here you'll be given instructions on how to connect to the server with your terminal.  

**Step 3:** Copy the two scripts into the home directory of your server instance. Make sure you've entered your Twitter development credentials into twitterbot.py. To schedule this script to run every hour edit the crontab.

`crontab -e`

You only need to add one line:

    0 * * * * python /home/ubuntu/twitterbot.py

Next install the dependancies listed in the Github Project readme. That's it! You should now have an active twitter bot.

### Code

I won't go over everything but I can point out a couple things I think are interesting in my code. If you have any questions please ask.

In twitterbot.py:

    if randrange(1,3) == 1:
        bot.update_status('{title} - {url}'.format(title=title, url=url))
    else:
        bot.update_status(""{title} - You'll never know!"".format(title=title))

This is used to beat the Twitter spam filter. The goal of this bot is not to gain attention or sell something, it's just a novelty account for randomly browsing the web. However they don't take kindly to accounts that constantly spam links or repeated comments. This code randomly chooses wether or not a link will be posted along with the website title.

In bitlify.py:
 
    while True:
        try:
            url = id_generator()
            urlopen(url)
            break
        except (HTTPError, URLError):
            pass
    return  url

This attempts to find a valid URL. If it doesn't it returns an error and it will keep looking until id_generator creates a valid address. It usually takes 1 to 4 tries before a valid link is returned.

1368753235.0,50,self.learnpython,1ehmr5,[Tutorial] Sets in Python,jameseric,54,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ehmr5/tutorial_sets_in_python/,"This tutorial provides an overview of the `set` data type, its advantages and some use cases. I wrote this to aid someone and thought some of y'all might find it helpful as well. Constructive criticism is welcome and appreciated.

## Preface ##


To spare me a few key strokes, I'll be doing everything in Python 3, but
everything in this document can also be applied to sets in Python 2.

## What are sets? ##

Even if you're not familiar with sets, you're certainly aware of Python's three
other iterable data types (for the time being, we'll pretend strings aren't
iterable `;)`): lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Dictionaries are used for
mapping, and although lists and tuples are used for containing lists of things,
the two differ a bit due to mutability which also affects resource consumption.

In the simplest sense, sets are lists that do not allow duplicates; adding the
same value to a set does nothing:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset = {1, 2, 3}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1, 2, 3}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset.add(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1, 2, 3, 5}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset.add(3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1, 2, 3, 5}

Converting a list or tuple to a set will result in all duplicates being
eliminated:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; L = ['once', 'upon', 'a', 'time', 'there', 'was', 'once', 'a', 'duck.']
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(L)
    {'a', 'there', 'upon', 'duck.', 'time', 'was', 'once'}

Remember what I said about pretending strings aren't iterable? Let's throw that
out the window now. Surely you lie awake at night wondering how many distinct
letters ""pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"" contains. Prepare
yourself for a sound night's sleep:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word = 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(word)
    45
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(word)
    {'a', 'c', 'e', 'i', 'm', 'l', 'o', 'n', 'p', 's', 'r', 'u', 't', 'v'}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(_)
    14

You'll notice the order of the items in the sets is not generally preserved.
One of the properties of sets is that, like dictionaries, they are unordered.
In fact, up until Python 2.4, [sets were implemented using
dictionaries](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/364638d6434d/Lib/sets.py). The
unordered nature is a consequence of set members being indexed by their hash
values which makes membership tests run in O(1) rather than O(n). In short,
this means rather than having to check do an equality check on every single
value in a set, only a single(-ish) operation needs to be done.

Although I will be sticking to common builtins for my examples, sets can also
be used to store non-primitive objects, and since the objects are stored by
reference as with all iterables in Python, the amount of memory used is
generally negligible. If you have an object factory or otherwise have the
ability to create objects that are equal in the sense of ""=="" but not in the
sense of ""is"", you need to make sure to implement the `__hash__` magic method
which I will discuss later for optimum set-friendliness.

## Use Cases for Sets ##

### Membership Test En Masse ###

As mentioned previously, sets are optimize for membership tests. This makes
them very useful for comparing groups of things. When given two groups of
things that need to be tested for membership against each other, it is very
common for novice programmers to do something like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking to find items contained in two groups
    &gt;&gt;&gt; in_both_groups = list()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for item in group_one:
    ...     if item in group_two:
    ...         in_both_groups.append(item)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking for items missing in one group
    &gt;&gt;&gt; missing_items = list()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for item in group_one:
    ...     if item not in group_two:
    ...         missing_items.append(item)

It is in this type of situation that sets excel especially when dealing with
large groups of things:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking to find items contained in two groups
    &gt;&gt;&gt; in_both_groups = group_one.intersection(group_two)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking for items missing in one group
    &gt;&gt;&gt; missing_items = group_two - group_one

When possible, the groups you're working with should be created as sets, but
even if they were not created as sets, it's usually going to be faster to cast
the iterables as sets and use the set operations than to for use the for loop
method. Let's do some runtime speed comparisons.

First, let's try the for loop method on two identical lists containing 10,000
elements:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for_loop_code = """"""
    ... missing_items = list()
    ... for item in a:
    ...     if item not in b:
    ...         missing_items.append(item)
    ... """"""
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import Timer
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     for_loop_code, setup='a = list(range(10**4)); b = list(range(10**4))')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    9.217123031616211

This code runs through the for loops 10 times then prints the duration in
seconds. Each for loop takes a little less than one second to run. Now, let's
try this with sets:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     'missing_items = b - a',
    ...     'a = set(range(10**4)); b = set(range(10**4))')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    0.0039539337158203125

That's more than 2,000 times faster than the for loop method. I initially tried to
use 1,000,000 elements in each set, but stopped after I realized the for loop
method would take way too long. With sets, 1,000,000 elements are still in less
than a second on my desktop:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     'missing_items = b - a',
    ...     'a = set(range(10**7)); b = set(range(10**7))')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    0.3704690933227539

The remaining use case examples are going to be relatively short compared to
this one given what I covered and generally going to just present hypothetical
situations where you can benefit from the use of sets.

### Filtering ###

Sets are great for filtering things, and even if you do need to for loop over
something, simply making what you're doing membership tests against a set can
provide a significant performance boost. In a hypothetical situation for
malware scanning, a simple signature check might be handled something like
this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a set containing all of the malware hashes
    &gt;&gt;&gt; with open('malware.hashes') as iostream:
    ...     malware_hashes = set(map(str.strip, iostream))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for filename, md5checksum in scanned_files:
    ...     if md5checksum in malware_hashes:
    ...         print(""The file '%s' may be malicious"" % filename)

### Filtering of a Different Kind ###

In this hypothetical situation, a Python script is responsible for flagging
suspicious activity in a chat room using set a comprehension:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; blacklist = {'windows', 'mac os x', 'redmond', 'proprietary'}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for line in chat_iostream:
    ...     words = {word.lower() for word in line.split()}
    ...     if words.intersection(blacklist):
    ...         os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGKILL)

The ""intersection"" method returns all elements shared between two sets, so
whenever the line contains unwanted content, there will be an intersection with
the blacklist.

Similarly, this can also be used for things like removing keywords when
indexing text by doing something like `keywords = allwords - commonwords`.

### Misc. Contrived Examples ###

Checking B-class IP diversity of servers hosted in the United States for a
hypothetical web hosting company (WARNING: Messy, quickly written code):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import webhost
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(['.'.join(x[3].split('.')[:2]) for x in webhost.nodes if x[1].startswith('us') and 'cloud' not in x])
    {'27.48', '05.449', '153.85', '153.80', '02.66', '146.141', '158.164', '479.38', '153.180'}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(_)
    9

## Implementing Object Hashing ##


Sets rely on objects being hashable. Most objects in Python support being
hashed with the `hash` function. When you run `hash` on an eject, it returns a
integral numeric hash:

    # Hash an integer
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(123)
    123

    # Hash a string
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash('123')
    163512108404620371

    # Hash a tuple
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(('123',))
    659470285131537468

When values are added to sets or dictionaries, these hash values are used for
fast look-ups.

For built-in primitives, two objects that are equal will generally have the
same hash provided they're the same type, but for custom classes, the default
hashing method does not guarantee that objects with the same properties will
have the same hash:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __init__(self, x, y=100):
    ...             self.x = x
    ...             self.y = y
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; thing = A(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(thing)
    -9223363303958891749
    &gt;&gt;&gt; thing_two = A(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(thing_two)
    -8732895884073

To fix this issue, you need only implement a custom `__hash__` magic method,
and there are various approaches you can take to this. Here are a couple of
examples (note that I will be omitting the `__init__` function for brevity, but
assume it is unchanged from the above):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Hash using a tuple of attributes
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash((self.x, self.y))

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Hash using a pre-existing repr string
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         classname = self.__class__.__name__
    ...         return str('%s(x=%r, y=%r)' % (classname, self.x, self.y))
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash(repr(self))

For object factories like ORM's that may produce different objects representing
the same thing, you may also consider defining the `__hash__` method so that it
relies on a key value for that object. Using an ORM object as an example, we
might derive the hash using only the database table's primary key:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class WebsiteUser:
    ...     id = ORM.IntegerPrimaryKey()
    ...     username = ORM.TextField()
    ...     passwordhash = ORM.TextField()
    ...     #           ---
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash(self.id)

## Afterword ##

There are of certainly of other ways to use sets, but this should cover the
basics and give you an idea of what you can do with them and how powerful they
can be. Oh, right: now you're thinking with sets!

So I sort of see Python as a giant class that has methods we can call with the '.' (e.g file.readlines()), but why the __init__ and self?

* Nothing wrong with diving right in.  If the project seems large and daunting, break it up into smaller digestible goals!
* Can't figure something out?  Google ""Python &lt;thing you're trying to do&gt;"" and chances are, the first few hits will be StackOverflow posts that have clearly and succinctly explained your problem.  When multiple solutions exist, usually the python veterans have debated the pros and cons in the comments, so you can make an informed decision on what method to use.
* Chances are, you'll solve a small problem, and later realize that python lets you do the same thing more efficiently, with less lines of code.  I had a few frustrating moments where I performed some task, then realized I could do the same thing in a single line.  Don't get discouraged!
* In python, for loops need an item to iterate through (such as a list).  I knew this conceptually, but it still took a while to grasp the implications.  I spent a lot of time writing code that would find the linecount of a file, just so I could use that integer as a variable in a for statement to iterate through the file.

An Instruction Manual for Installing Python  


## 0. Intro

Installing Python packages is challenging, and I've always struggled with
it, every goddamn time. I also wanted to run Python 3.3 as my default, while still maintaining a
copy of Python 2.7.

After playing around with virtualenv a fair bit at home, I decided to try to
use it at work to get two versions of Python living together. I also wanted
to figure out, once and for all, how to install Python packages properly.

This is a guide to doing those two things.

Note: I tested these instructions on Windows XP

## 1. Install Python

First, we'll install the versions of python we want. Find the newest
versions here: http://www.python.org/download/

* Install Python2.7 (using Windows installer)
* Install Python3.3 (using Windows installer)

## 1 a) If you want Python 2.7 as your default

I recommend installing the version you want as your default LAST.

If you want Python 2.7 as your default, do NOT add Python 3.3 to your PATH
variable when given the option during installation.

## 1 b) If you want Python 3.3 as your default:

Choose the option to add Python 3.3 to your Path. Since Python 2.7 doesn't
even try, you won't need to do anything else.  



## 2. Edit PATH variable

Regardless of whether you installed Python 2.7 or 3.3,
you should do this anyway, to add the `PythonXX\Scripts` folder to your path:

* Press `Windows Key + Pause|Break` keys
OR
* click `Start`, right-click `My Computer` and choose `Properties`
* click `Advanced` tab
* click `Environment Variables`
* In the lower window, select `Path` and click `Edit`
* Add `;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts` to the end of the PATH variable
* click `OK` 3 times!

(Note: Substitute `27` for `33` obviously, if you want 3.3 as default)

If you don't edit your path variable, you can't do this:

    C:\&gt; pip install markdown2

but instead will have to do this:

    C:\&gt; C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install markdown2

Same with easy_install and virtualenv. So add `Scripts` to your path.

## 3. Install setuptools

You need ""setup\_tools"" first, and for some reason it doesn't come with Python, so
first download a setup script called `ez_setup.py`. Save it anywhere, e.g.
`C:\ez_setup.py`.

Here is the link:

https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.8/ez_setup.py

(If this seems weird and random, it is. What the hell, Python? BitBucket?)

Then run it like this:

    C:\&gt; python ez_setup.py

(Note: the instructions here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.8#windows)


## 4. Install pip using easy_install

Setuptools gives you a handy way to install packages:
You can now do this to get pip:

    C:\&gt; easy_install pip

## 5. Install virtualenv using pip

Now we have what we really wanted: pip
You can now do this to get virtualenv:

    C:\&gt; pip install virtualenv


**Alternatively:**

## 4 + 5: Install pip and virtualenv from installer

Install pip from here:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip

Install virtualenv from here:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#virtualenv

Note that if you do this, you will still need setuptools!


## 6. Create Virtual Environment

Now that you have virtualenv, we can actually do some work.

Our goal is to create just one new environment for the Python installation
that is NOT our default.

Now create your virtual env. The path at the end is the location where
your virtual environment will be stored. You can modify this to whatever
you want:

    C:\&gt; virtualenv --no-site-packages --python=C:\Python27\python.exe H:\Python\virtuals\py27

Obviously you replace `27` with `33` if you are already using 2.7 as your
default.

Note: --no-site-packages is probably the default, if you have a new version
of virtualenv. Can't hurt to include it though. The opposite option is:
`--system-site-packages`

Note: You need setuptools, else Python 3.3 is going to fail to
create your virtual environment!
(See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7446187/no-module-named-pkg-resources)


## 7. Activate Virtual Environments

Now, you will activate your virtual environments like so:

    C:\&gt; call H:\Python\virtuals\py27\Scripts\activate

You can deactivate an active virtual environment by typing `deactivate` any
time, any where.

You should see your command prompt change, to look like:

    (py27) C:\&gt;

Indicating that the virtual environment is active. Now if you run `python`, you'll run the version in the active environment, not the one on your path. Genius.

(This applies to any virtual environment you set up, not just these ones)

(Note: Packages such as [virtualenvwrapper](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper) will make working with virtualenv easier. That being
said, I don't like to try to learn too many new things in one go. You can save that for later,
and activate your environments the slow default way.)


## 8.1 Install Packages using pip

Now that an environment is active, we can install the modules we want using
pip, which virtualenv automatically includes in our environments:

    C:\&gt; pip install markdown2
    C:\&gt; pip install openpyxl
    (etc...)

This installs them into your active virtual environment, _not_ your
default installation. So if you want a package in other virtual environments
you'll have to repeat this process. Or you can deactivate and just install stuff into your
default Python as well.

Note: If you installed all these packages in your default installation, you
can use `--system-site-packages` to include them in your virtual environments,
so you only need to install them once.

## 8.2 Installing Packages using Windows installers

Not every package will install via `pip`,e.g. pyodbc, so you might need to
look up an executable installer. This list might help:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyodbc

However, you *must* install a binary package for a *specific version*.
So if I run the installer, it wants to go to the Python
it finds, e.g. `C:\Python33`, _not_ my virtual environment. Well, it just so
happens you can do this:

* Download the package and save it, say at `C:\pyodbc.exe`
* Make sure your virtual environment is activated, and then do this:

    C:\&gt; easy_install C:\pyodbc.exe

Voila. It will install in your active virtual environment.

If this doesn't work, my guess is that you should install it into your default
Python installation, and then when you make your virtual environments, don't
use the `--system-site-packages`
[option](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#the-system-site-packages-option)


## 9. Verify Installation

To verify that your installations worked, start Python:

    C:\&gt; python

You should see that the correct version starts up, depending on which
environment you have activated. To check that your modules installed
correctly, simply do:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import markdown2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pyodbc
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import openpyxl
    &gt;&gt;&gt;

If it works, you'll just get a new line. If it fails, you'll get
an `ImportError`. In which case... good luck to you.

Repeat this process both after deactivating your virtual environment to
test your default installation.

God speed, pythoners.

I wanted to increase my knowledge of Python and start to actually make something and [this] (http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/) book about Pygame looked perfect for doing so.

However... As Pygame's last update was in 2009 and its based off SDL (i assume 1.2) and SDL 2.0 has just been released, is Pygame still relevant and useful to learn today or is it something that will soon be obsolete and as well as a lot people seem to be having performance issues with it on forums and such.

Anyway, my question: Is Pygame still worth learning, or would something like the Pyglet or even the Python binding of SDL be a better alternative?

Thanks in advance!

P.s. I also have no experience in 3d programming or OpenGL as my current goals as mainly 2d based, so maybe jumping into Pyglet may be a bit of rocky ride?

I read it a bit online, and decided that I needed a copy, and I bought it on Amazon yesterday.

I feel like I'm at the point where I can scrape together a Python program to do most basic things, and what's really holding me back is my relative ignorance of libraries.  This was put sharply into focus as I spent about three or four hours the other day writing a multi-process network ping scanner that could sweep a certain network (class A) in about three or nine hours (I forget); then the next day I spent about 20 minutes setting up nmap through Python and it could sweep the same network (and look up dns names) in one hour.

So that's why I was excited about the book; and especially so since it is *by example,* and that is important for practical use of libraries by a beginning programmer such as myself.

Now, one of the things I read was the introduction, which mentioned that the author did a ""Python Module of the Week"" blog, which is where much of the source material came from the book.  

Today, even though I overnighted the book, I decided to see if the blog is still ongoing (I'm quite impatient).  Well, Doug Hellmann, the author, seems to have run out of modules to write about, but the last update was June 11, 2013, about a new one, so he seems to be keeping up.  And on the main page, [http://pymotw.com/2/](http://pymotw.com/2/), there is a PDF, fully up to date, of the whole series!  Formatted like a book!  Organized by topic/library use!  For free!  Almost 1000 pages!  (The book is like 1200.)

Most noticeable ones are new CSS
and new sidebar with rules and guidelines for comments and submissions.

And we would love to hear your opinion on these changes, suggestions for further ones and just general
feedback on the subreddit.

Please upvote this submission so that other users can see it. I receive no karma for text-only posts.


*CSS/Rules/Guidelines*


**CSS Theme**

____

We're using modified [edurne](http://www.reddit.com/r/edurne) theme made by /u/rolmos. You can get it on
[github](https://github.com/rolmos/Edurne-CSS-Theme-for-Reddit/).

One of the most notable changes is that there are line numbers when you post code.
I've got the idea and most of the code from /r/learnprogramming subreddit where it was created by /u/zzyzzyxx and /u/trpcicm and introduced in [this ](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/160s2i/learnprogramming_change_your_code_blocks_now_have/)mod post

Example:

    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; 10:
        print b
        a, b = b, a+b

As pointed out in the sidebar you can still use back-ticks to `mark something` inside the normal text.
**Rules/Guidelines**

____

As this subreddit continues to grow it has become more obvious that there need to be some guidelines and rules.

* There have been a lot of ""bad"" submissions which contained no code, no error just description of what the script should do. These kind of posts will be removed from now on.

The reason is that the users who created such posts just wanted someone to write the script for them, they haven't tried anything, they don't understand the python basics and so on. We do not want this subreddit to become /r/HomeworkHelp /r/Favours or something similar.

This subreddit is about learning python, either by helping you with issues or recommending tutorials. You will not learn if someone writes the whole thing for you.

* Also screenshots of the code are now forbidden. There is absolutely no advantage of posting screenshot instead of copying the text and pasting it, either in the body of the post or on pastebin or similar service.

If the problem is visual you're allowed, and encouraged, to post screenshot of the issue.

**Guidelines**

Even though they are not rules you should treat them as such.

Completely ignoring them/not following them can get your post removed.

The most important ones are in bold. I initially had a 20 point list of rules but I cut it down. I would really like to hear your opinion of these guidelines and if you have suggestion on a new one, or perhaps you think some should be removed.

One that I'd like to point out is #1 in commenting guidelines. Is

&gt;Try to guide the poster to a solution instead of providing one directly.

Of course this can not always be followed, but lately a lot of the comments are just finished/fixed scripts with little explanation on what was wrong. It would be better if you guided OP to the answer instead of just giving them one.
In complex scripts this can be a little hard to do, but if the OP is asking how to ""list"" numbers from 1 to 10 you should point them to official documentation on `range()` function than just writing `for i in range(1,10)`. This is just one maybe a bit bad example but I'm sure you get my point.

And as far as posting goes, the most important one IMO is this one:

&gt;Keep your code Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable) and provide Example

If you have 100 line code that causes error when you try and open a file you should not include the whole script, just the part of the code that opens the file and that causes the error. And you should also include the file (if it's not happening when you try to open any file) that causes that exact same error.

*Even though I only pointed out 2 guidelines you should try and follow all of them as much as possible*

___

**r/LearnPython Wiki**

Since the sidebar is now filed with rules and guidelines we have moved all the sidebar content to the wiki.

The content is the same as one in the sidebar. But with wiki you can add the content yourself.

To be able to add content to the wiki you need an account that's older than 14 days. The requirements may change and you may also need some karma in this subreddit to edit wiki, we'll see how it goes with only 14 day account age limitation.

I would like to encourage everyone to contribute to the wiki.

The are no contributing rules, but generally it should be up to date and legal content.

If you vandalize wiki on purpose, spam it or something similar you will be banned.
____



**The AMA**


Thanks to /u/NYCMusicMarathon and his hist post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/17eqks/friend_of_exgoogle_employee_who_teaches_python/) and everyone who upvoted it. We will have David Blaikie do an AMA **this Friday at 11AM EST** We'll see if it will be answered right away or perhaps the next day depending on the amount of questions and Mr. Blaikie's time.

David Blaikie is a python coder, currently Adjunct Professor at NYU and former Release Engineer at Google. And he will be primarily answering questions about learning Python, Google or NYU.

If this AMA turns out to be a success and if there's enough interest we'll try and get more people to do it.

That's about it...

I'm looking forward to hearing community's feedback on these changes/annoucments.

Cheers!

**tl;dr**

We made some changes, read the sidebar and tell us what you think. Sidebar resources are now in [r/learnPython wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/). And David Blaikie, adjunct professor at NYU and ex Googler, will be doing an AMA this Friday at 11AM EST.

If you would like to learn python through hundreds of subject based lectures by many different people then I recommend you watch the videos there. They are lecture/seminar style and are a great compliment to the normal way of learning by reading module docs and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) posts. With lengths between 20 minutes and 3 hours they can cover the detail on the subjects you really need.

Ever heard of [PyCon](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2814D3290BAA8837)? If not, your welcome :)

I find these videos especially helpful because there are often great bits of knowledge sprinkled in that you would normally only get in very advanced classes, or having had to of figured them out the hard way. 

Like when learning all things, you often want to jump to the very cool stuff at the end, but you really aren't ready for it. The videos here cover such a variety of subjects and mix in advanced topics in an understandable way so you can get a dose of the fun stuff.

I thought it could be cool if you could use a list to keep track of a little video game characters stats.

    hero = [hp, mp, atk, and so on..]

So, as a little homework project for myself, I set about making a text-based pokemon-style battle game with two characters. You and a monster. I was having fun messing with it, but because I really am new at this, the only logic-y python tools I know are while loops and if statements.

Which would have been fine of course, if I didn't spend 7 hours making the thing WAY more complicated than I ever wanted to. I even googled up how to do random numbers to pick what moves the monster would use and if the attacks would crit or miss (Proud of that, actually). I was halfway through trying to find out how to get the ""Final Battle vs Red"" theme to play in the background, when I realized I needed to step back, and make it better before I add even more to it.

Could somebody look at what I wrote and tell me if there is a easier way to do this? I feel like I'm missing something very elementary. Also... wanna play?

I've been a software developer for a long time now working in different cities, countries and continents, and nearly everywhere I go, I'm handed legacy code that carries with it the same antipatterns:

* Short, unclear (2-3 character) variable names used outside of loops, even passed into functions.
* Files regularly in excess of 1500 lines.
* Models that do nothing but define database relationships and dozens of independent methods in a handful of massive util files, used to glue everything together.
* Not breaking up methods into packages or directories, but instead using `_` to delineate their names like `compress_htmlfile_bzip2`, `compress_htmlfile_gzip`, etc.
* Only one module: 99 models inside
* Redundant naming: `File.file_id`, `File.file_name`, `File.file_size`, ...
* Writing your own convoluted system when a fast &amp; efficient 3rd-party module would work fine

Now since I didn't go to school for this, I don't know what they teach people there.  But since these antipatterns seem to appear again and again, I've started to wonder: is this how programming is taught these days?  Am I being kept in the dark about some secret society of programmers with terrible habits?  I really want to know.  Does anyone here do this?  Is it because you think this is a Good Idea, or because no one has ever suggested that these aren't good patterns to follow?

Obviously there are edge cases for all of these where they might be suitable, but to consistently see them, project-wide, on every legacy project I run into... we're not talking special circumstances here.  This is business as usual.

Honestly, I run into this *all the time*.  It can't be a coincidence... right?


**Edit**: Some people have asked what's wrong with these, so I thought I'd outline them.

1. **Short variable names** - It's about readability and understanding what someone has done months, even years after initial writing.  Referring to a yoghurt as `y` or a button as `bt` doesn't help you later to figure out what's going on.  *Code should be easily understood on first glance*.

2. **Long files** - while not necessarily bad, files of excessive length are usually a sign that you've lumped too much logic into one place.  *Where does this value get set?* someone might ask later.  If the answer is: *Oh, it's in that giant file... somewhere.  I don't remember.* you're not organising your code adequately.

3. **Limited Models and great big utils** - Models are the authority on your data.  Not just repositories of information, but containers for what those objects do.  If you have a `cake` object that only defines the `flavour` and `style`, while you've got a `bake()` method sitting in some unrelated `utils.py` file somewhere that also contains a `drive()` method for `car`s, you're not breaking your data up into logical places.  Also, I'm willing to bet that your `utils.py` file violates #2.

4. **Using `_` to separate things that should be in separate files** - This is a great example of procedural logic leaking into the object-oriented world.  If you've got a function called `compress_html_gzip`, you've already decided that you don't have an `HTMLFile` class that knows how to compress itself depending on the parameters you pass to it.  Your objects should know about themselves, so you should be able to do something like this:

        myfile = HTMLFile()
        myfile.compress()

        myotherfile = HTMLFile(compression=FILE.COMPRESSION_GZIP)
        myotherfile.compress()

    Separating your code into a bunch of very similar functions with similar names is a good hint that you should be using objects and not functions here.

5. **One module, 99 models** - We separate our code not for computers but for ourselves.  If a human can't look at a module and know what it does, then the code needs to be broken down into more manageable pieces.  Think of it like packing your house.  If you put all of your cables, dishes, and toiletries into a box called ""stuff"", sure it'll still transport your things, but good luck finding anything when the boxes arrive on the other side.

6. **Redundant naming** - This is just pointless.  If you've got a `cake` object, you don't need to know that the flavour is `cake_flavour` because you've (hopefully) named your variables appropriately:


        cake = Cake(flavour=""chocolate"")
        print(cake.flavour) # This makes sense
        print(cake.cake_flavour) # This is redundant

    The only time where you'd need redundant naming is when you haven't bothered to name your variables appropriately:

        c = Cake(flavour=""chocolate"")
        print(c.flavour) # Now this is doesn't make sense
        print(c.cake_flavour) # Now this is necessary

7. **Writing your own code rather than using a module** - Obviously there are reasons to do this, but usually only when the modules available are over-powered or poorly coded.  If someone has already written an extension to help you with polymorphism, writing your own only means you have to (a) maintain the module and fix all the problems someone else has already solved, and (b) teach new developers about your proprietary system since there's no way they could have heard of it before.  Use the tools everyone knows and you'll spend less time training people on how to use your special setup.  It'll also help you if/when your lead developer(s) decide to leave the project.",,False,,t5_2r8ot,1348845804.0,,,True,t3_10l8pm,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/10l8pm/is_there_a_secret_club_of_bad_programming_habits/,

Then, **the coolest thing happened!** Someone pulled my homework, made a change, did a pull request, and taught me how to get the same result with more efficient code. It was a small change, but it opened my mind up to a way to solve the same problem in a way that will stay in my mind. I highly recommend using Github to learn in public. It can be very effective.

- Very versatile, many people building on top of it and constantly improving it for different purposes

- Syntax is different (easy?) from other languages

1) Python cares about whitespace. In C and Java the { } braces are the way we group code and the layout of the code can vary wildly based on whether it has been written by a code god or minified. Python doesn’t mark it’s territory like this. instead python finds all the code for a given element (for, function def, while, if/elif/else) by seeing if it is indented. That’s right. No more packing lines together. Your code has to be human readable to the computer too.

2) a for/next loop is radically different. In Python the “for” is an iterator and can work with lists of objects as well as integers. The syntax is:

for x in range(0,500)

… And the preferred syntax for numeric loops is to use “xrange()” since this function does not actually create an instance of the list to be iterated over.

Thing is, I have no idea what to program, I have no project nor an idea I want to get started with.

I initially started out with a friend, but he surpassed me by far within a week. I'm still a noob, and it's frustrating that it's taking a long time for me to understand.

One thing is being able to write code, another thing is writing it so other understand; I don't think my code is very understandable.
The most advanced things I've done so far is to basically read and write, etc. 

I have tried to be very thorough, especially the building blocks; meaning I have tried to focus less on syntax, and more on the structure of the language.

I am proficient with python, but I do not have anything to show for it.  I want to build a portfolio, and in the process, increase my skill in python.

**What?**

My plan is to basically just write a bunch of programs with increasing difficulty and breadth and document my progress.  

I am going to post the programs I write here. The first ones will be simple, so my progression will be a good guideline for learning. 
 
I plan to explore:

* regular expressions (haven't used them yet)
* many different data structures (suggestions helpful)
* GUI
* Network programming
* optimization algorithms (simplex, genetic, direct search and the like; again, suggestions welcome)
* some A.I. agents that are not excessively difficult without logical programming languages
* Games

I am not sure over what period of time this will all occur, but it shouldn't be too quick (no half-assing it) or too slow if I stay motivated.

**Why?**

If you are learning anything similar to what I am working on, we can help each other out.

I want to write code in a way that is readable to beginners.  The people I code for in the future likely will not have much programming experience.  So definitely critique any unnecessary ways in which I do things.

I want to join the python community, but have no idea where to start.

I think it would be a fun project to follow if it wasn't me doing it.

I want feedback on what sorts of things would be good to have in a portfolio as I move forward into my IT career path.

Sophisticated code intimidates me, and tracking my progress in learning how to produce and understand it somewhere where I know I won't be judged is a comfortable medium for me.

I am going to have fun doing it and posting here and getting any feedback will keep me motivated.

-Be able to search my database by word and display all summaries that contain that word.
-Any other good ideas you have!

The following steps is for PCs and Python 2.7 users:

FIRST do this: 


http://stackoverflow.com/posts/15294806/revisions


""Be sure that your Windows environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for Python 2.7.x: C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts).""


What that means is click START

Then SETTINGS 

Then CONTROL PANEL 

Then click on the SYSTEM icon

Then click the tab ADVANCE at the upper right

Then click ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES at bottom middle 

Then in the SYSTEM VARIABLES box - find PATH and edit to include:  

;c:\Python27;c:\Python27\Scripts 


For some reason the Cs only work for me if they are lowercase, so you might have to change then to uppercase.


These steps with pictures are also outlined at the bottom of this page:


http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~rosario/classes/07F/202a/python/index.html

And in this video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddpYVA-7wq4 


STEP TWO:


""Run this one line command on your prompt, it will install distribute and pip:

python -c ""import urllib2;f=urllib2.urlopen('http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py').read();exec(f)"" &amp; easy_install pip

""

What this means is click START 

Then click RUN...

Enter CMD 

Click OKAY 

This will open up a CMD.EXE window. In this window, copy and paste the code and hit enter and the computer will install a program for you.


STEP THREE:


http://stackoverflow.com/a/8020986


In the CMD.EXE window, type in:

easy_install praw 

Hit enter and the computer will install the PRAW program for you.

AND THAT'S IT! 

Now you can open up your IDLE, import praw and use it's features like the first example given. Hope this helps anyone.

Knowing that it can often be a somewhat tedious affair, Sweigart takes the approach that it's easier to learn a new computer language if it's applied to something fun. His first book, ""Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"", put this to great effect as it lead the reader through learning basic Python by creating several small and simple games. His latest book continues this concept with more complex games and introduces the Pygame library for manipulating graphics, animation and sound. Well, re-introduces Pygame. The ""Invent"" book had a chapter on Pygame but it really needs its own book, hence this one.

""Making Games with Python and Pygame"" is divided up into ten chapters. Over the course of the book, you will learn to create twelve games and every one of them is fun and very useful in the concepts that they teach. Make no mistake, this is not a book on basic Python syntax or just using the Pygame library. This book teaches you how to make actual games with a nice level of ""professional"" touches. I was surprised by a number of the hidden gems that were included in the book.

Each chapter follows the same basic formula. First is a brief description of the game that will be created and how it works. Next, is the full source code for the game. Then, he goes through the code, section by section, with a thorough explanation of what the code does and why it does it. At the end of the chapter, is often ideas for expanding the game and a link to ""buggy"" versions of the game that you can use to practice debugging techniques. The buggy versions can all be downloaded and each version tells you exactly what is wrong with the code. In fact, the book makes several references to supplemental material to be found on the book's website. 

One thing about the chapters that I really appreciated was the way that they are organized. Each section of code has its own subchapter heading. This makes it very easy to find information on that section or, more importantly, the concept that section represents. These subchapters are also incorporated into the main table of contents. Another really great idea is that the book's website includes a ""diff"" tool where you can compare the source code that you typed in to the actual code for the games. This is extremely helpful if you get stuck on a bug and can't figure out what you did differently from the code itself. Combine this with the ""buggy"" versions available online and you can learn a lot. For example, comparing the working source code to a version where the game character isn't displayed on the screen as expected. This is the first time that I've seen this concept applied and it's a wonderful tool.

Here is a quick breakdown of the chapters and the topics that they cover:

Chapter 1 introduces you to the intent of the book and a few other preliminaries such as getting Python and Pygame installed. 

Chapter 2 covers the basics of the game loop, game states, and general concepts such as managing the screen, graphic surfaces (canvases), basic drawing, animation and sound manipulation, and more. It also explains how to manage how fast the screen is drawn (refresh rates and frames per second). These are all very important ideas to understand before you can tackle the games themselves and Sweigart does an excellent job of leading you through them.

Chapter 3 introduces you to your first game, the classic ""Memory"" puzzle. The purpose of this chapter is to give you some experience with a real game loop and refresh you on your basic Python (conditions, loops, etc), as well as coordinate systems. It also introduces you to some nice additional features - basic animations for starting and ending the game. 

Chapter 4 has you creating a Sliding Numbers puzzle. Key concepts such as keyboard and mouse input, screen rendering and animation are used here. I really want to emphasize something that is introduced in this chapter: ""flair"".  Most beginner books that describe how to make games just teach you the basic mechanics of the game itself. Several of the chapters in this book teach you how to add some nice flair to your games. Chapter 4 has you create a nice little animation when the game is restarted. Rather than simply redrawing the board in a reset state, it has you play back every move in reverse, so it looks like the puzzle is being unshuffled. It might sound like a small thing but it helps to add a level of ""professionalism"" to the game. Especially for a beginner, it helps to give them the feeling that they have created something special. Little touches like this are spread throughout the remaining chapters.

Chapter 5 is built around a Simon-type (copy me) game. For those that may not remember Simon, its an electronic game that has four large buttons, each a different color, that light up and play a sound in sequence. The player then has to push each button in the same sequence. The longer you play, the longer the sequences get. This chapter focuses on the use of sound and controlling it, as well as using time as a feature. It also focuses on a bit of flair called an ""attractor"". An attractor is often used when a game is sitting idle. This is very common in arcade coin-op games where they will play an animation or sound clip to get your attention. You'll also see it used in games where you control a character on-screen (a la Mario Brothers or Braid) and let them sit idle for a bit and they start to get ""bored"". They'll start tapping their toes or looking around, maybe whistle... Those actions are all possible with the attractor logic and ""idle state"" taught in this chapter.

Chapter 6 uses the classic Snake game, here called ""Wormy"", to teach simple collision detection and mapping concepts. While not explicitly stated in the chapter, his approach to tracking the snake on the playing field and rendering it is very similar to managing levels and drawing their maps onscreen in RPGs. This concept is expanded on later in Chapter 9. Text rotation is also introduced for the title screen.

Chapter 7 expands on what has been learned so far with a Tetris clone. Here we're getting into complex shape manipulation, variable timing for user movements, more collision and rotation techniques and UI layout. A critical element of this chapter's game is that it is played in real time. Anyone that has played Tetris will be all to familiar with how frantic things can get in the later stages. The author takes the reader through some basic algorithms for increasing the complexity as the player progresses. Like Wormy in the previous chapter, on-screen elements are kept track of by using an array to store an object's boundaries, but it works and it works very well. Using the concepts learned here, you can track a complex object in space and move it around with some interaction with the environment (e.g. walls and other pieces). This is revisited again in Chapter 9. A strong emphasis on game logic is the underlying theme of this section and it helps prepare the reader to create more complex games. 

Chapter 8 brings autonomous characters into the mix as you create a simple variation of Katamari Damacy. You basically take control of a squirrel that runs around eating other smaller squirrels while avoiding being eaten by larger ones. As you consume the other objects, you increase in size. There are some huge concepts in this chapter such as sprite manipulation, camera manipulation and viewports (essential for side-scrollers, which is alluded to with a reference to Super Mario World). This basically allows you to create games that have very large playing areas while only showing a small section at a time. You also learn how to do some basic sprite movement to make it appear as if your character is jumping/bouncing with the introduction of the Sine mathematical function. Also nice to have if you want to throw a ball up in the air and have it come back down realistically. Not content to show you how to merely move the screen's camera around, a little bit of flair is introduced that gives the player's character some ""slack"" where he can move on the screen before the camera moves, as well as brief invulnerability when the player first spawns.. Again, just a nice thing to see in a book directed towards beginners. 

Chapter 9 is not the last chapter but it is the one that ties everything together in one really nice setup. Here the game is Star Pusher, a clone of Sokoban. This is an isometric game using a tile-set and externally stored maps, actual sprites, collision detection, and more graphic techniques. Upon completion of this chapter, you will have just about everything you could need to build a 2D game.

Chapter 10 finishes things up with four additional games that you can use to reinforce what you have learned and discover new techniques. The games included are variants of Othello, Flood It, Connect Four, and Bejeweled. Of special importance here is the introduction of basic A.I. concepts in Othello and Connect Four.

I was wondering if any of you could help me by letting me know how similar MATLAB and python are? I only have programming experience in matlab since I'm currently doing a physics degree. 

I hear python is very useful, and fairly simple to use. Would I have to essentially learn everything from scratch? Or is the main difference just the syntax? 

(My first post... Sorry if I submitted this wrongly) 

Thanks! 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. I've started working through a website I found on this subreddit, called ""programarcadegames"" which seems very well written and easy to understand. Also, it seems Python isn't as different to matlab as I though. I thought learning how to make games could be a fun project over the summer and it'll hopefully teach me the basics of Python!

1372944989.0,20,self.learnpython,1hms30,A Python tournament for beginners?,RideMyLightning,25,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1hms30/a_python_tournament_for_beginners/,"Hey guys

I just thought of this and decided to post it so I can see if you're interested, so I haven't worked out everything yet (but will do that soon if people like the general idea).

So I was thinking about setting up a tournament that lasts as long as summer does, with weekly challenges. Those are of the kind that are do-able for people that haven't got much experience with Python yet just like myself, but not of the kind that you can solve in 5 lines.

I planned on making teams/groups based on experience. Groups are awesome; you can learn tricks from each other, learn to cooperate on one project and get to know others that (probably) face or have faced the same difficulties as you do. Also you tend to be more motivated if others depend on you, that's true for me at least. Groups containing 3 to 5 people work for me, but that number can be influenced by your opinions and the number of participants. When I get informed that a certain group, or certain members of a group, show they can't cooperate, I might change groups or exclude those members from the tournament. I imagine there will be some people that aren't able to participate during the whole thing, maybe I can make a list of 'replacements'; people that replace others that are going on holiday or whatever, to keep the teams (more or less) even.

The challenges still have to be made and help/ideas are welcome. Maybe it's a good idea to include some learning-stuff and make the challenge around that?

I cannot do this on my own however. I am able to make teams, post topics, keep score and test code, but I'm in no way an experienced programmer. So I made a list containing the things I need:

- Participants 
- Some more experienced programmers, that can review the code (I'm probably not experienced enough to do so)
- Maybe also some experienced programmers, one for each group, that act as mentors or something
- Ideas for challenges, I'd rather plan those ahead, but maybe the winning group would get to decide the next challenge?

For the required level/experience I guess something like being able to write a simple piece of code and being familiar with the basic syntax of Python? 

Oh and lastly, might it be useful to set up a group on Skype/something similar to just chat and/or ask questions about this tournament/Python/the challenge? That probably saves quite some messages on reddit, is quicker and more social. I imagined the groups separately are going to be able to communicate with each other, but a group containing everyone might be interesting?

That's about it I guess. Remember, all of the above is just spitballing, most likely there are going to be changes. Feedback is appreciated :)

EDIT: This are possible challenges:

1. Draughts/checkers. The follow-up challenge (or bonus) could be chess.
2. A Pokémon battle simulation (the concepts, you don't have to copy the stats of all 650 Pokémon)
3. Create a (textbased) game. Quite vague, I know, but that ensures the entries will vastly differ.
4. How to solve a Rubic's Cube. Don't know if this is possible, and if possible it might be just inputting a shitload of data (therefore not challenging nor fun to do).

tl;dr: Want to work together with other newbies in Python during summer, with a competitive aspect? Or do you want to review code based on efficiency/cleanliness and/or want to be a mentor for a group?

How can I refactor it to be more pythonic?,Binary_Dragon,21,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1hccgt/wrote_my_first_nontrivial_python_program_how_can/,"I've been programming for some years now, and decided it was time I finally learn python.  I've been reading some quick start tutorials online, and used what I learned to write a script that can parse a generic arithmetic expression.  Right now it supports five basic operations and arbitrarily nested parenthesis.  I don't claim that it's bug free (for example, it doesn't handle negative numbers well) but its largely functional.

So, now that I've written this, I wonder, what did I do well, and what did I do wrong?  I come from a Java, PHP, and Javascript background, so I'm sure that a lot of what I have uses paradigms from those languages rather than the way things are typically done in python.  So, how can I make this more pythonic?

I should note I'm using python 2.7.1 on OSX, for what that might matter here.

First, the rhetoric. Matplotlib was clearly developed by human beings that hate programming second only to the human race. Seriously. Trying to do even the simplest task in mpl is unnecessarily difficult, intentionally obtuse, and completely un-pythonic (in the python implementation).

Now, for my example. I'm parsing log files and creating a world map of source &amp; destination coordinates. I'm then plotting a great circle plot from one point to the other. What I would like to do is change the color of the plot line based on the number of times the source coordinates show up in my file. This, one would think, would be very easy. But, you basically have to create your own color map, along with some other secret sauce I've yet to determine, and then normalize your data set into the color map in a manner that is so little documented that it's almost like nobody has ever had the idea before.

So, if there is a thorough tutorial out there, I would love to see it. I have already read the mpl docs, which are absolutely terrible. As if just being rubbish docs wasn't enough, the docs to do what I want appear to be along the lines of ""RandomFunc(*args, **kwargs) - Does RandomFunc"". Super.

I need the web app to be able to present the customer with a canvas, with a blank template of the sign. Then be able to place alphabets onto the canvas to make their sign. Fill in their information, generate a reference number and email the little form and design to him.

I am asking for some advice from you experienced developers out there. A little about me, I am still a Senior in a University (almost done! :) ). I learned Java, feel like I know the language pretty well, and covered a lot of topics in my studies (Hash tables, linked lists, kv pairs, etc). While I may not know everything, I feel like I can at least understand code pretty well. My biggest weakness right now is when looking at other peoples code, I often have to take a while and figure out what people were doing and why they did it.

I learned Python on my own, while at my internship. From the first days of learning it, I instantly fell in love. (You should have seen my face when I multiplied ""Hello World"" by 8....:D) So long story short, I have been teaching myself A LOT of the concepts so I expect there to be a few gaps in my knowledge, but recently I have become the semi-script/app writer at my internship. I started experimenting in Django, and so far its pretty solid (User auth, MVC concepts).

So lately, I find myself wondering what my next steps could be? I really want to start working on open source Python projects but I don't feel I could be of much use (rather my inexperience is hindering me at the moment). Any advice for an aspiring developer? Possibly how to expand from just a ""simple script writer."" (Not that I don't enjoy doing it, love turning heads when I turn a process that used to take 3 hours to a 2 minute py script haha)

So, what are the best practices to avoid common pitfalls ?

* When to use datetime vs time module ?
(Obvious answer is when you have to deal with time zones, but should you use datetime always instead of time?)
* What time zone to use when you only need to deal time in a desktop application on the local computer ? (is it ok to use time.time() ? The documentation states the following: ""... not all functions are available on all platforms. ... the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.""
* What methods/libraries to use when you have to deal with multiple platforms ?
* In what time zone to store time in a web application ?
(Is it better to store every timevalue in GMT everywhere, or store it in local time and convert from that? Or some other method ?)
* What are the biggest mistakes you can make while working with time and how to avoid those ?
* What mistakes are hard to notice when you make them ?
* What is the best way to convert time to human readable strings ?
* What is the best way to parse date strings dealing with incorrect inputs ?
* Is it ok to parse date strings with regular expressions which have a well-known format ? What if the format is not very-well known ?
* How to write regexes (or methods) when time format might be different every time in the input but it is important to correctly identify it ?
* I usually prefer storing time in timestamp (second since unix epoch), because I can do simply time = time + 3600. When is this method inappropriate at all ?
* What are best ways to work with time deltas either times with or without time zones ?
* Are there any differences when working with time in python2 vs python3 ?

An illustration [like this](http://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeTransitionsImage?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=v1.svg) would be nice :) if the preferred method is not to work with default time module in python.

1363300918.0,19,self.learnpython,1abbbz,Update on my Forest Fire Simulator,Enkaybee,21,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1abbbz/update_on_my_forest_fire_simulator/,"A couple days ago I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1a6ajb/im_using_pygame_the_simulate_a_forest_fire_any/) asking for help making my simulation run faster.  The consensus seemed to be that I should try to parallelize my operations and use NumPy because it's faster than Python's lists.

I changed it from a forest fire to a disease, but it's essentially the same thing.  I implemented the suggestions I was given.  I learned a lot making these changes and I'd like to learn some more, **so I'll ask the same question: do you see any major flaws that I can improve?**

You can [watch a video of the new version here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7Hh-soL9o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1) - 57,600 trees with fast death once diseased.

or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohoZk9RSb5A&amp;list=UUkYUtgzFgWI9Sm_6QPaHwIw&amp;index=1) - 40,000 trees with slow death once diseased.

I used to be able to simulate 10,000 (100x100) trees at 10 frames per second.  With my [new code](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=eUsawTBd) (Python 3.3 with Pygame, NumPy, and SciPy), I can simulate 57,600 (320x180) trees at the same framerate.  10,000 trees now runs at 60 FPS.  That's a huge improvement and I have you guys to thank.

I had the good fortune to happen upon the amazing [binary dilation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.morphology.binary_dilation.html#scipy.ndimage.morphology.binary_dilation) function of morphology in SciPy, which simplified things immensely compared to what some people had suggested to handle the spread of disease.  It also eliminates the need for padding on the edges, which cuts way down on operations compared to having a border.

Since I never really outlined it before, here's what's happening:

-The forest starts out populated with the 2 youngest levels of trees randomly distributed and no disease.  This is accomplished using numpy's random.randomint().

-Each cycle, trees below the top level of growth have a chance to grow up one level.  There are 6 levels of growth.  Trees at the highest levels of growth do nothing.  This is accomplished by testing the entire maxtrix for (3&lt;= node &lt;= 8) and then applying the chance matrix.

-Each cycle, there is a small chance that a disease will be introduced at a random point in the forest.  Disease can only start at a healthy tree.  This is accomplished by numpy's random.randomint().

-If a healthy tree is adjacent to a diseased tree, there is a chance that it will catch the disease.  The chance is greater if the tree is older.  Disease cannot spread diagonally.  First it generates a matrix of True/False where True is a diseased node.  It then uses that matrix to generate a matrix of True/False values where True means that a node is adjacent to a diseased node.  This is where binary dilation is useful.

-Each cycle, diseased trees have a chance to die down one level until they reach the dead state, at which point a new healthy tree can start growing.  There are 3 levels of disease.  This is accomplished by testing the entire maxtrix for (0&lt;= node &lt;= 2) and then applying the chance matrix.

1351739546.0,19,self.learnpython,12ftjx,Let's talk about learning resources. Which are best for which people?,callmelucky,22,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/12ftjx/lets_talk_about_learning_resources_which_are_best/,"Hi there.

I've been teaching myself Python for roughly a month (having absolutely zero prior programming experience), and have dipped my toes into a few online learning resources. I just wanted to share my thoughts on each of them, and initiate a discussion on the pros and cons of various resources.

[**Learn Python The Hard Way:**](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)  
This was the first resource I made use of. I do see a lot of value in it, but after sticking with it for a while, I decided it wasn't for me. It seems to be fairly randomly structured, and just has you copying out a lot of code and running it, without really explaining what is happening. It seems the principle is that you jump in, run the code, and then try to work out what it's doing by inspecting the results. As someone who likes to know what I am doing before I do it, this approach made me a little uneasy. Also, the 'FAQs' at the bottom of each lesson seem to be just straight up replies to each question posted in the comments, whether they are frequently asked or not, and, on occasion, are a little curtly worded, and not complete explanations anyway. Overall a good resource, just doesn't suit my personal style.

[**Udacity CS101:**](http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012/Unit/671001/Nugget/675002)  
This was the second resource I got into, and is by far my favourite. Meticulously structured, everything is explained from the absolute ground up, with a mature and level tone. Quizzes and exercises are nicely paced, and there are extra sets of 'homework' for each unit if you want to really reinforce your new knowledge. This is also one of the few resources I have looked at that *actually* assumes no prior programming experience. I found it quite annoying in a lot of other resources I looked into which claimed to be laid out for complete programming noobs, yet they are riddled with ""much like in C, in Python you can do such-and-such to blah blah blah"". Let me make this clear to resource builders: I HAVE NEVER USED C OR ANY OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. Anyway, as I said, Udacity is by far my favourite, and I would humbly request that the mods include a link to their excellent site in the side bar of this sub.

[**Khan Academy:**](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs)  
The perennial favourite. Khan Academy is really good. Nicely structured, and also doesn't make too many references to other programming languages. Generally very good for the absolute beginner. My only gripe with Khan Academy is a personal thing, which is that I found the lecturer's approach of repeating key phrases a few times to be quite grating and patronising. It's probably great if you really have trouble paying attention, but really, as an online video resource, you *can* just skip back if you feel like you didn't quite grasp something that was said. For this reason, I left Khan Academy after the first 4 or 5 lessons, and headed back to Udacity.

[**PySchools:**](http://www.pyschools.com/)  
Urgh. I'm sorry, but I just found this to be awful. I followed a link from the side bar in this sub, and was annoyed with it from the moment it made me log in via google in order to use it, and then continued to be annoyed with its waaay too minimal (read: lazy) site layout. The lists of sections/units on the main page are not hyperlinked. When you get an exercise right it skips immediately to the next exercise without so much as a 'You got it right!'. The text is often on a background of extremely poor contrast such as to make it almost unreadable. It doesn't show you a running total of your score as you progress. There are no 'next' and 'previous' buttons on the exercises. For a site made by programmers for programmers it seems to be incredibly lazily put together. That said, the exercises themselves certainly have value, but I just can't be bothered using that atrocious site.

So there's my two cents. What do you guys think are the best or worst resources around for a complete beginner, and why?",,False,,t5_2r8ot,False,,py27bg,True,t3_12ftjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/12ftjx/lets_talk_about_learning_resources_which_are_best/,

This demo takes a screenshot, and locates the game of Puzzle Quest inside it. This is interesting because until very recently anything easily available in python to do this with feature detection / description was patent-encumbered.

**Some specific questions for you:**

1) is this really using BRISK? I found in the opencv source code where it passes the 'BRISK' name to Algorithm
   but then I can't find where Algorithm is actually loading things up to see if BRISK is really there.

2) Do you see any specific errors in my explanations or use of opencv?

3) Do you know how to set parameters on BRISK to make the demo more flexible?

4) Do you know how to create the AGAST detector that is used in the BRISK research paper?

Needless to say, they failed.

As you could see, the code is 3 2 9, and if i try something like 3 3 4 the correct action happens, so does with 3 2 5 or 3 2 9, but if i try something like 5 2 7 then the code fails and does not recognize that the second number was correct. 

This code is a bit messed now since i tried to figure out how it would work, but I failed, so now i am seeking your help!

Thank you guys!

I'm working on a program that gets your current playing song from a music player program that you select (Desktop applications such as spotify, winamp as well as some web-based applications such as youtube and pandora)

This program is written in python 2.7.3 and uses PySide's QT link for the GUI.

Now, I'd like to support some more 'advanced' players. People have requested windows media player, zune and AIMP3, probably more to come.

Now, how my program mostly works, I get these three lines of code

    win32gui.EnumWindows(Main.examineWindow, None)
    #in Main.examineWindow function
    windowTitle = win32gui.GetWindowText(hwnd)
 
What this does, it runs through all open windows, and gets their titles. Then it runs through some checks to see if the title contains the name of a player the user specified.

For example, when playing a song 'Foo' by artist 'Bar'
Spotify would have the following title:
    
    Spotify - Foo - Bar

My program checks for the 'Spotify - ' part, removes that and returns it to be output.

Now, the first problem I had was iTunes. It had no such identifier. It had only the name - artist in its Title. There was no way I would recognize iTunes using this technique. 

Luckily though, I could get the current playing song with some code I found somewhere on stackoverflow
 
    iTunes = win32com.client.gencache.EnsureDispatch(""iTunes.Application"")
    return iTunes.CurrentTrack.Name + ' ' + iTunes.CurrentTrack.Artist

However, the newer players I've specified don't have such easily accessible... ""api's""? I'm not even sure what they are.

I've been reading up a lot on this. And I've come to a vague conclusion that most music players do have some api-ish accessibility (A great example is that a lot of players have remote controls, made with this.. api?/link?)

From what I've seemed to make from it, it has something to do with .dll's, c-libraries or win32com dispatch.

I have no idea what the code exactly means in my iTunes implementation above. I could easily understand the stuff that happened after it though (iTunes.CurrentTrack.name? That's readable :P)

So, finally. My questions are:

* Is it possible to do what I want to do? (in python?)

* If not directly, is it possible with something written in c linked with python?

* WTH are dll's?

* Could any of you give me some better directions?

tl;dr Need to access api's I'm not even sure of if they exist or not and if they exist, in what language they exist in.

First off just wanted to thank the subreddit for being a resource in my decision to first learn python and in starting that journey.  I find myself though with a problem to solve, which I'm sure python could provide a solution for, if only I knew more.  I'm currently working my way through the codeacademy track, but there's a project I need to get done quicker that has been stumping me.  I'm at a loss for where to even start, so let me describe what I had in mind.  It's based around the ideas of randomization and balanced allocation.  I'm at University for Cognitive Science and was looking to develop a tool to help me with randomizations of experimental conditions.  Specifically...

I start with `x` number of images.  For this project it is 64, for another 100 for example.  I have all the images named in a sequential order.  I need to assign the order in which these images are shown and break them up into a certain number of `groups` an equal number of times.  In this case there are 4 groups, but again I'd like to be able to vary this for future use.  I also need it to be equal after 24 runs of a loop.  Obviously the first run could just be the first 16 images assigned to group 1, next 16 to group 2, etc.  But I haven't figured out a way in my head for the program to keep trying new randomizations and assignments so that each image appears in each group the same amount.  

Any help that a beginner could understand would be greatly appreciated!  Of course if anyone took a quick jot of it and wanted to pass along some code that would be phenomenal as well.

We were trying to make a program for something, but he kept having questions about what `list.append(10)` would return, so instead of trying any more of the language, I sat down with him and he went through the functions and played with them for a while, trying to find a use for them (so he could remember it later). 

This was a) more fun, and b) more memorable, as he was making the examples up. He did not know all of the functions before (and doesn't yet, I don't yet after programming for two years), but having a list he can check, and having something to try out when he gets bored has been pretty handy so far.

There's some comments, but spreadsheets aren't the best for describing things in text, I hope to make this into a nicer iPython notebook or something soon so it's a little easier on the eyes, but I figured I'd share this with the community to see how useful / not useful it is.

I strongly encourage you to sit down with the plain vanilla interpreter to play with these, try to make a guess before about what a function / method will do, try it out, parse the error, and see if you can avoid using `help()`. It will stick better if you have experience with a function, rather than just reading a sentence or two about a function. Just like in science, making a hypothesis and testing it is more rewarding than getting to the answer.

Any comments are welcome, I'm sure I made a couple errors in this as well. Most of these should work with Python 3, but feel free to generate your own lists for them to make sure you get the right functions and methods.",,False,,t5_2r8ot,1370845521.0,,,True,t3_1g0eoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1g0eoz/i_made_an_overview_of_python_27_designed_as_a/,

The game is a text-based ""card"" game. The ""decks"" are predetermined by CSV files, and each deck essentially loads with dicts of ""cards"" like this:

    {'Magic': '100', 'Shield': '400', 'NameOfCard': 'Shaman', 
    'Attack': '0', 'Defense': '0', 'NumberOfCards': '4'}

The computer and User each have a unique deck of cards, and each will get a 5-card ""hand"" from that deck.

The computer will randomly choose a card from its hand on each pass through.

You will have the option to choose an ""ATTACK"" based play or a ""MAGIC"" based play. Attack based play means that your card and the opponent card will be pitted against each other using only the Attack and Defense values. A ""magic"" based play means that your card and your opponent's card will be pitted against each other using only the Magic and Shield values.


The goal is to eliminate all of the cards in your opponent's hand.

I was given an excel file that contained records that failed a process (missing information in records).

I was told to bring up each record using queries and check the record to see part of the data was missing and if it was I would look at the excel sheet and put in the appropriate information in the appropriate field and update the record.  I had hundreds of records and had to do it manually.

My first thought immediately was to create a python script that would grab the key from the excel file and select the record from the database.  Check if a field in the returned query was missing information and then if it was I would go to the excel file and grab the appropriate input for that record and update the record using a sql statement and then move on.  Bonus points would being able to format the row in excel with a certain color as in if it had been changed or some other condition.

So my question is can anyone point me in the right direction on how I can achieve this?  I am not sure how to look up something like this.

I posted my first project to Github today (and was really thoroughly blown away by how awesome Github is, by the way (I shudder to think if someone had asked me to rsync it)). 

Now, all the coding I've ever done is for myself or for random projects at work that only help me automate tasks and chew-up data, so I'm a bit like one of those raised-by-wolves type of coders. Anyway, the program seems to work as advertised, but I thought it might be instructive to share it with the pros and if anyone has any comments on it, I will happily take them. 

I'm still working on it in order to clean up the data and do a bunch of other things I want to do. This project was inspired by the desire to know more accurately what the ocean water temperature and wind speeds and current swell data were before I went to the beach, and to track that and send it to my phone via email-to-SMS.

The people over at /r/surfing asked me to put it in github, and it never would have occurred to me that anyone else would be interested, but anyway I put it up there and here it is:

https://github.com/pellagic-puffbomb/noaa-data

A few notes:

* I have a plain-text config file with username/password combination inside. This is probably a terrible way to do this, but my probably-adding-insult-to-injury solution was to just make a random email address that I use only for this script, which gets run as a cron job on a linux box. This is probably really bad form, but it didn't occur to me anyone would be interested. I figure, though, that by sharing I can learn the right way to do stuff.

* I'm still fixing stuff and cleaning it up (the data that gets pulled and displayed, primarily), and I guess trying to make it for useable for someone else.

Thanks for checking it out.

I am checking all regex patterns on each line, but I only expect to find 1-3 matches per line (and not all lines have matches, of course). Some of my regex patterns are not actually using any special regex patterns; they could probably just use string find methods (e.g. the regex pattern is just 'some specific words' in some cases). So if it makes sense to use something besides regex for those, I'm all ears...

I'm also storing all my results in a dictionary where each value is also a dictionary. I should probably use a class or classes for that instead, right?

Here's some brief psuedo code to keep it simple so you can understand what I'm doing (no this is not how I really name my variables):

    regex1 = re.compile('some complicated regex')
    regex2 = re.compile('just a string of words')
    #many more similar variables go here ...

    for line in file:
        find1 = regex1.search(line)
        find2 = regex2.search(line)
        #repeating for every regex pattern declared above ...

            if find1:
                    #do some string formatting and add items to dictionary
            if find2:
                    if some_condition:
                        #more nested if blocks ...
                        #eventually copy/paste string formatting and 
                        #dictionary adding from above ...
            #more if blocks out here as well ...

As you can see this gets messy quick and my code does not adhere to the DRY principle very well; lots of copy-pasting to handle string formatting and such. I'm looking to refactor my code such that I don't have to change something in 8 different places when I find a bug to fix. Is there a specific design pattern, or patterns, that would help out here? 

I am thinking of breaking this up into functions, but I'm not sure how best to approach it without still having some duplication involved. I've also never really used classes before in Python.

- What is the most ideal way of organizing code for a larger program? I'm working on a system that has rules and does things based on events defined in those rules. These tasks will range from OS-related functions, to interacting with web services. In something like PHP, I would include a functions.php, a database.php, a config.php, etc. How does that translate to python? Is it all packages?
- I know you aren't supposed to reinvent the wheel, but wouldn't it be a little cumbersome to just import a dozen or so libraries? If it's something like a web service that will only be doing a few things, would writing it myself be a better option? I think I would learn from it and would also save on the amount of libraries I'd hope the user would have.
- How do you make a python program stop terminating? Pyton works great for scripting, but I'm wondering how to make it a constantly running program, without using cron, that will only terminate when the user decides to. In essence, the program will run on a timer that checks a file every few minutes and then performs tasks based on that file. What would be the best method of achieving this?
- Just a general question...what libraries are used to get the standalone web interfaces for python programs, such as the web interface in Sickbeard or Sabnzbd? I assume it is beyond the scope of my skillset, but I'm still interested in knowing what specifically is used to achieve that kind of interface.

In the course the instructor constantly reminds the viewer about immutable data types but at first glance the idea seems to contradict itself when you can do a = ""cat"", a = ""dog"", a = 2, etc.

I believe I've come to understand that the ""a"" in the above example is merely a label that points at the ""object"" in memory, and that the object itself is what is immutable. So when you are changing from a = ""cat"" to a = ""dog"" you really are just pointing at another object and the original ""cat"" value will eventually be garbage collected out.

Where I'm a bit fuzzy is if you set a = ""cat"" and then do a = a.capitalize(). I think that the a.capitalize() becomes a new ""object"" that grabs the existing value of ""a"" and is then independent of the original ""a"" value. The original ""a"" value is then eventually garbage collected out but the new object that the ""a"" label is pointing to will not be affected by that value disappearing.

So am I correct in that or am I still mistaken? -_-

Also I might as well throw this question in: what is the most efficient way to do the following (compensating for the user input with strip and capitalize methods)? I'm thinking there is a way to do it in one line, or to define a function to handle it if there are more occurrences, probably haven't gotten that far in the course yet.

I just completed codecademy's course on Python and decided to try my luck with API's.

The bit.ly,dwello,placekitten ones which it offered were kind of uninteresting, so I decided to use Discogs' as a start.

So here's my code.

    import discogs_client as discogs
    #from urllib2 import urlopen
    
    discogs.user_agent = 'removed for now'
    
    artist_input = raw_input(""Enter artist\'s name : "")
    artist = discogs.Artist(artist_input)
    
    if artist._response.status_code in (400, 401, 402, 403, 404):
        print ""Sorry, this artist %s does not exist in Discogs database"" % (artist_input)
    elif artist._response.status_code in (500, 501, 502, 503) :  
        print ""Server is a bit sleepy, give it some time, won\'t you ._.""
    else:
            print ""Artist : "" + artist.name
            print ""Description : "" + str(artist.data[""profile""])
            print ""Members :"",
            members = artist.data[""members""]
            for index, name in enumerate(members):
                if index == (len(members) - 1):
                    print name + "".""
                else:    
                    print name + "","",
                    
            print ""Albums :"",  
            
            #Gathering only MasterReleases and not every possible release in every format(LP,CD,7)
            thereleases = [master for master in artist.releases if 'MasterRelease' in str(type(master))]
            for index, name in enumerate(thereleases):
                if index == (len(thereleases) - 1):
                    print name.title + "".""
                else:    
                    print name.title + "","",

My questions are:

1)When i want to print the albums, it's damn slow. What do i do wrong?

2)What's the benefits of using Discogs_client and not the urllib2 package way as i saw in let's say placekitten example. (or [this guy's code]( https://code.google.com/p/jwsandbox/source/browse/trunk/Discogs/discogs.py))

3)Can you provide me some links in order to get a better understandment of python - API interaction?

4)Also, if i print 

    print thereleases[0].data

i get MASSIVE feedback and i can hardly work around it. How can i organize the JSON (i hope i'm right) in order to be more readable? Even in notepad or something.


Feel free to point and suggest anything, even not concerning the code.

Thanks!

I've hit a bit of a wall trying to figure out how to start with this code. I have to define a function that reads geographic data provided in a data file and returns two data structures.

When I stumbled upon [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-K40mkhEU), though, I realized I should proceed with caution. Early in the process of introducing flask, the tutorial video brings one pretty close to the point of opening up one's computer to external attacks. The title ""Dangerous Stuff"" and the cautionary words near the end of the tutorial provide sufficient warning in this case, but I began wondering whether other tutorials might lead me to open vulnerabilities without warning me. 

I'm hoping reddit folks can give me a few rules of thumb so that I can stay smart about security while still having fun as I experiment with Django and Flask. 

For instance, if I stick with reputable tutorials that other folks on this subreddit have recommended, will I basically be okay? 

Or maybe I should take additional precautions? Some tutorials mention sandboxing your system before you start. I'll definitely do that if it's necessary. If it's not though, I'd love to spend an hour learning Django or Flask instead of half an hour learning it and half an hour figuring out how to make sandboxing work. 

I have no idea whether this matters: although I usually save my work on a public repo on GitHub, should I save it somewhere private when I begin working with Django and Flask?

The questions above are pretty much blind guesses, so now's your chance to set me straight. I'd love to be smart about security without wasting my time worrying about things that have low probabilities of happening.

My initial reaction was that there should not be, after all:

    added1 = [x for x in after if x not in before]
    added2 = [x for x in after if not x in before]

produces the same results.

I've completed most of LPTHW and I'm not all that impressed by it.  It does a good job of teaching the basics of Python but I don't feel like I can do anything with the knowledge. This became clear when I tried to do some of the Project Euler exercises and then looked at some of the solutions.

For instance the most popular solution to Problem #2 uses:

    x,y = y, x+y

Which requires unpacking a tuple.  LPTHW introduced tuples in lesson 48 but only in one paragraph.  Looking at the code above I was totally clueless until I read an explanation of it i another post here. I get it now but theres no way I could adapt the concept into code of my own at this point.  The second popular solution requires importing ""itertools"" which I had never heard of before.  Where does one learn all of this stuff?

LPTHW has given me a VERY bare bones overview of the language.  Where do I go next?

The community is very helpful and looking to hold some remote sprints very soon.

If you are interested, here is the post from the mailing list:

The Salt Stack team is very pleased to announce the first multi city Salt 
development sprint. In true Salt fashion we are hosting a distributed 
sprint. This, thanks to a generous donation from the Linux Fund and the 
accomidations generosly donated by C7 datacenters in Salt Lake City Utah, 
Cars.com in Santa Monica California and Idealist.org in Portland Oregon. 
This development sprint is being conducted with the express hope of adding 
more complete unit and integration test coverage to Salt, but as always, 
feature additions and bug fixes are welcome! 
The three cities and location sponsors are, I hope, only the first 
locations where we can gather Salt developers for this sprint. The goal of 
Salt Stack is to develop something great, powerful, and open. I hope that 
this is the first of many multi city sprints that will enable Salt to 
continue pushing forward and becoming an ever more powerful system. 
The Sprints will be held all day on the 30th of June. Details on exact 
times and addresses will be released shortly. 
If anyone here wants to host a city for the Salt Sprint please let me know, 
I will send out T-Shirts and get you linked into the shared video feed, I 
would like to have as many cities as possible involved!

I like words. They're very expressive. But they don't go over very well with computers. I also like examples. For instance, it would be great if, while learning, I'd come across things like ""Here are some example practical applications of this kind of variable/function/whatever."" I don't see that a lot. I'm also not very good at reverse engineering things. I tend to need to learn things from the ground up and I rely on my intuition to get me where I want to go quickly and efficiently.

I've tried a lot, but couldn't come up with a solution. I'd really like some help with this one, because I got a feeling that it's something extremely simple.

Might it be that the information gotten from the win32api could be non-utf-8?


A quick overview for what my program does:
You select a music program or webapp, it creates a thread when start is clicked, it loops through your windows (or in the case of itunes it uses the itunes api) and finds appropriate music information based on what's program_func.p and program_func.pw. Then it writes text that qualifies to a text file 'current_song.txt'.

We work in a call center and we want to keep track of the staffing at different points in the day.

What I want is an app that will have three input fields. These fields will labeled 'location 1', 'location 2', and 'available' . These will represent the total agents in both centers vs the total reps not currently on a call.

I have no formal experience with either flask or html but I do okay getting around python. I found a [tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/s/khendnc4uen1ekr/hello.py) online for an easy hello world example that uses an input to generate the second page.

My first issue is that I am not sure how to get two input fields, and then also have the info available in my python script to store it somewhere. I am okay with the one field in the example called `name` and I am assuming that this excerpt:


    return render_template_string(""""""&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            Hello {{ name | escape }}!
            &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;"""""", name=name)


is the part where it assigns the input of the user to a variable in my script..also i figured that just creating another:

 
    &lt;form action='{{ url_for('sayhello') }}'&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;Please enter your name&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;input type='text' name='name' /&gt;
            &lt;input type='submit' value='Enter' /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;


would create another field on the app, which it did (i changed the 'name' when I did it). What I have no idea how to do is how to get the second field to correspond to another variable afters its put in.

I feel like if someone were to eli5 how to do that, show me a mini working exmaple, or even point me to appropriate resources i can *probably* figure out the rest, or at least get a bit further...

Eventually I want this to take the location 1, location 2, and available numbers - time stamp them mm/dd/yy/hh/mm when we submit them and then put them into a db of some sort (hell even a text file would be fine for now). Then I would have 2 other pages to create once I get that done, one that lists all the entries chronologically, in a table (columns//rows) and way down the road the second page would (hopefully) display a nice line graph of availability over time, for a given mm/dd/yy. Once I have my data set I'm confident in my ability to sort it out over different time periods (day, week, month) and whatnot, its just getting to that point that I have no experience with.

I don't understand how passing an argument to f() (or maker()) assigns a value to X in the nested action() function. And why is it ""return action"" and not ""return action()""? How does this work? Another example with nested lambda:

    def func():
        x = 4
        action = (lambda n: x ** n)
        return action

    x = func()
    print x(2)
    
    16

x() (or func()) doesn't even take arguments. How come it can pass a value to n for the lambda expression?! I'm totally flabbergasted by these examples. Please help.

I'm trying to make an addition to this program that stores a players high score in a plain text doc. 

This is how it should run:

On the first run, the name and score are saved to a new text doc, then printed for the player to see. On the second+ run the high-scores are pulled from the text doc when the player makes the high-scores list and are printed for the player to see (as well as including their own new high-score for that round). Then the text doc is updated with the new score. The scores are also supposed to be in order highest-low.

My problems are using the ""a+"" for opening the text doc. It appends the users score twice, at the beginning and end. Mainly because that is exactly what I am telling it to do...I just don't know a way not to do that yet.

Also, since the text doc is one long string, I have no way of pulling any data from it. The text document is currently formatted like this:  


(player1, score1)(player2,score2)etc...


I tried putting in a ""/n"" in various spots within the code to try and get each entry on a new line inside the text document, but that just resulted in a ""/n"" and not a breakline inside the text document.

I'm trying to get the final product to print out something like this...  

Name.......Score  
AAA..........60  
BBB...........55  
CCC..........50  

But at this point I'm going for just making it work at all. Any pointers would be appreciated.

* &lt;nameofprogram&gt;msg

* &lt;nameofprogram&gt;gui

The first would contain all the meaty functions, classes, and so on. The second would have a bunch of functions that return strs for various messages (ex. error messages) or do the printing themselves. The last would of course have the GUI code, and would be the one to run to get the program going, and so this module would import the others.

Now doing slightly bigger projects (at least, for me), I feel like there are better ways in organizing code. I'd appreciate it if anyone could offer advice on what they do, or articles, et cetera. I follow the PEP-8 style guide if that's any use

Do not let the client ask for the data every second, just use this module to let the server push out the data.

Because of this, I was going through some old, *old* code of mine, cleaning it up to show as a OOP vs. Imperitive vs. Functional style, then I found [this](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Avoiding_dots...) .

It basically says (and I understand this part..) that accessing methods on a class in an iteration is slower, that's understandable, it's not traversing the class tree each time and assigning the class method to a variable would be quicker.

Ok.

So I've gone from this:


     block = list(gigantic_data)
     for x in y:
          block.append(x)

to:

     block = list(gigantic_data)
     append = list.append
     for x in y:
          append(block, x)

Which *is* quicker. Granted, it's obvious. But the next bit stumped me for a second. 

I quote:

&gt; Python accesses local variables much more efficiently than global variables. 

Could this be because namespaces are essentially dictionaries and that a local namespace containing fewer attributes that the lookup time is smaller? I thought that dictionary lookup was `O(1)` for dictionaries?

Is there some *different* implementation for local scoping name lookup than there is for the global scope?

* a raytracer [(balls !)](http://i.imgur.com/Wl9NN.png) using a really basic graphic library (more basic than SDL, you only get to display one pixel, using bits per pixels etc.. you have to use bitshifts to multiply colours..)
* a maze solver (.txt file given as argument then you have to use an open(), read() etc.. to store it as a char array then you solve it)  
* a sudoku solver (same as the maze one)
* [Nim Game](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/game_nim/nim.html) in termcaps (yeah really, termcaps)  
* printf() and ls recodes  
* etc..

I've looked at a few Python source codes and it does not seem really ""difficult"" (but I still find Python to be amazingly beautiful).  
 I had to look for an intership (in France) and most requiered languages were : PHP (Zend/Symfony2)/js, Java, Objective C, C++, C#, .Net, RoR and Python.  


What I would like to know is :  

* What do corporations need using Python?
* Is there anything that Python excels at?
* Any other learning ressources?  
* Is learning Python really worth it (I know that learning one more language can't be bad!) or should I rather focus on things like PHP or Java (I know that Django is a Python framework and can be used alongside with PHP) taking into account that I'll graduate in 2015? 

Thank you!

As a personal project I've written a program that you give a directory on a machine and it then goes and hashes each of the files, and reports back duplicate files.

My problem is that smallish trees ( a few thousand files) have no problem, but if I point it at something large like a network share I get a memory error.  (I'm running on Windows 7 32-bit with 4 GB ram)

I suspect the problem is that the dictionary simply grows too large and uses all available memory, but I'm not sure how to verify that is where the problem is.

I don't yet know how to create and write or query databases but if the above IS the problem that will be where I next focus to learn, if not please give me an idea of where to look.

Please DO NOT solve this for me without explaining exactly how the solution works, as that doesn't help me learn.

Obviously the Tkinter stuff is from the GUI so no worries there. What I can't figure out is what is the 3rd argument I need to give `GetNamedSecurityInfo()` I'll keep banging away at this and keep updating as I figure it out.

Sometimes I think just writing it down helps me work through the issues. Thanks for reading!

**Edit 2:**I think I almost have it. See updated code [Here](https://gist.github.com/nrmjba/5714268).

At this point i have gotten it to assign all of the needed permissions but under Special Permissions instead of the standard Full Control I was looking for. I am not sure of the implications of this but at least I can change the permissions of the folders now. 

Still working on this so any input is appreciated! Thanks! 

**Edit 3:**Ok almost done. got all the actual file stuff figured out with the help of u/lsakbaetle3r9. For the record I ended up using `os.system` with the `cacls`command and changed permissions that way.
Worked like a charm!

Is fib the ""item"" or the function? Or the name of the module?

Where do I put this code? In a file where the __main__.py program is?

There doesn't have to be any code in the __init__.py's right?

Is there a certain format for this? Like how all the methods of a class have to be indented in?

Look at the new folder I put in. It is called another_folder and it is under effects.

Can I put this on top of the file named some_file.py:

See, the thing is, I wrote all of my code in my browser when I was doing LPTHW -_- which I realize now wasn't the best idea, but anyway, now I don't really understand how to use python by itself. I can run scripts fine, in cmd or powershell (That's correct, right?)

Where I'm having trouble is installing some of the prerequisites of the tutorial, like pip or virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper. I try to install these and I look at the installation instructions and everything, but I don't get it. They have me doing things in some sort of command line application, but none of them ever specify which. I've tried installing them using Command Line, Powershell, Python command line, git command line, everything I have and none of them work. I can't help but think I maybe don't have the prerequisites for the prerequisites. 

As of now, I think I'm in a bit over my head with http://newcoder.io/ for now. I'm going to finish LPTHW (I'm on lesson 42 I think) and start reading and writing things a bit more at my level...

P.S. Since I told you earlier that I used to write all my code in my browser, I thought I'd ask a few questions about python editors. Is the only way to use them write code --&gt; save code -- &gt;run using command line? I dabbled in C++ for a little bit, and it had compilers that just ran the code directly inside of them. Is there anything of that sort for Python, or do you have any other recommendations?

#Python 3.2.3

Hi all,

I'm playing with modular residue of large powers and moduli.  I've become frustrated with how slowly my script works and have been looking online for coding and mathematical help to reduce the calculation time.

the basic Gist is this....


    a=4**2**(n-2)
    b=2**n-1
    c=a%b
    if c==2:
          #report result

As you can imagine, this is deathly slow for large 'n' (which is what I'm interested in).  So I modified the code as such:

    x=4
    p=2**(n-2)
    m=2**n-1
    while p&gt;1:
         p//=2
         x*=x
         x=x%m
    if x==2:
         #return result

While still deathly slow, it does work slightly better as I can catch some tells early in the process to remove some inputs well before the final calculation.  As I've been teaching myself, it took some time to find things like pow().  However, I've found that :
 
    for n in range(num):
        pow(4,2**(n-2))

Takes similar time to:

    for n in range(num):
        a=4**2**(n-2)

I get similar results with pow(a,b,m) compared to a**b%m.  I am currently trying to wrap my head around the montgomery reduction.  But I've yet to find anything that works faster (significantly and or consistantly) than my original code.

So my questions are as follows:

1.  Besides the Montgomery Reduction, are there any built modules or mathmatical concepts that WILL work faster with obscenely large numbers (think n=50000 to 10**8)?
2.  Can anybody help me figure out (and then implement?) the MR?


Thanks in advance for pointers helps and tips.  




EDIT::  Resolution.  Thanks for all your help and suggestions.  It looks as though I swapped my &gt;&lt; signs when I was testing before, so read my results long before.  Pow(2,2) and 2^2   are indeed similar and pow(2,2,2) vs 2**2%2 is indeed skewed.  However, as I can fail numbers well before they are completely calculated, my original code out performs.  Am still looking into Montgomery Reduction.

1: Create a new python script. I usually name mine 'resources.py' but you can make it anything you want. Store this and your main program in the same folder.

2: Define functions, classes, variables, anything, really, in your resources file.

3: In your main program, put: from &lt;resources file&gt; import &lt;function, etc.&gt;

This will import the given object (so long as it exists in the file you are importing from) and put it in your program. So, if you had a function called function1 and used the from - import command to import it, you could use function1() without it being defined in your file.

1. I'm aware that variables (unless declared as global) only exist within the function that they are declared in.
2. I have a rudimentary understanding of why global variables are generally a bad idea (mutable outside of the function
you're using them in and so unexpected results might occur).

Feel free to correct me on the above if it's wrong!

The question is, what if I want to pass a variable that's been set by one function to another?  I can call functions within functions, but what if I want to say pass the variable back to main() then use it in a another function later (without using  globals).  Should I even be trying to do this?


For example: 

	def functionOne():
		
		x = 1

		return x

	def functionTwo(x): #want to make use of the returned variable from functionOne.
		
		
		x = x*2
		

	def main():

		functionOne()
		functionTwo()
		
		print(x)

	if __name__ ==""__main__"":
		main()
		
I'm aware that I could do something like this:

	def functionOne():
		
		x = 1

		functionTwo()
		

	def functionTwo(x):
		
		#manipulate the variable defined in functionOne
		x = x*2
		
		print(x)
		

	def main():

		functionOne()
		
		
	if __name__ ==""__main__"":
		main()

It's not all that illogical in this example, but sometimes it seems illogical in real code that I'm having to nest functions like this.  I've seen examples after Googling that suggest creating additional namespaces then creating and accessing the variables through these namespaces.  Is  this a good / bad idea?

When I install these packages (say, from a link on Sourceforge) I click the '.exe' and from what I can tell it just copies a whole bunch of .py files then precompiles them into .pyc files... seems straightforward enough. Is it doing anything else?

What is the difference between this and using ""pip"" to install some package. The reason I am confused is because I would have though the most simple way to do anything would be to simply copy a folder of .py files into your ""site-packages"" folder and call it a day.

1325643643.0,13,self.learnpython,o1x2k,I'm planning on doing a 3-part tutorial introduction to programming in Python at my school: input from teachers and students appreciated.,WaxProlix,13,0,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o1x2k/im_planning_on_doing_a_3part_tutorial/,"Yeah. I have a few questions going into this. 

For learners:     
- What has been helpful to you in the past as you learn Python? Any specific explanations that provided ""ah-ha!"" moments?     
- What has been frustrating? Are there certain things that have just not been well-explained to you?    
- Any other input for me? 

For the more seasoned Pythonistas:    
My plan is to break it into 3 sessions of ~2hrs each. The first hour should be me demonstrating and explaining, with the second being them working along with me and then, afterwards, working alone and asking questions if they need help. Topic breakdown for the 3 sessions are thusly:    
1. Some philosophical and pragmatic issues: why program, what is it really, etc. This would be followed by the explanation of basic things like how to start the interpreter (we'll all be SSH'd into a unix box where it's already set up), then variables (small introduction to the notion of data types), flow (if-else, loops), probably functions, and, at the end, moving from working in the 'console' to running .py files. I need a concept for a simple but fun project that can be completed and put into a .py file which will be satisfying to people but which doesn't use too many high-level concepts.    
2. More in-depth look at data types, then namespaces (and import and an explanation of the main() boilerplate crap) and a basic introduction to the notion of classes. I'll start to use things from the standard library here, too, to showcase some of the convenience there. At this point, it's possible to make an implementation of a simple card game (or at least a deck of cards), but that's kind of boring... so I'm open to suggestions as to what to do for a (small) 'closing project'.    
3. The third will be a recap of the first two, and will cover stuff that I may have missed (did I forget range() or len() somehow? are there fun uses for operators that aren't obvious?). I'll also try to talk about list comprehensions and either talk about a web library or a database lib or something like that (matplotlib and something like scipy would be nice, but I never use em myself). I will probably talk about regular expressions. I will probably mention collections and itertools. The last project will probably be a longer one, dealing with basic NLP stuff (it'll be a group of linguists, so that's relevant) and we can do some basic word counting stuff to answer fun but trivial questions about a text corpus. My initial plan was to find a corpus, clean it, and then do analysis but I think that might be too ambitious. 

I guess my question is: is this too rigorous? There'll be a week between classes with 'homework' (practice exercizes) assigned but probably not done. Are there things I should be sure to go into? Are there things I should be sure to avoid? Is the pacing too fast? Too slow? 

I'm a pretty decent programmer and I generally do well communicating ideas, but am new to the whole teaching-my-peers thing. All input from all walks of life greatly appreciated.

1317085903.0,11,self.learnpython,ksfd7,Do you know about enumerate? Iterating through a list along with indexes.,rlayton,13,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ksfd7/do_you_know_about_enumerate_iterating_through_a/,"enumerate is a little known function in python that is easy to use and addresses a standard pattern when working with lists.
If you noticed in your code a pattern like this:

    list_a = [4, 6, 2, 7]
    for i in range(len(list_a)):
        print ""Item at index %d is %d"" % (i, list_a[i])

You can reduce a lot of the clutter by using enumerate:

    list_a = [4, 6, 2, 7]
    for i, value in enumerate(list_a):
        print ""Item at index %d is %d"" % (i, value)


Why is this important? Well, if you have multiple lists that you need to work from, using the same index, or need to ensure indexes are correctly matched with values, enumerate solves these problems. It also makes your code cleaner and there is less chance of a bug appearing when using indexes of lists.

Won't that use a lot of memory - creating a new list like that? No, it uses a generator, which means that values are created just before they are used! Don't believe me? Try ""print enumerate([3,2,1])"" - it won't print the values, just the generator expression. To get the values use it in a loop, or use ""list(enumerate([3,2,1]))"".

Technical details: the enumerate function takes a list and returns a generator, returning tuples (index, value), where index is equal to range(len(list)) and value is the value of thelist at the given index.

The whole thing works fine, but it won't work if I simply iterate over the list...it only works if I use `for i in range(len(date_list))`. I was told this is bad practice, but I can't get the code to work without it.

What happens is, I need to use `int()` on each list item to convert it from a string to an integer, but `int()` doesn't work on numbers with zeros in front of them (so if the user enters '06/05/1984', there will be an error unless we get rid of the zeros beforehand). That's what the `for` loop is for.

Here's the difference between the two programs' outputs: In the broken one, the list items won't stay integers after the `for` loop is done; not only do they go back to being strings, but the `0` we got rid of comes back! For some reason this doesn't happen in the working code, and yet the only thing that's different is I use `for i in range(len(date_list)):` instead of `for i in date_list:`

I know my error has to be something stupid simple, but I can't see it. Please help!

So far this program works fine except for yielding the same problem I ran into in my last post.

This is actually a hugely optimized version of this program compared to the first draft: I used to have a function for each conversion, e.g. `dec2hex()`, `dec2oct()`, `bin2dec()`, bin2hex()`, etc. I'm proud of this version, but I know it's still wrought with newbie mistakes. Let me know how I can improve this!

One thing I forgot to mention is this program also outputs the work for each conversion so that users can see how the conversions are done instead of just getting the final answers.

So step 2 now is to automate the process entirely (which also means I can process more frequently than beofre - daily instead of weekly).

The issue I'm having is the way the script works is it:

* Poplib to find report emails and save attachment locally
* zipfile to unzip the the attchment
* finally csv to write the content to a single csv file

Well now instead of writing it to a csv file I just want to compile the content from all attachments and display them on a url. Then I can set up a cronjob so this happens daily and this way there will be a nice daily breakdown of all our accounts.

The issue here is how do I process the attachments without saving them locally first? I want this script to just run on the server, but it seems I have to save the attachment somewhere first, before I can process it...is there a way to unzip and parse an email attachment without saving it locally first?

Let me introduce myself. Apart from long walks on the beach and candle light dinners, I've been a PHP dev for 5 years professionally. I've loved every moment, and wouldn't trade it for the world as it helped me understand how the internet works. All that changed recently, I guess the rose tinted glasses I had stapled to my head fell off. I've been planning the creation of a simple and powerful RESTful service with some friends of mine as good group project and suddenly I realized, although I could develop this in a weekend in PHP, it's the same language I've been working with since High School. 

I've grown up, and my vocabulary of languages should too. I've looked into Node and Python, and since I hate Javascript this seemed like the best place to start learning something new. 

After a few seconds of Googlefu I've found a video series that seems promising (as it covers Python and touches on Django which highly interest me). 

[Tuts+ Python From Scratch](http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/python-from-scratch/)

Let me know if you would stay away from this video series, or if there is anything else I should know about Python before jumping in.

Whenever I have some spare time I go through tutorials and try to accomplish simple things. Recently I decided to take on an exercise of my own and recode an existing perl script that I was using for work (made by someone else) in python, just to see if I could.


Goal 1 - reproduce exactly what I already had

Goal 2 - improve and add extra features


What's the script's purpose?
- To count the query throughput from a log file (i.e. how many entries per second/minute/hour)


The log file has a standard format like this:


INFO : [query] [2012/12/10 19:19:51.819] 0c9250e0-3272-4e2c-bab4-0a4fd88e0d75     this is a test line


Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/4374180

And here's a test log file: https://gist.github.com/4374226


Some stuff I thought about adding:

- Make it more generic so it can work with other log formats

- Add extra output formats (right now it's just simple csv)

- Automatically create nice graphs from the results

- Pull log files from remote locations through ssh

- Specify ignore patterns (right now it ignores DEBUG lines since that's what I needed)


I would love to hear if this works for you and what I could improve in terms of efficiency and style!

the problem I'm experiencing is that listmarkers has a length of 559, and when I check the output file it only has 373 lines.  Now, I'm a curious sort and decided to create Outfile2 as an experiment.  Interestingly, both files were blank when I changed the above for loop to:


    for h in range(len(listmarkers)):

        if h &lt; 373:

",TheBrownies,10,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/106ffx/bizarre_obfuscation_encryption_algorithm/,"At work I use an off the shelf product, that we interface with using a web services API, and as part of this the product has a tool that generates a config file.

The config file consists of various datapoints, one of them being a very bizarre encryption/obfuscation algorithm for generating an authentication string in the scheme of username:password. They do this, so they can pseudo obfuscate the username/password over non-ssl connections, which we do not use. They also do this so the username and password aren't easily discerned by looking at this config file. 

I need to generate this config using python and the web services api. I know the input values, and the output values, just not how they are converted from one to the other.

My colleague and I deciphered that each character was being represented by 4 characters, which seem to be some form of hex value, nothing greater than f. We figured this out by generating similar but different strings, where the first half was the same, but the second was different and longer by 2 characters, so the encoded string was 8 characters longer.






Pretty sure these are some characters:



a = 1610, 8553, b433, b1fa, 21b4


b = 6f66, 6dc4


c = 1633, 67ac


Here's a full input string:


aaaaaaaa:bbbbbbb



Here's a full output string:


c1fb798b1610ee227a5c43315d006775a50da4c8debcb39f58899c938f5d8a092c6e

or


c1fb 798b 1610 ee22 7a5c 4331 5d00 6775 a50d a4c8 debc b39f 5889 9c93 8f5d 8a09 2c6e


In the same string, repeating characters do not seem to output the same string value, so not sure what that means, other than it possibly incrementing some character map shift or something like a rot13 possibly.



I can generate another string, and repeat the first half off of it and the first part of it all the way to the end of the repeating part matches exactly.



I'm somewhat baffled, and I don't think this is irreversible, it doesn't appear to be a salted md5 hash or anything to me.

So I'm around lesson 40 something in LPTHW where we have to design our own game. I really enjoy poker so I thought I'd make a really short and simple heads-up poker game. The biggest issue I think I'll have will be figuring out a way to rank cards and hands but I don't want to think about that just yet and right now I have a different problem.

I would really like to make a class or SOMETHING that has basically a list of commands for the bot(or Villain in my code's case) to do when reacting to certain bet amounts and based off of his own holdings. How would I go about doing something like this? Here's beginner attempt to start this: 
    
    import random

    pocket_pairs = ['AA', 'KK', 'QQ', 'JJ', 'TT', '99', '88', '77', '66', '55',
				'44', '33', '22']
    cards = pocket_pairs[random.randint(0, len(pocket_pairs)-1)]

     print ""You are dealt %s"" % cards
     from villain import villain_shows #this is from a different module that basically is the same as the 
                                       #cards/pocket_pairs variables. Not sure if it was the right way to go  
                                       #about giving villain a different set of cards

    class PreFlop(object):

	      def __init__(self):
		     self.VillainPreFlop = VillainPreFlop()

	      def bet(self):
		     print ""how much do you want to bet?""
		
		     hero_bet = raw_input(""&gt; $"")
		     print ""Hero bets $%s"" % hero_bet
		     villain.action()
				
		
    class VillainPreFlop(object):
	
	       def action(self):
	
		      if hero_bet &gt; 10:
			     print ""villain folds""
		      else:
			     print ""villain flips table over""
			
     villain = VillainPreFlop()
     preflop = PreFlop()

     preflop.bet()

As you probably can tell, the 'hero_bet' variable won't work in the VillainPreflop class but I left it there to kind of show you how ideally I'd like the code to work. Again, I left out the other half of villain's decision making based on card rank because I don't want to worry about it just yet.  ANY help is appreciated

tl;dr- How do I make a list of commands for my poker bot to follow when faced with a decision?

My answer to the problem worked out fine but the suggested solution was a little more verbose and I want to make sure I'm not building a bad habit by unknowingly cutting a necessary corner.

EDIT: I appreciate all the assistance - just to be clear, I'm only using 'str' as a variable because that is what CodingBat uses as the default string variable ([here is the problem](http://codingbat.com/prob/p145834)). I won't do that anymore.

[Monkeyget](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lpkwe/comparing_variables_a_question_on_a_codingbat/c2ul2jy) has offered a legitimate reason for using the last2 variable:

owner.xml --&gt; car.xml --&gt; model.xml --&gt; company.xml

Each file contains information about a specific object (for example, car.xml might contain ""year built"", ""number of miles driven"", ""color"", etc.), as well as a reference to an object in a different file (owner.xml lists all cars owned by the owner, which you can look up in cars.xml).

This means that the entire database is in memory at all times (again, it's about 20 MB and not expected to grow). Is this a good idea?

* Doing ""if len(kwargs)"" instead of just ""if kwargs"". (Maybe there's a reason for this? I would think they were functionally identical as long as kwargs is a dict, with the latter being more Pythonic).

I'm a 26 year old college dropout who has finally decided to learn how to program. After numerous attempts at sitting down and teaching myself this mystical, esoteric art over the past couple years, this is the first time I've made it past the usual 3 days. I'm proud to say that today marks the 7th day of this attempt and I'm still feeling very interested and enthusiastic (I think I have Learn Python The Hard Way to thank for this - Zed really knows how to dumb things down and explain them clearly and with good examples).

Let me get to the point:

Earlier today, I found beginpython.com and I was absolutely overjoyed; I had been looking for something like this for a few days and happened to stumble upon it through one of the programming-related subreddits here. I devoured the first three practice categories (Variables &amp; Data Types, Functions, and Conditionals) and made it halfway through the fourth (For Loops) before I hit a brick wall on practice exercise 7 ([link here](http://www.beginpython.com/quiz/view_question/s4-q7)).

Initially, the modulo operator confused me and I had put together an unnecessarily complicated if/elif statement in my for loop before I realized all I have to do is isolate the odd numbers and add them together.

This is where it became unsolveable for me. I can't seem to wrap my head around how to tell Python, after I've isolated the odd numbers, to add all of those odd numbers together.

The closest I've gotten to this solution is:

def addOddNumbers(start, end):
	total = 0
	for i in range(start, end):
		if i % 2 == 1: 
			total += i + end # changed this statement after i posted because this is even closer, but still no dice.
	return total

I assume I have everything right up until ""total += i + end"", however I understand that that also may not be the case.

I don't necessarily want the solution, but rather I'd like an explanation of how to go about achieving a task such as the one in the practice exercise.

Any help would be very much appreciated. :)

**SOLVED:** Thanks to track02 sort of laboring through the logic with me, I ended up working out the solution on my own, but I'm not going to ruin it for anyone else who may be stuck on that exercise and happens to stumble into this topic.

I know it's telling me that the object hasn't been defined yet but I'm not sure how to go about doing that since I can't define a room without pointing at another one.

The problem is the following:

What is happening is that i ask for a raw input for ""next"". 
Then i just want to give options the user to answer. But to make it more friendly i would like to make this program accept answers like ""Taunt the damn bear"". So I'd like python to check like ""If taunt and bear is in the answer (they don't have to be exactly ""taunt bear"") then do the following procedure: xxx

I tried a couple of ways, like 

    elif next.lower() in ""taunt"" + ""bear"" and not bear_moved :

Every time I give this script a large number it spits out a prime number as the solution.  But there are some situations where a prime number is not returned.

But lets say I give n the value of 29874230987 (I just randomly hit numbers).  The scrips returns 3652553, a prime number.  

My question is this:  Why do I consistently get prime numbers when I assign n to a huge number, but when I assign n to a smaller even number like 50 or 100, I do not get a prime number returned?

What I would expect to happen would be that the child widget gets the KEYDOWN, acts on it if it's a Ctrl+A, `event.Skip()`s it if it doesn't, at which point the main window's CHAR_HOOK would catch it.

What actually happens, is the opposite.  The window catches it with CHAR_HOOK, acts upon it willy-nilly, and never passes it to the child widget's KEYDOWN.

I could implement a check to see what has focus, but that's pretty messy and unmaintainable.  I'd prefer to actually fix the problem.

Is there a way to optimize my use of memory? Let's say (since I was doing this recently, it's in mind) for example, that I'm looking to count word n-grams of length 3-5 in a large dataset (several GBs).

Now, the obvious way to do it is to just run through the files and get counts, but then you'd eventually run out of memory because there are so many n-grams.

So there are lots of other ways of doing things, possibly using a database updating the counts in it between files or something like that, right?

1. What I'm wondering is, is there a good optimal way to do this?
1. Is there a way to know when I am approaching maximum memory usage and then write out the data to the database at that time in order to maximize the use of my ram? (possibly a try except of some sort on out of memory errors?)

1372250915.0,7,self.learnpython,1h3rph,Need another set of eyes on this simple Python app (and some questions),TeamTuck,9,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1h3rph/need_another_set_of_eyes_on_this_simple_python/,"Hello everyone.  I am a CIT instructor at a technical college and have come up with a small C++ app to clock students in and out (some have coop jobs and it's hard to keep track of 20-40 students).  The app I created (C++ version) earlier this year has worked out quite well, but some other instructors wanted to implement this in their class.  I decided to rewrite the app in Python and use the Tkinter GUI to make it a lot easier than the previous version:  all text/CLI based.

Most of the app is ready to go and the basic functionality is there.  There are just a few things I need another set of eyes on, thus why I'm posting here.

Disclaimer:  This is my first Python app (more than the basic stuff) so don't judge me.  I've basically pieced tutorials together since that's how I learn programming the best.

This app is extremely simple:  there are two listboxes(available students and present students) with Clock In, Clock Out and Exit buttons.  Students come in, find their name in the AStudents listbox, select it and click on the Clock in Button.  Done.  If they have to leave early, they can find their name in the PStudents listbox, select it and click on the Clock out Button.  All of these actions get written out into a log file (log file is named after the MM/DD/YYYY format), then another Python script emails it to the instructor.

I do have future plans on adding more things such as passwords for each student, an admin console, etc.  But other instructors need this going by the end of the week.  

1) I have built in a ""resume"" feature to where if a student accidentally exits/closes the program, the instructor can just click on a resume menu item and all is well.  When I try this out on the app, it will look at 'resume.txt', input the first name in the text file into the PStudent listbox, but give the error ""TclError: bad listbox index ""Cecil Huffines"": must be active, anchor, end, @x,y, or a number""  Is it because it wants to refer to the item number in the listbox(0, 1, 2, etc)?  Not sure what's up with that or how I could get around it.

Maybe there is another way to accomplish a resume feature that I haven't thought of?

2) As I mentioned, a log file with each students name and clock in/out time is created when the buttons are pressed.  I would like these logs to look a bit better by actually showing how many hours and minutes that they have been present.  For example, our school hours are from 8-2:30, and each student is here for 6 hours a day (take out lunch and breaks) for our attendance records.  I would like the logs to say:

John Doe
Clocked in at 8:00
Clocked out at 1:00
Present for 4.5 hours

Each time that I try to look up information on how to calculate time, it's always a simple app where you have to put in the times manually.  Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this.

3) If a student has not clocked in and they accidentally press the Clock Out button, it needs to show a proper error message of what they did.  As of the code below, doing this action will do nothing, but console throws out an error message stating that the ""tuple index out of range"".  Any way to correct this?

I think that's all I have right now.  This app is decently solid as it stands but needs some dummy proofing.  My eyes can't take any more code at the moment, thus I needed some opinions and advice.  TIA!

I am wondering what the best (if any) validation methods I should use are?

I know I could just try the insert, and rollback if it fails, but I'd rather do a bit of error checking before I get to that point.

What I have thought up thus far looks like this:

    def validate_failures(data_dict):
        """""" Runs through an FR dictionary and validates the contents. """"""
        booleans = ('RepairRequired', 'Closed', ... etc.)
        ints = ('OwnerID', 'IncidentType', 'ResourceType', etc)
        floats = ('OdoMeter', 'HourMeter', etc)
        
        bad_entries = []
        # My data is stored in a dictionary, and each entry is a dictionary with the above headers as keys
        for pk, entry in data_dict.items():
            for key in booleans:   # Validate Booleans here:
                if entry[key] not in (True, False):   # I know this is half-assed, but you get the gist
                    logging.warning('Validation error. Issue: {0}, '
                                    '{1}: {2}'.format(pk, key, entry['key']
                bad_entries.append(key)
            for key in ints:
                # if key isn't a valid SQL integer, e.g. &gt;&gt; isinstance(entry[key], int)
                # gimme an error
            for key in floats:
                # as above, but allow floats


Of course, that oft repeated mantra of ""don't check for type"" is resounding in my brain.

Does anyone have any advice on a better way? I just think it makes sense to do a bit of error checking ahead of time, rather than have the guy run the whole thing just to find that half his spreadsheet wasn't valid.

Then in the script where I have the BlackJackCard(), I want to make the individual cards for the deck by instantiating BlackJackCard. 

I would like to do something like this:

    ace_spades = BlackJackCard('ace', 'spade')

When I do this and run the module, I get an error. 

    NameError: global name 'card_game_values' is not defined

I pretty much want to make 52 instantiations of the BlackJackCard class and then put them all in a list. It is my first major project, and I am not 100% good with classes and organizing projects. I know I will have to re-make my code since this is like the 4th time I have tried to make ""deck"". 

Also, the reason why I have a Card object as well and not just the BlackJackCard, is because I plan to make other card games like Uno, maybe Quibbler, etc. Other card games with other card values. I was thinking OOP will be best for this because of that, but I can be wrong :) Any advice would be great.

Am I understanding this correctly?,NarcoticNarcosis,12,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1fznct/boolean_order_of_operations_am_i_understanding/,"Using CodeAcademy for my learning. I started doing Boolean operators and shit last night and it got my head spinning. I THINK I finally understand how they can all work, but I want to be sure before moving on. 

So, when boolean operators are chained together (as we'll see in a minute), the computer calculates them and spits out the final result. There's an order in which these statements are calculated, which goes: 

* 1 not 

* 2 and

* 3 or

so in the following problems, we arrive at the answer because the computer essentially does the following:

    # False or not True and True
    bool_one = False


working from the Order of operations:

    False or not True and True

because not True == False...

    False or False and True

because False and True == False...

    False or False

because False or False == False...

    False

====

for the next problem:

    # False and not True or True
    bool_two = True

because not True == False...

    False and False or True

because False and False == False...

    False or True

because False or True == True...

    True

====


    # True and not (False or False)
    bool_three = True

We have the parentheses here, so we do those first. 

    True and not (False or False)

because False or False == False...

    True and not False

now we resume normal calculations. Because not False == True...

    True and True

because True and True == True...

    True

====

    # not not True or False and not True
    bool_four = True

I'm gonna go from left to right here. Not True == False, so...
 
    not False or False and not True

because not False == True...

    True or False and not True

because not True == False...

    True or False and False

because False and False == False...

    True or False

because True or False == True...

    True

====

For the last one...

     # False or not (True and True)
     bool_five = False

Parentheses again. Because True and True == True...

    False or not True

because not True == False...

    False or False

because False or False == False...

    False.

trying to install [nose testing](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (or later numpy and such).  

I'm not computer *illiterate*, but i've never really done any of the deep stuff.  but every time i go to install something, the instructions start saying things I don't understand.  I don't know what type of file it is.  how to uncompress it.  where to put it.  everything gives instructions for using linux or unix.  i see sudo everywhere, and I don't know who he is.  distributions, pips, stacks ...

i don't even know where to begin.  I just want to get it so i can `import thatthing` and continue programming.

is there like a beginners guide or something?


**edit: it might not be the proper way, but hawkeye found executable versions of all the libraries.  so i used those. [list of libraries](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ftkcw/how_do_i_install_a_package_i_have_no_idea/cadup1q)

Okay, I've decided to get back into programming after not messing around with it for a few years. Last time I mainly worked in php. While I never got very deep into it, its still created my base mindset toward programming. And the thing throwing my mindset off the most is not learning and having immediate access to SQL.  
  
Now, I have to assume most applications don't use the overhead of running a database unless they really need to, correct? If so, whats the ""normal"" way for storing data?  
  
For example, my favorite way to practice a concept I was struggling with was to create text RPG/fight games, as it allowed me to establish a base level of background complexity and I could easily think of multiple sample ideas to practice with.  
  
So, lets say I needed to have ~30 each of items, monsters, etc. What would be the ""proper"" way to store these? Just a bunch of nested lists/dictionaries?  That's the only thing I can think of, but its feels so.... ugly. I'm guessing if thats the case, its also normal practice to write a separate program to create/modify the resulting mess?  
  
I hope some of that made sense, and I apologize again for my inability to make my thoughts seem coherent. And just to make it clear, I'm looking for a specific solution to my example, but rather ""design principles"".

I do not need any further assistance. Thank you very much Remag9330.**

Im working on my uni project (its my first time using classes) and it involves making a class that takes a file and gets data from it. And the data is to be printed out in a readable fashion. The data is stored in a dictionary, called ""counts"", which is declared in the class __init__ function. I am now writing the __str__ function to manipulate the output when using the print(className) command. This function therefor needs two parameters; self and counts.  
   
    __str__(self, counts)    #Like so

But now I cannot figure out how to get it to work. I have built this small class to show my problem: 

    class learnpython(object):

Now my horizons are expanding, though, and I would like to pick up and become proficient in Python. I will be using it primarily for webdev, but down the line will also be interested in developing desktop apps as well.

**EDIT**: Thanks so much for your help everyone.  Just want to explain out loud so it sinks in.

To force python into treating them like integers, I have to use `int(raw_input(""&gt; ""))` in order to explain to python that the input will indeed be an integer.

I'm confused about why you have to define  guess as ""0"" to begin with. I understand that without doing that, you have an infinite loop. What I'm trying to get at is WHY that loop happens (pardon my ignorance!). Additionally, why don't you need an ""if"" before the ""print ""just right""""

I have been using computers for 20 years and working on all kinds of areas with computers from support, installation, rendering in 3d studio Max and Maya. made some of my own websites in HTML back in the days with some tiny newbie ASP extensions. All alot of years ago. In my current job I have been lucky enough to have time to learn some programming and have chosen Python for three main reasons.

1. Many people say its easy.
2. If I get okay at it I can make my own data processing tools to help myself at work.
3. If I get even better I can add stuff to support the special setup we have at work made around Maya.


Two years ago I read a chunk of A byte of Python but stopped again because I had no real project to work on. A month or two ago I started again with TheNewBoston: Python Tutorial, then some Learn Python the Hard Way. 


Where I am now is that I have made a few small programs/scripts for reading a list of numbers and using that with loops to generate some XMLish looking output files. Last one I used the PIL image to make a mosaic by reading the pixel values and finding the closest value.


I got stuck when trying to learn how to use a real XML parsing module because I couldn't easily see what data it had picked up.


So now I'm looking to buy 1-3 books that I can focus on to get more base knowledge. But i'm unsure what is best for me. I have borrowed Mark Lutz's ""Learning Python"" 3rd edition but find it a bit 'slow'. I don't need to learn how to install a program or basic computer usage. Maybe i'm just being a bit impatient so if this book is brilliant just tell me to keep at it. 


I think I could use one book for teaching me the fundamentals of Python and Programming. Not sure if I'm actually past this step since I already done a few small tools. I'm thinking about getting [Learn Python The Hard Way, 2nd Edition](http://www.lulu.com/shop/zed-shaw/learn-python-the-hard-way-2nd-edition/paperback/product-18839751.html), mainly because I already read a good part of the online version and I liked it. I am open to other suggestions or additions to this one.


I guess the next step could be the new [The Python Standard Library by Example](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Standard-Library-Example-Developers/dp/0321767349/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339505533&amp;sr=1-1), but I'm unsure if its too complicated for me.


A third book could be more related to Autodesk Maya, though I think it might be a bit early for this. 


I'm not that interested in books that focus mainly on building large websites. 


So far I have selected Python 2.7.x because then I have access to the PIL module (used it in my mosaic script). If you think this is a bad call please tell me so. :) I found PIL for 2.x a lot faster than I could find something similar for 3.x, but I could of cause be wrong. ;)

I am pretty decent at flinging powershell as well. 

I've decided to take on learning Python and try to get a real gig as a developer sometime down the road instead of my SysAdmin duties I currently have to make a living. So that said, I have a basic understanding of programming in general and have the aptitude to understand how things are working.

However, I'm just not piecing together the way that Class variables work. 

I'm currently going through Dive Into Python 3 as my first introduction to Python. (I started with the Django tutorials but realized quickly I should learn python first). 

I'm currently on this section. http://diveintopython3.ep.io/iterators.html#a-plural-rule-iterator 

The book introduces you to Classes by re-writing the previous chapters Generator, a Plural Rules Match/Apply generator. (http://diveintopython3.ep.io/generators.html). 

The problem I'm having is this: 
    
    class LazyRules:
    rules_filename = 'plural6-rules.txt'

    def __init__(self):
        self.pattern_file = open(self.rules_filename, encoding='utf-8')
        self.cache = []

    def __iter__(self):
        self.cache_index = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        self.cache_index += 1
        if len(self.cache) &gt;= self.cache_index:
            return self.cache[self.cache_index - 1]

        if self.pattern_file.closed:
            raise StopIteration

        line = self.pattern_file.readline()
        if not line:
            self.pattern_file.close()
            raise StopIteration

        pattern, search, replace = line.split(None, 3)
        funcs = build_match_and_apply_functions(
            pattern, search, replace)
        self.cache.append(funcs)
        return funcs

    rules = LazyRules()
     

In walking through this in my head, the first time you iterate through rules, you start here:
    
    self.cache = [] -- It's empty.
    self.cache_index = 0 -- It's Zero
   
    We call next(self). (We Iterate). 
    self.cache_index is now = 1
   
    if len([]) &gt;= 1: (It's not). 
   
    if self.pattern_file.closed: (Pass)
    line = self.pattern_file.readline() -- We load the pattern file
    if not line: (Pass)
   
    pattern, search, replace = line.split(None, 3) -- Split the pattern file and grab the first data set from the line and store them as pattern, search, and replace. 
   
    funcs = build_match_and_apply_functions(
            pattern, search, replace) -- We pass these into our previously built build_match_and_apply_functions     function, which returns two functions which we then store in funcs?: 
   
    def build_match_and_apply_functions(pattern, search, replace):  
        def matches_rule(word):
            return re.search(pattern, word)
        def apply_rule(word):
            return re.sub(search, replace, word)
        return (matches_rule, apply_rule)
   
-----------
Now..
    
            self.cache.append(funcs) -- self.cache = [(functions tuple)] len(self.cache) is now = 1
            return funcs

    rules = LazyRules()
   

--------------

Sorry for the wall of text. 

My confusion comes on the iteration process. When it iterates through again with next()
   
    len(self.cache) = [] -- It's 1
    self.cache_index = -- It's now 2 (Due to self.cache_index += 1)
   
            if len(self.cache) &gt;= self.cache_index: -- (If 1 &gt;= 2)
                return self.cache[self.cache_index - 1] (Fail, we don't return yet). 
    

Here's my fundamental breakdown in understanding. The book introduces this as the walkthrough, but it confuses the crap out of me, because I'm wondering how the Index check is every ANYTHING but LESS than the cache_index, since cache_index is always +1 from the previous iteration, and self.cache starts at 0. 

I'm also wondering where in this selection process is there a rule match that breaks the read in the pattern file. It seems to indicate that if it runs through and matches one of the cases in our function generator, that there's something that tells it to stop iterating, but all I see is line reads and an index check. I'm so confused. 
-----------This is the book's description of the process---------------------
When the module is imported, it creates a single instance of the LazyRules class, called rules, which opens the pattern file but does not read from it.
(HERE IS WHERE I AM CONFUSED) --&gt;When asked for the first match and apply function, it checks its cache but finds the cache is empty. So it reads a single line from the pattern file, builds the match and apply functions from those patterns, and caches them.
Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the very first rule matched. If so, no further match and apply functions are built, and no further lines are read from the pattern file.
Furthermore, for the sake of argument, suppose that the caller calls the plural() function again to pluralize a different word. The for loop in the plural() function will call iter(rules), which will reset the cache index but will not reset the open file object.
The first time through, the for loop will ask for a value from rules, which will invoke its __next__() method. This time, however, the cache is primed with a single pair of match and apply functions, corresponding to the patterns in the first line of the pattern file. Since they were built and cached in the course of pluralizing the previous word, they’re retrieved from the cache. The cache index increments, and the open file is never touched.
Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the first rule does not match this time around. So the for loop comes around again and asks for another value from rules. This invokes the __next__() method a second time. This time, the cache is exhausted — it only contained one item, and we’re asking for a second — so the __next__() method continues. It reads another line from the open file, builds match and apply functions out of the patterns, and caches them. &lt;-- (HERE IS WHERE I AM CONFUSED)
This read-build-and-cache process will continue as long as the rules being read from the pattern file don’t match the word we’re trying to pluralize. If we do find a matching rule before the end of the file, we simply use it and stop, with the file still open. The file pointer will stay wherever we stopped reading, waiting for the next readline() command. In the meantime, the cache now has more items in it, and if we start all over again trying to pluralize a new word, each of those items in the cache will be tried before reading the next line from the pattern file.

-----------This is the book's description of the process---------------------

Another example before getting here is a Fibonacci Class. This class took me some time to walk through, but I understand it as on each iteration, fib = self.a as it is currently defined. Fib HOLDS that value all the way through the next() and returns it at the end. The next time through self.a has become the previous self.b, and self.b has become self.a + self.b. So I'm confident that I understand that the Class Variables are changeable in the previous example, but I don't see the long tail of how it all ties together and how it stops iterating or why it chooses to stop iterating, since the cache always being lower than the cache_index just throws me. 
   
class Fib:
    '''iterator that yields numbers in the Fibonacci sequence'''

    def __init__(self, max):
        self.max = max

    def __iter__(self):
        self.a = 0
        self.b = 1
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        fib = self.a
        if fib &gt; self.max:
            raise StopIteration
        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
        return fib

These games are aimed at novice programmers, so they are written for simplicity (hence the lack of list comprehensions and the use of the occasional global variable, etc.).

You need to download [Pygame](http://pygame.org) to get them to run.

The games are a Flood It clone, a Bejeweled clone, an Othello clone, and a Connect Four clone.

My main questions are:

1) What are the parts that are most confusing to understand?

2) Is there enough commenting? Are there any comments that should be added?

3) Are there bits of code that could be simplified or even removed? (I've previously found functions that I never call in previous reviews of the code.)

4) Is it understandable by a novice programmer just by reading the code &amp; comments?

The code (and the image/sound files) can be downloaded from here: [http://inventwithpython.com/extragames.zip](http://inventwithpython.com/extragames.zip)

I was playing with the Multiprocessing module. Just basically learning how one dispatches functions etc. (Extremely green with it.)

I ran this, and as I expected, it prints here, then I instantly get a raw_input() call, instantly after the do_stuff() call. Hitting enter a few times (much more than the 5 that I call it with.) it loops indefinitely.

Mashing return keeps this up until it starts erroring about some inaccessible memory location, then it bluescreens. 

Code:

        import multiprocessing

        def do_stuff():
            print 'here'

        jobs = []

            p.start()

What I guess is happening, is that because I am not locking it somehow (as in, using the mutex lock to acquire, then release after the function has returned) it's writing to the same memory locations.

For those not familiar with LoL or any other dota-style game, you can die and respawn in that game.

The idea is to create an application which reads your respawn timer and notifies you just before you respawn via a sound notification.

[This excellent tutorial/article](http://hub.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117) helped me form an understanding of how automating games work.

There's one problem, how do I **read the values of the death timer image?**

http://i.imgur.com/Ndh4KXX.jpg

I've googled this subject, and most answers involve **heavily scientific and experimental libraries**, while I see bots do very similar things (maybe in completely different ways) perfectly fine.

For example, there's a service called [realmeye](http://www.realmeye.com). They have a bot which you can message ingame.

You can send the bot different commands with text parameters.

I'm sure that the bot somehow manages to actually read all the text and not a set of preset images for the commands they use because it can recognise randomised passwords to be correct or incorrect.

ex: It can read /set password kc9amcb02n

and validate that password as being correct or incorrect.

[Here is an example of what the text would look like
](http://i.imgur.com/20a188H.png)

Of course, these examples may be solved in various vary different ways. It may be that realmeye devs somehow found a way to directly receive the chat as text.

I've been working on this problem for a while now and I cannot seem to find a way to approach it.

I've got two csv files : source.csv and report.csv

source.csv looks like this:

    Target,  OutHits,  Spend
    target01,  1956,  37.452280
    target1234,  483,  7.297572
    target2348,  933,  7.000544

report.csv looks similar (it actually has more fields but I just pasted the ones I'm interested in to keep it short):

    Target,  InHits,  Income
    target01,  1956,  370.452280
    target02,  383,  798.297572
    target1234,  333,  13.000544


Basically, what I want to do is go through the source.csv file, take the first Target and then search for that target in the report.csv file.
Then I can output to another csv file : Target, OutHits, InHits, Spend, Income
And go to the next target, like so until the end of the file.

Not all targets are in both files, but if a target from source.csv is not found in report.csv it should still be in the final file.

Unfortunately, this is all I have so far:  [http://pastebin.com/XAGKT9n6](http://pastebin.com/XAGKT9n6)

The print in line 9 is just used to check that the script is going over the csv file correctly.

I understand why its not working. I cannot figure out how to iterate over the targets in source.csv and iterate over the targets in report.csv.

I've been reading that this probably is much easier with a dictionary instead of using csv.reader() but I still don't know how to properly iterate over the targets.

My question is, how would I pause until the stream is done? I've been over and over the Gstreamer docs, and I can't find anything that would help me.

So this is what I'm dealing with:

&gt; I have a module A, where

&gt; * submodule A.B contains a function called ""func1""
&gt; * submodule A.B.C contains a function called ""func2""

&gt; I also have a separate module B with an class C

&gt; Lastly, A.B.func1 uses class C from module B, through the import statement ""from B import C""

What I've learned so far is that, if I just do:

&gt; from A.B import func1

func1 will work.

However, if I were to do:

&gt; from A.B import func1

&gt; from A.B.C import func2

func1 will not work.

After digging around and trying stuff, I've found that A.B.func1's usage of C would look at func1's globals to find C (put there by its ""from B import C""). However, the entry for C in the globals is overwritten when ""from A.B.C import func2"" is executed. Basically, the fact that I have both A.B.C and B.C is confusing the global namespace and thus causing this unexpected failure, despite that within each module the code looks correct.

However, I'm at a loss for how to prevent this from happening in the future. What naming rules/conventions should I follow to prevent something like this happening? A drastic solution might be to make sure you never have two submodules with the same name, but I would imagine with a large enough library system this may be difficult to upkeep. What does everyone else do in this situation?

Perhaps I should be using imports differently, and do something other than ""from ... import ...""?

    x = 1
    y = 2

	        total += y
	    x,y = y, x+y

My question is this:  how does this variable allocation work? It seems like it is simultaneously assigning values for x and y.  did quantum computing arrive and i missed it?

If the variables were assigned sequentially, they would alter the value of the other variable in an undesired way.  if my code looked like this:

    while y &lt;= 4000000:
	    list.append(y)
	    if y % 2 == 0:
		    total += y
        y = x+y

y being defined first would change the value of x in a way that is undesired.  so i found out that this works

I've been asking some questions about a program I'm writing.

Well, now I'm almost done with polishing my program. But since it's a very dynamic program, I've been constantly updating it, fixing stuff, adding features.

There are quite some people (less than 100) using my program quite regularly, and there have been days where I pushed out multiple updates.

This program is supposed to stay up-to-date, it's rather prone to breaking.

Now, my point. I want to implement an auto-updating feature. 
How I wanted to tackle this was by running a script, checking if there is an update. If there is, exit the main program. Back-up it in some backup folder, download the new one and done!

But I feel like this isn't a great/secure/^pythonic way to do things. I have no idea what risks there are, if any (though, I think there definitely are risks involved).

Are there any frameworks for this? Any managers? Anything? I know a lot of programs have some kind of update feature, and it's usually really similar. So I guess there is.

The program is made for windows only, so solutions don't have to be cross-platform.

Any suggestions?

The parsing is where I'm stuck. Each program I want to run will have predictable output, but I'm curious about how Python'ers parse output that comes from the shell. Is awk a better tool than using python's own tools? If there are good python tools, can you name them? Is there a tutorial for this somewhere?

`speed` is a number between 0 and 120 (mph) that is generated randomly every minute and every minute the equation is performed again, updating `odometer_miles`.

Once `odometer_miles` reaches 500 (or the closest value greater than 500) miles, the race is over, and whichever racer (out of a group of 20) reaches 500 is declared the winner. When the winner is determined, the program needs to print the ""driver name"" and ""sponsor"".

This number changes daily. What the script does is grab the number and then text it to me (using SMTPlib and the fact that you can text by emailing to a provider).

My problem is, I can easily have it text me the number if I run it - but then it'll text me the number as soon as I run it. I'd like it texted to me every morning at 5:45 AM - to accomplish that, I could run a loop of some sort, BUT that would require my computer to be on at all times while it waits for 5:45 AM every time the loop reaches the next point.

I was thinking - there must be SOME way in which I can have some online service or something (preferably free) just execute my script for me every day at a certain time. If not at a certain time, execute my script once, and I could just figure out how to use a loop (probably just wait for 5:45 and then time.sleep(86400) to sleep for 24 hours and then do it again).

Any idea on how I could get this done? Please ask if you need more details - I'd love an answer to this.

Grab data from Cragislist page for my area.
Grab the headers from the electronics section.
Keep the stuff that is related to iPhones or iPads (just for example)
Sort everything by version, price, if or if not it has a picture, the location (etc.)

Problem is that I don't really know where to begin when it comes to gathering data from the web.

Should I get some html knowledge before I embark on something like that?

Using:

    data = [row for row in csv.reader(open (os.path.expanduser(""~/Downloads/"" + filename),'U'))]

I get the following error:

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)

This error occurs after it runs through many records and I believe it is crashing when it gets to interpreting that specific character. 

So I asked around a bit and tried: 

    data = [row for row in csv.reader(codecs.open(filename,'U', encoding='utf_8'))]

But I still get an error. This time and for all other encoding languages I tried, it crashes right when it tries to open the file. I get this message for utf_8, and similar ones for all the others.  

    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2022' in position 70: ordinal not in range(128)

From this some google fu told me that the character is a bulltet, however when I search through the file, I found no bullets. I did find this: Ä¢ (but when I remove that, I still error out. hmm?*(edit1))

I had contacted the company I get the data from and they seem pretty useless at helping me solve it. First they insisted they don't encode anything. Then they said they use unicode, then after pressing them, they informed me they use utf-8, which does not seem to be the case because I still get an error. 

I tried all the 'all languages,' and 'western Europe,' encodings from [this list](http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings), but no luck. Every one still gives me an error. 

Any advice? 


Edit2: So in an effort to figure out what the character that is causing me issues is, I opened the csv and did a find replace of every character. I got several errors trying to do this. Most characters worked fine and replaced the character with nothing, essentially removing it from the field. When I tried to find replace the following I got  a ""That function is not valid"" error: [n, o, r, s, u, x, 1]. When I tried to find replace 't' I got the error ""The formula you typed contains an error"". This seems awfully strange to me.

Right now, I have

    balls = [ list of 60 objects ]

      ball.calc_vertices()

Then calc_vertices is like

        radius = self.radius

        iterations = self.iterations

        #calculating 40 points or so

        flatverts = [fv[0]]+[fv[1]]+fv+[fv[0]]+[fv[1]]+[fv[0]]+[fv[1]]
        return flatverts 


Would it be better to have the ball's for loop instead construct a numpy array of x,y and r, and have some sort of itertools function fill up an array of vertices all at once?  Most of the above seems like slicing that numpy would be better at.  Would itertools be something that could speed up the straightforward task of calculating points on the circle?


*Update:*

I used SkippyDelux's suggestion to only calculate the circle points once (centered at (0,0)) and only translate them during the update.  I wind the vertices in the circle creating function called on __init__.  The Circle Creating function is only slightly better than before because winding the vertices just takes several list manipulations. 

Taking into account other feedback, my function is now:


    def translate(self):
        verts = self.circleverts
        x,y = self.body.position
        pts = [(x+cx,y+cy) for cx,cy in verts]
        return tuple(map(int,[val for subl in pts for val in subl]))

As tends to be the case when diving in, I've hit an issue I have no idea how to fix, or where to start.

I am dynamically generating part of the interface, based off a list, for reasons which are actually awesome, (I promise), and everything goes well up until I try and bind events.

Simplified, I have a list of strings, from which I want to create a button for each entry, whose label matches the string, and who, when clicked, calls a function with the string as an argument.

Here is the relevant code:

    def populate_pages(self, sizer_pages):
        self.dict_pagebuttons = {}
        for page in packs.pages[""_order""]:
            self.dict_pagebuttons[page] = wx.Button(self.scrolled_pages, wx.ID_ANY, page, wx.DefaultPosition, wx.DefaultSize, wx.BU_LEFT)
            sizer_pages.Add(self.dict_pagebuttons[page], 0, wx.EXPAND, 5)
            print(page)
            self.dict_pagebuttons[page].Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, lambda event: self.onPageClicked(event, page))

The `print(page)` works perfectly, and I get the list reproduced in the console, line by line.  When clicking any of the buttons, though, they pass down only the last item of the list as the argument, no matter the button.  When print()ing the `event` from `self.onPageClicked`, I get the same...  Address?  Either way, it looks like all of the buttons are the same button, but with different labels.

Yet it throws a 500 when I do a get on /sidewinder, and a 404 on the root directory /.

I'm running this on python 3.3 in FreeBSD, and had to rename a class to get it to load up due to [this bug with the _Timer class and python 3.3](https://bitbucket.org/cherrypy/cherrypy/issue/1163/attributeerror-in-cherrypyprocessplugins). 

Also it fails with this error:
OSError: Port 8000 not bound on '127.0.0.1'

even if I run it with sudo. Further testing lead me to this function being the culprit:

    def wait_for_occupied_port(host, port, timeout=None):
        """"""Wait for the specified port to become active (receive requests).""""""
        if not host:
            raise ValueError(""Host values of '' or None are not allowed."")
        if timeout is None:
            timeout = occupied_port_timeout
        print(""Host: {} Port: {} timeout: {}"".format(host, port, timeout))
        for trial in range(50):
            print(""DEBUG: on loop: {}"".format(trial))
            try:
                check_port(host, port, timeout=timeout)
            except IOError as ie:
                print(""IO ERROR:{} !!!"".format(ie))

                time.sleep(timeout)
        
        raise IOError(""Port %r not bound on %r"" % (port, host))


I find that this function does 50 iterations and raises that IOError without fail, I'm not sure what to do about that. I'm mostly concerned with trying to fix this output function as it throws TypeError: &lt;lambda&gt;() missing 1 required positional argument: 'value':

    def to_html(self):
        html_item = lambda name,value: '&lt;div&gt;{name}:{value}&lt;/div&gt;'.format(**vars())

I don't understand how multiprocessing.Pool is different from multiprocessing.Process (probably a silly question I know, but I didn't find the documentation very illuminating). More specifically, I'm wondering when you would choose one over the other. Right now I am working on a pipeline that calls a function that does an expensive calculation (and needs to do this for 4 different inputs). My solution was to use multiprocess.Process to spawn 4 processes that get automatically distributed to 4 cores by the os. Could you use Pool in this situation to use multiple cores for **each** of the 4 separate calculations (instead of 1 core per calculation/subprocess?).

To be a little more clear, the expensive function is sometimes one that takes the input and reorganizes the data into a csv file and sometimes a subprocess calling another program to do a similar thing.

Unfortunately, my company has some locks on Program 2 that require some sort of Printer key to work, and they want us to work on their main servers. Moreover, I typically need to run this program several hundreds of times over and over again, so I decided to write a Python script to do this for me. I've been experimenting with this script again and wanted to parallelize all operations using the *MultiProcessing* library. 



The multiprocessing script I wrote will run on my local machine; however, when I package this script using *py2exe* to run on Windows 2003 Server, for some reason 

    Pool1.map(myworker, args) 


re-runs all the code in 

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":  
    

Hence the program gets trapped in recursion where every time I call Pool1.map, the entire script inside the ""if"" statement is re-run again for the exact number of entries in the tuple *args*. 

I don't know if I've made some poor programming error, or is this a bug in py2exe, or is this Windows Sever 2003s fault? I would paste the code but it's getting to be more than a hundred lines now. The basic pseudocode gist is:

    import subprocess
    import shutil
    import multiprocessing

So let's assume I'm the server and a client connected to me, assuming a blocking socket. That client drops but doesn't shutdown/close the socket which eventually times out. But, IIRC, that time out is OS dependent and can be rather long.

My best guess for now is to use a timeout on socket operations rather than blocking it all together and simply making a decision as to whether or not this was indeed a socket failure. But, how to make that decision?

So I have a bunch of excel data (12 columns and 38 rows) that's been converted to CSV that I need to plot in matplotlib. I need to get specific columns of numbers and turn them into an array.

I've tried google but a lot of the solutions point you toward a special mod. I eventually got down a track that talked about ""parsing strings"" but I got confused and eventually gave up.

Guides I find on YouTube are sadly in another language. 

Can anyone explain how I set this up to a complete noob? If it's easier I can move to a windows machine to setup WSGI on there. I just need step by step help in setting up WSGI on either an ubuntu or windows machine with the latest xampp.

        self.cnx.ConnectionString = cnxstr

Now, later on I want a new kind of object, a patient, containing information about a single person given an ID

    class Patient(object): #STILL NOT FINSIHED
        """"""
        Given a patient id, returns a patient object with all patient information.

The problem is that in order to make a query, I need the cnx parameter located in the DBwrapper class. I have tried defining the Patient class inside the DBwrapper class, but I still cannot access the value as the patient does not inherite from the DBWrapper, it is just a class inside another class.

If you do not have any better idea, I think i will write a function that makes the query first, and then pass the result into the __init__ of the Patient class. 

So, how should I structure my code when I have a object that creates new objects (from a different class, never used anywhere else). Should the second class be defined inside the first?

**Two questions:** should I dive right in to django and work on this site, then go back later and improve/edit as I learn more? Or should I study up on the MVC framework to understand it first?

What sort of tutorials would you recommend? (I've got a tutsplus account and dont mind paying a bit of there are good things on peepcode).
