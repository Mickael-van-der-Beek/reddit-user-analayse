I'm a combat vet of 3 Iraq tours that recently got into some trouble with a DWI.  After doing some thinking, I realized that if maybe I could have found a better outlet for some of my problems I wouldn't have been in that situation.  Thankfully I was arrested before anything terrible could happen.

The purpose of this post is to see if there are any young vets out there looking for a healthy, active, and chemical free outlet. I'm not affiliated with anything, VA, AA, SOS, VFW, American Legion or any of that.  I'm just trying  to make sure young vets in the area can do something other than just drink away their problems.  

If you know someone that has been in the military, deployed or not, that may need someone to talk with, workout with, or just is having trouble adjusting, please PM me. 

I know Rochester has a great veterans outreach center located downtown (http://www.veteransoutreachcenter.org/) that provides free education and assistance, so if that's what you need, check them out. 

Importantly, if you know of someone that needs help immediately, please direct them to call the Veteran Hotline (1-877-WAR-VETS (1-877-927-8387)).  It is a crisis line that is answered by combat vets.  They can help, I've used them.

Anyway, I'm just curious to see if there is a need for more of a non-traditional outreach type thing.  Maybe going mountain biking (when it's warm enough and Tryon isn't covered in snow), running, pick up football, anything like that.  

Thanks for you time.

It's definitely not a perfect service. Compared to TWC, the lower plan is amazing at 100mbit for $50/mo, but the gigabit plan is definitely excessive at $250/mo, and there are no plans in between. Also, they're not symmetrical. It's 100/20 and 1000/100.

I grew up just outside of Rochester my entire life. I'm currently stationed overseas and will be here for another year or so. Being away from Rochester for over a year I have gained an additional appreciation for the city. Sure we have problems, but which city doesn't?

One of the things that makes Rochester such a great place to live is just the mere diversity of the citizens that live there. The festivals, bars, schools, parks, restaurants, and things to do just make it for a great place all around!

My memories of Rochester and some of it's local traditions and locale only specialties, really make me miss home. I can say without a doubt that I love not only the city itself, but also the people that help enrich it!

A very big deal for the wrong reason.,Usarmyliberal,85,11,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/ms5nl/big_deal_pizzeria_monroe_ave_a_very_big_deal_for/,"As Rochesterians there are two foods that we take seriously. Pizza and garbage plates. Having said that, I stopped eating garbage plates and  I now focus my attention on pizza primarily. I try to go to as many places that I can to compare and contrast with other pizza places I have been to.  They are usually all very good and have decent to outstanding customer service.  Let me share with you a most disturbing and unfortunate occurrence at a Big deals recently.  Last Friday, I went to O'cals pub to play some pool and have a pint with some friends of mine. After a couple of hours of beer and pool, we decided to go to the big deal pizzeria across the street.  None of us and had been there and decided to try it out.  We all got different types of pizza (I had spinach and it wasn't bad). As everyone was sitting there talking at the table to one another, I walked up to the counter to ask where the restroom was.  They pointed to a door behind the counter with a sign on it that read ""Out of order"".  ""Are you sure I can go in there? There's a sign on it."" ""No its cool. We just put that up so people wont come in off the street to use it""  After I came out of the bathroom, two of the girls we were with went in there and doing as girls do spent waaaaay to much time. At this point my black friend goes to knock on the door to get them out.  The manager (who was next to the pizza oven on the other side of the room) looks at my friend and yells ""Hey thats out of order""  My friend quizzically looks at him and informs the manager that he is just getting his friends out from the bathroom.  The manager repeats himself. ""The bathroom is out of order because I said so""  My friend tells him to chill out and goes to sit back down at the table with us.  Keep in mind at this point that my friend bought a piece of pizza and was in fact a PAYING customer.  My friend is clearly miffed and starts talking to us about leaving and hoping the girls would hurry up. As we are all finally leaving, one of the cooks yells at us ""There goes another mouthy black kid"".  Being the only person in the whole restaurant that is black, my friend turns around and starts to yell at them for their rudeness. I chalked it up to ignorant pizza chefs and their close minded views and tried to usher my friend outside so we could continue our journey down the street.  The manager (who was scolding my friend to stay out of the bathroom) says ""Yeah thats right you dumb n***er.  Get the hell out!!""  For a second I was shocked in disbelief. It had now been taken to the next level. While my other white friend held back my black friend in a bear hug, I went up and rudely and loudly voiced my opinion to the manager and his two chefs (who were now standing behind the manager as if ready to fight) that the 1960's were over and they had lost that battle. I reminded them what racist bigots they were and how dare they say that to my friend.  We walked home calming my friend down and explaining to him what idiots they were.  Never in my life had I ever come across that kind of direct and disturbing racism as that night.  I can only sympathize with my friend and what he felt.  I'm thankful that despite their immaturity we kept our maturity intact and the situation didnt get physical. This is not the type of business that should be anywhere, let alone my city.   I implore all of you to vote with your wallets and BOYCOTT BIG DEAL PIZZERIA.

**When:** 

Saturday 6/25 [Global reddit Meetup Day](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/05/june-25th-global-reddit-meetup-day.html), around 4pm (Though if it's really nice out- some of us may be there earlier)

Rain date: the Saturday after

**Where:** 

[Marie Daley Park](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14620&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Rochester,+New+York+14620&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=43.142317,-77.607988&amp;spn=0.001348,0.00284&amp;t=h&amp;z=19)

Official address is: 

&gt;140 Ashland St
&gt;Rochester, NY 14620

In the southwest corner near the picnic tables &amp; grills (but it's not a big park, hard to miss anyone.)

**What:** 

White hots! Burgers! Make-your-own garbage plates(?) We'll provide some food, but more is always better, especially if a lot of people show up.

We'll also have a cooler (or two) of Genesee varieties (To aid in getting past those awkward so-what-else-do-you-do-on-the-internet conversations) But again- can't guarantee there'll be enough to last, so bring your own!

**Other thoughts:** 

Kickball game? [Kan Jam](http://i.imgur.com/OIbav.jpg)? (it *did* originate in Buffalo.)

If you've got any ideas, feel free to post 'em. Also if you're into it- sign up on our [redditgifts meetup page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/rochester-ny-meetup/) so we can get a good idea of how many to expect.

(UPDATE from earlier this week),rd79winters,62,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1b8mfq/thanks_for_your_help_roccit_update_from_earlier/,"See this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1b1t35/where_should_or_shouldnt_i_eat/)

Well Roccit, we've come and gone and I need to thank you for your help in making our visit to Rochester an awesome one! Your advice was invaluable as without it we would've been truly lost. Reading reviews on line and asking locals advice are two **very** different things.

We were able to pack as much in to a day and a half in Rochester as possible. We stopped in at Dinosaur BBQ, Dogtown, The Tap and Mallet and the Firehouse Saloon on Clinton (I'm a firefighter and the name intrigued me). We were even able to check out Wegman's for a cup of tea.

One thing I will say, is that I was **shocked** by how good the craft beer scene is in the North East of your country. As Canadian beer aficionados we have been drinking craft beer from back home for a few years now and unfortunately we haven't been exposed to your craft beers at all. American beer doesn't have the best reputation in Canada (sorry) but I'll be sure to correct the next person I hear bashing it at home. I guess we were ignorant to generalize your beers as being all like Coors and Bud. 

And lastly I want to mention how truly welcoming the people in Rochester were to us. Everybody we met at the restaurants/bars/concert/hotel were very happy to help us or even to just sit around the bar with us and go back and forth making fun of each other's accents. We had a taxi driver name Greg (car #40) who ended up giving us an impromptu tour of the city, free of charge, and his love for his city was infectious! By the end of our trip we were thinking that we may just have to come back if only just to drink at your bars and obviously to pick up another garbage plate because that thing is just insane.

Thanks for the help Roccit!

First I'd like to thank everyone for the help on the previous post I made about this [original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/18tbmm/veterans_in_rochester_if_you_could_upvote_for/).

I've created a subreddit for this group that I'm trying to build, /r/RocCityVets that will be the starting point for the online portion.  Today I'm hoping to register the domain, and start setting up sites on facebook and get a twitter account up.  

If anyone is interested in helping me moderate that /r/RocCityVets, please let me know.  I have no experience in CSS, so that would be awesome.  There are plenty of opportunities to help out with other things as well, and I will be contacting local businesses to see what type of support I can get from them.  

So to start off, I want to just get some informal get meet ups going, something simple like meeting at Cobbs Hill for a run, or hitting up Tryon Park and tearing around on mountain bikes.  Depending on if there is a big interest in this, I'll see if I can get a group rate discounts from local businesses for paintball, rock climbing, martial arts classes, ect.  

I guess that is it for now. Please feel free to PM me with any questions or ideas, and spread the word to any Veterans you know that are in the Area.  It doesn't matter where, when, or how they served, this is for them all.  Thanks.

Their selection is great, the people who work there are wonderful and their prices are literally so low they don't make a profit.

Sadly, that's part of the problem.  It seems they're one step away from being closed down.

As any bibliophile will know, we're losing bookstores right and left.  If we don't start supporting them whenever we can we will lose them all.  This is a charity bookshop, everyone who works there is a volunteer.  Losing this store would be doubly bad.

Just so you know, I'm not affiliated with them in any way, except being a customer.  I just really don't want to see this place go under.

They have every kind of book you could imagine.  Many of them are less than a dollar, some of them are free.  They have first editions for only a few bucks.  They will literally look online to see how much a book is worth and then price it at 1/3 of the online price!  I've walked out of there with a stack of books and didn't even spend $10

Finding the shop is a bit tricky.  When you go to Village Gate there is a door next to the first restaurant on the right.  Take the elevator to the 3rd floor and walk to the end of the hallway. (Or, once inside, follow the signs)  You will NOT regret stopping in here.

I go there intending to spend 10 minutes picking up a book and I end up staying an hour because I'm talking to everyone

NOTE: They only accept cash (a bit of a pain, I know)

All I'm asking is that if you have some free time you go check them out.  You'll be hard pressed not to find something you want.",,False,self,t5_2qhkc,False,,,True,t3_10w4bo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/10w4bo/help_save_one_of_the_greatest_bookstores_in/,

I got my connection hooked up last week, but decided to go with the 100mbit plan instead of gigabit, because $250/mo just isn't in my budget at the moment.

Some notes:

* It was apparently the second install they had done (though they had a lot lined up and even more interest in other areas), and it took about two hours to complete the install.
* I am unsure if it is the same/sister/child company or if they're just reselling or leasing, but the provider is actually [Fibertech Networks](http://www.fibertech.com/).
* They do bill at the beginning of every month and will prorate your first month and bill for the second up front, so just be aware of that if you're budgeting.
* Haven't had a second of downtime or any slow down in speed so far.

Here is a [speed test](http://www.speedtest.net/result/2720750729.png) to DC. And here is a more [real world speed test](http://www.speedtest.net/result/2720784434.png) to CA. I'd like to see one from a gigabit subscriber if there are any out there.

(x-post r/URochester),vwilliams463,42,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1cvunk/looking_for_witness_to_accident_at_genesee_and/,"I'm hoping that someone in this subreddit may have witnessed an accident at Genesee and Scottsville Road last Monday 4/15/2013 at approximately 4:45 pm.
I was driving a black Dodge Grand caravan in the right-hand lane, heading west on Elmwood. Two University of Rochester Shuttle buses were in the left-hand lane next to me travelling in the same direction. As we crossed onto Scottsville Rd, the rear shuttle bus drifted into my lane, forcing me into the curb, and causing my front passenger tire to blow. Neither one of the buses stopped, nor did any traffic. The bus company the University contracts through says that they had buses in that area, at that time, but denies any accident took place. I have filed a police report, and a report through the University, but I have not been able to find anyone willing to admit to seeing the accident. Anyone with info, please email me at vwilliams463atgmail.com.


TL;DR U of R shuttle bus ran minivan off road, denies it happened, I'm looking for witnesses.

Health code violations anyone?

Then on New Years Eve they took my order, told me it would be forty minutes - I went to pick up, paid and waited in the store for fifteen more minutes for them to only realize - oops - we never made this guys pizza. At least it wasn't already brought home and opened this time...

If you've ever been to Genrich's before, chances are you've met Chuck. Chuck knew everything there was to know in the garden industry, but even more importantly, he remembered your name, your pet's name, where your grandson was going to college, or even that plant you bought three months ago.  He was one of those people who didn't look at you, he looked through you. Chuck helped the original owner start the business 35 years ago.

However, the original owner's son eventually took over and just a few months ago told his customers and the Irondequoit community that Chuck had decided to retire. This is 100% inaccurate, and a complete PR move. Chuck had no intentions of retiring, instead the owner wanted him out of the business for reasons unbeknownst to myself and Chuck's friends.  Chuck loved his job and the people he served. He did landscaping for customers countless times and almost rarely took anything in return and frequently worked 60+ hours a week.  Chuck died in his sleep about a month ago - eight months after ""retiring.""

Maybe asking you to boycott Genrich's isn't the right thing to do, and probably isn't what Chuck would want. But the next time you walk in there, just remember that the owner let go one of the most sincere men you've ever met, the face of his company - and the Irondequoit community - without any reasonable explanation.

I have been working with her extensively, and would really like her to find a good home. She knows how to sit, lay down, and wait. She is very intelligent and could definitely learn tons of commands. A lot of her hyperactivity is due to the fact that she is in a small cage for most of the day. I do what I can for her, but she needs someone who is willing to run with her, or has a large fenced in backyard. She likes some other dogs, but is very dominant and will play rough. I would recommend a house with no cats. If you are interested in her, it would be best to come and get to know her at the shelter where she is comfortable. Experienced dog owners would be best. If you'd like more information, or would like to look at some other animals, you can go to this website http://www.petadoption.cc/.

Drove over to Mise en Place. Parked in what I thought was one of their parking spaces. Ran in. Bought milk. Came back out less than five minutes later.

I come out to find a guy backing out of the space next to mine. As I got to my car door I noticed spit on the window. I then noticed there was spit on all of my windows. The guy who had been backing out parks his car behind mine, in a T-formation, boxing me in. He gets out of the car and approaches me.

""Did you spit on my car?"" I asked. 

""Did you park in my space?"" he replied. [He looked like a really short Hagrid, but acted like Voldemort]

""Yes, I parked here. I didn't realize it was your space. I apologize for that. Did you spit on my car?"" I replied. 

He said no, and then just stood there with his arms folded, glaring at me. He wasn't going to move his car. I was boxed in. So, I took out my phone and took a picture of him, and then of his license plate. That prompted him to get in his car and speed off. 

I went back into Mise en Place and told them what happened. I asked for the contact information of the company that runs the surveillance cameras of that parking lot. They gave that info to me, and I went back to my car and drove home. 

On my way home, on a side street, about half a mile away, there he was, parked on the side of the road, really close behind another car. It looked odd how close the two cars were, and there weren't any other cars parked around there, so I wondered if the two people in the front car knew this guy. So I pulled up beside them and asked. But they didn't. 

As I drove of, this dude started following me. Not wanting to give him any idea of where I live, I drove back to the Mise en Place parking lot. He followed me, and when we got there he pulled into both of his spaces, straddling the line between them. He then got out and motioned to me to roll down my window. Considering he had spit on my car seven times, I didn't think that would be a good idea. So I opened the window on the opposite side, so he could here me. 

I said ""Next time, why not write a note, or even call the police. Spitting on someone's car is just childish. I didn't know it was your space, and I apologize for that. Are you going to apologize for spitting on my car?"" 

He said nothing, so I drove off. Making sure he wasn't following me. When I got home, I used simple green to wipe off all the spit (on each window and the front lights).

tl;dr I made a mistake, parked in someone's spot behind Mise en Place for literally 4 minutes. He decided to spit on my car, seven times. I took a photo of him and his license plate, and soon I will have the videotape from the surveillance cameras showing him spitting on my car (seven times).",,False,self,t5_2qhkc,1364862870.0,,,True,t3_1bh8ia,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1bh8ia/beware_of_the_south_wedge_serial_spitter/,

Not a minute before we gathered to coordinate, an RPD officer came and kicked out a group of skateboarders. I think they were upset that we weren't also being kicked out and after they left the officer walked over to us. 

At this moment, a member showed up late with a shovel in hand and balanced across a rail to come meet with us. After I finished talking the officer said that if he saw that again (balancing on the rail) he'd arrest us and started to walk away. 

I'm a responsible adult and we've been using Manhattan Square Park for almost 6 years and have always had impeccable relations with the RPD. So I followed him and asked him for a minute to explain what law we were breaking. He then changed his wording and said he wouldn't arrest us but would instead forcibly commit us to the hospital for 24 hours for being mentally unstable. 

This statement blew my mind! So I'm curious if anyone has any knowledge on this topic. Again, this is the only ""threat"" we've ever received in almost 6 years. Was he just trying to intimidate us or was there some other reason? Is he legally allowed to threaten us like that or at least insult us by claiming we're ""mentally unstable""?

I really would like to make the Park Avenue area the next step as they expand.  We definitely have the population density.  If all of us could sign-up and then get two more people to sign-up I think we could get their attention. Do that by August 15. Email your friends, spam your enemies, just get some sign-ups and express interest - it isn't a contract. Let's get fiber for Christmas in Park Avenue. 

If you know any landlords (or have a landlord) hit them up too as they (Greenlight) seem to like dense population clusters. And if you are a business owner they are offering gigabit internet for $250 a month. 

This isn't just a little faster ; it will be a different experience. Remember your 28.8k dial-up modem and when you had cable Internet installed - it will be something like that but better. Greenlight's $50 plan includes 100 megabits per seconds bandwidth compared to TWC 'Turbo' plan at $54 a month for up to 20 megabits per second. You get five times the bandwidth for less money with Greenlight. 

Greenlight made the SouthWedge announcement on their Facebook and Twitter feeds, so that's another way to connect and get their attention.  You can let them know you are interested in signing up for service here: http://greenlightnets.com/sign-up-for-service/

I'm not affiliated with Greenlight in any way, I'm just sick of only having Frontier and TWC as options and know that Google Fiber is not coming here anytime soon.

Despite living in the charming Park Ave district and having plenty of friends and things to do in the South Wedge, my favorite part of the city is, without a doubt, High Falls. Beautiful, historic, utterly lifeless High Falls—an undeserved ghost town with so much potential it kills me.

The High Falls Historic District is in *such* a great location. Frontier Field, the stunning architecture of the Kodak building, WXXI, Water Street Music Hall, and Brown Square Park are all within a few blocks. Genesee has done a terrific job retrofitting its brewery as a museum and tap room/restaurant. There's one apparently excellent Italian restaurant, LaLuna, tucked away in one of the old brick buildings. And the entire district is filled with historic and natural charm—the dramatic drops of the gorge, the spooky and amazing old water wheel pit, the sound of the water rushing over the falls, etc.

So why is High Falls such a ghost town? Why are architecture and accounting firms the only real tenants in the district? Seems to me (admittedly a newcomer) that it should be one of THE major destinations in the city, on top of every list of things for both locals and tourists to do. It doesn't need to become another East End; I think we can agree that the beautiful falls don't need to be surrounded by noisy bars and nightclubs. But cute restaurants, ice cream shops, bookstores, theaters, and art galleries would all fit in quite nicely.

I'm familiar with [GardenAerial](http://gardenaerial.org)'s work to make the gorge and falls more pedestrian-friendly and desirable, but is there anyone else in Rochester thinking seriously about how to build up the area a bit?

After a little research, they're trying to get people into a contract with their company, under the guise that it will be less expensive. This is a super shady practice, unless you're on a fixed plan with RG&amp;E, the rates are always going up and down.

I'm posting this on behalf of my good friend who books talent at the Bug Jar. Please feel free to act on this advice or share further. It would be a huge loss to the city if the Bug Jar is shut down. Thanks!



""ANNOUNCE AND SHARE THE FOLLOWING:

Dear People of Rochester, New York,

As you might already know, there are rumblings about the future of The Bug Jar. You might be asking yourself what you can do. Here are three easy, meaningful, and positive things you can do.

1. If you know the family / friends of Deavoughn Hernandez-Ruffin, please reach out to them. Offer your condolences and assistance of any type. You may not know, but he was the father of an 8-month old girl, Za’Ryah. This is a terrible tragedy, and any support you can lend the family would be great. Let's get started working towards some benefit shows, fundraisers, letter writing, etc...

2. Letters of support: We need support from any local or national non-profits. Many of you work for non-profits in the area. Please take a moment to write a letter to Rochester City Council expressing your feelings about The Bug Jar as a cultural, social, and artistic bastion in this city. Let them know about the number of jobs (20+) that have been lost since we've temporarily closed, adding to the already growing unemployment level. Write what you feel you should, but be clear, intelligent, and have a good take that will show both support for businesses and hope for a less violent city.

3. Encourage the city to reconsider its point system for businesses. Essentially, to boil it down, when the cops are called to a situation (a cat in a tree, to remove a drug-dealer, to break up a fight...) that business is given points... for calling the cops... to do their job. Too many points, and a business can be fined or shut down. So, the point system ACTUALLY penalizes businesses for calling the cops to do good! And that penalty (any fines) goes from the business to the city. It does help pay the cops, which is good, they need to be paid for their work; however, if a business is a victim of a crime, and is then victimized by paying a fine, it just seems a little bit unfair; as though doing the right thing in cooperating with the authorities will make matters worse. In this instance, that is what has occurred. And not just for The Bug Jar; this points system is crushing many businesses in town. I know... I've been talking to a lot of folks these past few weeks. The point system needs to be re-evaluated, re-vamped, or removed. Period.

4. Meeting at City Hall 10 AM on Friday, June 22nd. The meeting will be closed, but anyone who wishes to support The Bug Jar, support the family of Deavoughn Hernandez-Ruffin, support arts, music and culture in this city, and support changing the points system is welcome to let it be known. Be creative! Have something to say. Call City Hall. Make a sign. Play instruments. Above all, do please be respectful, whatever you do. We want folks to know that we're looking out for the best of Rochester, not being an angry mob. Hug people. Give high-fives. Smile. 

Rochester, it is not often that you are given such an opportunity to let this City know that you are not willing to stand for senseless violence and that you are behind live music. Please, take a little time and do your part. Get organized. Walk outside and talk with your neighbors. Have a grill out and get the conversation rolling. Post on Facebook, put up concerts on YouTube, Tweet like a bird! Don't be kept silent! Help save this city. Thank you =)""",,False,self,t5_2qhkc,False,,,True,t3_ve42x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/ve42x/regarding_the_bug_jar/,

**Intro to Stained Glass**
A 6-week hands-on course in the age-old art of stained glass. You see it in churches, temples, art museums, older homes, even older commercial buildings. It’s gorgeous!

Rochester Restore the Fourth Holding Rally to Protect Privacy

Rochester, NY - Activists from across the political spectrum are coming together this Independence Day to combat warrantless mass surveillance and fight for our Fourth Amendment rights. Emerging from the social media driven Restore the Fourth movement, concerned citizens organized a rally for July 4th from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM at Washington Square Park in Rochester, NY. The rally will entail a march to the Federal Building, speeches, and activism workshops. 

The Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights protects all citizens’ assets, both digital and physical, against searches and seizures without warrant. The July 4th demonstrations seek to demand an end to the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the U.S. government and to ensure that all future government surveillance is constitutional, limited, and clearly defined. 
Restore the Fourth is a nationwide, grassroots, non-partisan movement. Rochester Restore The Fourth is one of dozens of Restore the Fourth Rallies taking place on July 4th, 2013. To learn more about Restore the Fourth movement objectives and protest locations go to RestoretheFourth.net. 
Visit facebook.com/RochesterRestoreTheFourth for updates and information on the local Restore The Fourth movement.

A friend, family member, and/or acquaintance who works with the PGA subcontracted grounds crew has been dealing with some ""highly questionable"" labor practices.

First, groundskeepers (trash-picker-upppers, etc) are *required* to be at a shuttle by 4am.  If they're not on time, they're considered absent for the day.  The problem is, they're not *paid* until 5am.  From my understanding, the same thing happens when they try to leave for the night.  Their pay stops at 2 pm, but they're required to stay an extra hour.

Second, limited personal protective equipment is being provided by the subcontractor.  Individuals who want to use PPE need to bring them from home.

Lastly, groundskeepers are only given 1 T-shirt for the course of the entire event.  It needs to be cleaned daily.  Extras cost $25.

Undoubtedly, public dollars are being spent on this event.  Why are we subsidizing it?

But, on the way back home we got to talking about all the cool things in Rochester that we never do or know about. That made us start talking about a Rochester bucket list. Everything we do in Rochester we could honestly do in any city, we have some awesome things available to only us, and most of us do not take advantage of it. 

So in this post I would like to start a Rochester bucket list, list all the cool places to go, eat, hang out, whatever it is I want to get a list going.

I am moving to your city in about one week.  My boyfriend is starting a PhD program in the area, so he is pretty much set once we get there, but I will have to find a job fairly quickly.

I am in my mid-twenties, a certified English teacher for grades 7-12 (I just finished school, so no experience yet), and by the end of the month I'll have completed my master's in English, too.  My boyfriend and I are both fairly bookish, into film, occasionally video games, some outdoorsy stuff (kayaking, ""light"" hiking).  We have a cat.

I guess I'm just looking for any advice for people like us moving to the area.  We are not really the clubbing/night life type, but we don't want to end up sitting around our apartment all the time, either.  

Do any of you know what the job market is like right now for teachers?  Adjuncts?

ANY advice would be greatly appreciated, or even just a welcoming word.  Thank you to those who took the time to read!

***EDIT:  Thank you to all who took the time to read and respond with information, advice, and suggestions.  I feel so much better about this move!

Thanks for the input! I actually think that we have a team of people who have been looking into this. I heard talk about it maybe 6 months ago. So hopefully we will be able to get it here! I travel a lot and find that the bike share programs in other cities seem really successful and useful.

Xerox Corporation, along with a number of other organisations, has put its signature on a letter in support of SOPA.

The agenda is as follows:

* Gather at the Washington Square Park camp (Woodburry and Clinton)
* Speaker will start at 16:00
* March down to the Federal Building
* Loop around to the Liberty Pole
* Speaker at the pole
* March back to Xerox for a rally and speak out

I'm a 20 year old college student (however school is almost out and I will not be taking summer classes) with a part time job for which I get paid above minimum and typically have 20-30 hours a week. If the subletter would like, I can get a second job if that will offer reassurance that I will be making rent (I have never had a problem with paying rent before). I am relatively clean but will not raise hell if other tenants are not. The biggest issue is that I have two cats. The good news is that they are both females (no spraying), spayed, litter trained, and I've literally never had a problem with them scratching furniture (I also keep their nails as short as possible just in case). They are both indoor cats so no worries about pests or outside insects. I have my own furniture but it's currently in storage so if the apartment is already furnished and the subletter would like to leave their furniture behind its not an issue. I am a college student so I do like to engage in recreational activities on the weekend but I do not bring that part of my personality home because I know that many do not like dealing with partiers. I know this is a lot of information but I'm currently in a bit of a panic because I'm in a dangerous situation and craiglist doesn't have a lot of good options. Ideally I'd pay no more than 400 a month with utilities but I can figure something out if that's not an option. Also, if you help me find the place I live in I will reward you with a painting or baked goods. Thank you for your consideration and assistance.

1362068322.0,17,self.Rochester,19eh12,Xerox (Verizon Wireless Project) is a horrible place to work at!,supermiabro,27,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/19eh12/xerox_verizon_wireless_project_is_a_horrible/,"Do it only if you are in desperate need of a job. For those of you who don't know, Xerox is slowly becoming a more service oriented company. After acquiring ACS (one of the largest outsourcing companies in the world) last year, Xerox now does outsourcing for companies like Verizon Wireless. When you call for customer service for VZW, 1 out of 20 calls will go to one of Xerox's call centers. 

I'm currently a customer service rep and have been here for about 3 months now. I've worked customer service for outsourcing companies like Sutherland but this is by far the worst experience i've had. 

First the training is a joke. They cram 3 months of material into 1 month. Next, they have unrealistic service score goals to reach. Its difficult to reach goals when your not trained properly and the leadership are unresponsive and doesn't care. Sure Sutherland isn't perfect, but the training program was great. 

The pay here is almost like a scam. They call it, ""ABC Pay"" which stands for Achievement Based Compensation. Basically its piece meal work. Your paid by the minute (But the minimum you'll ever be paid is $10 per hour or $0.16 per minute). So if no calls are coming in, your wage is $0. Also, the only time you are paid is when you are talking to the customer live. If you put the customer on hold, the per minute wage is $0. You can earn more money by getting better scores (Scores come from customers taking a survey about you). But I've seen people put in 40+ hours and make $10 even with high customer service scores due to lack of calls or placing the customer on hold often because they are not trained correctly and have to research answers. And if you are not meeting scores, your fired. 

And finally the working environment is terrible. Fights occur all the time in the parking lots (I've seen more cops come and break up fights then my old neighborhood in the city). Restrooms are disgusting. And the drug use is out of control. They hire anyone off the streets so we actually have ""gang"" members that work here just to sell drugs!! We have told supervisors and managers about this but no one listens. 

Because we are not meeting customer service scores, I heard Verizon Wireless is going to shut us down soon anyways. Good riddance! 

Do yourself a favor and NEVER work for the Verizon Wireless Project here. ",,False,self,t5_2qhkc,1362083201.0,,,True,t3_19eh12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/19eh12/xerox_verizon_wireless_project_is_a_horrible/,

Am I being too sensitive by calling security? ,megfleet,20,3,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/16tni6/my_downstairs_neighbors_practice_instruments_at/,"I live in an apartment complex around the MCC area and my downstairs neighbors play music at least every day and it is usually extremely disrupting to my roommate and I. I swear at times it sounds like they have a full drum circle in their room directly below me, but mostly their guitars echo through my pillow when I'm trying to sleep. Usually during the day I've always just let it go, even when my apartment is vibrating because of them on a regular basis. I've had to call security anytime from 11:00 pm, 5:00 am, 8:00 am, etc. When I first moved into the apartment I never had any issues, but lately it's gotten extremely hard to deal with. I do feel terrible having to call, I know it makes me come off as uptight especially for a young RIT student. But at the same time common sense says you don't movie into an apartment complex to have band practice, especially where they have regular quiet hours. There's tons of places to live in Rochester, and tons of places that would not only tolerate their obnoxious band practice day after day but that would also be cheaper! Anyway, I wasn't sure where to post this but I just wanted to hear if anyone in the area could help me out with any advice or tell me if I'm being too sensitive here. Thanks, everyone!

TL;DR - My neighbors are obnoxious playing their instruments every day and night, am I too sensitive for calling security so often? Oh, and their music isn't even good.

YNN is pretty much un-watchable during the midday hours due to your excessive use of self promotion spots. The bowling alley, the coffee mug, the endless check-ins from the food guy, the car broad, the pet chick, etc, are all horrible, dull and pointless.  I am already watching your station; I don't need reminders that you are on 24 hours over and over again.  

Are your sales people slacking off so badly you can't fill the airtime?  I see they face a challenge; if I were an advertiser, I would be leery of a station whose content is 50% self promotion.  

And don't even get me started on the idiocy of the spots saying ""MSG is looking for money, but don't leave us because then you will lose YNN.""  That is like a magazine saying, ""We are closing out our sports dept, but don't stop subscribing, because then you will miss out on those annoying subscription cards that fall in your lap when you open each issue.""

Either start providing better content than self-promo spots or close the channel down and use the money to buy better channels.

Enough Is Enough is asking all supporters to take part in a Phone-in Day for Benny Warr’s case on Wednesday August 14th. Supporters are asked to telephone Monroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley (585-753-4500), Rochester Mayor Tom Richards (585-428-7045) or Chief of Police James Sheppard (585-428-7033). 

Callers should ask that all charges against Benny Warr be dropped and that Officer Joseph M. Ferrigno II, Officer Anthony R. Liberatore, and Sergeant Mitchell R. Stewart instead be charged with assault and official misconduct for their documented brutality.

Anyone connected to social media is asked to direct these requests to @CityRochesterNY and https://www.facebook.com/CityofRochesterNY, the mayor at https://www.facebook.com/MayorTomRichards and the police at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rochester-NY-Police-Department/403845733028894 and @RochesterNYPD. We're using the hashtag #BennyWarr.

Enough is Enough is also calling for local activists and proponents to rally the morning of the trial and to fill the courtroom, located at 99 Exchange Blvd in downtown Rochester. The rally will begin at 8:00 am on Tuesday, August 20th, with the trial set to begin at 9:30. The judge has requested that supporters not wear their Enough Is Enough shirts, so those coming should wear orange shirts in solidarity with Mr. Warr.",,False,self,t5_2qhkc,1376350467.0,,,True,t3_1k8ojt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1k8ojt/remember_the_benny_war_case_you_may_have_seen_one/,

Would I have trouble finding people to play board games with? Are costs of living decent (I'd be renting an apartment)? Is it easy to meet new friends? Is it easy to find people to date?

When: Thu, January 19, 7pm – 9pm Where: 1115 Main Street East, Rochester, NY 14609 (Door #7, Suite 200)

Description: Anything goes, unstructured evening of general making, coding, and doing of stuff. This event is open; you don't have to be a member to attend.


*Edit*: Just got back from the ""Do Night"" and found the space to be a really wonderful and accepting environment for anyone who wants to hack/tinker/ham/build something from garbage or bring in a brand new build and assemble and troubleshoot. I met about 6 members of Interlock and they were all outgoing and intelligent, and of all different personalities.

There was a network guy, an arduino guy, a guy who specialized in brushless motors, a Ham radio guy, and one guy working on the RepRap who I spent near the entire night with trying to print stuff out.

It was a great time, and I'd encourage anyone who is interested in voiding a warranty or two to stop by Tuesdays and Thursdays for a ""Do Night"".

She hasn't really done shit that has pushed for the growth of high tech industry here. She dropped the ball on the Yahoo server farm deal (Lockport got it), she dropped the ball on Google/Microsoft having larger presence here and while Rochester may have this so-called growth, she doesn't support any major incentives for tech start-up initiatives here. The only job growth seen in Rochester are barely above minimum wage call center jobs. And now Maggie is promoting the huge call center (again, majority of jobs are barely minimum wage with shitty benefits) that Xerox wants to build. Sure, its better then having no jobs but how about Maggie push and support for some local high tech industry that can bring in better paying tech skilled jobs. Fuck the minimum wage shit jobs here, we have enough of them to go around. She doesn't push to get more funding for start-up tech jobs or more incentives for larger firms to come here. Hell, even our economy stricken neighbor Buffalo has seen a surge of tech jobs popping up in Buffalo. If Buffalo continues this trend of high tech jobs, it will only be a matter of time when Buffalo steamrolls Rochester in terms of non-minimum wage jobs being made. 

Yet she still gets voted in by the older conservative morons that plague the area. No wonder all the young people run from this town once they graduate. She wins the old people vote by mentioning she wants to make manufacturing strong here. Manufacturing is fucking done for here. Get over it and lets move on and transform ourselves. We have a strong medical industry here taking care of the older Kodak retirees, which is great, but its not sustainable. With technology, it keeps evolving, it gets better, like a bottle of wine. Sure their are some predictions that manufacturing will make a huge come back because its getting more expensive to manufacture in China, but that dream bubble will fade once the companies move those productions to other 3rd world countries (South East Asia will be the ""new"" China). What manufacturing has increased in the area? Harris? Gleason? Thats it. We have not seen any increase in job growth in that area. But when you look at the growth of high tech, its been constant, but we need a push for that industry to flourish here.

I'd like to submit this as a humble request to help out the Rochester Parkour community secure a $250,000 grant from the Mission: Small Business initiative. Last year, Andrew Salmon and myself started the first Parkour gym in New York State with less than $6,000. We made it work by spending the last 15 months working 14 hour days and 2, sometimes 3 jobs, in order to make our dreams and the dreams of our members come true. 

Since it's founding, every dime from RocPK has gone to the upgrading of its facility, the safety of its equipment, and fighting for better insurance coverage. It's been a long hard road, but if all this was started with my college summer money, imagine what $250,000 could do! 

We need 250 votes to get into the next stage. Show us some love?

I have Road Runner standard cable internet and I just signed up for MLB.tv this season, and was super excited.  I go to run the speedtest on MLB.com and it tells me that my speed is about 1.6 mbps.  1.6!  At 4 pm on a Monday.  I can't stream HD at that speed.  I can't watch it on my nice big TV. It stutters and spurts and will hold HD for a minute and then 5 minutes on SD.

I shiver to think what it's going to be like at 7 pm when games normally start... unusable.

My internet sucks balls!  I need internet that will pretty much guarantee me 4 mbps down at all times.  **Is there anything here that can provide that?** Is RR Turbo worth it?  I need something that won't break the bank and will offer me the bandwidth I need to enjoy my product.

While the results are aesthetically pleasing, they're also pretty shit for durability and I don't feel good about selling them.  They just don't hold up.

Unfortunately, I got a bit over zealous with purchasing shrink plastic, and I have a metric shit ton of the stuff to burn through. As a fervent  anti-hoarder, this is a problem for me.

I'm also a fervent proponent of well-documented pets, and if I can help anyone get a tag on their animal, I'd be thrilled to kill two birds with one stone.

If your cat, dog, horse, rabbit, goat, bsdm buddy or newt is lacking a tag, I'd like to make one for you. Basic B&amp;W round tag, about 3/4"", with a line or two of text &amp; phone number. I don't want money, I just want to get rid of this stuff and limit the number of lost pet postings on my local CL.

As I said, these things are not super durable; they tend to get eaten away by wear at the split ring/hanger, scratching, etc.  They do the job for a time, and if you just need to get your name on your pet ASAP, are headed on a trip, or need a tag for a back-up collar, they serve the purpose.  Estimated survival is about three months on a very large or very itchy dog; more on a smaller or quieter animal.  They do endure weather well.

If you would like a free tag, please message me.
