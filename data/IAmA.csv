In 2008 while I was working on my isolated mountain property, I was mauled by a predatory black bear. Saved by my thumbnail and my two faithful ranch dogs, I hiked out of a box canyon and drove myself four miles down a rutted logging road to our little rural fire station from which I was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center. There I underwent eight hours of emergency surgery and survived the subsequent onslaught of LA reality television's media hounds. 
   Five years and a dozen surgeries later, I'm back to some semblance of my original self.

Boggs, I used my IBM Selectric with its Orator ball to type up a memo to my bosses at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), outlining our idea for this little invention called “Ethernet”, which we later patented.

I worked with the IEEE Standards Association to develop the IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet, which specifies the physical and lower software layers. Today Ethernet and the IEEE 802.3 standard are the foundation for today’s world of high-speed communications used in billions of homes and businesses around the world.

I arrived in Baghdad on the 2nd of April 2007 where my main job was to develop spending reports from the computer system used within the Ministry of Finance. 

On the 29th of May, 2007 around one hundred Iraqi police officers from the Ministry of Interior entered the building and took away myself and four British guards. 
 
For six months I was moved around meeting up with the British guards. In December of 2007 I was separated from the other Britons and was held with two Americans. In June of 2007 I was transported back to Baghdad and this was the last time I had contact with any of the other hostages.
 
In May of 2009 the number two commander of the militia (Laith Al Khazlli) was released from US custody in exchange for the bodies of two of the British guards. In September over one hundred militia were released in exchange for the body of one of the guards.
 
On the 30th of December 2009, 946 days (or 2 years, 7 months &amp; 1 day) after I was captured, I was released in exchange for the militia leader Qais Al Khazlli. The last of the hostages bodies were eventually handed over in early 2012.

With the help of the Georgia Innocence Project (GIP) and DNA testing, we were exonerated from prison after spending 18 years and 24 years, respectively, in prison for crimes we didn’t commit. 

We are answering questions today. An intern at GIP is helping us type our answers. 

Clarence Harrison:
Clarence was convicted in 1987 for rape, robbery, and kidnapping in Decatur, Georgia. Clarence was interrogated about a rape, solely based on rumor. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup, later proven to be mistaken identification. He was exonerated after GIP found a slide from the original rape kit and performed DNA testing that confirmed that Clarence was not the perpetrator. He was the first man exonerated by GIP and was exonerated in 2004 after serving nearly 18 years in prison. 

Robert Clark: 
Robert was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and armed robbery in 1982. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup and in the courtroom, even though the actual perpetrator was in the courtroom at the same time. (Robert is 5 or 6 inches taller than the real perpetrator). DNA testing proved that Robert could not be the perpetrator; the DNA matched a man already in prison serving time for sodomy and cruelty to children. Robert was 21 years old when he went to prison and spent 24 years wrongfully incarcerated, more than half of his life.

Clarence is sticking around though!!!!!

EDIT #5: Clarence is finishing up. His parting words:
""It has been very fun and I appreciate you all being so interested in what it has been like for an innocent man to have been falsely imprisoned. I have to say this technology stuff has really gone a long way. I would have never believed that you could have so much fun with people and not even be able to see them. And I look forward to this adventure in the future, and it truly was an adventure due to the fact that I STILL do not know what we are doing.""

If you want to contact Clarence, you can email him at clarenceharrison73@gmail.com or you can send regular mail to the Georgia Innocence Project, 2645 N. Decatur Road, Decatur, GA 30033

1344977572.0,3391,self.IAmA,y81ju,I created Imgur. AMA.,MrGrim,22063,18672,5019,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y81ju/i_created_imgur_ama/,"I came across [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y65jo/four_years_ago_a_redditor_lets_the_guy_who_made/) yesterday and there seems to be some confusion out there about imgur, as well as some people asking for an AMA. So here it is! Sometimes you get what you ask for and [sometimes you don't](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/y2z5f/after_sending_imgur_an_email_in_a_notsosober/).

*I'll start with some background info:* I created Imgur while I was a junior in college (Ohio University) and [released it to you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting). It took a while to monetize it, and it actually ran off of [your donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9nsoa/mrgrim_creator_of_imgur_is_barely_breaking_even/) for about the first 6 months. Soon after that, the bandwidth bills were starting to overshadow the donations that were coming in, so I had to put some ads on the site to help out. Imgur accounts and pro accounts came in about another [6 months after that](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ank6i/reddit_ive_been_promising_this_to_you_for_months/). At this point I was still in school, working part-time at minimum wage, and the site was breaking even. It turned out that OU had some pretty awesome resources for startups like Imgur, and I got connected to a guy named Matt who worked at the Innovation Center on campus. He gave me some business help and actually got me a small one-desk office in the building. Graduation came and I was working on Imgur full time, and Matt and I were working really closely together. In a few months he had joined full-time as COO. Everything was going really well, and about another 6 months later we moved Imgur out to San Francisco. Soon after we were here Imgur won [Best Bootstrapped Startup](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/imgur-wins-best-bootstrapped-startup-sees-1-billion-pageviews-per-month/) of 2011 according to TechCrunch. [Then we started hiring](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/02/02/were-hiring/) more people. The first position was Director of Communications (Sarah), and then a few months later we hired [Josh](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/03/23/imgur-is-growing/) as a Frontend Engineer, then [Jim](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/04/18/welcome-to-imgur-jim/) as a JavaScript Engineer, and then finally [Brian and Tony](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/07/10/welcome-brian-and-tony/) as Frontend Engineer and Head of User Experience. That brings us to the present time. Imgur is still ad supported with a little bit of income from pro accounts, and is able to support the bandwidth cost from only advertisements.

*Some problems we're having right now:*

* Scaling the site has always been a challenge, but we're starting to get really good at it. There's layers and layers of caching and failover servers, and the site has been really stable and fast the past few weeks. Maintenance and running around with our hair on fire is quickly becoming a thing of the past. I used to get alerts randomly in the middle of the night about a database crash or something, which made night life extremely difficult, but this hasn't happened in a long time and I sleep much better now.

* Matt has been really awesome at getting quality advertisers, but since Imgur is a user generated content site, advertisers are always a little hesitant to work with us because their ad could theoretically turn up next to porn. In order to help with this we're working with some companies to help sort the content into categories and only advertise on images that are brand safe. That's why you've probably been seeing a lot of Imgur ads for pro accounts next to NSFW content.

* For some reason Facebook likes matter to people. With all of our pageviews and unique visitors, we only have 35k ""likes"", and people don't take Imgur seriously because of it. It's ridiculous, but that's the world we live in now. I hate shoving likes down people's throats, so Imgur will remain very non-obtrusive with stuff like this, even if it hurts us a little. However, it would be pretty awesome if you could help: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Imgur/67691197470

EDIT 8:08 AM 8/17/12: Much appreciation for everyone asking and waiting for responses.  This is a lot of work, wow!  But I intend to answer some more later this afternoon. 
EDIT 7:43 PM: Back with more answers, though might not be much more after this for awhile.  We both expected as much work doing an AMA, but it's another thing reading all the wonderful comments and then thinking on and answering great questions.  Takes a while!  Here goes a few more...

I make films and we can talk about that if you like, but I’m also on the board of directors of a new organization called [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org). My fellow board members include legendary whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, writers Glenn Greenwald and Xeni Jardin, award-winning documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow.

We all came together in December to try to start a broad movement to help protect and defend the First Amendment, given secrecy is at an all time high and whistleblowers have never been under greater attack. I wrote about it for [Huffington Post here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/why-im-donating-to-fund-t_b_2632389.html).  You can also read the two talks I did with leading free speech law professor Jonathan Turley and Kevin McCabe [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/what-is-an-assange_b_2317824.html) and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/what-is-an-assange-part-2_b_2402236.html).  

Back in 2010, WikiLeaks was cut-off from payment processors despite committing no crime, after unofficial pressure from a couple Congressman. We wanted to make sure that doesn’t happen to another journalism organization again, but we also wanted to help other organizations bring transparency to government.

So, we’re taking donations to WikiLeaks, but also supporting three other innovative organizations, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Truthout, and Public Integrity.

They each have a specific secrecy-busting project on US drone strikes, the Guantanamo trials, and US defense spending that your money will fund. And every two months, we're going to support a new bundle of organizations similar to these. You can go to our website and donate to any or all of these organizations here: https://pressfreedomfoundation.org

So hopefully you donate. But whether or not you do, spread the word around and read and support these organizations that are doing such important work. Obviously everyone can't afford to donate, but awareness and knowledge is just as important.

Ask me anything though.

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.

**Proof:**

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

My father declared himself Prince and my mother Princess.

Our claim was emboldened the next year when, after I faced weapons charges for firing warning shots at an approaching British vessel, a British court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case because the exchange had occurred in international waters.

A decade later, a greater drama ensued when a group of Germans with plans to build a luxury casino on the fortress tried to take control of Sealand while my mother and father were away. They held me hostage for several days before releasing me. A few days later myself, my dad and a few close Sealanders stormed Sealand and retook it in a dramatic armed helicopter raid, (the helicopter was piloted by our close friend John Crewdson, a James Bond stunt pilot!). Once the fort was retaken, we imprisoned the men there. When the German government sought Britain’s help in freeing them, Britain declined to intervene, citing the 1968 ruling. Germany sent a diplomat, the men were eventually freed, and My father Roy asserted that Germany had effectively recognized Sealand as a sovereign nation.

Sealand has its own flag, currency, passports, national anthem, stamps and most recently a national Football Team! 

There have also been recent meetings in Hollywood regarding the making of a Sealand film.

I am currently editing my book ready for publishers to see.

Hi Redditors!

I've always enjoyed doing Q&amp;A's on 4chan, and have gotten a lot of requests to do an AMA on Reddit over the years.

My background: I founded [4chan](http://www.4chan.org) in 2003, and have been working on a new site called [Canvas](http://canv.as), which launched two months ago in invite-only private beta.

Redditors can sign up for Canvas here: [https://canv.as/redditors_only](https://canv.as/redditors_only)

We opened our threads to the public last week, but until you sign up you won't be able to browse index pages or sticker, comment, and remix. Here are a few fun examples of threads we've had: [http://canv.as/p/1iq1a](http://canv.as/p/1iq1a), [http://canv.as/p/2yuu](http://canv.as/p/2yuu), [http://canv.as/p/bwfm](http://canv.as/p/bwfm).

The Canvas team—[timothyfitz](http://www.reddit.com/user/timothyfitz), [roooney](http://www.reddit.com/user/roooney), and [dmaurolizer](http://www.reddit.com/user/dmaurolizer)—will be helping me answer questions related to Canvas, and I'll answer everything 4chan related.

Ask away!

EDIT: I'm heading out for a bit, but I'll be spending most of my day hanging out in this thread, and will be back to answer questions soon.

EDIT #2: Wow, what a response. I'm back and answering questions now.

EDIT #3: I've posted a lot of responses that seem to be stuck at the bottom of the page. Please check my [user page](http://www.reddit.com/user/moot) to see those responses, and vote for them (*and their parents!*) if you believe them to be informative. Thank you!

EDIT #4: We're going on twelve hours now, and the response has been incredible. Thanks so much everyone! I'm still here answering questions and hope to stick around for at least another few hours. I'll also make some time tomorrow to hang out again.

**About Us**

We are lawyers, plaintiffs, and civil liberties advocates involved in the Hedges v. Obama lawsuit and other activism to fight the NDAA - specifically the ""indefinite detention"" provision.  

Indefinite detention was passed as part of the fiscal 2012 National Defense Authorization Act and signed into law by President Obama on New Years Eve last Decemb.  It would allow the military to detain civilians -- even Americans -- indefinitely and without charge or trial. 

The provision being fought (Section 1021 of the NDAA) suspends due process and seriously threatens First Amendment rights.  Judge Katherine Forrest ruled entirely in favor of the plaintiffs earlier this month, calling Section 1021 completely unconstitutional and granting a permanent injunction against its enforcement.  

The Obama DOJ has vigorously opposed these efforts, and immediately appealed her ruling and requested an emergency stay on the injunction - claiming the US would incur ""irreparable harm"" if the president lost the power to use Section 1021 - and detain anyone, anywhere ""until the end of hostilities"" on a whim.  This case will probably make its way to the Supreme Court.

It sounds like our friend SH is running out of steam and I imagine our colleagues in Seoul have some sore typing fingers, so we're going to have to sign off for now.

Please share widely, and until the next time!

**Hey Folks,** [Movements.org](http://movements.org) here for this AMA. This is JJ at the keyboard and we are joined tonight (or this morning in a chilly Seoul) by an incredible organization [Liberty in North Korea: LiNK](http://libertyinnorthkorea.org/) who is sitting beside (and providing translation for) our friend Sang-hyun who recently escaped from North Korea. Because of the ongoing danger involved in making this passage and the constant threat of retribution, we are not using Sang-hyun's real name, and the best proof we can offer of his identity is a Tweet from both organizations here: [Movements.org](https://twitter.com/aym/status/304006187039485953) and [LINK](http://www.movements.org/page/-/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-19%20at%206.28.34%20PM.png). Over the next hour-and-a-half, Sang-hyun will be available to answer any question you have about North Korea-- our goal is to get past the headlines about nukes and sanctions that have bombarded us these past few weeks and understand a bit better what the **people** living inside the [most repressive regime in the world](http://libertyinnorthkorea.org/learn/nk-crisis/) are dealing with every day. 

We hope you'll forgive the intermediary nature of this AMA, but responses coming from Movements_Guest will be coming directly from LiNK and Sang-hyun himself.

**Movements.org** provides support to human rights activists using digital tools to fight repression and helps amplify those voices around the world who are calling for freedom. While we've done a number of activist chats on Twitter, this is our first Reddit AMA, and over the next few months we hope to bring you more opportunities to speak directly with those fighting on the front lines for basic human rights. For a bit more background on this AMA, and to Join Us, visit: [Movements.org](http://movements.org).

Want to make a difference for Sang-hyun and other people trying to escape North Korea? See below for more info about LiNK and how you can help: 

**Liberty in North Korea (LiNK)** is the only full-time grassroots organization in North America devoted to the North Korean human rights and humanitarian crises. LiNK provides protection and aid to North Korean refugees hiding in China and, utilizing a modern-day underground railroad through Southeast Asia, rescues refugees and helps them to reach freedom. LiNK’s global grassroots movement works to redefine public perception on North Korea, shifting attention away from the politics and onto the people, and provides a way for concerned citizens to come alongside the North Korean people and help bring about positive change. LiNK also works to develop people-focused strategies that will have the potential to promote change inside North Korea in the long term.

I was born in 1914 in a house in Chicago. We lived in a neighborhood we called ""Back of the Yards"", and my family members worked in the nearby stockyards. When the Prohibition started (and the Depression followed), I helped my mother make and sell bootlegged whiskey called ""hooch"" from our house to make money for our family. I also  remember a little about the ""Century of Progress"" World's Fair that was in Chicago in the 1930's!

style for our script writing program, and I'm just comfortable with it.

Secondly, I'm sorry this response is so long in coming, but until

air, though you probably could.

So without further ado, here we go...

*To this day I'm convinced that your appearance at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner was because the Bush Administration didn't understand
your show.*

*Did they? What happened behind the scenes there? Was it more ""non-alcoholic
beer in the Roosevelt Room"" or ""Dick Cheney peppering your limo with
bird-shot as you beat a hasty retreat?""*

I was as surprised as the next guy that I was invited to roast the
President and the press corps that spring.

Here's how it works. The White House Press Association (or some name close to
that) actually does the inviting, not the President or White House. The
president of the press association that year was a man named, I believe,
Mark Smith, I think from the AP. He invited me. When all was said and done, I wrote to thank him and said I hoped I hadn't
made trouble for him. He said there was zero fallout. 

As for the backstage
aspects of the night, the President has a nice, small gathering in a room
near the banquet hall. The presidential seal is etched into the granite on
the floor. A few news anchors, football greats, cabinet members and advisors
(I remember Rove and Chertoff, there were others I think), Rich Dahm,
Allison Silverman, my brothers and sisters and mom, my wife Evie, and the
President and Mrs. Bush.  Let me say that the President could not have been
nicer, especially to my mother. I have some lovely pictures of her with him.
The President and I had a brief conversation before we went on stage.  There
were in total maybe 60 people at the party, many of whom I should remember
more about, but I was pretty focused on my job that night.  There was no
backstage event after the dinner, but several parties around town.

I had my family up to our room for a drink then hit a party, don't remember
which one. We all had a great time. but I had no sense of public reaction
until Monday at work.

*You gained your fame and fortune slightly later in life, was there ever a
point in your career where you thought about plan B? What kept you going as
an actor, why did you keep trying?*

*At what point did you realize that everything was probably going to be okay,
was it a specific gig you landed?  What did you do to excel your career when
you weren't booking gigs? Lastly, do you have any advice for 20 somethings
pursuing a tough career during this economic downfall where it isn't just
actors who aren't getting jobs?*

When you are young and single, there really isnt anything to worry about.

Will you starve? Not likely. I worried that I didnt have enough gumption to
get work. That I wouldn't know how to network or something. But at a young
age several people, some professors and directors, told me I had talent, and
that it was mine to husband if I was willing to work.  Those kind words
sustained me, many times.

I mostly just said yes to any opportunity to get on stage. Pay or no pay.
Equity, amateur, comedy, avant garde, and improv especially. Chicago
has a great improv community, and I could get up on stage a lot after I
got to know the other members of the community. I called it getting in
trouble. You say yes to something, then you are in trouble. You have to
deliver.  Each mini-crisis I forced myself into made me work hard.

As for true doubt, it got under my skin deeply only once. I was
newly-married and I was offered a part I would have loved, but no pay. I had
worked for six years doing anything, but had made a deal with myself that if
I ever was to have family I could support, I would have to insist on pay. A
small rule, right? But hard for a young actor to keep. Mostly you don't
really get paid.

I said no to the part and immediately (I mean within minutes) went into a
spiral of panic that lasted for months. I was sure I had made the wrong
decision (I hadn't) and would never get a part like it again. But the worst
feeling was that I knew I truly wanted to be an actor and there was no
turning back now. I was too old to do anything else.  This was a feeling I
wouldn't wish on anyone.

Importantly, I was wrong on all counts. Just keep working as long as you
can't thnk of anything else you could happily do. Keep saying yes.

*After viewing the more candid interaction you had with John Kerry recently,
I'm curious:*

*How often are there times, on the show, or in your day to day life where
people will express a strong feeling of agreement with the more ludicrous
things you say? Do you ever just want to yell ""No you idiot, you can't
possibly agree with what I said. What I said was stupid, and you're stupid
for agreeing with me!""*

*I know I often play devil's advocate in arguments for fun, and sometimes I
have to stop half way and just say ""No, stop agreeing with me!""*

There have been many times that I have successfully argued a position I
don't agree with. That's a lot of fun.  But the sort of thing that gets me
is when simple lies are not refuted, like, ""The founding fathers were all
deeply-committed Christians who believed in the literal word of the Bible.""

""Tax increases on the rich are proven to lead to job losses.""

*Do you feel like the comedy news shows by you and Stewart are having any
effect on the actual mainstream / cable news networks?*

*You both pick their stories apart frequently and point out their biases,
have you noticed any change in their practices? Is the goal of your show
purely to entertain, or would you really like to affect a change on the news
media?*

I think the phrase ""purely to entertain"" has a nice ring to it. Much better than ""merely to entertain.""

I presently have no plans to change
the news media. They are changing themselves without any help from me.  I
seem to remember that when I started the show five years ago there were
fewer jokes in the cable news nightly broadcasts. And I was the only one
crying on a regular basis. I could be misremembering that.

*Who have you tried to get for an interview, but won't come on your show? Who
would you like to interview the most?*

I've never been heartbroken not to have a guest. Our game doesn't flourish
because of big names, but because of strong feelings about the guest
or passion from the guest on their subject. And my booker is tenacious.

That being said, I'd like to have more conservatives on.  But I can
understand guests' hesitancy. They don't always know what to expect
from a character. That may make them uncomfortable.

Salinger would have been nice. I'm a fan.

*Do you sometimes wish you could not be in character for some interviews?
Being in character, do you feel that it prevents some people from coming on
the show?*

Well these questions are really related. I'll say that from my end of
the interview, I often have a guest whose subject I happen to know a thing or
two about, and I want to engage them intelligently, but I am an aggressively
ignorant character. That is frustrating. Of course knowing their subject
lets me make the dumbest possible characterizations of their position or
idea. If you ever see me truly being vigorously dense with a guest, I
probably know something of his or her subject.  And as I said, yes, the
character aspect may give some people pause.

*Has anyone ever walked off the set/out of the studio either during or before
an interview? If so, why?*

No one has ever walked out in studio. One congressperson was about to in
D.C., but my crew jumped in to stop it from happening. Not I. I just wanted
to capture whatever happened. After that moment, strangely, the
representative went on to have a great time with me. I'm not sure what
precipitated the threat to leave.

\#8 by [drunkmonkey81](/user/drunkmonkey81)

*How often do you interview people who still don't realize you're ""in
character""? Can you share a story of your favorite encounter with a
""clueless"" participant?*

No one doesn't know I'm in character. I tell everyone first.

I admire Sacha Baron Cohen, but I am not doing Ali G.

\#9 by [Imidazole0](/user/Imidazole0)

*What is your stance on marijuana legalization?*

When we were last in California for the Emmys, people came out of pot
shops with lists of things to say to the doctor so he wold give you
a legal prescription. Anxiety. Sleeplessness. What is the difference
between that and legalization? So if it happened, I don't think the
world would come to an end.

Unless... IT WAS THE POT SMOKERS WHO DREAMT UP SUBPRIME MORTGAGE
BUNDLING IN THEIR DAMNED OPIATE FEVERS????!!!!

When I was young, marijuana was everywhere and basically a joke. Then
in the eighties it was conflated with crack in the just say no days. I
was truly surprised by the return of drug humor and movies in the last
decade.

*Jon Stewart's interview on Rachel Maddow highlighted Jon's philosophy on the
difference between his role and the role of news people like Rachel
Maddow.*

*What, in your mind, is the difference between your responsibility or job and
the responsibility or job of a news anchor or 24 hour news host /
personality?  Do you feel you're fulfilling your role? Do you feel they're
fulfilling theirs?*

*Thanks for doing what you do. You're a funny, funny man.*

I think Jon's appearance on Rachel highlighted his ability to be pretty
sharp after vomiting for eight hours.

As for the 24 cable hosts / personalities fulfilling their
roles, you bet they do -- as those roles are defined by their companies.
If not, they are fired. The fact that the roles they fulfill are hard
to recognize anymore, and have little to do with informing us, but are
instead used to emotionally ""engage"" us with their brand personas,
means I have a steady stream of material.

I too would be fired if I wasn't fulfilling my role as defined by my
company. Happily they define that as comedy, and I agree. I have no real
responsibility beyond working hard on jokes.

*How does your family handle your constantly growing popularity? I know in an
interview a while ago you said you didn't want your kids to watch your show
because you feared they wouldn't be able to differentiate your character
from who you really are. Is that still the case or are they allowed to watch
your show now?*

It has come to my attention that I can't stop them anymore, but I wish they
would ask me which shows to watch. Sometimes the old guy can get on some
rough subjects. I don't like the kids seeing that. He drops the F bomb a wee
too much as well.

I am lucky to have gotten my flavor of fame after reaching man's estate.

Not
that I don't confuse myself at times, but I have a pretty good idea of
who I am, and am sustained by a breathtakingly levelheaded girl who
married me long ago.

Thanks so much for all that you redditors did for the rally. I am so
impressed that your idea of coercion is to do good deeds until they are
national news.  CNN and others were reporting your charity blackmail just
days after you started. A new idea, I think, and something to be proud of.
The rally was tremendously supported by you all, along with Facebook, and
Twitter. I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you
clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout
and success. Contrary to whatever bullshit quotes you may have heard in the
bullshit press.

See you 'round.

Thanks,

You’ve probably noticed, our democracy is a mess. [Citizens United](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=5771765) triggered a tsunami of corporate political spending that threatens our democracy. Meanwhile, the Wall Street titans who crashed our economy are getting richer than ever and still enjoying Washington galas, while Aaron Swartz was aggressively prosecuted for trying to share public documents with the public.  Our government is for sale to the highest bidders.

Right after Watergate, [I was elected to Congress](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4860231) and spent 12 years there pushing back against establishment politicians who cared about their special interest donors more than the people they represented.  When I was in Washington, there were problems, but we could make things work. Today, the system is so badly broken we can’t seem to make any progress.

I became president of [Common Cause](http://www.commoncause.org) in 2007 so we could get Washington working again for regular people like you and me.  Common Cause is a nonpartisan nonprofit org that’s been around for 40 years [fighting for the public interest.](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764181)

Here’s some of the work we do at Common Cause:

* [Money in politics](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764307) is one of the biggest problems our democracy faces. That’s why we’re trying to overturn the awful Citizens United decision with a [constitutional amendment](http://amend2012.org/about/) that says corporations aren’t people and money isn’t speech. In 2012, we passed resolutions saying this in [Montana and Colorado](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/11/06/amend-2012-ballot-measure-results/), and we’re already working to do the same thing in Arkansas in 2014.

* We’re also working to stop the ridiculous abuse of the filibuster we’ve seen in the Senate. [When you need a supermajority to even debate an issue](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/12/03/busting-the-filibuster-on-msnbc/), it’s no wonder the 112nd has been the least productive Congress in years. That’s why [we’ve sued the Senate](http://www.alternet.org/story/155430/common_cause_sues_to_restore_majority_rule_to_u.s._senate) to abolish the 60-vote rule and pushing for common sense reform.

* Election 2012 saw an unprecedented [war on voters](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=7719573), with restrictive photo ID laws especially affecting students, low-income folks, people of color, and the elderly. We teamed with civil rights groups, mobilizing volunteers to register as many eligible voters as we could.  On Election Day, [we showed up in person](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/11/07/beating-back-the-bullies-on-election-day/) to ensure ballot bullies didn’t try to intimidate voters.

* Common Cause fights for the free flow of information. We were among many organizations to [stand against SOPA](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/01/18/91-million-legislation/) and we joined transparency advocates worldwide in mourning [Aaron Swartz](http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4773613&amp;ct=12188179).  In the months ahead, we will be fighting media consolidation and working to preserve network neutrality.

Here’s some more cool stuff I’d love to talk about:

* I hold five honorary degrees and I’ve been arrested five times for civil disobedience, guess which fact I’m more proud of?

* I wrote the book [“Middle Church”](http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Church-Reclaiming-Faithful-Religious/dp/0743289501) which calls upon progressive people of faith to take back the moral high ground from religious extremists like the Westboro Baptist Church.

* I hear you Redditors LOVE corny puns, which is good news, because so do I. Hit me with your best stuff and I’ll try and keep up.

That’s about it, ask away! **I’ll start answering questions around 1 EST.** Common Cause staff will also be answering questions on the account **Common_Cause**

**4:00pm (mst)** Carol: So, I'm at work right now. Just thought I'd let you all know that, since we're obviously not answering questions again for a bit, at least until this evening. Thank you all for so many upvotes, that's amazing... but - why so many downvotes too? o.O . . . why you gotta hate? Can't we sleep!? :P

**10pm:** Well, as the day draws to a close, all I can say is thank you again. I think we're winding down here on questions and answers. We may answer a couple more tomorrow, but no promises. We apologize if yours didn't get answered. In many cases, some of you asked a question that had already been answered, so be sure to look for that. I tried to link to some of those questions too... I did relay as many of the comments to Dean as I could, in case you're wondering if yours got read or not.

1354116826.0,2609,self.IAmA,13xqbr,IAmA a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon and I wish the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for treating Palestinians. AMA.,throwaway874832749,9569,6960,2870,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xqbr/iama_a_palestinian_refugee_from_lebanon_and_i/,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/) on r/worldpolitics, and somebody told me I should do an AMA, not sure if you'd be interested. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**UPDATE1: Since many here are blaming the PLO and its involvement in the civil war. That's definitely true to a large extent, however you're missing a few points. Most Palestinians refugees were placed in camps in south Lebanon when they arrived. These camps were gradually militarized and became the grounds for operations against Israel and because the PLO had so much power back then, they started making trouble and trying to control part of the country. So had the Lebanon absorbed it's Palestinian population properly, this wouldn't  have happened. Look at the Palestinians of Syria, they didn't make any trouble and didn't start any wars, why? Because they were treated like equal citizens. Also, FYI, Lebanon naturalized more than 100,000 Palestinian Christians and Shiites. Second, who do you think was funding the militarization of the PLO? THE ARAB GOVERNMENTS, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iraq or some other Arab country.**

**What do I want from Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee? Some of you say that naturalizing 450,000 Palestinians would be a strain on the country. You think that much Palestinian refugees aren't already a  strain? Everyone knows if Lebanon naturalizes Palestinians the whole debt Lebanon has would disappear. I'm not exactly fond of naturalization myself though. However, so many laws can be quickly enacted that will significantly improve the life of a refugee, like property law or proper ID and passports formats that aren't from the 1950's. Also, you say that refugees put a strain on Lebanon. Mind you that a large number of Palestinians work abroad and they all send money to their families in Lebanon so they contribute a lot to the Lebanese economy. Hell, I've been told the Lebanese lira dropped significantly when the PLO left the country in 1982. One more thing, all Lebanese factions and leaders involved in the civil war are now reigning free in the country many of them ministers or MPs, the same people that committed massacres towards their fellow Lebanese. Nobody was punished for the civil war, except for the Palestinians. Why? Because they're not Lebanese, so it's perfectly fine to discriminate against them.**

-------

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**UPDATE2: It seems like a lot of Kuwaitis here are saying that the Palestinians got what they deserved for their support for Saddam. Can you really believe that 400,000 Palestinians earning good money in Kuwait wanted war and death in Kuwait? There might have been a vocal minority, but that's to reason to expel families that were contributing to the Kuwaiti economy.**

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Me doing Toaster: http://www.jerryrees.com/page3/page3.html

More of me doing Toaster: http://www.jerryrees.com/page105/page105.html

Several years ago, fans who had grown up with the film started getting in touch with me. It was an awesome surprise to hear from the college crowd, who liked BLT as kids, then rediscovered it in their teens.

Various Producers started seeing potential in doing something fresh with the property. Thankfully, Tom Wilhite suggested to that if anyone was going to revive it, they should turn to the Director of the original – the only one of the three that stood the test of time. I truly appreciated it.

In 2009 I started developing a new story. Not a remake, but a proper sequel picking up right where the original left off. True to the spirit of the original, but comfortably nested in the present. And, my dream was to do a live-action CGI mix.  Not because John Lasseter, a good friend, had hoped to do it in CGI, but because I was doing CGI long before all of that, as a Computer Graphics Choreographer on the original TRON.  The TRON stuff had turned John and lots of other folks onto the potential of CGI.

Me on TRON: http://imgur.com/JHXsG

Some of my TRON Stuff: http://www.jerryrees.com/page20/page20.html

So I work the sequel story, and sink into the familiar characters, mixed with new characters and layers of substance and silliness.

A snag happens as it turns out people apparently holding the rights didn’t. Bankruptcy, Reorganized Debtor entities and cease &amp; desist notes abound.

Industry Big Names became my allies, encouraging me to continue with the creative endeavor, helping to sort out the legal knot. Months pass. I’m told to get ready to announce to the fans – we’re almost there!

The bankruptcy group suddenly says a “mystery entity” outbid and walked away.

The Industry Big Names say “Don’t worry, whoever it is will get in touch with you. You were Writer/Director on the original!” But they don’t get in touch.  The current announcement of a remake in fact attempts to delete my role from the original entirely. Can’t do that. Sorry, history is history.

What they did is totally legal. Anyone can buy anything and do to it what they will. But I cared about the original film and its characters dearly, and helped nurture them to life as the fans know them.  I believe I could have brought them alive again in a genuine way that is beyond the understanding and capability of people simply making “product”.

I had planned to invite as many of the Original Team as would be willing to jump in again.  Amazing people.

I had planned to invite the twenty-somethings in the industry, who had grown up with the film to join in.

And I had planned to use a web portal to allow fans from anywhere in the world to participate – actually trying their hand at animating, doing designs, throwing in storyboard ideas, etc.

It was a time for all of us to make Toaster together. By the way, I called the sequel “BLT, homemade.”

Okay, guess that’s enough preamble.

Ask me anything.

HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING 

* the very cleverly titled DON HERTZFELDT VOLUME 2 DVD is coming out next month and is now available to pre-order. the DVD collects the short film trilogy EVERYTHING WILL BE OK, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, and IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY,  with the option for the first time to play the whole story together, as a seamless new feature film. the DVD also includes a bunch of other stuff, including miserable cartoon WISDOM TEETH and over 40 minutes of interviews.  here is a trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e6DHjZ-eRg   

everyone pre-ordering the DVD will also get a free 35mm film strip,  clipped from an ITS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY release print (no two are alike),  as well as some other strange things because we don't want them anymore. please find all details over here:  http://bitterfilms.shop.musictoday.com/Dept.aspx?cp=957_58078

* the resulting new feature film shares the same title as the third chapter of the story,  IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY,  and is now turning up in theaters around the USA , with more screenings added before the year is out. it is a somewhat different cut than the one coming to DVD, but sort of not really. come see it on the big screen if you can,  the current list of confirmed cities is posted over at:  http://www.bitterfilms.com   expect one or two surprises

*  i think there was something else but now i can't remember

here also are the posts proving i am me and not somebody more interesting:

[Website](http://drmichaelham.com)

Today's blackout of the internet has been truly awe inspiring. For the first time in my adult life, I saw a diverse community come together with the express purpose of saving some of our freedoms from a Congress that has abandoned the vast majority of Americans. All three of my Congressional representatives are pro-SOPA/PIPA and it has been disheartening to contact them and have their offices ignore a very real threat to our freedom of speech.  

I'm a long time Redditor who got tired of watching my freedoms and future evaporate. So I decided to do something about it.  

Throughout my life, those that represent us in the Federal Government have been selling off my future piece by piece. I was born in 1981 when the Federal Debt was ~1 trillion dollars and the government couldn't wiretap my phone without a warrant. There was never any threat that my family might be indefinitely detained by the government we elected to represent us. The cost of attending a University was manageable for someone working a college level job.  The promise of a society that rewarded hard work, but still took care of those who were less fortunate was still in place.

Like most Americans I pinned my hopes on first one party then the other to restore some sanity to the way government operated. However, this government by the people is no longer for the majority of the people. It has become abundantly clear that government is not broken, it's been hijacked to represent a few narrow interests. There is a segment of society that has always been on the upswing during my life, but it isn't the average American. 

I want to show that there are consequences for these actions. The only way to get our Congress to perform it's duty, is to get a new Congress. We need to set a warning for every future Congress that if they continually subvert the will of the people, they will lose their jobs.

I am running for the United States Senate to replace a PIPA co-sponsor, Jeff Bingaman. I want to put pressure on the primary race and change the debate in the United States to one where we discuss which policies work and which don't. 

Here are [some of my top priorities](http://drmichaelham.com/?p=25) and here is a link to a [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ham/sopa-congress_b_1195598.html) I wrote about the danger of SOPA and PIPA to scientific discussion.

I want to be the voice in Congress that stands up for civil liberties and increases opportunities for all Americans.  I am expecting my first child and I want him to grow up in an America that is full of promise once again. 

I don't want to be a Congressman forever. I want to make a positive impact for the people our past several Congresses have left behind: teachers, soldiers, police, firefighters along with the entire middle and lower class. I also want to ensure that we continue to invest in our future as we fix the budget. Then I want to return to my normal life and write books and build apocalypse ready cars.

Congress thinks this (SOPA, PIPA, NDAA, Patriot Act etc) is just going to blow away, but to paraphrase the great American John Paul Jones ""[we] have not yet begun to fight.""

The principal investigator on the project, Ralph Harvey, couldn't be in the field this year, so he will also chime in here to answer questions.

My name is Adnan Hajizada and I am a dissident and ex-prisoner of conscience from Azerbaijan. In 2009 I posted a video that mocked the ridiculous overspending (purchasing donkeys from Germany at USD 40,000 each) by the Government of Azerbaijan. Two weeks later, my friend and I were attacked and severely beaten up by government hired thugs while dining in one of the local cafes. We went and complained about the event to the Police. Eventually the thugs were let go, my friend and I were arrested on trumped up charges of hooliganism and causing minor bodily harm. We spent 17 months in jail. The case caused wire international outcry, eventually Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama spoke on our behalf and we were freed on parole. 

I have been lurking here for a while, decided that the first post should be an AMA about myself. Hope this will be interesting.

We'll answer questions intermittently, but we've been doing this for 10 hours now, and need some food. You're all great, thanks for all the questions! :)

Almost three years ago, we hosted a session here on Reddit where you got to tell us [everything that annoyed you about Firefox 3.6](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/boipt/i_work_on_the_firefox_user_experience_team_and/). This led to an effort at Mozilla called “Paper cuts”, see [blog post](http://limi.net/articles/papercuts/) and [slides](http://www.scribd.com/doc/31643187/Firefox-4-Paper-Cuts-Alexander-Limi-Firefox-User-Experience). We got over 2000 comments back then, and we'd like to hear from you again!

What we're after is the “paper cuts”, the stuff that gets in the way or annoys you about Firefox on a daily basis, and that we could help get prioritized. 

**Ground rules:** (of course, you can ask us anything, but this will save some time)

* One idea/papercut per comment, please — that way they can be voted up individually.
* No trolling in bug reports linked from this thread, please — if there’s already a bug in Bugzilla for it, we take it seriously, no need to post “why hasn't this been fixed yet‽”
* We love all the other browsers on the market (yes, really!), and several of our close friends work on competing products. Competition makes everyone better, and the web is better off for it. No “browser X sucks, browser Y is the best” comments necessary.
* Make sure you have tried a recent version of Firefox (preferrably with a [reset profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems)) before commenting. Firefox has come leaps and bounds lately, and has best-in-class memory usage, massively improved startup time, etc. So make sure you're commenting on the product we're actually shipping, instead of the Firefox you used a year ago. :)
* We will not answer any questions about Rampart.

**TL;DR — some questions that are asked repeatedly:**

* Problems? Slow startup, slow shutdown, lots of memory used? [Reset Firefox fixes most issues](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems).
* If that doesn't fix your problem, talk to our [awesome support team](http://support.mozilla.org).
* Private browsing without shutting down the current set of tabs is coming in Firefox 20 (get the beta if you want it right now!)
* Flash issues are hard (focus stealing keypresses, volume control), due to the way Flash works. We're still trying to find ways to fix this. We hear you!
* We are currently working on Australis (the visual redesign), here's a screenshot of the UX build this morning: http://i.imgur.com/VdQ99bc.png

**Remember, Firefox is *your* project — it's the only mainstream browser not owned by a massive corporation — so help us make it better!**

My parents were barely present and I was raised by staff, babysitters and bodyguards. I was so emotionally neglected that my first spoken word was ""auto"" instead of mom or dad. I barely have memories of spending time with my parents outside of being dragged to political events in little tuxedos and Christmas. Completely alienated from the world around me, I sought refuge on the internet starting at the age of 9.

If I remember correctly, the trouble began when I was around 7 years old. There was increased pressure to become secretive, and I realized that there was something wrong about the fact that I was never allowed to go anywhere without two tall and heavily armed men following me around. My father was wary of everyone, including my classmates. Nobody was allowed at my house, and I was not allowed to go anywhere. 

I remember my greatest accomplishment of 'freedom', which was when I was actually allowed to go outside and only had to go with ONE bodyguard to pick up a Big Mac. I was forbidden to go outside due to continued threats on our lives, which included dead animals being mailed to our house. At one point I witnessed a carbomb being defused from a car that they falsely assumed was ours.

Around this time, my father began to exhibit signs of poisoning and had to be hospitalized. The diagnosis was heavy metal poisoning, possibly infused into his food or drinking water. Thankfully he recovered. There were numerous scares about snipers, and I was told to keep away from windows anywhere else except our house (because ours were custom built and bulletproof, as was our main car).

A year later we had to leave Slovakia in the middle of the night, staying in a hotel in Austria for several weeks. Why we had to move was unclear to me at this time. I was not frightened, but confused. I didn't really know what was going on, so I had no reason to be scared. Apparently Austria had granted my father asylum for the charges he faced. It took a decade of expensive and difficult legal proceedings to finally clear his name and get the government to admit that the charges were fraudulent. 

My mom began acting increasingly irrational. She locked herself out of her car multiple times, burst into tears randomly for no reason, and threw away jewelery and clothing in excess of $5000. One time she put a $10,000+ opera dress into the donation bin. Some homeless person must be looking quite snazzy by now. Humor: an easy way to cope.

One night in October 2000, when I was 9 years old, my mother burst into my room while I was sleeping. ""DIE!"" She screamed at the top of her lungs. The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was her wielding a large kitchen knife above her head and her cross necklace swaying as she ran towards my bed. She tore the blanket off me and began stabbing me in the chest repeatedly. I tried to defend myself with my hands and severed a finger in the process. There was blood everywhere. The walls and the bed were painted crimson, and it trickled onto the carpet. I felt serene and stoned off endorphines. Everything was blurry and dreamlike. It didn't seem like any of this was actually happening to me.

(In light of new information, she apparently suffered from Capgras delusion as pointed out by various commenters)

My father heard me scream for my life, ran downstairs (they were sleeping in separate rooms), and threw her down the stairs before calling the ambulance and the police. According to news reports, she then stabbed herself in the stomach and jumped out of the first floor balcony, breaking several ribs. My last memory of this night was passing out on a gurney while the EMTs talked at me in German. 

Luckily they managed to save my finger. I spent 6 months bedridden in a hospital. I had to relearn how to walk because she had damaged my spine. The knife went all the way through my body, and there are scars on both my front and back. 

 When reporters asked me how I felt, I said I was upset that my body was damaged and that I wished to murder my mother with a brick if she was ever released. My mom survived the jump and stabbing herself in the stomach and was put into a high security mental hospital. She was there for a year. During that time her sister tried to steal from us, and our housekeeper had to kick her out, literally throwing her suitcases on the street. 

My dad later married the nanny, and now they have a daughter. My stepmom has completed her law degree and now has a prominent law firm.

Every school I went to, this story followed me. Even though I WAS THE VICTIM, they were afraid of me and I was expelled for 'bad publicity' and 'scaring other students'. Teachers did not respect my privacy, and took any sickdays that I had as an opportunity to tell my story to the class at great lengths. I had to go to 7 different schools as a result of this. Their rationalization was that I would likely stab someone because it happened to me. At one point a school official asked for a considerable bribe to keep me in school, but my father's assets had been completely frozen, making him unable to pay even if he wanted to. We went from millions to almost nothing.

Note: There's a lot I left out due to space.

Here are photos of my scars, 11 years after the incident (possibly NSFW). Excuse my unkempt appearance, I just woke up and made no effort to shave/prepare. [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/CQC3i)

UPDATE - I only realized too late that the details pertaining to my stepmom have been claimed by my aunt in an attempt to smear our family and portray them in a negative light. I remembered that they have first been living together in 2003, and not any earlier.  


""I have made the reddit AMA post to try and make my situation understood, not be skewed into scandal. After the original post, I have realized that the accusations of an affair were the fabricated musings of my aunt Anita, who tried to damage our lives. Because I was still a child when this happened, her words stuck with me too deeply. I realized too late that this was just her way of getting back at us. I wrote the original post after a stressful day, and was confused by the dates.
The claim of my father's 'affair' surfaced only as late as 2003, which was a long time after these events have transpired. This was an attempt by Anita to spin the story in her favor. She threatened to do this and asked my father to give her my mother's old car as blackmail. When he did not oblige, she started spreading these rumors and lies.

To put things into perspective, Janka has always been supportive and helpful, more than possibly anyone else ever was to me. Growing up she was the only person I had any kinship with.

Anita on the other hand, hit me in the face the first time she saw me after I got stabbed. And all that because I accidentally dropped a dinner plate.

Saying that I was 'interested in UFO' is also skewing the situation, since the article conveniently leaves out that this was when I was 10 to 12 years old. This is not a relevant part of who I am today.

I tried to write my story out as a way of coping, and letting people know how terrifying life can be when something like that happens to you. I do not see much of a point in this prodding and stirring for the sake of entertainment. This is exactly what has confused certain aspects of my story, because my aunt has always been cooperative with news agencies to portray us in the absolute worst possible light.

My story was part my own subjective reality growing up, and part the incommensurate fiction that I have been force-fed by my greedy aunt and her posse.

If you are taking as factual evidence the memories of a child under the age of ten, I would reconsider your stance on reality. I have since spent more time contemplating the transpired events and realized that my timeline had not been accurate, nor had the reason for my mother's suicide been accurate.

She had killed herself for trying to murder me, something that was difficult for me to accept emotionally, and what my parents tried to shield me from. The only voice that rang loud was that of my manipulative aunt, who managed to sway my perspective enough to generate this fiasco.

I write this with deep regret, as my misremembering of her sleazy verbal manipulation of a child as factual evidence. There was no affair, and the distance between my father's nightmares of the incident and their relationship spans SEVERAL YEARS.

Moja teta 'affairu' vymislela a vtliekla mi to do hlavy, co som si uvedomil az ked som porozsmislal nad tim, presne kedy sa co stalo. Do 2003 o tom nic nebolo, ani Janka u nas nebivala !!!

Nikdo nebere do uvahy ze co spuosobilo vsetko bol politicky terror! Nobody considers that what caused the ENTIRE course of events was political terror.""

People who have questions concerning the political landscape and what really happened, I suggest you look at [Markiza.tv](http://markiza.tv) . 


**TLDR - My family who were once part of the government of Slovakia ended up being chased out of the country, lost their wealth, my dad was poisoned, and my schizophrenic mom stabbed me multiple times when I was 9.

My name is El Sawyer. I was sentenced to 8-20 years for a shooting when I was 17. I served 8 years in SCI Graterford, Pennsylvania's largest maximum security prison. While I was incarcerated I had the chance to learn film/video production. When I came home from prison I dedicated myself to community service and video production, and am now a director of a community arts non-profit in Philly called The Village of Arts and Humanities (www.villagearts.org)

Re-entry and recidivism is a huge issue, and through my own struggles with returning to society, I felt the need to create a film about the topic to shed light on some of these issues. The film is called Pull of Gravity (www.pullofgravityfilm.com) and follows three men (I'm one of them) in different stages of reintegration. The US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of PA reached out to me three years ago to lead classes for at-risk youth using video as a violence prevention tool. From the success of those classes they have put their full support behind the film.

Trailer for the film: https://vimeo.com/57340780

I'm happy to talk about what led me to prison, being in prison, the filmmaking process, etc etc.

Ask me anything.

EDIT: The guy I shot did NOT die. He lived and testified against me in court.

I have worked as a Emergency Room Physician since 1991. I have traveled all over US; and have worked in 11 states. I have calculated a guesstimate that I have treated about 100,000 patients.

That doesn't include residencies, I often see more patients per hour and work more hours than used in the math.)

He's also agreed to have his office create a sub-reddit where anyone can submit ideas for potential legislation or any other input; I have explained to him that reddit's user base represents a wide variety of skill sets and that its dynamics are such that good ideas will be voted, if not to the very top, at least high enough to compete with memes, joke answers, and pun threads, and that this medium can thus serve as a crowd-sourced advisory group possessing a number of advantages over more traditional means of getting information.

I should also mention that the incumbent, Randy Forbes, once introduced legislation whereby Congress would affirm that ""The Holy Bible is God's Word.""

&gt;what's the one movie that has stumped you (as far as making a decision on whether you enjoyed it or didn't) the very most in your career?

Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy."" I keep waiting to see it again. It keeps going wrong for me. The characters of Rupert Pupkin and Masha are unforgettable. Jerry Lewis is pitch-perfect. NAME is dreamy. I am nagged by a suspicion I'm wrong. I've approved of many leer movies. But in my sort of generic approach (Does this movie succeed in what it sets out to do, or what we expect it to do?) I dunno. I will have to see it for a fourth or fifth time.

&gt;**dippyT**

&gt;How has age affected how you view movies over the years? By that I mean, do you think you've gotten better at discerning what movies are worth seeing by having experience with the medium over a long period of time, or do you think a more innocent viewpoint, not marred by technical knowledge such as influence or technique, leads to a more ""pure"" watching experience - one that allows a person to more easily experience the core emotional elements that make a movie enjoyable or meaningful without being distracted by technicalities?

The more movies you see and write about, the more you know about them. Consider baseball. The ""innocent"" crowd member sees a bunch of guys running after a little ball while earring funny costumes. The Cubs fan sees inevitable tragedy unfolding.

&gt;**rboymtj**

&gt;How has your bout with cancer affected your viewpoints on things like controversial movies, politics and life in general? It seems that after your illness/voice problems began you've been publishing more politically motivated (and wonderful, I might add) columns and articles.

It was a wake-up call about my mortality. About a man about to be hanged, Dr. Johnson said something like this: ""The knowledge hat one is to die in the morning sharpens the mind greatly."" I don't expect to die in the morning, but the principle holds.

&gt;**rdewalt**

&gt;What is your ""Guilty Pleasure"" movie?

Russ Meyer's ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" John Waters called it ""The best movie that ever has been made, and ever will be made."" That tells you something right there.

&gt;**Khiva**

&gt;Are there are any of your reviews that are particularly proud of - ones that brought recognition to an unknown film, or which you feel captured something nobody else quite understood, or which were just unusually fun to write?

I am proud that I was the first person to ever write a review of a Martin Scorsese film, and I was absolutely right about him. I wrote about ""2001"" the day before its premiere, and my praise was joined by many early criticisms. Recently, I've been excited to champion the work of Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart,"" ""Goodbye, Solo""). My choice for best film of the decade was ""Synecdoche, New York,"" and on my blog I received dozens of messages in fervent agreement. Charlie Kaufman's film is building a reputation as challenging but profound.


&gt;**Paulinboots**

&gt;You are credited as the first major critic to realize what an incredible force in cinema Martin Scorsese was destined to become. What currently developing directors will be the most recognized in 20 years?

Ramin Bahrani.


&gt;**qgyh2**

&gt;Ever watched a movie that was too disturbing / shocking to complete / review (if so what was it)?

I walked out of ""Caligula,"" but more because of disgust and shock. Otherwise, no.


&gt;**stephiem**

&gt;What is your process of reviewing? Specifically, take notes during the film or do any outside research? If the film was based off of a book, do you read it?

I take written notes sometimes. I do not go out of my way to read the book, although often I may have. Although my reviews often discuss the source material, it's not a question of whether the movie is ""faithful"" to the book. The question is, how good a film is it? New things interested me less than whether ""Twilight Two"" deviated from the novel.


&gt;**lulz**

&gt;Are there any films you particularly disliked when you first reviewed them, but years later saw the film again and greatly enjoyed? Or vice versa?

Not particularly, although I am open to shifts in opinion. What we thought then need not be what we think no. We grow, we learn, we change.



&gt;**tantric\_fart**

&gt;What is your most favorite personal memory of Gene Siskel that at the same time defines the kind of person he was (i.e., an event, a joke he told, act of kindness, something he said, etc.). Details of this memory would be much appreciated. He seemed like a genuine soul and it was fun to watch the two of you worked together.

My appreciation of him only grows over the years. He was formidably intelligent and much of his criticism grew from his skill as a reporter. He liked to say he ""covered the movie beat."" Some may dismiss that; he used it to apply inflicting honesty. I'm glad so many of our old shows survive on the net, because he was so funny.


&gt;**giantgiant**

&gt;On the first viewing of a movie, do you find yourself paying more attention to the mechanics of movie making (IE ""What a bad shot,"" or ""What good lighting/sound,"" or ""That character draws attention away from the main plot in a bad way,"") Or do have the ability to let the mechanics go and watch the movie like a ""regular"" movie viewer; to 'get lost in the story'?

The movie informs me how to look at it. In an ideal situation, I'm looking at everything all at once, just as an experienced sports fan is caught up in the excitement of a game, yet simultaneously observes strategy and technical details.


&gt;**jhaluska**

&gt;Has anybody ever thanked you for a negative review of one of their films?

In an ad, David Lynch once proudly proclaimed, ""Two Thumbs Down!""


&gt;**tdrizzle**

&gt;What do you think of meta-review sites like rottentomatoes and metacritic. Do you think they serve a good purpose, or do you not feel you can get a fair feel of a movie from aggregating reviews?

They tell you which way the wind is blowing, but no good review can be understood from a sentence or two. I think people understand that. My site gets a lot of hits from such sites, and IMDb, MRQE and MovieReviewIntelligence.


&gt;**juliusseizure**

&gt;In your opinion, how important is re-watchability when judging a movie to be great?

Derek Malcolm, the British critic, says his definition of  a great movie is: ""One I can't stand the thought of never seeing again.""

My left arm is frozen in a 90 degree angle and confined to my side. My right arm is also in a 90 degree angle, but I am able to fold it to reach my face and feed myself. I am unable though to stretch my arms out. When I was younger, bones grew near the ribs locking them into place. As i grew older, it caused to me to get severe scoliosis. This is a progressive disease meaning that the older I get, the worse I will become. People with FOP get these things called flare-ups where our muscles will really swell up and the bone will grow, limiting movement until the body tells it to stop. I am currently having one in my hip and thigh and it extremely painful. My chances of not being able to walk are very slim. There is currently no cure or treatment as of February 15, 2013, but there is hope because a clinical trial will start later this year. There is still a struggle  and it could be years till I am able to receive the treatment.A student at my school is helping me raise awareness by doing various fundraising activities.

I've given a TEDx talk to inspire adult language learners. AMA",irishpolyglot,7125,4818,1785,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y70v0/by_request_i_ama_polyglot_multilingual_person/,"A video I recorded (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITzFRlVhMVs) is currently on the front page of /r/videos and several people have requested that I do an IAmA [in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/y5pra/black_guy_and_white_guy_speak_a_dozen_languages/).

I am NOT naturally talented in languages. I took German and Irish (Gaeilge) in school, and barely passed German and had to drop down to a lower level in Irish for a basic university entrance requirement. I have a degree in Electronic Engineering and when I moved to Spain at the age of 21, **I only spoke English**. I even managed to spend six months in Spain and not learn the language to any useful degree. I've given a TEDx talk about my story and what I changed to become the polyglot I am today.

I've had a completely different approach since then and *can now speak ten languages* and sign American Sign Language. To watch **my TEDx talk**, and then see me use several of my languages with a native speaker in a spontaneous interview, **[check out the videos on this page](http://speakfromday1.com/in-action/)** ([here's a direct link to watch my TEDx talk](http://speakfromday1.com/tedx/)) or *[my Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/irishpolyglot)*. About six of these languages are genuinely **fluent** - this would be a [European Common Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) level B2-C2, with officially recognized diplomas in several, and the others are various degrees of conversational. So for example, my Spanish is C2 (mastery) and I've worked as an electronic engineer in the language, but my Chinese is B1 (conversational, but still hesitant).

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about my thoughts on how to go about learning a language efficiently.

For proof that I am who I say I am, you'll see that I'm pretty active on Reddit, Youtube, twitter etc. and it's always under the handle irishpolyglot.

Here are some typical questions people ask me:


**1. What's your secret? Are you naturally talented, or did you grow up in a multilingual environment?**

No. I did poorly in languages in school and only spoke English when I was 21. My secret is that I stopped using excuses like ""I'm too old"", ""I've got no language gene"", ""People will laugh at me"" and other absolute nonsense, and I focused on speaking my target language every single day. A communicative approach, rather than a studious one, will get you much further. I do study, but it's based around my spoken sessions.

**2. I see from your blog that you travel a lot. That's all well and good for you to be in the country, but I can't! I guess I can't learn my target language until I'm rich or go on holiday?**

Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, travelling as the core of your ""strategy"" is a terrible idea. I've met thousands of ""expats"" living abroad with nothing in the language.
I always tell people **it depends on your attitude, not your latitude** (and longitude). I actually learned most of my Portuguese while living in France, and in September I plan to learn a language totally unrelated to anything I've ever learned before, to fluency in three months, in the wrong continent, to prove how it's what you do, not where you do it, that matters.
You can talk to people on Skype via many sites (one I like is [italki](http://fi3m.com/italki)), or you can meet up in person! The video that is doing so well on /r/videos shows me and my other polyglot friend speak a dozen languages **in a mall in Ohio**. Not New York City, not at a language conference, but in Columbus, Ohio. There are always opportunities if you open your eyes or try harder! I also like to use Couchsurfing.org and search the city I'm in for the target language, and invite that person out for a coffee. 
You can meet up in person with native speakers of many languages if you are in any large city, or you can practice via Skype. Some languages are a little harder to do this than others, but once you find ONE person to spend time with consistently, you are good to go!


**3. Should I go out and buy Rosetta Stone/Pimsleur etc. What books do you recommend?**

[I reviewed Rosetta Stone for my blog](http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/) while learning Dutch. It's the first or second result when you Google ""review of Rosetta Stone"" and one of the few reviews on the Internet that isn't actually a pitch (for RS, or for a competing product). I've written a book myself that I sell on a site separate to my blog, but I say specifically not to buy it as an alternative to RS - it's only for people who are more curious about how I learn languages myself.

Basically, I find RS to be marketing geniuses. You can't miss them in America. But the product itself is simply not good. They copy and paste 90% of their content to all languages, which means you simply are not learning what you need to. Obviously a course needs to be unique for each language and its subtleties. The course is also too expensive. It has been effective for some people, but I feel it's because they've spent so much money that they feel obliged to use RS and other (more useful) resources.

[I've also reviewed Pimsleur](http://www.fluentin3months.com/pimsleur/) and a few other products. The bottom line is that there IS no product that will solve all of your problems. This is basically throwing money at the issue. What you need to do is learn a few words and phrases and use them immediately with a human being. I got so frustrated with this product-focus that I actually wrote a ""sales pitch"" for [the best product in the world, HB 2.0](http://www.fluentin3months.com/hb) (Human Beings).

Note that if your focus is just on passing examinations, or something else like reading a book, rather than communication with people, then a lot of what I say becomes less relevant. **Not me, or anyone else has the ultimate solution to learning a language**, this is all down to what is relevant for you. Many people do the opposite of what I say, and more power to them because they have very different goals. The great thing about the Internet, Youtube etc. is you can get to know other polyglots and see where their focus lies and see if you'd jive more with their advice. ""One size fits all"" products are always a terrible idea.

If you are really curious though, I tend to invest in ""Teach Yourself"", ""Colloquial"", and Lonely Planet phrasebooks when starting off with most languages. I find these teach you to get by pretty well, and are light on grammar. From there you can advance quicker. I would study grammar when I have a base, never intensively at the start.


**4. Does speaking a lot of languages get you laid a lot?**

I get asked this a LOT!! Look, I'll admit that I kind of got inspired to become multilingual partially because the Brazilian guy I met (mentioned at the start of my TEDx talk) had ladies drooling over him. I thought it was because he spoke all these languages, but in fact it was because he was charming, attentive and a nice guy, while also being assertive and a man of the world.

And that's what it all comes down to in the end. After my first four years of travelling, I think I spoke five languages, which is already ""impressive"" enough. I made the mistake of saying this immediately when I would meet a pretty girl, thinking she'd be so impressed with me that we'd be going home within five minutes. It never ever happened. It's as bad as waving a Rolex or pointing to your Porsche. That doesn't impress people ever. Some girls are attracted to guys with money, but if you come across as an insecure asshole then that charm vanishes and the cute and charming bum becomes way more interesting. (For the record, I'm not rich. I earn about the same wage as people I graduated university with, but I am a minimalist and this helps me travel easier. Living in foreign countries also helps you leverage currency differences to your advantage)

So no, speaking a bunch of languages does NOT get you laid. It's the kind of person that you are. It's true that now because I speak more languages, I am open to more opportunities to meet more interesting people. I travel a lot and have learned to become less shy and approach more people (guys and girls), and this naturally leads to more opportunities. It's true that if I happen to speak the girl's native language, my chances increase dramatically, but actually you only need to speak ONE language for this, not a dozen.

As it happens, I'm not travelling the world to shag every girl in sight, and it's a pity when people think I have ""a girl in every port"". I prefer quality over quantity, and building deeper connections than having a string of empty one night stands. Being a world traveller influences my love life (for better and worse) more than speaking many languages does.

Speaking more languages *does* make you more of a ""man of the world"", which is of course an attractive quality. DON'T learn languages to get laid though. You'll be terribly disappointed. Work on becoming a more interesting person. If more girls are interested in me, it's actually because I can LISTEN in more languages, not because I can speak in more of them.


**5. What's the hardest language in the world?**

I've learned Hungarian and Czech to basic conversational level (haven't maintained them though, my ten non-English languages I maintain are Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Esperanto, Irish (Gaeilge), American Sign Language, Mandarin and Dutch), dabbled in Thai and recently learned Chinese. And you know what the hardest one out of all of these has been?

Spanish.

Yep - not Chinese, not Hungarian. Spanish. When you look at a language from a purely linguistic viewpoint, comparing grammatical concepts or how many cognates it has with your mother tongue, it's easy to think that you could theoretically come up with a ""hardest"" language. 

But this ignores the psychological aspect. The hardest language in the world is what is hardest FOR YOU. Any generic list can never take this into account. I had the most inefficient learning approach (for a language I genuinely tried to learn) for Spanish. It took me almost a year to get the stage of OK conversational in Spanish, whereas it took me about five months to get to that same level in Chinese. I went on to improve my Spanish after this, but the point is that my APPROACH made the language hard, not the language itself.

If you are passionate about a language, then don't waste time comparing it to others. Some people like to learn a language *because* it seems hard (I'm not a fan of this; seems like a rather superficial reason to take on a means of communication with human beings), but for most of us this is nothing but intimidation, or the ego of someone who is a native speaker or who has learned it and wants you to think they are smart because of that.

Yes of course, if you have no personal attachment or motivation to learn languages and impersonally compare them, one language will come out as much harder than another to learn. But if you love Japanese Manga, then maybe this would be the ""easiest"" language (in passion) for you to learn, or if your family is Czech then you'll dive into that with way more enthusiasm than you ever would for Spanish or French.

Don't compare language. Learn the language you want to learn and learn it well!


**Bonus Q. 6 How do you learn so many languages??**

One language at a time. Focus, stick to it until you get to a very comfortable level, and then start another one, while maintaining the previous one. I've seen people try to learn two or three languages from scratch at once, and sometimes it works, but for most of us this is too confusing.

My fluent languages are a part of me now. I lived my life through them and have friends in these languages. I focused entirely on each one for several months or over a year, so it's a means of communication to me that I switch into.

I don't mix them up so often because I try to use them frequently. This allows me to compartmentalise them in my mind (I do other things like associate body language, posture, voice with one language so it's harder for another language to invade it).

Focus is the secret. If you are patient, and stick to one language that you are GENUINELY passionate about, then after you have reached a great fluent or mastery level in that language, you will be may more skilled to take on the next. It does get easier - not necessarily because your brain is tuned to language learning, but because your personality is. If you gain the CONFIDENCE to do it once, then you can do it again.

People don't realize how important confidence and ambition are in language learning. It isn't about good memory, but genuinely using it. This is how languages work - it's you and another person talking. Make it about that rather than sticking to the books and you'll be good to go!



*
EDIT 1: Several people are asking **Have you ever overheard people talking about you or dissing you thinking you don't understand?**, so I'll answer it here.

I have found indeed come across people talking about me in general, curious about this white traveller (especially in non-touristy places) but to this day, never bad mouthing me that I was aware of. In China this year they kept referring to me as an American 美國人, rather than simply foreigner 外國人, since I'm white and they presume most white people are Americans. I found that a little annoying, but hardly offensive. They'd say this loudly enough that I was bound to hear it, but presumed that I couldn't understand them.

And one girl on a metro in Taiwan said to her friend I was cute, and got so embarrassed when I said 謝謝! (Thanks!)

Also, another question coming up a lot is **What language do you think in?**
Generally, at any given time, I'm focused on improving a particular language. With this in mind, I force myself to voice-over in my head in that language. So even in the early stages, I'd try to *think* ""Oh damn! I'm out of milk! I'll have to go to the store"" or ""That girl's cute!"" etc. in the target language. It's unnatural at first, but soon I get used to it.

Right now I'm in the Gaeltacht in Ireland and think about such things in Irish. It's a conscious decision that keeps me in the flow. If you are curious about what language I **dream** in, you'll get that and a few other FAQs on this page: http://www.fluentin3months.com/learner-faq/

Some background: I have worked in the food service industry all my life. I've been a dishwasher, busboy, waiter, and bartender, and I've worked every position in a kitchen. I worked for years in a James Beard award-winning restaurant. I don't have a culinary degree, but oddly enough I was designated as the trainer for CIA externs. I quit working in restaurant kitchens fifteen years ago due to health reasons.

I have been working for my employer for twelve years now. He made his money by creating a stock brokerage from the ground up. Now he has sold his company and is retired, but he is still highly respected in the investment community.

My employers own houses in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and on a tiny private island in Florida. They travel seasonally, spending summers in New Hampshire, Winters in Florida, and the rest in Pennsylvania. They are wonderful, down to earth people.

Hi Reddit! Nearly 4 years ago I submitted an AMA ([Reddit, IAMA Native American Indian who lives on the reservation, or the U.S's third world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a1hcg/reddit_iama_native_american_indian_who_lives_on/)) in which many of you asked some good questions about where I live and how I grew up. I invite you to ask me again and I'll provide as much insight as possible.

As an update since then, I've started a Navajo language teaching website ([Navajowotd.com](http://navajowotd.com)) to give back. As you may know, the Navajo culture and language suffered, and still does, from an effort to extinguish it by various outside influences. It is my hope that more people will learn Navajo so that they can speak to their elders, and to encourage a dialogue about the importance of cultural preservation.

If you'd like to help the effort to preserve the Navajo culture, I started an [Indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969) to begin collecting and archiving the spoken word of Navajo elders, which I've named the Diné Bizaad project (Diné: the people; bizaad: his/their words). Here's the link: [http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969](http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969).

I also am on a walk that began a week ago at the western border of the Navajo Nation in Arizona and am now in New Mexico. This is to spread awareness of a pivotal moment in our history as Navajo people known as the Long Walk (Hwéeldi). In the 1860s, my ancestors were forcibly removed from their homes to a barren reservation east of Albuquerque, NM. Many of my people died, but their resistance and subsequent return via the Treaty of Bosque Redondo, led to the sovereignty we possess today. The treaty allowed the US government to take Navajo children into boarding schools, where a long line of mistreatment began in the government's pursuit to eradicate the Navajo culture. My walk to is to create a dialogue around this painful moment in our history as we are a few years from the 150th year since the return of our ancestors to our homelands.

I look forward to your questions!

I was 18 years old, from a family of 8 brothers. I was a photo recon and served in the South Pacific from 1943-1946. I was a receiver of a Purple Heart, when I was shot in the ear by the Japanese after I had been taking pictures of bases. I now am almost deaf in that ear.
In  Leyte, Phillipines, I lived in a village where I owned a pet monkey and took pictures of the locals. I was a part of the 8-Ballers, which was a photo reconnoissance squadron.
I am very knowledgeable in cameras, planes, and other pieces of technology. I even have an iPad that I research on daily.
In 2010, I took the Honor Flight, where I was sent to DC with fellow veterans to visit memorials and speak.
My experiences from the war are some of the fondest memories I have, and I would love to answer any questions you have. I have great recollection of things and am open to anything you might wonder about.

Protools on a computer, and an MPC. 2) how did i ""make it""? a combination of luck and persistence. that's the best i can tell you. do it for the fun of it, so if it doesnt take off, you arent at a loss. 3) whats my ""inspiration""? this is almost too broad to answer, but in short, A) life, and B) music is a part of the fabric of my life at this point, so it is just there, for better or worse, at all times.  it's how i've come to interface with the world in many ways, so i dont really need to look for it. there are an infinite number of things in music that i will never learn/accomplish/do, so its not like im constantly exhausting its' possibilities. hope that makes sense.",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1344908591.0,music,,True,t3_y542u,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y542u/hi_im_rjd2_producerdjlabel_ownergeek_ama/,

My name is Jim Graves, and I am running for Congress.

I want to replace Rep. Michele Bachmann because she is part of the inflexible extreme. While her freewheeling comments have made her a national media phenomenon, they have not added one new job to the 6th District of Minnesota.

I started AmericInn Hotels with my wife Julie in 1979 with only $2,000 in the bank.  Since then, I have created thousands of jobs and balanced as many budgets. 

I have never run for office before, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give back and serve the community that has given me so much. I look forward to providing the people of the 6th District the representation they truly deserve and so desperately need.

We have three debates coming up next week that we are very excited about. We wanted to schedule seven, but it seemed as if she wanted to have as few as possible! The debates are as follows:

* 10/30 in St Cloud @ the Rivers Edge Convention Center from 12:30-1:30. Public is welcome!
* 11/1 on MPR
* 11/4 on KSTP-TV Twin Cities

I'm a commercial pilot by the aviation definition of the word. I get monetarily compensated to fly. However, I'm a corporate pilot. So right there, I'll probably lose the interest of a few readers, and possibly pick up that of a few others.

I fly planes for an energy company here in the US. I'm also pretty young (mid twenties). I'm extremely lucky to be in what I consider a once-in-a-lifetime gig. I fly when I want, where I want, often for a few days at a time, and since I work in the business side of the company, I'm not just chauffeuring; I get to stay and play.

For now, I fly a single engine aircraft and a multi-engine turboprop. These are *not* jet aircraft. I have friends in the airlines who could maybe do an AMA for something concerning the 'big boy planes' or even corporate jets. For me, the jet flying won't be until next year, when the company buys one (or two? Hey boss?).

But hey, I'm definitely not opposed to a carrier commercial guy jumping in to hijack any questions that have to do with that side of the biz! In fact, I'd like it if a few of those guys did, as this will be more entertaining and educational all around. Also, I was never in the military. I went the civvy route. Military guys, you should jump in for some of those questions, too.

I'll answer what I can for as long as possible tonight. I won't give out any personal info, but I'll give my opinions and honest answers on anything pertaining to my corner of the wide, wide, world of aviation. Ask away, all.

I tested out of high school and joined the Army when I was 17. Two years later I was a machine gun team leader in an urban assault Stryker unit known as ""Bull Company."" We served a 15 month deployment from Aug 2007 to Nov 2008 as the only conventional task force running kill-or-capture raids in a district of Baghdad known as Sadr City. Our mission was to hunt down high value targets in the Mahdi Army and secure the north western flank of Sadr City from their influence.

On the 23rd of March one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the war broke out right there in Sadr City. The Mahdi Army rose up to overthrow the occupation. Our rules of engagement were lifted, and both sides went to town. Open street fighting lasted for nearly three months. Thousands of people were killed and wounded. That includes some two-hundred Americans and countless civilians - and it barely made a headline back here in the west.

At that point Iraq was considered ""old news"" and the politicians didn't want to talk about the war. 2008 was an election year so the ratings were more important than the truth. Both sides had something to lose if any word of battle made it home. The most attention it got back here was a 60 Minutes segment about high-tech UAV's - one which completely overlooked the actual fight. Other than that, were just a few back-page articles that never made it into print, and blog posts later on down the road as it solidified into a niche subject.

Instead, the biggest headlines that spring were the impending Twilight sequel, American Idol hiring a new judge, and Elliot Spitzer getting caught with a prostitute.

I recently wrote a book about my experience during the battle, and I've teamed up with some other vetsto get their stories out to the public. Together we're trying to raise awareness for what happened and some of my friends said an IAMA might help. While it would be totally cool if you want to head over to Kickstarter and pre-order a copy of the book, I'm not here to pull a Woody Harrelson. I just want to get the word out about what happened in Sadr City, help people get a more complete picture of what really happens ""on the ground"" during modern combat, and answer any questions you may have about... well... anything at all.

My name is Nicholas Eftimiades.  I’ve spent 28 years working with the US government, including:

* The National Security Space Office, where I lead teams designing “generation after next” national security space capabilities
* The Defense Intelligence Agency (the CIA for the armed forces), where I was Senior Technical Officer for the Future’s Division, and then later on I became Chief of the Space Division
* The DIA’s lead for the national space policy and strategy development

In college, I earned my degree in East Asian Studies, and my first published book was [Chinese Intelligence Operations](http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Intelligence-Operations-ebook/dp/B004OL2NI8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346781552&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=chinese+intelligence), where I explored the structure, operations, and methodology of Chinese intelligence services.  This book earned me a declaration from the Chinese government as an “Enemy of the People.”

In 2001, I founded a non-profit educational after school program called the [Federation of Galaxy Explorers](http://www.foge.org/) with the mission of inspiring youth to take an interest in science and engineering. 

Most recently, I’ve written a sci-fi book called [Edward of Planet Earth](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&amp;field-keywords=edward+of+planet+earth&amp;sprefix=edward+of+p%2Cdigital-text%2C221).  It’s a comedic dystopian story set 200 years in the future about a man who gets caught up in a world of self-involved AIs, incompetent government, greedy corporations, and mothering robots.

I write as an author and do not represent the Department of Defense or the US Government.  I can not talk about government operations, diplomatic stuff, etc.

He was called upon to do recon in Afghanistan due to his ability to speak Farsi, prior to the Soviet invasion in '79. Thanks to a tip from a Captain who was a friend of his, he avoided going to Afghanistan as those who went never returned (this was before the actual Soviet heavy weapon invasion/assault). 

He used his negative standing with the Soviet party as reason to approach the US Embassy in Moscow in 1989 and our family was granted asylum as political refugees. 

We moved to Los Angeles in 1989 (I was 2 years old).

AMA!",dramaticat,10432,8229,1494,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1johro/iaman_aussie_girl_that_grew_up_in_the_bush_living/,"I was born in Sydney to parents that had grown up there and decided they wanted a rural upbringing for me and my soon to be brother. Plans were made and at 8 years old we (4 yr old bro and parents) were moving into an old, weather board tool shed (5 x 10ms) on 22 acres of land with no electricity or town water supply access in central Victoria.


The old tool shed was a temporary situation whilst my dad extended an old tin garage that was also on the property so we had more room to live in whilst he built us another house. The dream was a mud brick, A frame house, completely self sustaining. 


As life happens nothing went to plan but we had an amazing and unique experience that I'm willing to share if you are interested! To give you an idea of the unique daily/ weekly life activities/ chores/ worries I have made a list:
* Not having electricity we would have to ensure we always had huge supplies of candles lying around. We were very poor so 'just popping into town' almost 20 kms away was not always an option. We learnt the hard way early on, short Winter days became even shorter and bedtime was about 5pm.


*This was early 00's and Australia was just starting its 10 year drought so rain water that we caught in the tank was for drinking only. Shower water was supplied from one of our dams through a diesel generator. The water was so brown from the clay bottom that if you had a bath you couldn't see your hand 2cm under the surface. Best memory of going to my Nana's house back in Sydney was sitting in a crystal clear water and being able to see the bottom of the bath ( also pee).


*Snakes were a frequent occurrence, Red belly blacks  and Eastern Browns.  Dad was a real bushie and taught us how to handle situations with them. Feeling like an expert on herps I would go to a log on the property border  that had baby brown snakes every year and herd them into old lemonade bottles so my brother and I could examine them. 'Yep, that is indeed a juvenile Eastern brown that would most definitely inflict a lethal bite to a young child more than an hour from the nearest hospital'. ( Probably would have made it to the hospital but the embelishment sounds better.) 


*Being the only two black kids ( my brother and I are half white aussie and half Torres Strait Islanders) at a school in a tiny town that lived in the bush with no electricity, we aroused a lot of attention from the towns folk. My favourite question from a fellow 8 year old peer whilst looking confusedly at the palm of my hands, 'Are your hands worn out from working the land?'


*At the time it was a little weird for us to live so differently from the other kids so bringing them back for our birthdays we would be a little shy/ embarrassed, especially if they wanted a shower…
*As cooking was done on an open fire for the first 8 months of living there, chopping loads of wood was a weekly chore we all shared. I was the most ripped 8 year old child at my school, full 6 pack and guns that went on for days. To collect the wood my brother and I would drive ( I learnt to drive manual at 8 and my bro at 5) into the bush and collect the old logs lying around and bring them back to be chopped up. This is how my bro totalled our car, the only access we had to town for a few weeks before we could rustle up enough cash for a cheap Camera (bogan spec car).


*The whole thing lasted from about 8 to 15 for me as my mum had been battling schizophrenia since I was 1 week old. The episodes would become more severe and last longer every year. By the time I was 14 my parents had to separate because mum was off chops and dad was hitting the bongs hard for several years by then, needless to say the house construction was put on indefinite hold when the bongs were on the scene and mum thought I was the spawn of Satan. 


Poverty and craziness aside,  I’m so thankful to have had the experiences I had from growing up in the bush and being exposed to such a unique experience. I feel a resilience in my character now that I don’t think I would have had I grown up in a more normal setting.


My story has so much more to it so if you’re interested, ask away! 

Gosh. Proof that I lived in a shed with no electricity is super hard. Hopefully this photo of my family in hillbilly clothing in front of the foundations of our dream house will suffice? 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jgKcJlE.jpg?1[/IMG] 

TL;DR Bushlife. Grew up with no power or clean water with a schizophenic mum that thought I was the spawn of Satan and a hippie Dad that loved the green. Time of my life. Many stories along the way, many good, some sad and some funny brother sabo. AMA!

I saw an old man be beat bad enough to be taken to the hospital because he didn't respond to a verbal order RIGHT AFTER he took out his hearing aids (which he was ordered to do.) 

I was fired after I caught the beating of a triple amputee (you read that right!) on video, and I got 7 officers fired for brutality. 

Don't believe me? here's a still from the video.

This is one second of over 14 minutes of this poor man being beaten with a mop handle, kicked, punched and thrown around. As you can see in the video, he is down in the left hand corner, naked and cowerig while being sprayed with pepper spray.http://imgur.com/I8eeq

After I was fired, I sued the Sheriff's Office and the Board of County Commissioners and I settled the night before trial. I consider every penny that I got blood money, but I did get a letter of recommendation hand signed by ther sheriff himself, and I FLAT OUT REFUSED to sign a non-disclosure agreement. One of my biggest regrets in life is not taking that case to trial, but I just emotionally couldn't do it. I also regret not going to the press immediately with what I had as it happened. I want someone to finally listen about what goes on in that jail. Instead of going to the press, I decided to speak with attorneys and help inmates who were beaten and murdered by detention officers in the jail. 

In the last 5 years I have been deposed twice and I have been flown across the planet 3 times to be deposed or to testify in cases against the Sheriff. I have also been consulted by 4 or 5 other attorneys with cases against the Sherfiff. Every single time my name has been brought up (with 1 exception) the case has settled within a few months at the most. The record is 2 weeks. Some of those have gag orders on them or are sealed, so I can't discuss the ones that are under an order like that, but not all of them are like that.

Let's talk about the two most recent cases I have been involved in: 

Christopher Beckman was an inmate. He was brought in on a DUI or something like that, he wasn't a career criminal, he was a guy like you, or your buddy, or your dad who fucked up and did something stupid while drunk. He had a seizure in the jail because he was epileptic and didn't get his medications. During this seizure he was hog tied, and ran HEAD FIRST into a 2"" thick steel door, concrete walls and elevator doors. His skull was crushed and he died a few days later. I was deposed in his case and very soon afterward the family settled for an ""undisclosed"" amount of money other than the 1mil, and I promise you this..... they didn't get enough. The officers that did that to them? One of them pled out for a year in jail, the other got nothing. http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=14&amp;articleid=20110606_12_0_OLHMIY608751

Dionne McKinney: She is the toughest woman on this planet. She fought for 9 and 1/2 years to take the sheriff to trial and she did it. NO ONE takes the Sheriff to trial in OK county and wins. It hasn't happened in a civil case since the 1970's (from what I understand) She was brutally beaten in the Jail in May of 2003. I testified in this case earlier this month.http://newsok.com/jury-finds-in-favor-of-woman-who-says-oklahoma-county-jail-detention-officers-assaulted-her-nearly-10-years-ago/article/3738355

Why do I live so far away? I fear for my life. I left oklahoma in march of 2010 after I turned over every piece of evidence that I had to the feds. When I have been flown in, I have been in and out in 2 days for depositions, but for the trial, I had to be there for almost a week. I spent 4 days barricaded in my best friends' house. When I left my family in OK after testifying a few weeks ago, I knew that I'd never be able to see them in Oklahoma again and flights to me are not cheap. 
Here is an absolutely scathing report from the department of justice about the Oklahoma County Jail in 2008.
http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/OKCounty_Jail_findlet_073108.pdf


TL:DR I worked in a jail where I saw human beings being treated like dogs every day, I tried to stop it, but was fired for it and have spent the last few years being deposed and testifying about the atrocities that I witnessed.

*EDIT*: I had no idea this would get any attention, holy crap. I've been here answering your many wonderful questions for the better part of the last 11 hours and I really must get some sleep. I will answer any new questions when I get up in a few hours! Thank you so much!

*EDIT 2*: I feel that I should address this here: this is a PRE-TRIAL facility. These are not hardened criminals who have already been charged and convicted. These are people who are JUST coming into jail, still in their street clothes. Just pointing that out.

**To those of you who have been saying that what happened was a long time ago, and it couldn't possibly be happening there now** I know that what I witnessed happened back in 2001-04. I can't say for sure that things are basically the same way it has always been, but the news articles tend to agree with my opinion, which was based on what I witnessed from 2001-2004 ...

We are too. We'd like to share with you everything we know and answer any questions about how we work with celebrities etc for AMAs. In regards to the Morgan Freeman AMA and celeb AMAs in general:  

* This was set up by the publicity team from the film studio for Oblivion. I interacted with them over the past few weeks to set this up. This is not uncommon for celebrity AMAs. Though it is not uncommon for an assistant or someone else to read the questions and type answers for a celebrity, we would never encourage or facilitate an AMA if we thought that someone was pretending to be someone. That system has worked pretty darn well.  

* We were told Morgan Freeman would be answering the questions for the AMA himself (with someone in the room typing what he said) and we believe this to be the case. If we find out otherwise we will let the community know and this would be a HUGE violation of our trust as well as yours. It's hard to imagine that a pr professional would go to such lengths to pretend to be their client in a public forum, but it's not impossible.  

* Most but not all of the bigger celebrity AMAs start with a publicist or assistant contacting us to get instructions, tips, etc. We send them a brief overview, the link to the step-by-step guide in the wiki, and sometimes examples of good AMAs by other celebrities. We also often walk through the process on the phone with the publicist/assistant, or sometimes even the celebrity themselves.  

* We do not get paid by anyone for AMAs.  

* We very often get approached by celebrities who only want to spend 20 or 30 min on an AMA or do nothing but talk about their project. We try to educate them on why an hour is the absolute minimum time commitment, and heavily discourage them from doing anything if they can not commit that much time.  

* On occasion we have ""verified"" to the mods that a user is who they claim to be. We usually do this just to let the mods know in advance what the username will be so they can prevent fakes. This is not usually an issue since we advise everyone to tweet or post a picture as proof. We won't do this anymore in the future and there should be public proof at the start of an AMA.  

* The mods here do an amazing job, and this incident was our fault, not theirs.
  
We will try to answer all the questions we can, but don't have much more information about the Morgan Freeman AMA, and are waiting to hear back from his publicity team.

Hi everyone!

First, here is a short photo album of my journey: [Across Africa in a Year and a Half (2012-2013)](http://imgur.com/a/TiQ48)

On December 28th of 2011, I set out on a one-way flight to Cape Town, South Africa, not knowing what I was doing or when I'd return home.  I ended up spent the next year and a half traveling the entire length of the continent, all the way to Alexandria, Egypt and finally returning home to Seattle on July 3rd, of 2013.  

Here is a very rough outline of the journey: I started in South Africa, planning to drive to Cairo with two South African guys. We made it through Mozambique, Malawi and into Tanzania, staying at backpackers and doing a bit of scuba diving before that trip fell apart due to not getting along. I flew back to Cape Town alone, went to AfrikaBurn, spent a month+ on a farm, then on the coast. From there I crossed into Botswana, where I spent a month with a British guy I met through Couchsurfing, then rode a single speed bike 1,500km across the country. In the Okavango delta I met a German guy who drove down Africa in a 74 VW, and we spent the next two months together, a month of that at an orphanage in Southern Zambia. We split up, I rode my bike another 900km through Zambia then tried to paddle the worlds longest lake alone in a traditional wooden boat. It did not go well, but was an amazing experience. I took a 100 year old ex-German warship the rest of the way up the lake, then rode buses and Couchsurfed my way through Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and into Kenya. Unable to get a visa for overland entrance into Ethiopia, I flew from Nairobi, and spent an interesting but somewhat difficult month in Ethiopia. I was also unable to get a visa into Sudan and had to fly over it, one of the biggest disappointments of the trip. I arrived in Egypt, traveled the country by train and bus from one end to the other, leaving just two weeks before they threw out their president.

**Some highlights:** Simply saying 'yes' to the journey in the first place, scuba diving in Zanzibar, doing a safari in the Serengeti, going to AfrikaBurn, cycling across Botswana, paddling Lake Tanganyika, hiking in the Simian Mountains of Ethiopia and finally reaching Egypt, accomplishing my goal of crossing Africa and most importantly the people I met on the way.

**Some lowlights:** The initial 4x4 across Africa trip failing, having most of my possessions stolen in Zambia, laying semi-conscious and shitting blood for 3 days in Tanzania, and saying goodbye to a place I love.

**Death:**  I've been in villages when there have been children killed by lions and crocs, where thieves were stoned to death by a group of students, where a man was stabbed to death in a goat raid, heard stories of cerebral malaria killing in only three days, a shooting rampage in Ethiopia and saw the aftermath of a minibus crash that killed all 13 on board.  Life is cheap.  

**I never thought I would:** Travel up Africa in the first place, sit on a crocodile, go three weeks without seeing another white person, eat elephant meat, do the dressing on a fresh male circumcision, cycle the Trans-Kalahari, and be an honored guest of local headmen.

**Internationalism:**  I would find myself at parties with as many as 10 different nationalities.  Mostly through Couchsurfing, I stayed with people from South Africa, England, America, France, Spain, Russia, Sudan, India, Ethiopia, Egypt, Uganda, Tanzania, Italy, Slovakia, Germany, Botswana, Kenya and more.  

**Transportation:** I used just about every method possible.  Driving in a 4x4, taking buses, hitch hiking, riding trains, bicycles, canoes, motor boats, donkey carts, airplanes, sailboats, motorcycles, walking and more.

**Accomidations:**  Everything from mud and grass huts to 4-star condos.  I found myself sleeping in logging camps, I've slept on bags of fish while on a boat, countless random couches, laying in the sand of the Kalahari, the homes of cattle ranchers and the homes of many, many Peace Corps volunteers.  

**Overall:**  Africa is amazingly safe, expect for when it's not! Most people love America (although don't understand it at all).  My experience with Africans was overwhelmingly positive, the hospitality was simply incredible.  Africa is undergoing some extremely rapid change, and those growing pains will have major consequences and last well into the future.

I got to know the place pretty well because I spent at least 4 hrs there everyday from 1984 to 1991. So ask away!

Note: I will be back in a few hours to start answering questions, got shit to do today.
 
Edits:

(1) I know a lot of you want proof. I can think of two things that may prove it, my school photo from Bishop Ford's memorial school and Angel's Kindergarten which are both next to KWC and I think both still exit. I will see if i can find them and send it to the Mod when i get home.

(2) Many of you asked for pictures inside. Even though everyone has a camera now, back in the 80s it was not that common and even if our family had one, it made no sense to waste the film inside KWC from the people who lives there perspective.

(3) Bishop Ford's memorial School is on top of a hill next to KWC and it's next to a cementery. Even most Hong Kong people don't know this fact unless you are a Kowloon or Lok Fu local!!! People from Lok Fu can back me up on this. I guess this is like a semi-proof that at least I am local to that area.

(4) I need to go now but will be back and answer a few more and hopefully find my photos and send to the mod as proof. Thanks for the interest in this AMA!

Edit 2:

(1) I just sent some strong circumstantial proof to the mod because as I said I don't have direct proof. 

(2) My answers are vague? Yea true, but I am recalling things that happened 20 or more years ago and I was about 8-10 years old at that time, how can I comment on the nuances of the socio-political situations there from the memories of a child?

(3) I am not familiar with every single place in KWC?  This is true, now just look at the photos and tell me, would you let your 8-10 years to roam the dirty alleys inside KWC?? I mostly travelled back and forth from my relative's place and school and when my bro, cousins and me went out and played, we played OUTSIDE the fortress. Kids don't play hide and seek inside KWC. 

Edit 3:

(1) The mod hasn't got back to me about the proof I sent, probably because it's thanksgiving.

(2) Lack of photos inside? I am repeating myself here, it was in the 80s, I didn't have an iphone back then, I could't just take random snap shots of the place. Do you notice that all the photos of KWC are from journalists or professional photographers and not from residents who took photos of themselves inside? It never came to mind back then that I should take a photo of myself in the dark alley under the leaking pipes with all the shits and trash on the ground.

(3) I will probably pop back in tomorrow to answer a few more questions.

Edit 4:

(1) [Here is the google map of Bishop Memorial School](http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Bishop+Ford+Memorial+School,+Kowloon+,+Hong+kong&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=38897761&amp;biw=1191&amp;bih=624&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), you can see the Kowloon Walled city park just next to it.

(2) I will probably look at this thread again for the last time tonite and answer a few more questions and maybe do a summary.

Final Thoughts:

Well I think I will leave this AmA now. By some requests, [here](http://i.imgur.com/hfARp.jpg) is the photo of KWC where I indicate (red arrow) approximately the building I spent most of my time in, it is only approximate since there was no way I could know what the building looked like from the outside and I locate it by approximating the way I took to get there. The yellow arrow indicate the Kindergarten I went to and the blue arrow points to the location of the Bishop Ford Memorial school. Where did most of the residents go? The buildings pointed by the purple arrow and many more behind them not shown in this photo were the destinations  of many of the residents.

There is some misconception about KWC, by the mid-80s, it was no longer as dangerous as it once was. There were probably still many drug problems/prostitution/gangs and triads, but they have all gone underground. On the surface, at least from what I remember, it was a very busy place where people carried on with their lives just like any other places. 

Many people asked about fire hazard, I had seen a few fires broke out throughout the years, but they were always isolated to a few apartments. There was never a really big scale fire that I remember, probably due to the all concrete buildings and high humidities within the fortress, but honestly I don't know why it never happened (thankfully).",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1353721780.0,other,,True,t3_13muo9,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13muo9/i_grew_up_in_the_cyberpunkesque_dystopia_called/,

Edit: What a blast! I've been a reader of Reddit for only a few months. Today I signed up for an account to give this a try- I thought it'd make for a nice warm-up session before I did my day's work. Well, I should've known better. I drew for about 5 hours and got tons of requests. I wish I could've drawn everyone's but hey, maybe I'll just have to do this again sometime. I just finished drawing a request for a little girl's birthday this weekend and I think that's a good note to go out on. Thanks Reddit- you guys rock.

I didn't think this was considered unusual or negative, but mentioning it elsewhere on Reddit has shown me there is a lot of misinformation and hostility toward it.  So, I invite you to AMA.",MechanicalPencils,7538,5383,4120,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/,"I am a former public school teacher and I now homeschool my daughter (13, 8th grade) and my son (5, kindergarten). This is our third year. 

I homeschool because I want my kids to have an experience-based education. We use textbooks for things like math, science, and history. Both of my kids are avid readers, writers, and artists. I teach writing using my own curriculum to my own children as well various groups of kids for pay (which is how I fund our travel). I send them out for music, art, and PE classes, as well as science lab classes. But the basis of their education is in experience, and we spend a lot of time outside, in museums, speaking with experts, and exploring places away from home. This year, we've been all over, including places within our our state, as well as across the country and overseas. I'll link to two of my Facebook albums, if that's allowed, to show you some of what we've seen and done...the first one is from our Oregon trip, where we spent a month, including a week on the road studying geology, and the second is from our Virgin Islands trip, where we lived in an eco-camp that runs on renewable resources and where we worked with scientists and studied the coral reef. My daughter is still participating in an ongoing public outreach project to educate people on the reefs and their importance.

EDIT:  Removed albums because of morons.  

I think that's enough fodder to open with. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer! I think there are a lot of myths out there about homeschooling, especially about socialization, and I would love to dispel some of them. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that we do not homeschool for religious reasons. I am an atheist, my husband is a Muslim (pretty much only culturally, though I think he does believe in God), and my kids are free to decide for themselves.

EDIT again: This is exploding, and I don't think I can possibly get to all your questions! I'll write a little more on the most popular areas, so that maybe some questions will be answered up-front.

Socialization:
My kids do something with other children every single day. The have art class, gym class, music class, books clubs, literature circles, various co-ops, and one-off special event type things regularly. Parents organize gatherings of kids similar in age on a regular basis. We belong to a community of homeschoolers that is made up of over 150 families in our area. Three hundred children in these families participate in various activities offered by the group. All kinds of kids, all different ages, with all sorts of personalities and abilities/disabilities. There are some they love, and some they don't like, and they deal with it all effectively.

Sheltering:
Both of my children are away from me quite often. I do not shelter or smother them. They learn from other people, and they have their own interests that I'm not necessarily a part of. Hell, I hardly ever see my daughter on the weekends. I'm sure she'll have plenty of opportunity to get into the usual trouble and make her way out of it...hopefully not at 13, but I have no illusions about what's coming up in the next few years. 

Money:
The way we homeschool is kind of expensive, with all of the travel and whatnot. The money I earn working at my part-time tutoring business goes directly toward their educations. We are not wealthy, but we find ways to do what we want to do. It does not have to be expensive though, so to those of you who stated you are considering homeschooling, please don't factor that into your decision. 

Religious vs. non-religious homeschoolers:
We are secular, as I stated above. I know no homeschooler personally who is a fundamental religious homeschooler, though I know they do exist, and did exist in much greater numbers in the past. The demographics of homeschooling are changing drastically, and I think it's important for us all to note. I believe that keeping your child at home to seclude them and indoctrinate them into anything is flat-out abuse. I hate that what I do is mixed up with this other kind of homeschooling, and that's why I decided to do this AMA...to give another viewpoint. 

I'll be answering more questions later, but my fingers need a break right now. Thanks for all of your responses!

Most of the country has now been handed over to the Afghan security forces, which is supposed to be progress. Some officials even claim it is victory. I was with those security forces last November and December, and the chaos and corruption I saw was deeply shocking.

I am currently sitting here with my mom who is willing to answer any questions related to her life in Cambodia, her experience through the regime and war (where over 1.3 million Cambodians died), and her arrival in Canada in '83.

She was around 11 when they chased everyone from the city and made them march on foot to labour camps. There is so much of her experience I haven't heard yet, so this will also be somewhat of a new thing for me.

[This is her and my dad when they first met at a refugee camp in Thailand.](http://i.imgur.com/q5MHC.jpg)

-------------------------

One of the reasons why I decided to start this AMA is to raise funds for a personal cause.

My mom lost her parents during the time they made everyone work on the farm in villages. When the regime fell, one of her uncles went from villages to villages in search of my mother and surviving children of the family. He then took them all in and raised them as his own, not only because he had unconditional love for them, but also in memory of his brother (my grandfather) who had always supported him to make sure he had a good life while they were growing up.

She left Cambodia in 1983 and never had the chance to return. My parents and I grew up in a low income household before I started workig.

We recently got news this month that he was diagnosed with lung cancer and is already at the terminal phase, leaving him with less than 3 months to live.

What I'm trying to do is basically raise enough money so my mom can go to Cambodia (she doesn't know this yet!) to meet her uncle, whom she actually calls her adoptive father, before it's too late. One of my regrets in life was not being able to help my dad go to Cambodia when his parents passed away when I first started working. It was devastating to him and extremely heartbreaking to me.

TL;DR: My mom's uncle raised her when she lost her parents. She hasn't seen him in over 28 years and now he has 3 months to live. So I'm trying to raise money by doing this AMA. She's not aware of it, it's a surprise!

3:12 AM EST Update

Uhhh, so it started off reeeeaaaaally slow, but boy did that escalate quickly! I was supposed to be in bed since 11PM.

On that note, I need to go to sleep for real. I will try my best to answer the questions I may have forgotten and promised to deliver later this evening.

* Ramiro Corbetta (ramiroc) who made [Hokra](http://www.ramirocorbetta.com), which won the audience prize at Indiecade this year.

* Noah Sasso (nnooaahh), creator of [Barabariball](http://www.barabariball.com), that just won the prize for Creative Design at the Hoplay festival.

/actually, *I've* not done any of those things, but my grandpa, who's in the room over and who has agreed to do an AMA, has. Yesterday I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/estwo/from_foodstamps_to_porn_cinemas_foreign_redditors/c1asero) in the [Foreign Redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/estwo/from_foodstamps_to_porn_cinemas_foreign_redditors/) thread and had a request for him to do an AMA. I figured hey, this could be interesting, so here I/we am/are. This'll go pretty slowly, as I'll be printing out questions and then chatting with him for a bit and then returning to type them here, and in any case will have to translate to and from Russian (as he's far from fluent in English), so I'll really only be doing 5-10 questions at a time. I'll try to get to as many as I can, though, so long as he stays interested. Keep in mind that some things may be lost due to my imperfect translation, but I'll be as faithful as I can.

A gold star would be nice for this, but all the corroborating documents are out of reach and in Russian, so that might prove difficult. I have a few news articles in the house somewhere that mention him; I'll try to scan them in. Here are a few [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nu7wO) of him I put up yesterday (B&amp;W are old, color ones are from the previous month).

Oh, and also, no debates/insults please. I'll refuse to translate those. And if anything in here seems particularly aggrandizing, it's my fault, as I respect, admire, and love the man greatly.

So, without further ado, begin!/

/edit2: Okay, I've done about a dozen questions so far and need to do some yard work right now, but I'll be back to do more (the ""best"" first and then the bottom page ones after) in a bit. He's enjoying it so far, but each question takes me a good 10-15 minutes to get through because he's very fond of telling lengthy stories on not too pertinent asides/

/edit: I'm answering a few questions I personally know the answers to and will resume when we finish with our runs with the dogs. I also gave some soft evidence in favor of this thread's legitimacy here.

/edit: ok, we just got back, I'll do the top 8-12 questions right now but then he has to go to bed. He falls asleep at 20:00ish and wakes up at 4:30 for exercise and assorted housework. After these I'll only be continuing sometime tomorrow.

/edit: Ok, done for tonight, he's long asleep now. Oh, and while taking pictures from his book to help answer the question pertaining to the mission to mars, I snapped a shot of a picture of him standing in a group picture with a bunch of other important people (I think some guys from nasa are in there too). He's the guy above his finger in the big white suit. :] http://i.imgur.com/jRioO.jpg

Oh, and we haven't answered too many questions so far, but some of the ones we have are buried because of higher voted comments getting in there first. Please keep that in mind./

IAmA 53 year-old quadriplegic woman who enrolled in a study at the University of Pittsburgh medical Center (UPMC) last fall. In February, I had brain surgery to insert two sensors into the motor cortex area of my brain. One week later, I was moving a robotic arm with my thoughts. 

Since then, the research team and I have been putting Hector (the name I gave the robotic arm) through his paces. I have learned how to move him to pick up and move objects, to interact with the environment, to shake hands, to play rock paper scissors, and ultimately, to feed myself. Much has been made over the fact that I fed myself chocolate. I also fed myself string cheese and red pepper. 

This technology will advance rapidly. The possibilities are amazing. Down the road, the cables will not be necessary. Subjects will need smaller implants, and the robotic arm will be smaller and portable. Eventually, amputees will be able to move prosthetic arms with their minds. 

Before my illness, I ran Deadly Affairs, a successful Murder Mystery Party business. Spurred on by my success in the UPMC study, I finally finished editing and self-published my first book, [Sharp as a Cucumber](http://www.amazon.com/Cucumber-Brenda-LaVoom-Mystery-ebook/dp/B008OAVZQG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top), on Amazon Kindle last July. My book is based the script of one of my most popular murder mysteries. 

I am lucky to be part of this study. I am so excited to go to the lab and try new things and achieve new goals. Being part of this project has given me a new sense of purpose and awakened me to the fact that I am more than the body I live in. I am so happy that seeing this video and the story tonight on 60 Minutes will give hope to a lot of handicapped people. It won't happen tomorrow, but hang in there! It will happen. 

I am happy to answer questions. As I cannot type, my daughter will be helping me throughout the AMA. I will be answering questions until around 6pm EST, when I will leave and go watch my 60 Minutes premiere!

1366554813.0,2095,self.IAmA,1cstrm,I did research on facial attractiveness for years at a major university and published in the field. AMA,norcross1,10116,8021,3978,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cstrm/i_did_research_on_facial_attractiveness_for_years/,"Update 7 PM GMT on April 23:  Thanks for all of the interest &amp; the questions (and the Gold). The conversation really went in a lot of directions &amp; it was interesting to see it unfold.

I did most of this AMA in 20 hrs straight (like a lunatic) - so my wording was not always the best &amp; there might be some unclear statements.  I've tried to make some edits to clear things up more.  In general, this topic is more complex than it might seem on the surface.  We have many different kinds of preferences and even 100 studies measuring those preferences just scratches the surface.  Also, there are rarely black &amp; white answers in this field, though we can usually spot trends. Even since the AMA, I've argued about some of the questions with people I know who have done similar research.  Plastic surgeons have huge disagreements over techniques and what is aesthetically pleasing too.  So, all of this has to be taken in that context.  There are no absolutes in this area because of subjectivity - though we can understand a great deal about the topic based on things that are repeatable in research studies (and thus, more likely to be objective).

TL;dr:  Facial attractiveness has a lot of components like symmetry, sexual dimorphism, skin quality, facial ratios, ""averageness"" (how much your features represent the average in the population - like the average length nose), and a viewer's personal preference (which can make up a large % of the equation).  So, it's complicated &amp; sometimes contradictory, as research often can be.  There are still a lot more questions than answers in the field.  At least we know some of the major components - and this info is based on empirical research in psychology, literature from plastic surgeons, and a little bit of literature from art.

**Introduction**

My new boyfriend has been insisting for months that I do a IAMA but I always refused because I feel that this is simply too personal. He told me that it was important I share because it could be an inspiration to others and in the end, he won. 

If you want to read it, be patient, because it’s a long one. A summary wouldn’t allow me to truly show what I went through so I decided to spell it out.

**My childhood**

I was an accident. Both my parent made that pretty clear in my mind, for almost all of my childhood and teenage years. My father was 53 when I was born and my mother 38. They had been unhappily married for 20 years and one night, my father forced himself on my mother years after she had stopped taking the pill and 9 months later, I arrived.

I grew up miserable. My father was an alcoholic. He worked as a carpenter and worked long hours outside of the house. As soon as he came home, he would start drinking and later in the evening, beat my mother for an offense or another he thinks she did to him. 

My mother on the other hand is I guess a co-alcoholic and somehow thinks that our life was normal, that every husband in the world is like my father and every wife is like her. You know women who try to pretend that their husband loves them even if he beats her? My mom’s rationalization isn’t that he still loved her but rather than love simply doesn’t exist. She was always a stay at home mom and if she left, not only would should she be alone in life but she would have no money. Needless to say, neither have any real education.

Both pretty much ignored me all my life. If my mother was hungry, she would prepare a meal for lunch when I came back from school, otherwise, I learned to fix myself a sandwich quite early. Only supper was guaranteed to be on the table because my father ate with us.

I couldn’t receive any friends, because of my father and I couldn’t visit any friends, because of their father who were just as bad as mine in my mother’s mind.

So I grew up limited only to meeting kids in school which sucks because real friends see each other outside of school.

I sucked in pretty much every subject. Not getting any help on homework and my inability to sleep until late at night because of my parent’s arguing didn't help. 

But the worse was that nothing rang a bell in my mind. It was all normal. It was life. Movies and TV showed fiction including when it involved happy families.

I began lying to friends about my family but I couldn’t realize that they were actually telling the truth. I couldn’t conceive of parents who actually loved their kids. That was on TV, with monsters and fairy tales.

**Teenager years**

Around 11 or 12, I began drinking. My father left bottles everywhere and I would take a few sips to help me calm down during the fights. I spent my evenings locked up in my room and drinking so I would try to ignore what was going on outside of my room. Like I said, I was mostly ignored. I was like a dog you had to feed. You could fight in front of it, because it couldn’t understand you.

At 12 however, you aren’t a little girl anymore. Guys started to notice me. I was usually wearing awkward clothes and no one bothered to buy me a well-fitting bra. 

I was desperate for attention and certain boys quickly discovered it. I lost my virginity at 13 to a guy who was a year or two older. 

**Drugs**

Soon, I was offered light drugs like marijuana, acid blotters and ecstasy. I didn’t need more to get in the sack with a guy so I guess that’s why I never tried cocaine or anything stronger.

Drugs helped me avoid my problems and allowed me to fly through the days either without feeling anything at all or by letting me feel things that had nothing to do with my daily life.

But more importantly, I don’t think I ever took any drugs alone. I would take them with boys who offered it to me in exchange for sex and they all thought that it was the drug I was after when I think I wanted some love and affection. The drugs were just a nice bonus.

Most of the time however, I felt depressed and a few time took a lot of pills to apparently kill myself, but in reality, I think I mostly wanted to know if people would miss me when I was gone. I don’t really want to talk about that, not even with my boyfriend in private.

**Death of my father**

When I turned 16, my dad died of rectal cancer gone general. He didn’t even realize he was sick until a few months before his death. I had known he had problems on the toilet for years but we never thought it was something that awful.

He refused all treatments and chose to simply die at our home, peacefully. In reality, he simply screamed orders at my mother all day long since he rarely left his bed. He had a colostomy and it disgusted him profoundly until he died.

For a little while, I thought it would be better with my mother now that he was gone but obviously, her problems weren’t caused entirely by him. She mourned for him for years like a normal widow, but in an excessive manner. She stopped making meals altogether but continued buying the same groceries as when we were three in the house, letting a lot of the food spoil.

**BDSM**

That’s roughly when I started dating a guy who was into BDSM. Sorry it took so long to get there.

He was one of the guys who used to give me drugs but he liked to have it a little rougher. We started visiting a local BDSM dungeon where he would tie me up and whip me or spank me.

In the beginning, I thought it was weird, but it was something to do and he really seemed to like me. Plus, I was stoned most of the time and barely felt anything.

I wouldn’t say I was his girlfriend or anything serious like that. He was just a guy I frequently saw.

**Alone in the dungeon**

But one day, the dungeon master became furious when he saw weeds and pills in my partner’s bags and expulsed and banned him, leaving me alone in the club.

I should have followed him, but I guess I was already too stoned to do so. I met a few people. I can’t say I had ever presented myself before and felt accepted by them. A few weeks later, I began returning alone, if only to feel welcomed somewhere.

I had dropped out of high school by then and didn’t know anything about anything. I couldn’t do the laundry, I couldn’t really cook, I couldn’t talk politely enough to work anywhere. I simply was a reject of society, a complete wreck.

Of course, back then, I couldn’t realize any of that. I couldn’t see that soon enough I would most likely be left alone on the streets by my mother to become either a prostitute or yet another homeless girl begging for change.

**Enter Frank**

But I met Frank (fake name). Frank was one of the masters visiting the dungeon. He was single but he wanted a full time slave girl to live with him. He gave classes on bondage and safety in BDSM and helped a lot of people, but he didn’t want a girl to play from time to time. He wanted a full time slave to keep in his loft in a committed relationship.

I think he had noticed me the first time I went to the dungeon with my ex, but perhaps he looked at all girls as possible future slaves.
All I know was that he paid a lot of attention to me when I was there alone. He did a lot of bondage demonstrations using me as a model and even practiced his suspensions on me which I kind of liked.

I had stopped seeing my ex since he had gotten banned and I was now cut off from my supply of both drugs and sex to get my mind off of my solitude.

**Accepting the proposition**

So I began to open to him and one day, after he proposed for the 40th time or so to have me as a slave full time, I simply said yes.

I didn’t know what I was getting into, but I didn’t care. I had nothing in front of me and my mother hadn’t spoken to me in weeks.

I left with him to reach his loft. It’s in an old industrial building. It’s a unit in the middle, without windows or interior walls. It only has a small kitchenette in one of the corners and a small industrial bathroom: there was a man’s restroom with a urinal and a booth for a toilet, but the toilet in the woman’s section had been replaced by a shower.

The rest of the loft was occupied mostly by home-made bondage equipment, apart for a king size bed.

He told me that he wanted a house slave. That I could leave anytime I wanted by saying my safe-word but that until then, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave his loft unless I needed to see a doctor. We went over my limits but I am not sure I was really sure of what I was getting into. I mostly checked no on his list on a few things I was scared off, stuff like branding and needles or tattoos. He did have to explain a few of them to me.
I guess today that my motivation was mostly to live somewhere with someone who would care for me and Frank was the closest I could find. We talked a lot and the next day we went to my house so I could pick up my things and say goodbye to my mother who was obviously unconcerned that I was moving away.

It’s only when we came back to his loft that I began my 16 month journey…

**My beginning as a slave**

Frank carefully helped me pack my few things in boxes for storage and in all seriousness, asked me to strip naked.

At first, I felt ashamed, but a few soothing words from Frank helped me calm down. He boxed my clothes too and I ended up not wearing anything until the day I decided it was enough, 16 months later.

Well, I did wear panties during my periods, but otherwise, I was fully naked around the clock, for more than a year.

Frank works in a factory on shifts. He sometimes works the night shift, sometimes works the day shift, etc…

One of the first things he did was get rid of all calendars and clocks in the house, keeping only his watch and his cellphone for any time references. He didn’t have a computer or a TV or even a radio so even if I wanted to know the time or the date when he was away at work, it was impossible. He didn’t even have a phone at home, using only his cellphone for communications.

At first, our relationship was like most other couples in that we engaged in conversation, had lots of sex with the added kinkiness of me being suspended or tied or even whipped from time to time.

Quickly, as time went by however, it was expected that I would behave more and more like a slave and with less and less freedom of will. He was slowly helping me let go of my resistance to obedience, as he said it.

**Getting used to it**

Gradually, I began to enjoy it. When he was there, he would train me in doing whatever he wanted me to do, including cooking, cleaning the loft or servicing him sexually. When he wasn’t there, I was left instructions on what to do, like meditation or even just stretching exercises.
Rapidly, I lost track of time and Frank insisted that this was his goal. He wanted me to fully rely on him for all information.
I realized that sometimes, a Wednesday would follow a Thursday, but I was expected to just accept it and soon enough, I stopped asking or caring about which day we were.

Today, I realize he was almost brainwashing me, but like my mother, I didn’t see any alternatives. I was warm, I was secure, I was loved and unlike her, the few times I was hit I actually welcomed and enjoyed it as it was usually followed by some of the best sex I ever had.

Several times, he invited friends over and no, I was not allowed to dress back up. Most of the people were friends I knew from the dungeon, but I was usually expected to play a certain role, like remain silent for the evening and simply serve food for everything or even just remain on all four and serve as a human footrest for the whole evening.

Only twice did someone else had sex with me, thought in one of the cases, I have no idea if it was really someone else.

**Long term roles**

You see, some of the things he did were long term rules or roles. I once did pet play for a full month (well roughly three weeks), from the end of my periods to the beginning of the next one. I played the role of the puppy night and day.

But the worst part for me to endure were the 3 weeks or so I spent blindfolded. Not once in those 3 weeks was I allowed to see anything, but I was expected to continue to follow my routine.

At first, I hit everything and I did think to cheat while he was at work, but I remained faithful and spent the whole period blindfolded. During that time, Frank received friends over and I had sex with someone but I am not sure if it wasn’t Frank himself. It sure felt familiar.
The other time was for a threesome.

Eventually, he kept pushing more and more. His little stint with the blindfold was notable one of the tipping points. For days after the removal, I was hypersensitive to light and the Chilean miner crisis recently showed me there was a real danger to his fetish. 

**Getting out**

One day, he decided to tie me to his cross like he often did and I just said my safe-word. I had enough. I had been forbidden to talk for the previous few months and I no longer felt good about myself like in the beginning. I had forgotten who I was, what I wanted and simply couldn’t take it 
anymore.

He confirmed that was what I wanted and brought me some of my clothes to put on my pale carcass. Without any sunlight in 16 months, my skin had never been so white, and I had lost quite a lot of weight under his care.
He didn’t drop me on the street like I was afraid he would do or like my mom told me men acted when you said no to them. He asked me the date I thought we were and I was off by a good 3 months, under evaluating my stay. I had just missed my second birthday while in his presence and I was now 20 years old.

I had left the dungeon that night on a hot summer day and when I came out, snow was everywhere.
We found my mother but I discovered she didn’t even care where I had been or that we hadn’t spoken for that long. The three of us ate supper without even speaking a word.

I stayed with Frank for another 5 months but I wasn’t his slave anymore. We did continue to have sex and even do a little BDSM play but we were back to the talking phase we had in the beginning. We spoke a lot about what I had gone through and I shared all my thoughts and emotions. He apologized for the last part where he asked me to stay silent for so long.

He mostly wanted to be sure he didn’t somehow break me or traumatize me.

He tried to convince me to try it again, but it was behind me now. I had others things to do even if I had no idea what.

**Finding a job and moving out**

Two months after I said my safe-word, I found a job in a burger joint, not a big chain but a mom and pop store where I was a waitress serving greasy burgers.

Three months later, Frank and I agreed it would be better if I moved so he helped me find a small apartment and even paid for the first few months to help me get on track, allowing me to find used furniture and even all of the appliances.
We stayed in touch for a while, but he was busy finding my replacement. When he did, he stopped calling me as he was now busy with his new slave. I had met her. She wanted to confirm that Frank wasn’t a psycho and I reassured her that I was fine. Frank promised he wouldn’t do the same mistakes he did with me.

**Now**

I eventually made a new boyfriend, a regular customer at my restaurant, and now I am the receptionist for the office he works for.
Somehow, what happened in those 16 months almost helped me reboot my life. I don’t think it was because of the BDSM itself, but perhaps it was simply because someone had loved me and taken care of me almost like a child for the first time in my life.

**Conclusion**

What scares me today from time to time is that if he hadn’t begun to impose long term rules like the no speaking part, I might still be there, without the attention of a dentist and slowly losing sense of who I was.

But I grew out of that and slowly defined who I was and what I wanted and didn’t want and even learned today to say no to my boyfriend, something my mother was never able to do.

**Summary**

If you didn't want to read, here is a summary:

- I was an accident and my parents ignored me all my life
- desperate for attention, I slept with boys who gave me drugs
- I eventually dated a guy who was into BDSM and when he was kicked out of the dungeon, continued going
- Frank asked me to be a full time slave at this loft and I eventually said yes
- I spent 16 months naked at his loft as a slave, slowly almost being brainwashed
- One day, I said it was enough and moved out

**UPDATE Friday Morning**


I am trying to answer the questions I didn't get. I didn't fight with my boyfriend (but he did get a BJ). Here are some of the most asked questions:

- The safeword was ""MacGyver""
- No, I no longer do BDSM
- I was with Frank from August 2002 to January 2004, so it was 7 years ago
- Since then, I returned to high school and turned my life around
- I didn't take any drugs since the night my ex was banned, so I didn't take any with Frank
- I was 18 when I said yes to Frank. Not 16 like some understood.
- the problem with Dental care is because my current boyfriend is obsessed with his teeth, but I didn't realize it was an unhealthy obsession
- Yes, I will try to write a novel about my experience",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,True,nsfw,,True,t3_f5qjy,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f5qjy/iama_girl_who_spent_roughly_16_months_as_a_full/,

I only came on here to share because I thought it was an interesting thing to happen to someone and I knew reddit would listen and it would help to talk about it. When I made this post, I was still in shock of the whole situation and information was given to us by different sources. I wanted to say I orginally told you guys how much the navy was giving us because thats what I understood it to be and that amount was only going to last two weeks. I will say now that has changed and the navy has given everyone a set amount of money but I won't discuss that here. Also we do have a lawyer but thats to protect us. The media on this thread is ridiculous, don't believe everything that you read please. I will say that my orginal shock of the whole situation is wearing off and reality is starting to sink in. My family and I have a lot we need to do in the next few days, weeks, and months. I will probably do a follow-up post just to let reddit know that we're okay, which I know we will be. I thank you guys for all the support, this I honestly mean that. I also need to say, yes my brother and I have recieved a lot of attention but we're not the only ones who were affected. Please keep everyone in your thoughts.

Hi my name is Devin and I'm 21 years old. I can't even begin to wrap my mind around what has happened. Who thinks they're gonna wake up one morning then have their house destroyed by a jet?? My brother was the one who saved the pilot (Colby Smith)
The amount of support I have gotten has been incredible.
I decided to turn to reddit since I knew it was such a new and weird story.
It's even crazier that no one died.
But I guess I wanted to see how many people have had anything similar....tornado, fire, etc of their house and how did you feel? When did it get better? How was it seeing your house?

PROOF: here's the video of my brother :)

and then a picture of the two of us!

EDIT: I know this should be in AMA but I wasn't thinking straight.

AND ANOTHER EDIT: this is/was my apartment/home http://imgur.com/UtTsu I circled it.

EDIT: People keep saying this is a scam? I'm not asking for money but people kept asking for me to post my pay-pal so I did. My brother was at work, he's with me now, so I took a picture with him haha http://imgur.com/ZMFIt

UPDATE: We have lawyered up, thank you for all your words reddit. I'm just glad I'm here to share this story with you. Talking to you all is helping me stay sane in the moment :)

and just cause i can: here's a video! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE_Qo9FPxME&amp;feature=youtu.be , you guys needed a thank you video. I blocked the comments cause I don't need anymore trolls in my life right now, the navy did enough.

my brother's story: My brothers story is actually really cool and it gave me chills when he told me. He was playing guitar hero in his room then got up to go put his contacts in. He was standing in the bathroom when the jet hit. He said it was a loud thunder noise and huge explosion and the house started shaking and the power cut off. He popped his head out of the doorway and saw his room on fire. He ran down the stairs and out the house without shoes on. Ran to my neighbor's house and then found the pilot right beside that house. That's when the pilot said he was sorry for hitting our home and my brother told him it was alright and they needed to move him to safety. There had to be a reason he got up at that precise moment to put his contacts in, it's freaky to think what would have happened to him if he decided to play one more song....

I'm off to bed, goodnight reddit, thank you for just hearing my story and all your kind words and questions. I am beyond thankful for the people who donated. You really didn't have to and trust me it's appreciated. I'll try and keep you guys updated but my internet access is extremely limited right now.

UPDATE: the fucking hotel we were staying in kicked us out because our navy allowance hadn't come in yet. They charged us $400. i'm getiing the navy allowance today, but I am beyond hurt. I called the mayor and the local news about this but they were completely unhelpful.

I owe this Reddit AMA to my BIL who asked me to do it for his late birthday present.  I did this because I wanted to make sure that other young women know that becoming an Itamae is something they can achieve even if it was a very difficult path.

As the Alamo Drafthouse grows, we remain dedicated to keeping the movie-watching experience safe for movie fans, serving quality food and drinks, and upholding high presentation standards. We are also striving to achieve long term goals by expanding the theater to new neighborhoods. Here are the eight objectives we hope to achieve as we grow:

1. Share the movies we love with as many people as possible.
2. Be a community cultural center.
3. Build an audience for classic, golden era cinema.
4. Build an audience for foreign language films.
5. Build a youth and collegiate cinephile audience.
6. Help local video stores survive as community cultural centers.
7. Help preserve our vulnerable 35mm film history.
8. Help preserve our even more vulnerable VHS film history.

Since we are expanding to several new cities this year, I thought I would bring together a few folks from the Alamo to answer any questions you might have.

AMA.",oneoffaccountok,4518,2464,2402,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13zjjf/iama_painter_decorator_subcontracted_to/,"Actually, I'm not anymore. I lost my job when my daughter was born. Took a week paternity leave and was called at the end of it by my contractor to find that I had been laid off. I was not awarded any redundancy pay because I was sub-contracting. 

I never went back to that profession and am now doing something completely different. 

However, fuck those guys - I have plenty of stories to tell and if you are the tennant of a British council house or flat or even if you are not and just have questions, ask away. I am quite happy to spill every bean I have.

If proof is needed I can scan my CIS card which has my name and face but I will only do this to the mods as I don't really want to be incriminated for bean spilling by my former employers who were, frankly, a bunch of evil bastards.

**EDIT 1:** proof sent to mods.

**EDIT 2:** Just so nobody else need ask: a council house is British cheap housing owned and managed by a local authority (regional government) rented out to tennants who can't afford (or don't want) to rent or buy privately owned property. Council estates refers to large numbers of low rise council owned buildings in one area, used to house entire communities. A council block is a high rise of flats. The best widely familiar example of a high rise council flat I can think of is Del Boy's flat in Only Fools and Horses. 

**EDIT 3:** I should probably point out that council flats/houses does not necessarily equal run down slums, ghettos of drug addled crazies or large swathes of criminal immigrants milking the system for all its worth. All this exists, of course, but there are an equal number of well maintained council properties and the vast majority of council tennants are regular, nice, law abiding citizens. The nature of my job (i.e. repairing void tennancies where damage has been caused or the tennant lived in such a horrible way that he left the property in a vile mess) means I wound up seeing the worst end of the spectrum, not the best. So the stories I have to tell reflect this. Just don't make the mistake of thinking they represent what is the absolute norm.

**EDIT 4:** I'm getting a lot of accusations of being American. I'm not sure why. Some people are saying I use American spelling. All I can guess is I'm using Chrome, which does the spell check thing as I type and if it pulls up an error I change it to the suggestion. All the suggestions appear to be American spellings. I am very British thankyou very much, but used to using a sort of neutral language online so as not to confuse non-Brits who are, frankly, in the minority. Maybe that also has something to do with it. ",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1354222002.0,specialised,,True,t3_13zjjf,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13zjjf/iama_painter_decorator_subcontracted_to/,

I am one of you guys...I browse IAMA for fun and educational profit like many of you do, but one thing that has irked me (and many of you) for a long time are these ""Would you be interested in an AMA from...?"" submissions.

YES! The answer is yes. If you have access to someone you think the community might want to have an AMA from, then the answer is yes before you even ask the question, especially if that person is well-known. So here's the deal, **you don't need to ask for community approval**. It's not necessary, because the answer is yes! 

You say you know the mayor of Detroit? He might want to do an AMA you say? Pick up your phone, call him/her up, and get their ass on here! Reddit will want to ask them questions. I promise.

**EDIT 1: ""A rebuttal""*** 

So to outline the response here, i've got the normal bell curve of people who agree and disagree with whatever it is i'm saying, and I've seen a lot of good discussion back and forth as to the pros and cons. At this point, I want to offer my reasoning here.

* Yes, there is a voting system. Yes, I get that it should be used to downvote posts that people don't like. My argument is that while the voting system works just fine, ""would you be interested in"" posts just don't belong here. It's not an AMA and it's not an AMA request. Ultimately, I'd like to see an IAMA free of AMA requests as well, and the mods here have been working on a solution, but for the purposes of this thread, **""are you interested?"" posts don't fit in here.** It'd be like having a DAE post get on the front page of IAMA. It just doesn't belong.

* I really don't understand the reasoning behind using these posts as a tool to convince someone that it's worth their time. If you're trying to get someone with some fame behind them to do an AMA, and you can't convince them to do it based on your personal relationship with them, then having numbers as a means to persuade them would have questionable effect on their decision i'd argue.

They talk and talk about improving our state test grades, but once the news cameras are gone this is how they really want us to run our classes -make them so easy everyone can pass without doing any work at all. Then they blame the low test scores on ""lazy teachers"" and the Union. It's beyond sick.

Here's the list:


Multiple Choice
-------------------
Consider open book tests using page references 

Limit to one word or short phrases

Provide only one choice per letter (eliminate: A and B &amp; All of the Above)

Eliminate: None of the Above

Offer a maximum of 3 choices

Avoid using negatives in questions (Which of these is not...)



True-False
-------------
Avoid negative or comparative wording (which is NOT, etc.)

Avoid the use of specific determiners (always, never, and no)

Balance the number of true answers to the number of false (Ex: tell the students ""there are 5 true and 5 false"")

If this is impractical, at least tell the student how many of each (5 true, 7 false)

Eliminate the need to rephrase false statements to make them true


Fill-in &amp; Completion
------------------------
one word answers or short phrases only

Provide a word bank and/or page number clues

Give the first letter of the answer

Limit the number of fill-in-the-blank responses to 1 per question (Ex: President [blank] was the 1st President of America, his vice president was [blank]  is not recommended.)


Essays
---------
Weigh the merit of using any essay questions at all

If you must use essay questions:

Allow students to list answers without complete sentences

Provide ""answer starters"" (provide the first sentence or paragraph from a well-written essay)

Consider providing open book or notebook time


There were several other references to ""consider giving open book tests with page references"" that I eliminated as redundant. Geez, I wonder what they want all our tests to be from now on, but can't come right out and say it? I could never guess...


EDIT: Thanks for all the great questions guys - I'm headed to bed. I will try to be back on tomorrow to answer some more. If I did not answer your question that means someone else had already asked an identical question that I had responded to, so try searching the thread.

Also, I will not identify my state or district so stop asking. Thanks!

We will be here answering your questions today beginning at 4:00 Eastern/3:00 Central to celebrate this week’s release of our third original book, [The Onion Book Of Known Knowledge](http://theonion.com/encyclopedia), a definitive encyclopaedia containing all information known to mankind, such as the details behind the [ladycrash of Amelia Earhart’s ladyplane](http://www.theonion.com/topics/amelia-earhart/) or how [CPR is correctly performed](http://www.theonion.com/articles/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation,30095/). Anything, or anyone, that is not referenced in our sacred tome does not exist.

You are welcome to ask us anything, be it about the book, the vast worldwide Filipino conspiracy wherein [Filipinos control the media](http://www.theonion.com/topics/media/), our comprehensive [election coverage](http://www.theonion.com/section/politics/), the [book bjorn](http://www.theonion.com/video/book-bjorn,29956/), or The Onion in general. You are also welcome to compliment us profusely. 

Here in our Chicago office today:

* Editor Will Tracy — Will was also a staff writer on the The Onion's television series Onion News Network. He was raised in Portland, Oregon and later attended Vassar College in upstate New York. His writing has appeared in The Onion since 2006, and he is a former employee of Vanity Fair magazine.

* Head writer Seth Reiss — Seth has written for Boston's The Weekly Dig, McSweeney's, and the former ESPN Classic show Cheap Seats. Seth is also in the sketch comedy group Pangea 3000. He is a graduate of Boston University.

* Sports editor Chad Nackers — Chad joined the Onion staff in 1997-ish. A native of Appleton, Wisconsin and a graduate of some college, Chad has performed numerous award-winning tasks such as editing, writing, and cleaning the grisly remains of undocumented workers from the Onion's printing press.

We will split up your questions and answer as many as we can, though please remember that no number of answers you receive from us today will do anything to stop the ever-looming specter of mortality that’ll never stop casting a heavy shadow over your meaningless existence for as long as you may live.

To verify we are real people, a tweet from [@TheOnion](https://twitter.com/TheOnion/status/261528823659634688)


UPDATE: Thank you for all of your questions. We tabulated them all and here are the results:

*40% of the questions were bad 
*18% of the questions were intellectually dishonest, but good 
*42% of the questions we did not read

Goodnight.

Whose Line was COMPLETELY MADE UP. We had no advanced notice of suggestions.

After 1,000s of hours of improv, I have no favorite, crazy memory of a particular moment of doing improv. (I can barely remember anything from the show until I see it on TV- that's true for all the guys)

My favorite scene from WLIIa is Colin on the Richard Simmons jet ski.

Colin, Ryan, Greg, Colin, Wayne, Drew, and Chip are all truly VERY nice guys.
(All of them are shy in real life) They were all very fun to improvise with.

Ask me anything about my extreme constipation.,nopooshallpass,14106,12091,5042,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jo5at/iama_guy_that_hasnt_pooped_in_the_month_of_august/,"My last bowel movement was July 29th, for the last 10 days I have limited myself to one bowl of cereal a day, b/c the bloating is just too painful. I have gained 11 pounds during this entire ordeal. I've tried everything from coffee enemas to stretching. Nothing has worked. My doctor now has me on 4 different medications and I am about to do 2 different types of Enemas. He swears I shall see something pass today. 

For the first time in a long while I do actually feel something going on in my lower stomach. My doctor warned, with extreme constipation of this sort, I may actually rip my anus from the impacted poop. This has forced me to take muscle relaxers and actually have to apply Vaseline to my anus twice a day.

I will keep you updated, and for you Reddit, if I release this beast, I promise to take pictures. That is if you want me to. My doctor guesses this will weigh close to 6 pounds! So buckle up and pray for my butthole.

This is the first time this has happened to me. I've gone 7 days before, but nothing like this. around day 18-20 I had to lay in bed and not move b/c the feces was causing cramps. I've had night sweats for the last week. It's gone to far, today I dont care if I rip my anus, I'm going to go to the damn bathroom!

Edit: Off to take enema numero uno, I'll be back in 10 minutes! 

Here is a picture of my setup in case I pass out - advice from my doctor**
http://i.imgur.com/X4fAY.jpg 

Off to take enema number 2, I'll be back to 15 mins. I'll also take stomach bloat pic as requested

This prob does look like much, but I'm 6'3 and weigh 175, and have to lean forward to see my toes **

Edit: guys my girlfriend has been reading your comments and thinks we need to go to another doctor, I'm kinda concerned reading your comments regarding anal tearing and his lack of attention to it. Going to go to a 24 hour clinic, I'll report back when I get home. It's cramping again and I can barely stand up. Thanks for your support. Meanwhile you have my girlfriend rather worried about our doctor of 3 years 

Edit: Here's attempt number 1 for trying to get it out after the enema. Warning that this is graphic: http://i.imgur.com/D6S6l.jpg

Edit: Final update for a while guys. I'm posting this from the hospital. There are doctors and nurses wearing what looks like very expendable clothing. The doctor tells me there will be a manual retrieval that should have happened days ago. I know that you guys aren't the praying type but I need some sort of God on my side right now. I'd say that I'm scared shitless and I think that's a pretty accurate statement. Updates as soon as humanly possible. Reddit, I'm *scared* now. 

**12:01 CST Update - Sorry I fell off the face of the earth earlier. I went in to the hospital and had a rather unpleasant experience.  They gave me a drug called 'golytely' and some other mild sedatives that basically allowed my ass to loosen up enough to where a nurse(male) could get his claw mouse grip into my asshole(Manual Disimpaction) and rip out what felt like a sword. In reality, the clog was about twice the size of a golfball. I really did ask if I could take a picture of it, but they just laughed it off and took it away. On a bright note, I asked if that was all that was coming. He laughed and said I was in for a grand finale after my next enema. I am too exhausted to even thinking about taking on that chore tonight. Me and my asshole are currently not on speaking terms. It's sore and feels violated. No lacerations, but very, very sore. Tomorrow is the day Reddit, tomorrow is the day. For your support all day and advice to go to the damn hospital, you shall be rewarded with countless pictures.**

Also, whoever bought me reddit gold, much appreciated! It was the gift I needed in an otherwise bad day.

1:00am - I could stay up all night and chat with you guys, but I'm afraid my drugs are taking hold. I'm off to bed! See ya tomorrow!

Edit: I'm going to have to stop the live stream for a little bit. I'll keep answering questions and get the live stream back up soon. Thanks for all the suggestions.

Edit: The live stream is back up. Knock yourselves out if watching a bearded man hiccup is your sort of thing.

We are the Ask an Astronomer Team at Cornell University. We are a team of graduate students within the Department of Astronomy that volunteers time to answer questions from the public, both online and in various events hosted throughout the city of Ithaca, NY. Our [website](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu) describes what we do and how to contact us.

Whenever a popular article is posted about astronomy on Reddit, we notice that a lot of questions float around typically. A few of us have personally tried to answer questions but we thought it might be a good idea to get involved as a team. Answering questions tonight are five students:

Rebecca Harbison - Planetary science, looking at the particle size distribution in the rings of Saturn using data from [Cassini](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/‎).

The Mike Jones - Using HI surveys [ALFALFA](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/‎) of the local Universe in order to better understand the local galactic environment.

Michael Lam - Pulsar timing with the [NANOGrav](http://www.nanograv.org) collaboration, looking at removing the effects of the interstellar medium on the times-of-arrival of our pulses to help us in the eventual detection of gravitational waves. 

Sean Marshall - Radar and infrared observations and shape modeling of near-Earth asteroids.

Tyler Pauly - Astrochemical modeling of protostellar clouds, looking at the formation of complex molecules in low temperature environments.

So please, ask us anything! And thanks to the advertisements on /r/space and /r/AskScience!

AMAA",elizabethbridges,5007,3012,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19l1cb/iam_elizabeth_bridges_an_83yearold_writer_who/,"Hello everyone,


This is my first time trying to post on a website like this, so please bear with me!


I'm an 83-year-old author with over 30 years of writing experience, although I've only just recently self-published my first novel on Amazon, after having tried for ten years to get this book published through traditional means.


My novel is a family saga called ""The Falcon and the Dove"" and it's currently only available as a digital download through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Falcon-Dove-ebook/dp/B0097OZA1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362247141&amp;sr=8-1 ) , although I plan to make it available through other outlets. The link for those in the USA is: http://www.amazon.com/The-Falcon-Dove-ebook/dp/B0097OZA1Y/ref=tmm_kin_title_0  Thank you to those kind commenters who pointed that out to me.


As part of a writing course thirty years ago I had to write several short stories. One in particular made me think I could expand it so that is what I eventually did. By this time I had already been writing for several years, including a book about the lives of my parents, one about my time as a student at agricultural college, one about my time in Taiwan. None of these I had published but I was able to draw on these experiences when writing The Falcon and the Dove. This took five years to complete in between working as a gardener, travelling to Taiwan to work as a volunteer teacher, visiting family and friends in England and abroad.


I was born in Taiwan/Formosa, the youngest of five children of missionary parents. We came home to England when I was only one year old, to live in Eastleigh, near Southampton. My mother taught me at home, as she had my brothers and sister while in Formosa, until 1939 when I started school at the age of ten, then in the war I was evacuated to Malvern. At the end of the war I had hoped to train to be a vet but as that was not possible I trained instead to join the Land Army. I worked, mainly in dairying, until the Land Army disbanded in 1951 when I married my husband who was a farm worker. We had five children and I now have the joy of not only the addition of their partners but fifteen grand children and six great grand children. I still enjoy gardening, joining family events, church activities, working with children, volunteering, U3A, travelling.


Please feel free to ask me about my life, my first published novel, or my writing in general!


Kind Regards,

Elizabeth

**In an attempt to answer the common question: How did I get started?**

 I took my first photo aged 10 with a very simple box camera. Oddly, it was of an Orca in captivity at Windsor Safari Park (now Legoland) in the UK whilst on a school trip. I found it magical that by one press of a button you could capture a moment in time and share it for years to come.
 My passion for photography grew over the years at school where I taught myself to process and print my black and white photographic efforts.

 I left school at 18 with the idea of going to University in London to study 'Film and Photographic Science' (yawn, thank goodness I didn't!). I needed a holiday job for 9 weeks before Uni to get some beer money so on the day I left school I literally walked into a small film company called Oxford Scientific Films near where my parents lived. I managed to show them my photographic portfolio and they gave me an interview there and then! They offered me a temporary job but said they couldn't pay me but they would pay my bus fare and give me lunch. I loved the place, work and people so much that I asked for a permanent job and skipped University. I learnt sooo much over the next 4 years working with wildlife and on commercials, feature films and IMAX (as a tea boy mostly). Sweeping, tidying up, holding lights, cleaning lenses etc. etc. I learnt by watching the masters of their crafts.

 The pay was appalling and so I had all sorts of evening jobs like selling loft insulation, Betterware door to door and as a cocktail barman at a Harvester restaurant.

 Finally after 4 years I knew it all and needed to move on to greater things and more pay so applied for jobs with the BBC. I got several interviews and finally got a job as assistant cameraman at BBC Bristol. I worked there for another 4 years alongside some of the greats including Alan Heyward, Andrew Dunn, Martin Saunders, Hugh Maynard etc. (IMDB or Google them). At the BBC I realised I didn't know diddly-squat about the job and so stepped onto an even steeper learning curve that I have never got off.

 After another 4 years the pay was again not enough to support me, my wife and child on the way. The advice I was given with the reputation I had been building was to go freelance. Amazingly, word spread and in the space of 2 weeks I had been offered 2 year contracts with NHK, Partridge Films and the BBC NHU as a freelancer!! They were all offering interest free loans so that I could buy a camera kit and then work to pay off the loan. I was gobsmacked and took the BBC offer as it was where I was based and new the producers etc. The BBC leant me £18,000 ($30,000) and I bought a second hand ARRI HSR 16mm film camera and lens. On the strength of a 2 year contract in my hand the bank lent me a further amount (which I am still paying off until 2022! as part of my mortgage even though the camera was superseded 10 years ago).
 
 I remember my first big job as a freelancer was filming Terns (birds) on the Farne Islands off the north east coast of UK. The producer Neil Lucas accompanied me up there and helped me into the tiniest of fishing trawlers (think miniature Deadliest Catch) with my newly purchased camera kit. I didn't have insurance and pictured loosing the lot to the sea. The sequence turned out fine for a David Attenborough series called 'The Trials of Life'.  The rest as they say is (Natural) history. 

 After 30 years in this career I am still married with two sons (who put me up to doing this Reddit IAmA). I am still working full time.

**Some brief advice on how you can get started**

 My advice to anyone wanting a career in Wildlife film making: Firstly, get out there with any camera you can get your hands on. Get photographing or videoing. Build a portfolio and hone your skills, use the internet and books for advice on technique and find out for yourself whether this really is your passion. Could and would you sit in a hide for 4 weeks, 15 hours a day on the off chance of capturing a unique piece of behaviour? If you find yourself complaining at all then I suggest you try something else. If you love it and want more, then go for it.

 I am a great believer that you make your own luck and opportunities in this life. Don't just follow the normal path, think outside the box to make your luck change. Any employer in any business will only employ you if you are going to bring some skill to their company. You need to build your skills so that you can offer something to the wildlife film making industry rather than just saying 'I always wanted to do this'. If you have a talent or skill or knowledge to offer then someone will want you to work for them. 

 If any of you want feedback on video or photographic efforts then I will be keeping a check on this IAmA thread over the next few months or perhaps longer if there is still interest. Remember we all have to start somewhere.

Thank you.

I'm Dr. Dante Shepherd, and there's a good chance you know me best as a guy in a labcoat with a chalkboard.  I've run my chalkboard photocomic [Surviving the World](http://survivingtheworld.net) (a.k.a. STW) daily for five years, and recently started a second webcomic, [PhD Unknown](http://phdunknown.com) with art by Joan Cooke.

I'm also a chemical engineering professor working on [developing STEM experiments for grades K-12](http://sciencetheworld.com) with science educators of all levels.

Right now, I have a [Kickstarter campaign to make STW page-a-day calendars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1909831013/surviving-the-world-photocomic-page-a-day-calendar) with help from Topatoco and Make That Thing - and if we hit our goal by midnight tonight, every backer getting a physical reward will also get a set of STW coasters as well.  **UPDATE**: looks like we met our initial goal!  Woo!

I'll be answering questions for a while today, so feel free to ask whatever you'd like about STW, raptors, engineering, science, or anything else!  Thanks!

AMA.,hobviously,4946,2960,2197,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ecphi/i_saved_a_girl_from_drowning_she_then_sued_me_ama/,"I am a trained swimmer and completed all classes to become a lifeguard. However, swimming never was more than a hobby for me and I chose a totally different career path.

In 2007 I saved a girl from drowning. For those of you unexperienced with seashores and beaches, the sea will always push you back to the shore unless you are further than a given point. After this given point , the strong current will either push you deeper into the sea, or keep you where you are. You can't just ""float"" back to the shore; you will drown for exhaustion.

In 2007 I was at the beach with a few friends when I noticed a girl way too far from the shore. By ""too far"", I mean way too far: at least twice as far as any other person. Her gestures were clear: she was drowning, barely keeping her head above water. I turned around: no lifeguard. I later learned the man chose to take a break and was at the bathroom.

To make this clear: she was getting futher and further from the shore by the second. I'm a good swimmer: I raced to her, then carried her on my back to the shore, keeping her above water. She had already swallowed a lot of water. I risked my own life because my weight with hers could have been too much. But I made it.

The lady later sued me. Now, I learned later that she had to spend three days at the hospitals, couldn't afford it, tried to sue the beach owners but her case was rejected, but she still sued me. Her case? I should have saved her earlier. I had been careless, not carrying her to the shore fast enough, and should have let the lifeguard do his job (yes, you read that right). I had injured her, she was in pain, she wouldn't have swallowed as much water, if that makes any sense, etc etc etc. 

I had the case thrown out by a judge, but still had to hire a lawyer, and to suffer the humiliation. It was an unnecessary stress. I felt disgusted and betrayed. AMA.

I was the second person in the US to have a full face transplant and third in the world. As far as full and partials go, I was the third in the US and I think fifteenth in the world. 

I know I will get asked as to why I needed one, so I will clear that up. In 2001 I was in a single cab pick-up truck. The driver lost control around a turn and ran into a utility pole, cracking it in half and putting a lot of power lines around the truck. When his gf exited the vehicle, she was struck by one of the downed lines, I immediately got her off and was struck myself. I do not remember thirty minutes before the accident or thirty days after (drug induced coma). Everything I know is by eye witness accounts. I'm probably fortunate to have not remembered that much pain. Though after waking up, I was still in a lot of pain. My left leg was still being amputated further upas the infection kept spreading. Luckily it finally stopped spreading and my knee was saved. 

I'm new to Reddit so this is my first AmA. I hope I did it right. Feel free to ask me questions and I will do my best to answer them. You can view my youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/Fifth0555. My FB medical page is https://www.facebook.com/DeathIsScaredOfMe. There I have an album called ""progression"" which shows pictures of before the accident, after the accident, and the healing stages after the transplant. My newest one is the profile pic taken this week. My personal FB is https://www.facebook.com/Mitch.W.T.F though I have it pretty locked down, so a lot of the pics on it can't be viewed, even by subscribers. Feel free to add me though, I'm a pretty down to Earth guy and enjoy meeting new people, from different parts of the world. 

Like I said, feel free to ask me questions and I will do the best I can to answer them all. If I get swamped, just be patient, I will eventually get to your question. Hope everyone is having a great weekend. Thank you all for the warm welcome I have received thus far.

I work for Nestle Prepared Foods in Solon, Ohio. I'm a member of the team that designs products for brands like Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, and Buitoni. I'm happy to answer any questions that you have. Just keep in mind that I can't divulge anything confidential.

[Here's Verification](http://imgur.com/ASz0n)

The requester had some questions:

Q: Does it ever look like what's on the packaging?

We use the actual product when we do photo shoots, but the photographers take some ""artistic liberties."" They might position the ingredients in a particular way or put the product on a plate or something like that. Part of our job as the food technologists is to make sure that the photographers don't go too far to the point that the photo is misleading.


Q: What is in TV Dinners that we're happy not knowing about?

Not much really. This is a bit of a misconception. Actually our frozen meals don't need to be formulated with preservatives because freezing is the only preservative we need. The weirdest thing you're going to find on the label is probably xanthan gum, which is just a carbohydrate that serves as a thickener. In our factories, we make the meal from scratch, assemble the components in a tray, freeze it, put it in a box, and ship it to you. Pretty simple.


Q: What kind of testing goes on?

We do all sorts of tests. We're given lots of contstraints that we have to meet, and our job as food technologists is to formulate a product that meets all of the requirements. We have to design something that can feasibly be made in our factory, at a particular cost limit, within a set of nutritional requirements, without posing any safety concerns, while still delivering on product quality.
So we begin by trying out different formulations in our test kitchen that meet those requirements. We test and test until we get a product that we're happy with, and then we scale it up. We do tests on a larger scale to make sure that the product we envisioned can actually be made in the factory. We test just about anything you can imagine as long as the company feels the cost of the test is justified.

Well my dad was drinking pretty heavily that night. (counted 18 beers in about 2 hours) and generally speaking when he was drunk there was GOING to be a fight. The night started with just the general passive aggressive wordplay and then progressed to screaming and eventually him telling me to hit him (so that he would have an excuse to beat the shit out of me I guess). Eventually he just snapped and went for a small .22 revolver in another room my mom got to it first and my uncle + mom played keep away with it. Eventually my he wrestled it away from my uncle and started pulling the trigger but my uncle had his finger in between the hammer and managed to throw it outside into the dark. Dad then decided he was leaving and he got his keys and went outside. He came back in 3 minutes later muttering about him leaving was what we wanted him to do. He then made a B-line for my room which contains many assorted knives and weapons. My mom ran into the room and tried to wrestle the knife away from him and he grabbed her hair with one hand and had the knife in the other (kinda like a human shield) and as soon as I saw that I knew I had to do it. So I reached into the drawer and pulled out my .44 mag and shot him in the liver/stomach area.
EDIT: I answered this elsewhere but I can't seem to find it. He didn't die right away. The police arrived and cuffed/interrogated me, but no charges were filled and they called it a very clear cut case of self defense. He was air lifted to a nearby hospital, fighting the police and medical staff the entire time. He fell unconcious never woke up, and died three days later.

I've been referred to as the 'most fiscally conservative Governor' in the country, and vetoed so many bills that I earned the nickname ""Governor Veto.""

Normally, we travel to dozens of air shows between March and November every year. This year, unfortunately, we are one of the many military units impacted by sequestration.

I was fortunate enough to attend the event last Monday in London where Mark Post, a researcher at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, showcased the first ever cultured beef burger. [Sergey Brin]( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/05/google-sergey-brin-test-tube-burger), the co-founder of Google, was also revealed as the philanthropist behind the project.

Why meat alternatives? Meat production is a leading driver of climate change, a massive burden on environmental resources, and a breeding ground for epidemic disease.Meat alternatives hold a lot of promise in feeding a growing population more safely and efficiently.

* We got a lot of initial help from our kissing cousin Kickstarter campaign, [The Machine of Death] (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1234131468/machine-of-death-the-game-of-creative-assassinatio)! *(Which is ending in 12 hours so make sure you check it out while you still have time!)*

* [Colin Mochrie let us make a card based on him!](https://twitter.com/colinmochrie/status/311340292324335616)

* Story War is a card game structured similar to [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) but focuses more on the questions like ""who would win in a fight between Medusa and King Midas"" than on word association. It plays sort of like a more open-ended and accessible version of Dungeons and Dragons.

* We've playtested over 500 individual rounds with a diverse mix of people. We've noticed a common thread of people who don't normally like card games getting the most excited about it.

* The Kickstarter is going to end on Friday at 4pm, *while* we're running a demo booth at **PAX East**.

The [trailer's on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/KillerJoeTheMovie), too. It's rated NC-17. I've been making movies since the 60s. Ask me your questions, and I'll try to answer them the best I can starting 10AM PST.

I love the internet, computers, and love helping people. I'd like to think I'm a really nice computer guy, but that's not what this place wants.

My hopes have slowly been diminished and crushed as requirements from 'upper management' become more strict, and not on promoting people to work harder but discouraging people from being helpful. The red tape that we drown in over the phone gives us the ability to say ""Sorry"" and if you talk to a good person they'll actually pray your issue gets fixed as it flows down the rusted, broken down pipe.

Greedy lying manipulative sales people, technicians that blame dispatch and a dispatch that blames technicians, a training department that spends eight weeks on how to setup an account and two weeks on how to fix issues, outsourcing agents (OSRs) that **DO** read from scripts for out of date billing/repair systems and still manage to mess things up.

The stress from being one of the few in my office that know how to, and actually want to, fix things is over-whelming when it seems there are more rules in place to prevent that than help. I've got a teaspoon to poke at an ocean of problems. Feel free to ask me anything.

I was friends with the killers, a few victims, was scapegoated by the police as being involved, went on to do lots of anti-bullying activism for many years before I gave it up. AMA",Or1g1nal1ty,6237,4337,2697,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gulaf/iama_columbine_survivor_named_brooks_brown_i_was/,"So, that's the short version. The longer version is a bit of a pain to go over entirely. I was a senior at the time of the massacre, and was the guy Eric told to 'get out of here' because he 'liked me now'. My family was the one who reported Eric Harris almost two dozen times to the police for death threats and various things which they never followed up on. After the terrible day, my family and I went to the press to show the world that the police botched this one up - and instead the police lied, saying we never did such a thing, then they began telling the media and the families that I was involved in the killing.

I quickly became a pariah in the area, lost all but a handful of my friends, and became a semi-regular news feature. I spent the next few years in front of TV cameras, working on documentaries of all sorts, writing my book, and going from school to school talking about the dangers of bullying. I also spent much time reading, studying, talking to psychologists, experts, and others to try to understand why it happened. It consumed my life wholly. 

Then I quit all of that to move to SF to work on videogames and leave all that shit behind. It's been liberating. A while ago my Reddit account got outed as mine in a post about the work I'm doing now, and since then I've been sent messages saying I should do an AMA. So, here I am. 12 years in, hundreds of miles away. So, ask me anything. (edited due to stupid wording I had used)

EDIT: Submitted photo for the AMA to the mods. [Link here](http://yfrog.com/gy8wbbuj). glad to see it make the front page. Your kind words are fantastic to read today, and I know a bunch of other Columbiners who are on here and its good to know it's still in your thoughts. I'm answering as fast as I can. 

Edit 2: Finally reading through the discussions and they're pretty fantastic. At least the civil ones. That's why I love reddit &lt;3

Edit 3: That's it for now. 4 hours straight on Reddit is well over my daily requirement. I'll try to read more and answer more throughout the day. I think I replied to many, and almost every one with more than a few upvotes. I certainly didn't expect  1500 comments. thanks for all the kind words you guys/gals. It's definitely helped :)

Edit 4: So I don't have to answer a ton of dupe questions about the bullying, I'm pointing to two articles, [one from that year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm), [and another from 7 years later](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8115&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;PAGE=1) and [the amazing response to that one](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8452&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35). The bullying was real. the shooters were NOT bullies, and there is a TON of stuff to back it up.

1339651371.0,1893,self.IAmA,v17kn,"IAmA former meth lab operator, AMAA",HeisenbergSpecial,6073,4180,3639,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v17kn/iama_former_meth_lab_operator_amaa/,"So, let's see.  I have an educational background in polymer chemistry, and have been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar disorder.  I had been going through the mental health system about four years, trying all sorts of different medications for both disorders, without having any real improvement.  So, as kind of an act of desperation, I tried various illegal drugs.  I discovered that the combination of indica-strain marijuana and low-dose methamphetamine allowed me to virtually eliminate all symptoms of both disorders, and become a very successful medical researcher.  But because methamphetamine is so hard to obtain where I live, I used my chemistry background to make the stuff.  I've made it via the iodine/phosphorus reaction, and via the Grignard reaction and reductive amination.  I never sold methamphetamine, although I have sold mushrooms and weed.  I've seen the first four seasons of Breaking Bad, which started well after I already was doing this.  I was caught by the police over a year ago.  The way they caught me was pretty much really, really bad luck on my part.  The police searched my car and found a few chemical totally unrelated to methamphetamine manufacturing, but according to police, chemicals=meth lab.  Some powder in my car tested positive for ephedrine, even though it was not ephedrine or even a related chemical, and this prompted a search of all of my possessions.  I thought I could get away with it because of the very limited quantities I was making, but didn't count on Bad-Luck Brian levels of luck.

Also, this ordeal has given me a lot of insight into the way the criminal justice system works in the US, the way the healthcare system works in the US, the way mental health and addiction are treated, and the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry controls government policy.  An example: methamphetamine is available by prescription under the name Desoxyn, for treating narcolepsy and ADHD, but only one company is allowed to make it.  A prescription will cost a person with no insurance about $500 a month, not counting doctor's visits.  The same amount of dextromethamphetamine can be purchased on the street for about $100, or manufactured by an individual for about $10.

Because of my crime, which fell under federal jurisdiction because of transportation across state lines, and involved about 5 grams of pseudoephedrine, I am now a convicted felon for the rest of my life, barring a pardon from the president of the United States.  I am unable to vote, receive financial aid for education, or own a firearm, for the rest of my life.  I spent one month in jail, after falsely testing positive for methamphetamine, essentially because of the shortcomings of the PharmaChek sweat patch drug test.  I lost all of my savings and my job, after being court ordered to live at a location far away from all of that, and having all my mental disorder symptoms come back full force.

While I was using, I did experience many of the negative effects of methamphetamine use, although overall I still believe that physiologically, it was a positive influence on me.  But I can easily see how a methamphetamine addiction could spiral out of control.

So, ask me anything that doesn't involve giving away personally identifying details, and I'll answer to the best of my ability.  I should be verified by the mods.

Edit:  It took me almost a week, but I finally read every question in this AMA, and answered all the ones I could, that hadn't been asked and answered too many times already.  I even read the ones at the bottom, with negative scores on them, even though they were mostly references to Breaking Bad, people who didn't read the intro, and ""fuck you asshole, I hope you burn in hell!"" in various phrasings.  I would like to point out that the point of this AMA was not to brag, or look for sympathy.  It was to try and answer questions relating to meth and its synthesis in as honest and neutral of a tone as I could manage.  People know there's a lot of bullshit out there regarding drugs, and I wanted to clear up as much as I could.  Also, to those people who don't believe my story, believe me, if I was selling this shit, I'd be in prison.

Edit 2: For anyone who thinks my story is unfair, read about [Ernesto Lira](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/us/battles-to-change-prison-policy-of-solitary-confinement.html), a man who committed a crime roughly similar in magnitude as mine (though he committed his crime while on parole).  Compared to his story, mine is nothing. 

Edit 3: For those people saying more or less that I committed a crime and got caught, and should accept the punishment, I'm not saying I shouldn't have been punished.  What I'm saying is that taking away more than five years of my life for what was truly a victimless crime seems rather extreme to me.  And taking away certain rights for the rest of my life is beyond insane.  If I had been stealing money from my family to feed an addiction, or buying from a dealer supplied by the Latin American cartels, my punishment would be far less than it is.",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1347834208.0,crime,,True,t3_v17kn,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v17kn/iama_former_meth_lab_operator_amaa/,

I write for Southern Fried Science (southernfriedscience.com), one of the most widely read ocean science blogs on the internet. I also tweet about sharks @WhySharksMatter , and am always happy to answer any questions that anyone has about sharks.

Couple things I will say now.

1. I was never expelled from the high school.

2. I transferred to a new high school and graduated.

3. I do not know what happened to the other students involved last I heard they transferred to an alternative school for troubled teens and graduated.

4. Most of the people in the reports testified in the jury trial for the defendants including the principal and officers involved.

5. The trial consisted of them bringing multiple friends in saying I threatened to kill them also. This is actually a very important piece because they tried to paint a picture of me doing this to multiple people.

6. My lawyer was very good and caught the people testifying for them in multiple lies.

My name is Aaron Santos, and I’ve made it my mission to teach math in fun and entertaining ways.  Toward this end, I’ve written two (hopefully) humorous books: *How Many Licks? Or, How to Estimate Damn Near Anything* and *Ballparking: Practical Math for Impractical Sports Questions*.  I also maintain a blog called Diary of Numbers. I’m here to estimate answers to all your numerical questions.  Here's some examples I’ve done [before](http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2011/03/death-statistics.html).

Feel free to make your questions funny, thought-provoking, gross, sexy, etc.  I’ll also answer non-numerical questions if you’ve got any.

**Update** It's 11:51 EST.  I'm grabbing lunch, but will be back in 20 minutes to answer more.  

**Update 2.0** OK, I'm back.  Fire away.

**Update 3.0** Thanks for the great questions, Reddit!  I'm sorry I won't be able to answer all of them.  There's 3243 comments, and I'm replying roughly once every 10 minutes, (I type slow, plus I'm doing math.)  At this rate it would take me 22 days of non-stop replying to catch up.  It's about 4p EST now.  I'll keep going until 5p, but then I have to take a break.

By the way, for those of you that like doing this stuff, I'm going to post a contest on Diary of Numbers tomorrow.  It'll be some sort of estimation-y question, and you can win a free copy of my cheesy sports book.  I know, I know...shameless self-promotion...karma whore...blah blah blah.  Still, hopefully some of you will enter and have some fun with it.

",,8490,6612,1064,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uy25t/iama_the_43_year_old_terminally_ill_husband_and/,"This AMA was well received:  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uta5q/iama_terminally_ill_43_year_old_husband_and/

Yesterday I saw my ICD nurse and a doctor who had assessed the information from my last discharge and found something interesting.  I explained this in the AMA, but I'll outline it again here.  The heart goes through several waves as it completes a single beat, illustrated here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rhythm.  The peaks are represented by letters:  P, Q, R, S, and T.  When I first diagnosed and my ICD implanted, I only really had an R point.  The rest were just little mumbles because my heart was so weak.  But what they discovered is that my heart has gotten so strong, that the T point had gotten high enough that the ICD was counting it as another R wave, effectively double counting my heartbeats.  Instead of 176 beats a minute, it thought my heart was in v-fib at 352 beats a minute, and would deliver a shock to reset, or cardiovert, my heart.  It ended up that I never...needed...shocked...at all.  Which sucks, because it *frigging hurts!*  

So my heart had a software bug.  The ICD nurse and a cardiologist logged into my heart using a wireless device, pictured here:  http://imgur.com/9B9vM  (St. Jude Medical makes my ICD).  They programmed my ICD to ignore 200 milliseconds after it sees an R point, so it doesn't pay attention to the T, and counts the next R.  They also set it to ""capture"" my heart when it exceeds 180 beats a minute.  When it happens, my pacemaker will start pacing my heart at 190 beats (it is...uncomfortable, like suddenly being anxious about something) then start marching my heart rate down to a safe level.

End result:  **I should never be shocked again, and my heart maaay be twice as strong as we thought.**  I have a couple of tests, an echocardiogram and a nuclear (or nucular.  Nucular) scan scheduled for later this week to ascertain if my heart is stronger, and if so, exactly how much stronger.

Dying guy no die no more?  Maybe!  My family is ecstatic.  I am ecstatic.  I hope you are all ecstatic, too.  I hope that this fills your day with hope and possibility the way it has filled mine.

Edit:  I've tried to keep up all day, but I'm worn out.  I'll probably check in later tonight, but for now I've got to go and rest.  Thanks, everybody.  Again, everyone's been really great.

Edit 2, The Return:  I got back on for a while, tried to answer everyone, got really tired, going to bed.  Starting to take the downvoting personally, but I've been told it's a bot.  If I didn't answer you, it's because you got lost in the crush, not because I didn't want to take the time personally to thank you for your kind words and wishes.  I'm glad that so many people have taken hope, solace, or inspiration from what is, to me, just trying to stay alive. As always, Reddit, you folks have been really gracious and kind and have given me so much love and support, it makes me cry.  Good night.

Edit the Third, the Search for Spock:  I've been kind of goofing around off and on this morning.  I'm sorry if I haven't messaged you personally, but I can only write ""Thank you"" so many times before my hand turns into a claw.  So if you posted to just say thank you, I want to say it back.  You guys all took time out of your day to say a few kind words and deserve to be acknowledged for it.  I will be going through all the PM's shortly to make sure I did get them all.  

Edit 4, The Voyage Home:  Today are the tests to determine if my heart function has improved.  I should hear either immediately (the techs like me and tell me if things are good before the formal results come back) or tomorrow.  I will update everyone.

A quick clarification:  I use the word “Tick” to describe the unvoluntary movements and noises my TS causes me to make.  “Tick” is not the proper spelling, it ought to be “Tic”, but I use Tick for 2 reasons:
1.	 Tick in my personal onomatopoeia of the sound I hear in my head when I tick.
2.	I use words like “Ticky” and “Tickish” when I describe the rate at which I’m ticking, or how I’m feeling.  So for consistency’s sake, I spell the word “Tick”.

**Ticks:**
I can usually feel a tick coming.  It feels just like the “Point of no return” when you sneeze.  Sometimes I can stop it from happening right away, sometimes I can’t, or don’t feeling coming.
When I stop it, I can still feel it there.  If feels similar to when you REALLY have to pee, but can’t get to a bathroom right away, so you have to hold it.  After a few minutes my whole body is SCREAMING to let the ticks come out.  I feel much better after a tick happens.
A tick for me, is a way to “fix” or “release” an uncomfortable sensation that has built up somewhere in my body.  I don’t tick to feel good, I tick to make an area feel normal again.

*Ticks I exhibit:*
I have both motor and vocal ticks.  To be diagnosed with TS you much have motor ticks and at lease one vocal tick.
I jerk my head at my left shoulder.
My right arm flails up, sort of like an odd salute.
Sometimes my head jerk and arm flail happens at the same time.
A leg will “kick out”.
I flex the muscles in my arms and leg.
I furrow my browns.
I stretch my eyes very wide and they stick that way for a bit.
I clench my jaw.
I wheeze out all the air in my lungs and hold it.
I make a small “Hm” sound in the back of my throat.
I repeat words or phrases people say to me, or anything that gets stuck in my head.

**TS and other issues.**
It is common for people with TS to also have ADD, ADHD, OCD, Schizophrenic, or be slightly autistic. (Like Aspergers)
It’s common for us to experience anxiety, insomnia, and depression.
I have TS, there are things I’m OCD about.  I can have anxiety here and there, I’m definitely an insomniac, and I have depression issues.

**Being in public.**
I usually have a good handle of my ticks so I can suppress them or disguise them while I’m in public, but when they do happen, and they are noticeable, I either explain to any strangers who look worried/confused/interested, and if nobody looks worried/confused/interested, I just let it go.

I go to the movies.  I only have a few vocal ticks, and they’re pretty quiet, so I don’t think I’ve even been a disruption.
The only time I’m ever really embarrassed is when young children mime my ticks when they see them.  They’re just being kids, but it still kinda makes me feel sad.

*School*
Nobody made fun of me in high school.
I tried to go to college, however the stress of being on my own and un-related medical issues made my ticks become debilitating, and I could not commute because it was not safe for me to drive.  The school was not accommodating, and I failed out.  I probably could try to go again because my symptoms are much less bothersome now, but I don’t want to.

*Personal Life*
It has never affected my friendships or my ability to find a boyfriend.  All my friends have learned to ignore my ticks, just like I do, and when a tick is funny, they laugh right along with me.  I currently have a GREAT, supportive, loving, and understanding boyfriend.  We live together, and I don’t think he really notices my ticks anymore, unless he ends up getting hit by one.

**Sex**
Yes, I can have sex.
Yes, sometimes I tick during sex, but since my man loves me for me, he has learned to ignore it.
If I ever tick enough to ruin the moment, we take a quick time out and then get back to the fun stuff.

**Treatment**
I currently do not take any kind of medicine.  Medicine is available to me, but it has a bunch of bad side effects, and I don’t want to encounter them if my current symptoms are minor.
On sparse occasions I have used THC recreationally.  THC stops all of my ticks.  I am currently not planning on using THC for medicinal purposes, as it is still illegal in Ohio, but I think that it should be legalized, that way it is an option for me, and many other people, if I need it in the future.

**Supression**
I don’t have a way to describe or advise how to suppress ticks.  I just… Do.  I wish I could find the words to describe it, but it’s like describing a color without using colors.

**Videos**
My identity is not really a secret, but I prefer to not be forthcoming, as this is the internet, and you are all strangers.
I don’t think I will be posting a video, as it will be primarily watched just for people to see me tick, and I don’t want to make a spectacle or a sideshow of myself.  I might consider it in the future, but not today.
As for a picture of myself, I guess that’s okay.

1361650032.0,1875,self.IAmA,193e3x,IAMA sexual assault therapist discussing when orgasm happens during rape. AMA!,ChildTherapist,12561,10686,4315,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/193e3x/iama_sexual_assault_therapist_discussing_when/,"I did an AMA on this a few months ago and have received a number of requests to do it again.

The basic concept of experiencing orgasm during rape is a confusing and difficult one for many people, both survivors and those connected to survivors.

There are people who do not believe it's possible for a woman or man to achieve orgasm during rape or other kinds of violent sexual assault.  Some believe having an orgasm under these circumstances means that it wasn't a ""real"" rape or the woman/man ""wanted"" it.

I've assisted more young women than I can count with this very issue.  It often comes up at some point during therapy and it's extremely embarrassing or shameful to talk about.  However once it's out in the open, the survivor can look at her/his reaction honestly and begin to heal.  The shame and guilt around it is a large part of why some rapes go unreported and why there is a need for better understanding in society for how and why this occurs.

There have been very few studies on orgasm during rape, but the research so far shows numbers from 10% to over 50% having this experience.  In my experience as a therapist, it has been somewhat less than half of the girls/women I've worked with.  (For the record, I have worked with very few boys/men who reported this.)

In professional discussions, colleagues report similar numbers.  Therapists don't usually talk about this publicly as they fear contributing to the idea of victims ""enjoying rape.""  It's also a reason why there isn't more research done on this and similar topics.
My belief is that as difficult a topic as this is, if we can address it directly and remove the shame and stigma, then a lot more healing can happen.  I'm hopeful that the Reddit community is open to learning and discussing topics like this.

I was taken to task in my original discussion for not emphasizing that this happens for boys and men as well.  I referenced that above but am doing it again here to make this point clear.

I was verified previously, but I'll include the documentation again here.  http://imgur.com/eTVei

This is an open discussion and I'm happy to answer any questions.  Don't be afraid if you think it may be offensive as I'd rather have a frank talk than leave people with false ideas.
AMA!

**Edit:** 3:30pm Questions/comments are coming in MUCH faster than I thought.  A lot faster than the other time I did this topic.  I'm answering as fast as I can; bear with me!

**Edit2:** 8:30pm Thank you everyone for all your questions and comments!! This went WAY past what I thought it would be (8 hours, whew!).  I need to take a break (and eat!) but I'll check back on before going to sleep and try to respond to more questions.

**Edit3:** 10:50pm Okay, I'm back and it looks like you all carried on fine without me.  I'll try to answer as many first-order (main thread, no deviations that I have to search for) questions as I can before I fall asleep at the keyboard.  And Front Page! Wow!  Thank you all.  And really I mean Thank You for caring enough about this topic to bring it to the front.  It's most important to me to get this info out to you.

**Edit4:** 2:30am Stayed up way later than I meant to. It kept being just one more question that I felt needed to be answered.  **Thank you all again for your thoughtful and informative questions.  Even the ones that seemed off-putting at first, I think resulted in some good discussion.**  Good night!  I'll try to answer a few more in the days to come.  And I have seen your pm's and will get to those as well.  Please don't think I am ignoring you.

**Edit5:** I was on for a few hours today trying to answer any remaining questions.  Over 2000 questions and comments is a LOT to go through, lol!  I am working my way through the pm's you've all sent, but I am back to work tomorrow.  I have over 4 pages, so please be patient.  I promise to get to everyone!

I’m an entrepreneur and writer. I’ve founded 20 companies, ranging from hedge funds to dating websites, most of which have failed. A few have made million dollar exits. I blew that on expensive toys, trips, and bad ideas, and saw my account go from $15 million to $143 in a matter of months. I lost my house, my friends, my sanity and considered killing myself. BusinessWeek called me “Wall Street’s keeper of pain”.

After a few months of depression and heartache, I started a blog to bleed out some of my ideas and lessons I was going through (to give you an idea, popular posts include “I Want My Kids to Be Drug Addicts”, “How I Screwed Yasser Arafat Out of $2 Million, and Lost $100 million”, and “I Want To Die”). I started more businesses, wrote more books. Now the blog receives millions of visitors a year, I made most my money back through new investments, and just published my new book: [Choose Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4)

[Choose Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4) is the result of everything I’ve gone through in the past. You can’t wait on anyone to give you the life you want. Nobody is coming to hire you, invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. College isn’t going to help, neither are your parents, or friends. You have to choose yourself. There are more ways than ever to make a million dollars, create art, and change the world, without “help.” If you want to read it, I’ll even [pay you to do so](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/06/nobody-has-ever-made-this-offer-before-i-am-paying-people-back-if-they-read-my-book/)

UPDATE: The website wasn't proof enough, so I sent reddit my business card this morning. Hopefully this post goes back online and we can keep this dialog going. To clarify, I have not been published as of yet. And I am not presenting any of my own research here. The purpose of this post is to dip into the huge trove of research that has been done in the past 10 years on cannabis and bring it to light, so that the public can make its own educated decision on the subject.

Check out this paper. It's all-inclusive and a good general introduction to cannabis facts ranging from plant compositions to biological effects of cannabinoids and terpenes:

 Hello all once again, doing another IAmA. Why? Well I don't really post that much on Reddit, mostly browse, so karma doesn't matter to me, especially in a self post. 

Anyway, so you may have all heard about Google StreetView's new update! I've been driving as a contracted driver for Google under a third-party company for about 3 months now. 

I have mostly been part of the update project since I started, I haven't really added *too* much to the new system, mostly just improving it and such as the update states. I did have an option to help with the UnderwaterView, but it would result in me having to pay all expenses to get there, don't really have the money to do so. After all, this job is a temp-job.

Anyway, right now I'm nearing the finishing of my routes in New England and then will be going a little west and south, going to about Virginia or so. I'm one of the lucky few who has been kept on due to my hard work (and them overworking me and me not complaining...money is money). 

So yeah, ask me anything. The only thing I can't answer is my current location or where I will be going and what route, due to my own safety. 

I did get into a minor fender bender with my van that I had, so they gave me one of the Imprezas to drive. I prefer this car much more, but it does behave a little topheavy in windy conditions.

* Which of your works is your favorite? Why?

* Where do you draw the most inspiration from?

* Are you happy with the film adaptations of your books? Is there anything you wish had been done differently to make the films more accurately represent the books and characters in them? Is there anything you feel was done in the films that really impressed you and you thought was an improvement from the books?

* You have spoken about your experiences that inspired the book Choke and that you attended meetings because you were transporting people to them. You've also written about support meetings elsewhere including Fight Club. Have you ever heard anything in a support group that stands out as a particularly inspiring, sad, or shocking memory?

This isn't a question just an aside but I really loved reading Testy Festy in Stranger than Fiction. I spent some time in Missoula and I was completely taken aback when I first learned about the festival. Reading about it as described by Palahniuk was a real treat.

I spend an uncomfortable amount of time studying the inner workings and numbers behind gambling games, so I can chime in on those questions, too. Seriously, ask me questions about Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, flipping coins, the LOTTERY... anything.

Some of us will be on throughout, others will pop in and out over the course of the afternoon.  (Lessig, TBL, etc won't be able to answer every single question, but will probably get to those voted up to the top.)

We are here to discuss the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) which we are striving to reform, and under which Aaron Swartz, Andrew Auernheimer (weev), and others have been prosecuted and which potentially makes felons out of millions of Americans by criminalizing website terms of service violations.

We hail from across the political spectrum and we have somewhat divergent opinions about what the ideal CFAA would look like.  But we all agree that the CFAA allows law enforcement to engage in frivolous prosecutions and/or to seek penalties that are severely disproportionate to alleged offenses -- and that this stifles innovation and speech and must be fixed.

It hit #274 on Amazon yesterday ([proof](http://i.imgur.com/9QUcbde.png)), which blows my mind.

What I write about is pretty eclectic -- basically, what's something new to me and fascinating. Here are five very recent ones, to give you a taste:

* To help fight chlamydia, Sweden once set up an [on-demand condom delivery service](http://nowiknow.com/the-condom-express/) and had an awareness day called Chlamydia Monday.
* Colgate-Palmolive once pulled a snack off the shelves, allegedly because [it made people fart too much](http://nowiknow.com/the-musical-snack/). 
* Ever notice how, when you're on your cell phone and the call drops, you can almost immediately tell? That's because [cell phone companies pump artificial noise into the receiver](http://nowiknow.com/enjoy-the-silence/) specifically to make it clear that the other side is still there.
* In the 1700s, [people were killing children in order to get executed](http://nowiknow.com/the-worlds-worst-loophole/). Why? Because suicide would cause them to go to Hell, but they wanted to kill themselves.
* And a program in Brazil which gives prison inmates [time off for riding a stationary bike hooked up to a car battery](http://nowiknow.com/pedaling-to-freedom/). This charges the car battery, and the power is used to power street lights. (If anyone here writes for *Orange is the New Black*, this should totally happen.)

And [here's one which I think most of us on reddit suffer from](http://nowiknow.com/witzelsucht/)... especially me.

All the archives are [here](http://nowiknow.com/archives/) and you can subscribe for free. They're kind of random, but hopefully interesting.

Keep the questions to Now I Know and I'll answer just about anything.  I'll also answer questions about baseball, just because. And most other stuff as well.

A few years ago I decided to break my Non-Disclosure Agreement I signed when I left Guantanamo to tell my side of the story about what went on there and why I believe the facility should be shut down.   I reached out the UC Davis Guantanamo Project and told my full story.  Since telling my story I have been threatened by the Government, harassed at work, and much more.  

I also had the privilege to meet with two former detainees in London as part of a BBC documentary “Guantanamo Reunited” that I once guarded at Guantanamo who like many there where innocent and released without any charge.

Erik and Alexis organized this amazing bus tour across the Heartland of America, from Denver, CO to Danville, KY, during election season. My company, Nimblebot, stowed away to document the action. What emerged was an incredibly fun and educational journey, revealing stories about entrepreneurship in the midwest (from payment processing, to mobile games, to farms), implications for the American economy, outrageous party antics, and some lifelong friendships. Alexis, Erik, and I are here to answer your questions about the journey and the film. 
Many of the entrepreneurs and community builders featured in the movie will also join us.

Since there’s so many of us, here’s some possible themes that we’re all well acquainted with: the bus tour, the film, “making of”, next steps, internet freedom, America’s tech/startup scene, blending entrepreneurship and community building - or whatever you want!

AMA,BrokeTheInterweb,3947,2128,1709,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e0rzq/iama_21yearold_girl_who_was_disciplined_for/,"A year and a half ago, I worked for the YMCA's after school program, which took place in the poorest elementary school in the city.

The program, which was basically homework and then playtime, was for the kids whose parents couldn't afford daycare, and for the mostpart, wished they didn't have a kid. This was best proven by the fact that about 1/4 of the parents attended our free parents appreciation dinner, and 100% left early.

After I got to know the kids, they would run up to me and hug me to say hello, or sit on my lap during playtime.

I had the audacity to hug them back, and to read them stories while they climbed all over me.

This behavior earned me a write-up, and an incredibly offensive lecture about ""good touch, bad touch."" After all, if the parent sees, which they won't because they don't even look at their kids, they might sue us!

I was told that when a child hugs me, I am to walk away and ignore them in order to show them that touching is not okay.

I wasn't even allowed to hug the five year old who watched his dad get shot to death the night before. ""That's a matter for the mother to deal with,"" my boss said.

I called my mom, who's worked in childcare her whole life, expecting sympathy. But they had brainwashed her too. ""That's just how it is. Just don't touch them.""

I started hugging the kids more than ever, telling them how many things they could grow up to be, and then I quit. Rules like this make me sad about humanity, and I'll never stop wondering how those kids are doing.


Couple things: I wasn't a teacher, I was a part-time after school counselor while I went to college. I saw these kids for four hours a day, and I was never once alone with any of them. That rule is understandable, but I don't agree that hugging them in plain sight is any sort of threat.

I made an AMA about it exactly a year ago today - and in it - I made you all a promise. I'm back. AMA!",isthisadream,11649,9841,2813,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/we3jw/i_quit_my_job_broke_up_with_my_longtime/,"A year ago today I made [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/imp9j/i_quit_my_job_ended_a_4yr_relationship_and_then/) about my chaotic adventure across the US by train, and spent the following weeks talking with redditors about what happened during my journey. The response was...*unexpected.* Psychologists, newspapers, magazines, college professors, and screenwriters approached me afterward trying to interview me, or write out my story. I answered question after question, and wrote email after email for weeks after my initial post, but when it came time to actually sell my story...I knew I couldn't. I'd made a promise to you all, and I have every intention of keeping it.

After a full year of writing and editing, I am finally able to say that I have completed the story of my travels. All of it, written out in detail from start to finish in the vein of an adventure book. Every chapter takes places in a different city, with different situations, and with different people. It's fair to say that each chapter is a mini-story in-and-of itself, and the whole trip ties it together. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to debate a US diplomat on Wikileaks, or to fall in love in Seattle, or maybe cross two state-lines following a fever-induced dream, getting sloshed on tequila with an overly aggressive 40yr old cougar and then wake up scared and alone, live on a train, or perhaps what it would be like finding yourself at knife-point in a dark and dingy train station near midnight...all of this is written in here, and more. This was the craziest period of my life (especially being introverted), and I'm more than happy to be able to share what happened, and what invaluable lessons I've learned because of it.

Here is my [prologue](http://www.elf-clan.com/ichosetherailsprologue.pdf) if you're interested (note:this is a *true* story, and so it contains some profanity), and below is the actual book if you want to read more...

[Her other stuff is awesome too.](http://www.considerchromatic.com/Photos/Art/Art2/index.html) Thanks to their help, this book is 100% created by, and for, reddit. I think that's pretty cool ;P (Oh and ... they are definitely available for work /shameless plug)

If you guys have any questions about my trip, what it was like to going back to society, what it was like learning to become an author, self-publishing, writing a true story from memory and journals, or anything else... **AMA!!**

**EDIT** - This post, besides being dedicated to reddit, the IAMA community, and the [[two]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u7ikn/inspired_by_a_fellow_redditor_i_put_my_life_on/) [[redditors]](http://traveltoallthethings.wordpress.com/) who traveled solo around the country because of reading my post, is dedicated to a person who I've never met, and yet, whose life I have somehow dramatically impacted. I received a message from him about three months after my OP, telling me that because of my AMA - he divorced his wife. 

I didn't really know how to respond, but I tried. 

Every day since then I've thought about that message, and tried to wrap my head around the fact that something I did/wrote could have had such an impact as to separate the bond of marriage within the lives of people I didn't even know. Wherever you are man, I hope you found the happiness you were looking for, and if it means anything, just know that your message has kept me going for the months that followed. The completion of this book, it's for you. If you could do something like that because of me, then I sure as hell could do something like this.

**EDIT** - Holy crap [it actually happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taADLPtyDb0)

**EDIT** - Thanks to Indolence for this link http://www.charitynavigator.org/ . Before voting for the charity you can see what they do with the money. Doctors without Borders looks like it's going to win, and National Space Society is a semi-close second. (In case you're wondering)

**EDIT** - Okay I've extended the paperback purchasing for 5 days total. To be honest, I can't wait for my brief moment in the spotlight to fade, it's unnerving and awkward. I made a promise to myself that I would write the book and then post about it. I've done that, I fulfilled what I was meant to do. Now, I need to start getting these orders processed, and then return to my quiet life. :) Thank you everyone for your support. If you have any more posts/questions I'll still answer them when I can.

",repmcgovern,3692,1887,535,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/,"Hello! I am Congressman Jim McGovern, from the 2nd Congressional District of Massachusetts. Over the past three years, I've been one of the leading voices in Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's misguided decision in Citizens United, which unleashed a flood of corporate and special interest money into the American political system. 

I recently introduced two constitutional amendments to that effect. The first amendment, HJ Res 20, advances the fundamental principle of political equality for all by empowering Congress and the States to regulate political spending.  It will allow Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation that will withstand Constitutional challenges.    The second amendment, HJ Res 21, would overturn *Citizens United* and put a stop to the growing trend of corporations claiming first amendment rights.  This “People’s Rights Amendment” not only addresses corporate rights as they pertain to campaign finance, but is broader in scope to clarify that corporations are not people with Constitutional rights.  Importantly, the amendment clearly protects the people’s rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free exercise of religion, freedom of association, and all other such rights of the people. 

 ( [My floor speech on those two amendments is just about at 100K views on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5IEEv4RVIc) ) 

More on me: I dedicate a lot of my time in Congress to human rights and hunger issues as the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission and the House Hunger Caucus.  I'm also the second ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, and a member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, which has jurisdiction over SNAP, and other nutrition and consumer programs. 

 I'm a dad, a Red Sox fan, and proud to be from Worcester, MA.  Ask me anything!

I was also in [Nightmare on Elm Street](http://i.imgur.com/uM37b.jpg), as well as [many other movies and shows](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389003/).

These days, however, I find myself the victim of people in very high positions of power within the Hollywood Industry.  They have denied my health coverage, and I was hoping that through reddit I could share my story.

In the 80s, I was on the SAG Board of Directors, where I advocated for stunt people who not being recognized by the Board.  Even once my term was over, I continued to advocate for my fellow stunt people.  This was apparently an act the Board of Directors wouldn't forget.

Skipping ahead to the present day, many years in the stunt business has left me with multiple injuries, including Post-Concussion Syndrome and all its effects (which has recently been in the news linked to the death of Football player Junior Seau).  I applied for my health coverage through SAG, but they refused to cover me, refusing to acknowledge the PCS, despite the fact that I had been diagnosed as such by a doctor.

Now, I'm trying to get my story out there through reddit and the internet in the hopes that maybe someone can help me and others with injuries like mine get the rightful coverage we have earned.

So AMA, reddit, about my career as a stuntwoman, my injuries, or what [Ricardo Montalban is like in person](http://i.imgur.com/N6r96.jpg)!  After years of being an advocate for stunt people, I’m looking for someone who can help me now.

The Singularity Institute, founded by [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://yudkowsky.net/) in 2000, is the largest organization dedicated to making sure that smarter-than-human AI has a positive, safe, and ""[friendly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence)"" impact on society. (AIs are made of math, so we're basically a math research institute plus an advocacy group.) I've written many things you may have read, including two [research](http://singularity.org/files/IE-EI.pdf) [papers](http://singularity.org/files/SaME.pdf), a [Singularity FAQ](http://singularity.org/singularity-faq/), and [dozens of articles](http://lukeprog.com/writings.html) on [cognitive neuroscience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/), [scientific self-help](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/), [computer science](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dhg/an_intuitive_explanation_of_solomonoff_induction/), [AI safety](http://lukeprog.com/SaveTheWorld.html), [technological forecasting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9ao/longterm_technological_forecasting/), and [rationality](http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/). (In fact, we at the Singularity Institute think human rationality is so important for *not screwing up the future* that we helped launch the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://appliedrationality.org/) (CFAR), which teaches [Kahneman-style rationality](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/) to students.)

On October 13-14th we're running our 7th annual [Singularity Summit](http://singularitysummit.com/) in San Francisco. If you're interested, [check out the site](http://singularitysummit.com/) and [register online](https://www.thinkreg.com/events/singularity/).

I've given online interviews before ([one](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8s6/video_qa_with_singularity_institute_executive/), [two](http://lesswrong.com/lw/980/singularity_institute_executive_director_qa_2/), [three](http://singularity.org/blog/2011/09/15/interview-with-new-singularity-institute-research-fellow-luke-muehlhuaser-september-2011/), [four](http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai)), and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

1. After appearing on Malcolm in the Middle for many years, what led you to choose to do a darker, different role as Walter White in Breaking Bad?

2. Throughout the series, we see Walter transform from someone looking out for his family, to something darker and more sinister. Is that because of creator Vince Gilligan's writing, or did you have input as to how you wanted Walter to transform throughout the series?

3. Whats your relationship with Aaron Paul like offset? Are you two practically bros?

4. Which do you prefer working in? Movies or TV shows? Do you prefer doing Comedy or Drama?

5. Since Breaking Bad is in its final season, what do you have lined up to do after the show ends?

I've got a pile of Qs on my old threads following yesterday's SSM decisions so, as promised, I'm back for the post-decision AMA. I'm around today save for a few meetings so I should be able to do Q&amp;A most of the day. 

Per usual, here's my regular intro.

**Quick Background:**


I'm a lawyer living and working in DC. My pet love my whole life has been the Constitution and constitutional law. I do not work as a constitutional lawyer for my day job, but I do write academically and colloquially about areas of constitutional law. I've worked in a public interest firm doing constitutional litigation in the past, so I can do some Q&amp;A about how that process works but I no longer actively litigate.

My areas of specialization are the First Amendment and legislative procedure. Within the First Amendment I know mostly speech/press/election law issues and legislative procedure is all about our federal legislative system (so everything from item-line veto to the filibuster) are what I love to talk and write about.

I have a general knowledge of most other constitutional provisions, including the issues surrounding same sex marriage, so ask away - I'll be as accurate as possible (and will point you to more knowledgeable folks if I can't answer your questions).

One caveat that I give in all my AMAs - I'm not great on national security law. I know the basics on issues of military tribunals, jurisdictional issues, war powers, and executive privilege but questions of indefinite detention, torture, GITMO, and drone strikes are pretty foreign to me. I highly recommend the [Lawfare Blog](http://lawfareblog.com/) for all national security law related interests. The writers there are fantastic and unbelievably knowledgeable.

I *do* know the Espionage Act through my First Amendment forays, so I can answer Snowden related questions there.

One more caveat - I'm happy to dig in to the 2nd Amendment but will warn in advance that I'm not fluent in it. I can discuss the decisions that set the rules but most folks want me to make arguments and, while I can throw together law school quality arguments, I'd hardly call myself an authority, so take any answers to 2A questions with a grain of salt. Happy to talk about the constitutionality of gun control legislation as I see it, but again, I'm not an authority on this one.

**DISCLAIMERS, IMPORTANT NOTES, AND LEGALESE**


Nothing contained herein is or should be construed as legal advice. This is purely informational and made for educational purposes. I'm here because I believe educating people about our system is the best way to engage folks in protecting and improving the system. I'm not here to be your lawyer, nor could I legally give you advice even if I wanted to.

Also, I do my absolute best to keep my politics out of my commentary and my answers. Where I am giving an opinion or my interpretation, I will note it as best I can. The law, like many things, has many interpretations - some good, some bad. Opinions on case law are diverse and I'm not here to present a single truth, in fact I will do my best to display the diversity of opinion around particular areas of law.

1363802714.0,1780,self.IAmA,1aod7l,"I am ""allergic"" to sexual arousal, AMA",patient4,9216,7436,2292,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1aod7l/i_am_allergic_to_sexual_arousal_ama/,"I am a guy in my 20s. Ever since high school, I have had a condition called [chronic pelvic pain syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_prostatitis/chronic_pelvic_pain_syndrome). It’s essentially a constant ache in the pelvic/bladder area, just the way some people have chronic back pain or headaches. In my case it started gradually and without apparent cause.

A hallmark of this condition is that the pain gets [worse after orgasm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247725). I have this symptom too; in fact, over the years it has worsened to the point where **any sexual arousal (not just orgasm) can cause a flareup**. This can include such minor things as seeing a racy picture, having an attractive girl brush up against me, or simply thinking about a girl I like. This is as bad as it sounds. A few seconds or minutes of pleasure can result in hours, days, or weeks of increased pain.

I’ve tried, without success, every pelvic pain treatment in the book, from special diets, to physical therapy/stretching/relaxation regimens, to pain medications, to an implanted nerve stimulator. I have seen the very best urologists, neurologists, anesthesiologists, rheumatologists, physical therapists, psychiatrists, etc. All they can tell is that I probably have some rare disorder or injury to my autonomic or central nervous system.

So, the only way I have found to keep my pain from spiraling is to **strictly abstain from all sexual arousal**. This means no more sex, foreplay, kissing (or ANY romantic contact with women), or masturbation. No looking at women in a way that might arouse me (this means absolutely no porn, or even seeing women in revealing clothing). When an attractive girl walks by me on the street, I often have to avert my gaze to avoid getting aroused. And the most difficult part: no sexual thoughts. When I break these rules, I usually sorely regret it. The last time I had sex, I was in bad pain for over 2 weeks. So, I have not had sex (or masturbated, etc) in a very long time. My libido is high, so this requires every last bit of willpower I have.

Proof/evidence: I have scanned a few [excerpts](http://i.imgur.com/uzeqpzJ.png) from my medical records. Can post more if people are interested.

This condition causes me huge anguish. I feel I am in a mental prison, being starved emotionally. It’s tragic because before I got this condition, I was thriving in all aspects of my life and had huge ambitions that were cut short. I also went from having satisfying relationships with women, to hardly being able to date.

There are so many facets to this condition and its impact on my life, so rather than write everything out I’ll see what people want to know.

I’m putting this AMA out there because my rare condition and life situation may be of interest to some, and maybe some connections will be made that will someday help me or someone else.

**EDIT**: some FAQs:

My head hit the bottom of the pool, and two of my vertebra shattered. The broken vertebra damaged my spinal cord enough to leave me permanently paralyzed from the chest down. At that moment, my world fell apart, but I stayed as positive as I could be. My fiance at the time(now husband) was away on a camping trip with his family. When he heard the news, he rushed to the hospital, and never once left my side. In the following year, we appeared on various media outlets and talk shows together. It's been a very exhausting but interesting 3 years. 

At this point, more than anything, i really would like to work and have a sustainable income. It's incredibly hard to find a job that is compatible with my situation. Constant nerve pain, mobility issues, etc. For the time being, I speak at churches, organizations, and other various groups.

With the help of Internet freedom advocates, computer and legal experts, [the draft has been revised and is available here.](http://www.lofgren.house.gov/images/stories/pdf/aarons%20law%20revised%20draft%20013013.pdf) I have been in communication with Aaron’s father who supports this draft bill and approves of the name “Aaron’s Law.”

Like the first draft, this revised draft explicitly excludes breaches of terms of service or user agreements as violations of the CFAA and wire fraud statute.  This revised draft also makes clear that changing one's MAC or IP address is not in itself a violation of the CFAA or wire fraud statute.  In addition, this draft limits the scope of CFAA by defining ""access without authorization"" as the circumvention of technological access barriers.  Taken together, the changes in this draft should prevent the kind of abusive prosecution directed at Aaron Swartz and would help protect other Internet users from outsized liability for everyday activity.  

As our discussions have continued, it is clear that many believe a thorough revision of the CFAA and substantial reform of copyright laws are necessary.  I agree.  “Aaron’s Law” is not this complete overhaul, but is a first step down the road to comprehensive reform.  If we succeed in getting this draft bill enacted into law, it will be in honor of Aaron Swartz, and should be seen as a beginning of a concerted effort to bring reform to these broader issues.  To be successful, that effort will likely take substantial time and require sustained and intense support from all of you in a push that will need to exceed our stoppage of SOPA.  
 
I see “Aaron’s Law” as common sense fixes that should be enacted to stop the kinds of abuse Aaron was subjected to from affecting others.  I intend to introduce a final version of ""Aaron's Law"" as legislation soon, and in talking with my friend Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, I understand he wants to introduce it in the Senate as well. I will be urging my colleagues in the House of Reps to become cosponsors. The chances of success – whether for ""Aaron's Law"" or other proposals – will depend greatly on the degree of positive public engagement and support to change the law.  As SOPA showed, when the Internet speaks, lawmakers listen.  I think with enough constructive support we can have an opportunity to pass ""Aaron's Law.""

I suppose almost anything, except for questions about Gene Sledge, who I didn't know very well since he was in the mortars and I was a rifleman at the front of the line. I'm sure he was a swell marine, but I didn't even have a chance to know him because the mortars were about 75-100 yards behind us on the line (a few other riflemen and I were consultants on his book, though, and you can find my name in the acknowledgment, for what it's worth – which isn't much).

We are at 500 feet, 450 MPH, and only 18 inches apart from one another.  This is the opening of one of the most awesome demonstrations of American Airpower.  This is about the pride, precision, and power that your fellow Americans demonstrate every day as part of the world’s greatest and most respected air and space force.  This is a USAF Thunderbirds airshow.

Hey y’all.  I am Major Josh Boudreaux, Thunderbird #2, and I am excited to be able to chat with you today.  I am the left wingman for the Team and my job is to maintain formation position as close as 18 inches from the leader and back the commander up throughout the show with confirmatory radio calls as we transition between maneuvers.  I would not consider myself an adrenaline junky (my brother is a Hurricane Hunter pilot and I think he earned that designation), but I love flying anytime I can.  I was fortunate enough to attend the Air Force Academy, be on the wrestling team, fly and instruct as a glider pilot, compete as a cross-country glider pilot and jump out of airplanes with the parachute team.

I love my job (if you want to call it that), but I also enjoy spending my limited amount of down time with my three young sons and my beautiful wife.  I am a southern boy from Covington, Louisiana (40 miles north of Nawlins – New Orleans for non-locals).  I love to fish, hunt and spend time outdoors.  We have lived all over the country, in Asia and in Europe (7 places in all over the past 10 years).  My family and I have enjoyed the adventure the Air Force has provided us with.  I have flown over 3,000 hours, 100 combat missions and been to over 20 countries.

With that, I invite you to ASK ME ANYTHING!  Please feel free to share with me your thoughts and questions.

Hi! My name is Justin, I'm 25, and here is my episode of Pimp My Ride!

http://www.mtv.com/videos/pimp-my-ride-justins-97-toyota-rav4-full-episode-514/1567490/playlist.jhtml

-How long did it actually take them? 
Took 5 months to complete the car.

-Did you like what they did? 
At first, no. But I eventually got used to it. I also redid the whole car, added about $20,000 worth of things to it. You can see that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gYVfNoJJE)

-Did all the stuff actually work? 
They actually take out a lot of the stuff that they showed on TV. Such as the ""pop-up"" champagne, and the ""drive-in"" theater.

 
-Do you still have the car? 
Unfortunately, due to some wiring errors (work done by a completely different shop), it burned. You can see it happen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-q6Y8nn1iA).

-How did you get selected?
It was a casting call at GAS. There were over 200 cars in the parking lot, auditioning. I was requested to go to a final audition with 15 other people. There, I made a video of the car, and from there, they sent it to the producers. A week later they called me back to start shooting. I was in competition with the other 15 contestants. So whoever made the best video would be the one getting their car pimped. In reality, it wasn't true. All of the other ""contestants"" got their rides pimped anyways.

Hi guys!  Greetings from the USAF Thunderbirds!!! I'm Captain Jason ""Jaws"" Curtis, Thunderbird #6 and I'm stoked to be here to chat with you! As one of the new guys on the Team, I fly as the Opposing Solo where I get to showcase the maximum power of the F-16 Fighting Falcon while flying upside down just a few feet above the ground. (Of course, this is easier to do when our team is not sequestered.) 

It is a thrill to watch the crowd jump after the famous 'Sneak Pass', but don't be mistaken; there is a lot more to being a Thunderbird than just performing at air shows. I am a combat fighter pilot who has served in Korea, Afghanistan, and Libya. 

While not at work, I enjoy racing my '68 Camaro and playing the drums. I named my Thunderbird #6 aircraft after my baby daughter, Aurora. I am from a small town in Montana called Kalispell.

With that being said, I invite you to ASK ME ANYTHING! Please feel free to share with me your thoughts and questions. Get ready for a fun AMA session!

My whole life I have been a big person. I was teased as a kid, very cruelly... I never understood why I couldn't be left alone.. Even my family, teachers and doctors constantly made comments about my weight. So in order to be left alone, I tried hiding in plain sight. Ya know, made jokes about myself being fat, how I was ugly etc. 
But it just seemed to make things worse. I once in a rare occasion tried throwing up my own food. I hated who I was and I so desperately just wanted to change and love myself.

So I did.

I went on the internet, checked out books from the library, asked people who worked out regularly questions, and looked up tons of information about how the body works and what I can do to change, and if there truly was hope for me... Or if I was just a lost cause.
After I completely surrounded myself with as much knowledge as I possibly could, I constructed a diet and workout regimen to start out with. 
I lost 20 pounds very quickly at the start.
Soon I lost 40 pounds.. Then before I knew it 60 pounds had vanished.. 
By this time, the teasing and insults had turned to praise and compliments.
After months and months of intense training, eating healthy, and sticking to my goal... 

I made it... I'm 210.

I worked out at the YMCA pretty regularly and I knew the whole staff, so I was recommended by one of the trainers that I be put on staff. After a series of interviews, I was put on staff as a personal trainer. 
I couldn't believe it. Me... The fat kid everyone picked on, a personal trainer.

How old and how tall am I?: I'm 18 years old and I am 5'11.

How can you be certified? Are you certified? Yes, I am I have my ISSA certification and im certified through the YMCA

What have you learned out of this experience? Ive learned that there is no excuse. If you want to achieve something.. Do it. No one's going to hand ANYTHING to you on a silver plate.

Do you blame your parents? No, I blame the fact that no information was given to them about healthy lifestyles. And I blame myself for not doing this sooner. 

Does your skin bother you? I get self conscious at times, but hey. Dont we all?

How's the love life? Great! I got the girl of my dreams.

How can I do this? Ive said it before and i'll say it again.. Be your own Personal Trainer! Be responsoble for youself, and prioritize whats important to you. You have the power to do anything.. I mean look at me. I was just some fat kid a few years ago.

I think having a chance to talk to the man who oversaw both the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war would be a fascinating historical insight.

EDIT: I just sent this email to a few related organisations, now we wait I guess.

To who it may concern,

Hello, my name is X. I am a student in my first year of university with a keen interest in international politics and sustainable development. I am also an active member of one of the largest user driven internet forums in the world, Reddit. The site is divided up into many discreet sections (sub-reddits) that focus on different areas of interest. One of these sections, IAMA, is designed for users to be able to directly ask questions to notable public figures.
The style is that of an open forum, where a comment’s visibility is determined by the amount of positive or negative votes that other users give it. This process means that the most relevant and interesting questions will float to the top of the thread to be answered by the public figure. Such public figures have included:

President Barack Obama

Former Vice President Al Gore

Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger

…and many more

But not all of these AMA threads (Ask Me Anything) are authored by big names. There was recently a fascinating thread posted by a former citizen of the USSR, he described in detail what life was like under Communist Rule, and mused on the ideas of how things have changed. After the success of this particular Q&amp;A session I thought how interesting it would be to hear how the country was run from the man who at one point ran it.
So this is why I am sending this email, today I posted an AMA request for Mikhail Gorbachev on Reddit. It is currently one of the most popular posts in the IAMA section. I, and the other users of the site, would be extremely grateful to have the chance to directly talk to the man who was active in the very highest levels of the Soviet Union. Reddit has a user base in the tens of millions, and an “Ask Me Anything” thread by Mr Gorbachev would be a fantastic opportunity to spread his ideas and experiences with a huge amount of people. It would also be a fabulous historical experience for younger users to be able to directly talk to the last leader of the Soviet Union.

I am not sure exactly who this message will reach, but if you have a chance to put the idea to Mr. Gorbachev, please let me know if he would like to partake in a Q&amp;A session like the ones posted above. I hope you are in agreement with me when I say that this would be a great experience for all involved.

Looking forward to your response,

Здравствуйте,
Меня зовут X, я студент первого курса и очень увлекаюсь международной политикой и устойчивым экономическим развитием. Также я - активный член одного из крупнейших интернет-форумов в мире, Reddit. Это веб-сайт разделён на несколько разделов (под-reddit), фокусирующихся на разных областях интересов. Один из этих разделов, IAMA, придуман специально для того, чтобы пользователи могли в письменной форме задать вопросы напрямую выдающимся общественным деятелям. Это происходит в стиле открытого форума, где заметность вопроса пользователя определяется количеством положительных или отрицательных голосов, полученных от других пользователей. Этот процесс приводит к тому, что самые существенные и интересные вопросы появляются вверху всей дискуссии, чтобы быть замеченными и получить письменный ответ от общественного деятеля. Среди таких деятелей уже были:

Президент США Барак Обама,

Бывший вице-президент Эл Гор,

Губернатор Калифорнии Арнольд Шварценеггер,

...и многие другие.

Но не все AMA-дискуссии (от ""Ask Me Anything"" - ""спрашивайте меня что угодно"") начаты известными людьми. Не так давно удивительная и очень интересная дискуссия была начата одним из бывших граждан СССР. В ней он детально описывал, какова была жизнь при коммунизме, и размышлял о том, как всё изменилось. Именно после успеха этой дискуссии я подумал, как интересно было бы услышать о том, как управлялось это государство, от человека, который сам им управлял. Вот почему я пишу это письмо - сегодня я создал AMA-запрос на Reddit, предложение провести такую дискуссию для Михаила Горбачёва. В данный момент это один из популярнейших запросов в разделе IAMA. Я, как и другие пользователи этого веб-сайта, был бы в высшей степени благодарен иметь возможность напрямую пообщаться с человеком, действовавшим на самых высоких уровнях Советского Союза. Количество пользователей Reddit исчисляется десятками миллионов, и ""Ask Me Anything""-дискуссия господина Горбачёва была бы фантастической возможностью поделиться его идеями и опытом с огромным количеством людей. А возможность напрямую пообщаться с последним лидером Советского Союза была бы изумительным историческим переживанием для молодых пользователей Reddit.

Я не вполне уверен, кому именно придёт это сообщение, но если у Вас есть возможность донести эту идею до господина Горбачёва, пожалуйста, сообщите мне, хотел ли бы он принять участие в такой дискуссии в виде вопросов и ответов, как описано выше. Я надеюсь, Вы согласитесь со мной в том, что это было бы замечательным опытом для всех участников.

С нетерпением жду ответа,

С наилучшими пожеланиями,

I too had to wear the eye patch of shame. (It did come in handy as a respirator when carving pumpkins...) I knew that I didn't see like everyone else, but I never knew that there was a possible treatment for it. My vision basically worked by trading dominant eyes depending on which direction I was looking. If I looked to the far left, my right eye would take over and the left one would kind of go into a standby mode where the whole field of vision it took in was like peripheral vision. If I looked to the far right, my eyes would seamlessly trade rolls. I could voluntarily switch which one was dominant, but they couldn't work at the same time. I had what is known as esotropia.

well, hope this goes better... AMA

EDIT: spelling

EDIT: going to take a little break now, its 4 AM here but i will answer all your questions in like 4 hours. thanks for now, i just love this, be back soon, feel free to ask anything

EDIT 3: couldnt sleep so am back.

EDIT 4: wao frontpage!! by the way sorry for the grammar errors, english its not my first language. hope my answers are good enough to understand :/

EDIT 5: common question: there are no published reports of recovery of nuerologic function after the diagnosis of brain death using the criteria reviewed in the 1995 American academy of neurology practice parameter. 

EDIT 6: i will spend today answering the remaining question that i haven't answered yet. P.S: i didnt mean to refer to the donors with ""it"" to objectify them, it just got lost in translation and i ve been corrected. another thing, i haven't heard about doctors making less of an effort to heal donors before, guess is an american thing or just an urban legend, don't see how a doctor could do that to a patient and the diagnostic criteria is really hard to meet with absolutly no false positive reported in the litarature yet. Give me some time and i will answer your questions, if i dont answer to you directly is because it was asked before you came in and i recomend you read all the comments, thanks for all the support and nice questions, this has been a great oportunity to talk to patients and nice people, thanks.

EDIT 6: am kind of surprised that some people are judging my surgical skills based on my command of the english language, you are going like""ok, he just told how to perform a repair of a transposition of the great vessels in 2 min, but am calling bullshit because he spelled putrid wrong, come on guys! Am also on an iphone...

EDIT 7: a lot of comments about zolpidem's new found ability to improve patients with brain injuries, i doubt this would work in organ donors that are brain dead, if you dont get blood to your brain you couldn't get a drug to your brain either. its intresting but there still evidence to be obtained and it needs to be peer-rewieved before we find out if it really works. also now days everybody is a especialist and decissions are made by a multidiciplinary team, the surgeon can't know everything and make every decission, thats what the rest of the team are for, and i am sure that when and if zolpidem's ability is well stablished the neurophysiologist in my team would be aware of it as i am aware of new surgical techniques they don't know about yet.

EDIT 8: hey everybody...nods are actually knots

EDIT 9: no longer relevant things

EDIT 10: thanks for being here, hope i could make some people aware that donors are needed, become a donor if you wish something good to come from something bad, try to make a difference in someone elses life. You have a big problem in USA and most countries in E.U were people don't want to become donors and patients have to be implanted with machines for long periods of time and poor quality of life and high risk of complications. This two AMAs have been an intent to bring closer to the people this problem and the people involved in it and humanize the surgeons and other personal involved, know that we feel about you but are glad an happy that together we can help many people out there that really need help. Thanks for asking questions and good bye.

EDIT 11: for last i want to adress the title of the AMA since i have gotten well deserved comments claiming that the title is missleading since braindead patients are considered dead in medical terms even if their organs keep working with life support and drugs. First i apologize if this confussed you or made you feel bad in anyway. but thinking about it i think someone would allways have a problem with this AMA no matter what its name was. WHY? you ask, lets see, if a called it ""i collect or harvest or procure organs from dead donors"" (that would be the pragmatic medical definition), when people found out they were brain dead, some people would eventually comment they still have some life in them, no matter what the correct definition of brain death is, and they wouldn't be completly wrong. if it was called ""i harvest hearts from brain dead patients"" it would have been probably be the more suitable name, but similar debates would have happen. i picked the title that i taught best described what i wanted to get across the room and that is that this patients hearts are beating and they still have vital signs, and their organs are working in their majority. I also wanted to get across that this is the only case in witch you can legally do something to a patient that would directly end all vital signs and advancing or precipitating the patients death, i just don't take them off life support and wait for the inevitable to happen on its own, we in an active manner stop this people's hearts and end the activity of all remaining organs and make the patients unable to live even on lifesupport like they did before. maybe i could have chosen a more suitable title? probably yes, but what i could'nt have done was picking a title that wouldn't cause commotion or controversy. i suggest if you are intrested you read the whole AMA because all remaing questions are answerd and clarified inside. you can keep posting questions if you are not satisfied, i will continue to answer them as long as reddit allows me to keep posting here. thanks and bye

In 1997 I started Slashdot.org. For several years, we pioneered news aggregation and on-line communities while exploring our niche of the 'net under the slogan, ""News for Nerds, Stuff that Matters.""  Our work was later expanded upon at countless other more successful sites including Reddit and the Huffington Post.


I left Slashdot last year, took a long time off, and then started work at the Washington Post Co's WaPo Labs… their digital media R&amp;D skunkworks group.  I work as their Chief Strategist and Editor-at-Large, contributing what I can to a variety of projects ranging from their Social Reader, to some projects under development. From here I am able to continue to explore my interests in news, journalism, technology, and communities.

We started last Thursday night, when I was too tired to go on:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uta5q/iama_terminally_ill_43_year_old_husband_and/
Then, we found out my ICD was malfunctioning and got it fixed:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uy25t/iama_the_43_year_old_terminally_ill_husband_and/

And because my heart appeared to be getting stronger, that brought us to yesterday.
I went into the hospital to have an echocardiogram done.  Much like an ultrasound, they examine my chest with a transducer and take measurements to determine how much blood my heart is pumping, which led to the tech saying:  ""What did they tell you your ejection fraction was?""  I told him ""It was 10%, then 20-30, then back to 20 for a long time.""  The tech then said ""Well, I gotta tell you, I'm seeing it being much better here, but we'll wait for the doctor to look at it and determine the final numbers.""  That report hasn't come back yet.
They then sent me to radiology, where I was injected with a radioactive tracer for another test.  After sitting in a wheelchair for a while, I was taken for a cardiac stress test.  It did not go well.  I was given a drug that was supposed to stress my heart so they could take readings on how it performs.  Some people have a reaction to this drug.  I...am one of them.  I began vomiting violently.  Someone held me upright while another person put a basin in front of my mouth.  The doctor started calling out times, and someone kept taking my blood pressure.  I was not hearing good numbers, but was too busy trying to stay conscious, and vomiting constantly.  Eventually, I think a year later, the doctor said ""I'm going to give you the antidote now.""  WTF?  The antidote...now????  After they put it in my IV, I stopped vomiting, but felt as well as you can imagine.
Here are the results of that test:
Protocol Lexiscan
Time In Exercise Phase 30 S
Max Heart Rate 97 BPM
Max Predicted Heart Rate 177 BPM
Max. Systolic BP 142 mmHg
Max Diastolic BP 64 mmHg
Max Work Load 10
Symptom:   Negative -  Hypotensive Response
ECG:   Negative
Chronotropic Response:   Abnormal
Pretest Probability:   Intermediate
I have not one clue what any of it means.  All I understand is ""hypotensive"" and ""abnormal.""
So they took me back and almost immediately began the nuclear scan.  Cool, I laid there, some huge machine made a lot of noise and moved around a lot, and then I was told to rest, don't be around pregnant women, small kids, the elderly, and not get angry, because no one would like it when I was angry (the last is my own embellishment.)
These are the results of that test:
1. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%, just below normal limits.
2. No reversible perfusion defects identified to suggest stress-induced 
myocardial ischemia. 
3. Small fixed apical defect which may relate to physiologic apical 
thinning versus myocardial scar.
In case anybody missed it, my ejection fraction is now **49%**.  49.2, to be exact.  *My heart has more than doubled it's function, *  **and is now just below normal limits.**

I have spent the day speaking with my cardiologist, who confirms this is ""a miracle.""  That it testifies to the viral nature of my heart damage, but it's healing now, after so much time, to be nigh impossible.  They have reduced one of my cardiac meds, my carvedilol, by half.  I have been told I can start light exercise.  It was offered that my ICD could be removed if I wanted, *because I don't need it anymore.*

This will be my last post as thatdyingguy.  Because I'm not.  Despite coming to the end of my rope; of nearly letting go...in eight days, my life has been given back to me.  I'm crying as I type this now.  I still have CHF.  That's not good.  But...this.  This!  My son and daughters will keep their father.  My wife will keep her husband.  I no longer have to fear a loud noise, or eating something with cholesterol or caffeine.  We're going to have a lobster dinner tonight (if my arteries clogged at all, I was told I would be dead.  Period.) to celebrate.  I am going to sleep tonight, not in fear of dying, but in hope of what tomorrow can bring.  I troubled about spamming Reddit for the third time in a week.  I was told by my friend Aubrey to post.  That soooo many people were drawing hope from my story, that they would be blown away by what has happened.  I hope you are, because I certainly am.  Don't ever, *ever*, **ever** lose hope.  Any of you.

Edit 2, the Wrath of Khan:  I had to go talk to friends and family all afternoon and am going to be going to dinner soon.  I will try to get to everybody.  I swear it.  Also, I can't believe that right now, at this moment, I am ahead of MC Frontalot, who is one of my favorite rappers.  Listen to his stuff!  It is often mistaken for novelty music, but it is not.  :)  

Edit 3:  Going to dinner!  Back later or tomorrow, depending on how happy my wife is tonight.

Edit 4:  The last you'll hear from thatdyingguy:  A lot of people have drawn hope from my story, but it's still being written.  I have CHF, which means my diet, my fluids, everything will have to be monitored for the rest of my life, and will likely be what kills me.  Even though my heart has apparently been strong for some time, I am getting weaker.  I don't know if that's because of the strain on my entire heart, or maybe the extra weight...I don't know.  All I know is some days I can't get out of bed, I'm so weak.  I have pain all the time, still, even with an increase in my ejection fraction.  I am not well.  I am still very,very sick.  I may still die, and very soon.  But I beat viral cardiomyopathy.  And that's a fact.  I wish I could answer the rest of you.  But thatdyingguy is going away.  Good luck to all of you.

After that was over we hit a different bar to keep the party going. We stayed there til they stopped serving alcohol. On our way out, we were confronted by a group of 7-8 guys who said one of us mugged them. We tried to talk it out but they wouldnt have it. A fight broke out and they ganged up on my best friend while our other friend and I tried to get them off him. They beat him into a bloody mess. When they finished with him they shifted their rage to the next closest target: me. Before they could jump me I remembered I had my EDC Kershaw knife on me(3.5 inch blade, clipped to my front pocket). Without hesitation I pulled it out and struck the first one of them that attacked me. The fight ended immediately. In the chaos that ensued, I tried to gather my group and get them into my car to make a get away. The police showed up almost immediately.

FAQ:
This happened in East San Jose in California.  
I was 24. I am 25 now.  
The knife was a legal(in my county, anyway) 3.5 inch blade Kershaw Crown.  
The knife was ordered to be destroyed.  
I payed about $5,000. for bail and other expenses.  
The attackers were NOT charged or even arrested. I dont know why. Truthfully, I no longer care.  
I dont have an opinion on gun control, the Zimmerman case, the CA or US justice system.  
I was arrested because I confessed to stabbing a man. The police dont judge the event. That happens in court.  
He did NOT die.  
I stabbed him just left of his belly button.

EDITx5: I think I've gotten to everyone. Feel free to post again if you feel you didn't get a good enough answer, but for now, it's four in the morning, and thus, bedtime. After a nine hour AMA and over 28 000 comment karma... good night, and thanks to everyone that posted questions!

**Edit:** Disclaimer/Explanation. Ian is a close relative of mine, he (as others have done in the past iirc) did the AMA 'through' me, he wasn't directly typing the questions in himself but he was reading them himself and responding, responses which I then typed into the AMA the mods told me I could do this prior and it's also what he wanted to do. I thought that AMA's typically only lasted for ~1hour/1.5 hours and had no idea it was expected to go on for quite a bit longer than that.  Due to time he (or I) couldn't attend for that long, had I known I probably would have waited for sometime later next month when he was more likely to have time available. So in this case; please DO shoot the messenger as the slight confusion was all my fault, I probably should have educated myself on AMAs before pitching the idea to him.

FAQs:

1) Boy scouts look good. Eagle scout looks better. I don't like the boy scouts personally, but I like what you've likely gained as a result of your experiences with them. 

2) For home schooled applicants, we typically look more at standardized test grades such as the SAT, ACT, SAT II, AP, etc.

3) I'm not going to tell you which school I work for, sorry!

4) If your school doesn't offer X amounts of APs, we'll know that when your school sends us a secondary school report, so dont worry. If your school offers 2, for example, and you took both, we'll see that as ""Oh, he/she did all the rigorous work he/she could""

5) Your 5,000 hours of community service look good, don't worry

We're the [Starry Expanse team](http://www.starryexpanse.com/what-is-starry-expanse/), a group of people from around the world that has spent the past few years working on a realtime 3D version of the classic 1997 point-and-click game, *RIVEN: The Sequel to MYST*.

It's been a long, risky journey since we started out in a legal grey zone, but just recently the company that made *MYST* and *RIVEN* — Cyan Worlds — told us we have their official blessing to continue the project. Even better, they’ve informed us that they may be able to provide further assistance as our work progresses.

[Here’s an in-game look](http://i.imgur.com/ZxtqB.png) at some of our newest work.

Answering your questions today will be five team members: 

* Max “Zib Redlektab” Batchelder (Boston)
* Everett Gunther (Memphis)
* Matthew Sampson (Connecticut)
* Philip Peterson (Orlando)
* Nick “Shimmey” Mower (Adelaide, Australia)

My name is Spencer Campbell, I'm a US Peace Corps volunteer and I'm here with some students and teachers from Amos Okrah SDA middle school in Ghana. The school serves a community of about 2000 people and most people in this village make their living weaving Kente cloth.

If you'd like to help our school out, please donate to our School Excursion Project here. https://donate.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=donate.contribute.projDetail&amp;projdesc=13-641-025 

We are hoping to make a trip down to the coast (about a 5 hour trip by bus) to see some of Ghana's famous tourist sites and tour one of Ghana's premier universities. Most of the students here have never been further than a few miles from their hometown and a poor rural school would never be able to pay for a trip like this without outside support.

I'm here with teachers Peter Boateng (IT Teacher) and Emelia Asante (English Teacher) and students Theresa, Sekyere, Isaac, Prince, Gloria, Micheal, Felix, Janet and Juliana.

Ask us Anything! 

EDIT Wed 15:55 GMT - Sent the students home for dinner, they'll be back in an hour or so. I'll continue to answer your questions.

EDIT 2 Wed 21:00 GMT - Sorry for the delay, kids are all home for the night but I'll be around for a few more hours answering your questions tonight and a few tomorrow morning (if my power stays on) All who PM'd, I promise responses are coming. Those interested in Peace Corps service, please PM so I can tell you to do it over and over again (and answer your questions). Also, please contribute to my grant so your real life karma can get a boost. You all rock.

-What was your main inspiration for Portlandia?
Working on projects with Carrie.  That turned into making videos which then turned into the show.  Our surroundings in Portland became the setting.
-How much of your material do you write for your SNL skits?
I write with other writers there.  It's the most fun, getting to collaborate with smart and funny people.
-Is it amazing playing the most well-known parody of the President?
I love doing it.  
-Are most Portlandia characters based on people you've met?
For some reason, it's the other way around.  We make people up, then somehow we see them walking around.  Or biking around.
-Who have been the best hosts on SNL while you've been on the show?
So many and for different reasons.  I like ex-SNL cast members.  Like, Molly Shannon for example.  I get star struck.  I watched them on this show.

I will be on from 9am-5pm CST like Reddit is my JOB :-) So here goes! Recently my life has been turned upside down, but in the best way possible. I grew up being so heavily bullied that at 13yo I discovered my ULTIMATE dream was to become a fighter in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. So I set out pursuing that. I won multiple National Championships in wrestling... Then at 19yo I started fighting professionally... At 21-22 I was the youngest fighter on the reality tv show The Ultimate Fighter ""Heavyweights"" with guys like Kimbo Slice, Rashad Evans, &amp; Rampage Jackson. ***Here's why Canseco don't want none***  http://i.imgur.com/uHkT3Ao.jpg
 

Then my life took a crazy turn. Fighting against people didn't fulfill me like I hoped so I found myself as a depressed, drunk, drug addict... So bad I missed being the best man at my best friends wedding and I attempted suicide just over 3 years ago. Now, humbly and excitedly I can say I have COMPLETELY overcome that! I have put those childhood dreams on hold and now I have gone from fighting AGAINST people to fighting FOR people. 

Now I am on a pursuit to love people in maybe the most dark, destitute, and dangerous country on the planet. In the last year and a half I've gone DEEP in the Congo jungle to spend two months with the Mbuti Pygmy people... Maybe the most despised people group on the planet. Pygmy translated to some means ""Elbow Height"" because their men stand ONLY 4 foot 7 on average. In recent years some of the tribe has been hunted, killed, cooked, and eaten. The UN confirmed it, BBC, The Guardian, and CNN reported it. Then in August &amp; September of 2012 I partnered with the oldest university in Congo and their School of Community Development. What I didn't know, was their last EIGHT years of negotiations was about to pay off... BIG! 

We saw 60 Pygmy men, women, and children SLAVES be set FREE! Placed on their own land, that they own, for the FIRST time in history. We got an agriculturalist from the school to stay and teach the oldest nomadic, hunter gatherer tribe on the planet how to farm. Since then a ripple effect has occurred. We have seen over 120 slaves be set FREE on 60 acres of land and they are getting ready for their SECOND harvest! Now I have been made family with the tribe... They named me Efeosa, meaning: ""The Man Who Loves Us."" I'm getting ready to leave for the Congo jungle for a full year. ***Now I have decided to really get some skin in the game and put my life on the line.*** 

I will sleep in twig and leaf huts, sleep on the dirt, and when it rains in the rainforest I will sink into the mud like my last trip. (huts http://i.imgur.com/8RD1PKV.jpg) The Congolese University and my goal is to see 1,000 slaves be set FREE and DEVELOPED into a fully self-sustainable people on hundreds of acres of land.

BEST THING SO FAR FROM THIS AMA: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x4rvy/iama_former_playboy_model_turned_hardcore_adult/c5j9tgx

EDIT 1: Holy balls! Sooooo many Q's! I promise they will all get A'd before the day is over. It's overwhelming but i'l push through. I'll take a short break soon and eat and then post some pictures. 

EDIT 2: I didn't mean I was taking a break NOW....jeez....I'm still going strong. Also....if you want pictures I have to take a break eventually to take the pictures. Don't worry...we'll have it all today! Fun times. Everyone just stay cool and remember: We're all friends here to have fun. :)

EDIT 3: Yes, I play video games. Yes, I have favorites, such as: BIOSHOCK (all of them), DARKNESS II, SKYRIM, SAINTS ROW 3, SILENT HILL (all of them, some more than others), BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY, MARIO KART, CoD (all of them...and yes, I'll beat your ass.)

EDIT 4: What do my parents/friends/family think of my career choices: My Mom knows but we don't discuss it. She's supportive though. My Dad knows I do nude modelling but it's too awkward to discuss any more than that. He's also very loving and supportive. No one has cut me off or been nasty to me as a result of my career choices. 

EDIT 5: How do I feel about the negative/bad/degrading parts of the industry: I've chosen to do (mostly) only videos that don't oppress or degrade women. It's been a conscious choice and while I have done some things that I know don't follow the above sentiment, I've done those mostly to appease multiple requests from fans. The fans make a career possible so I like to accommodate when I can. 
Do I think it's a job for every girl? Hell no. You have to be very strong willed to not succumb to the obvious pressures you'll get some everyone in the industry.
I have so many conflicting thoughts on this....it's one of the main topics I hope to address if I ever get a podcast up and running. 

EDIT 6: No, I won't tell you how much money I make....it's not polite to discuss numbers. 

EDIT 7: Favorite Doctor Who? Was Tennant but since I've met and partied with Matt Smith he's that top of my list. What a wonderful guy he was. 

EDIT 8: Does size matter? Anything 5 inches or over is perfectly fine. 9 inches and up is too big. Girth matters most. Small and thick is a lot better than 30 inches long and thin as a pencil.

AMA!,cyberstalked,13101,11436,2322,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hkeok/i_got_my_anonymous_cyberstalker_of_15_years/,"Hey Reddit!


As this case is still going through the court system, I prefer to remain as anonymous as possible. I sent proof to the mods by showing my ID, a copy of my Order of Protection, a copy of a syllabus I used as a college adjunct, and a screen shot of my stalker's charges that were posted online. [They've verified this proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hkeok/i_got_my_anonymous_cyberstalker_of_15_years/cav6qj2) and you can also quasi-verify by checking out the posts I made about this [in r/askreddit one year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s9va3/ive_been_cyberstalked_for_8_months_police_wont/) and [in r/privacy when I was in the midst of everything just a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1889gy/i_want_to_identify_my_psychoticviolent/).

**The basic story:**

I'm a female adjunct professor who TA'd for a course 2 years ago. That summer I received disturbing, violent, suicidal, and affectionate text messages from an unknown number. This soon progressed to email messages, facebook messages, and then every social networking site I was connected to. The more I blocked the incoming messages or deleted myself off the internet, the more the stalker persisted and found new ways to get to me, e.g. by emailing and facebook messaging/stalking my roommate, close friends and family and threatening to kill them if I didn't come back online or respond. The stalker soon learned of my home address, my family's home address, and threatened to physically harm me by coming to my apartment, tying a rope around my neck, and ""taking me away.""


I continued monitoring just my old inactive facebook account to keep the stalker preoccupied. Eventually, the stalker got sloppy and started sending me messages about college course-related information. I did my own investigative work with this information and worked with my college to identify the stalker as a former student of mine from a course I TA'd in 2011. The college called her in for a meeting to discuss her academic standing, my case, and other behavior issues she was having, but she was difficult and refused to attend. In the meantime, she, the stalker, sent me a message saying that she wanted to ""shoot up"" the school and discussed how she was going to steal her uncle's guns so that she could come and do it when she came in for the meeting. I informed me school and my detective and she was arrested. She spent 2 nights in jail, was ROR'd, and me and my roommate were given orders of protection.



AMA, and I'm just sitting at a desk all day today so I can answer questions all day long.

Here are some things I'd love to talk about:

- more details/particulars about my stalker's behavior, about the case, and my experience with it all
- anonymity/privacy on the internet
- the actual privacy level of social networking sites
- the law around stalking and harassment / privacy
- police mentality around these cases
- tracking a stalker: personal and legal documentation/reporting


**Edit:** Hey guys! Loving all your questions - and I'm still here (12:26 PM EST). Keep 'em coming. I'll get to as many as I can!

**Edit 2:** Wow guys, so many good questions. I wish I could get to you all. I will try to answer them over the next couple of days too if I don't get to yours. Also, there are a lot of repeat questions! So please look at my user page to see the responses I have already given to make it easier to track what's been asked/said. I'm still here answering (1:39 PM EST). Also, just a few points/clarifications:

**Edit 3:** Still here (3:00 PM EST). I'm out at 6:00 though! And will try to answer as many as I can in the next few days. Thanks for all your questions everyone. And the PMs - Glad to hear all your stories and offer my support/advice!

**Edit 4:** Done for the day everyone. I'll keep checking this to try to get to any more questions in the next couple days, as promised. Thanks again for all of your great questions. I will update when I have more on the sentencing.

*Why would I do this AMA if the case is ongoing?* - A news reporter recently wanted to run a story on this case. I refused to comment because I didn't want it to get misinterpreted and I didn't want my name to be attached to my comments (for my stalker to easily find/see). Instead I'm taking my story into my own hands and using as a moment to educate anonymously. Yes, an AMA is very public and potentially risky (although my identity is nowhere here), but I am willing to take the risk if it means informing people about this topic. This is an issue that can potentially affect everyone. I did nothing to intentionally provoke my stalker and that is the case for most stalking cases. My number one goal is to help others going through this or help prevent it from happening to YOU. I hope it proves useful.

*What's next?* - Some people have requested I update you when she goes to court and is actually sentenced. I promise to do that.

I had to be cleared by a psychologist to make sure I wasn't crazy, and also got my own lawyer (I paid for none of this).

The medical process was this:

After going on birth control for about a month, I stopped and for about a month I injected myself daily with hormones (right beneath the belly button). I took about two hours of public transportation to get to the clinic where I was being monitored, which was a slightly difficult near the end, as I am a full time student and I was going in almost every day, ha. Basically, they would take my blood to check how the hormones were doing, and give me an ultrasound to check on my eggs. The hormones make your ovaries become super fertile, so there are tens of eggs that become really large. The week before and after the surgery I was very bloated and it hurt to move much.

The surgery involved no cuts, just a needle up there. They did put me under. And I got to keep the purple surgery socks they gave me.

My spending habits have not changed, except for the fact that I put ten grand into a Roth IRA, donated about 1k to charity, and buy delicious expensive things like raspberries and chai tea slightly more often. 

No regrets so far.

.A little about myself 


I have been competing for the last 4 years as a Natural Bodybuilder and coaching others around nutrition and training since 2011.

[This is what I look like today] (http://i.imgur.com/YcHpoMs.jpg)

[This is what I looked like last year] (http://i.imgur.com/TJYmj2Q.jpg)

[This is what i looked like 4 years ago] (http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg)

[This was 6 months after I started working out] (http://i.imgur.com/DJ6JwlI.jpg)


**Stats**

Age: 24
Resides: Toronto, Canada
Contest Weight: 165lbs
Off-Season Weight: 180lbs
Height: 5’7 
Marital Status: Married

My outlook on health and fitness has changed dramatically since I first started in 2008, going from the TRADITIONAL HARDCORE or nothing mentality to more of a balanced and flexible approach to training and nutrition. Now I can actually live life lol. 

Here is some insight :

**3-5 years Ago** 

*Training: 3x a week, ONLY Chest and Arms, 5-10 sets of 10 reps.

*Nutrition: 2 meals a day, fruit in the morning and whatever I wanted for dinner.

*Philosophy: If I miss a meal or workout its ALL OVER, no going out with friends and supplements are drugs. 
 
*Progress Pics 
http://i.imgur.com/DJ6JwlI.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg

**1-2 years Ago**

*Training: Each body part 1x/week, Train to failure on all sets, train body parts equally, 20-30 sets 6-12 reps, Cardio 7 days a week 1 hour a day.

*Nutrition: 6 Meals a day, Only Chicken, White Fish, Sweet Potato, Brown Rice, Green Veggies. No counting macro nutrients just the type of food. 

*Philosophy: Go hard or go home. If I don't struggle then I havent worked. If I miss a meal or workout I am a failure but keep going until you are PERFECT. I need my supplements at all times, have to bring my food everywhere I go, so tired I could not function after 7pm, didnt care about nothing but bodybuilding.

http://i.imgur.com/O8MRJbQ.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/TJYmj2Q.jpg


**Over the last 6 months** 

*Training : Daily Undulating Periodization Training model, switching between power, hypertrophy and strength workouts during the week, Monday/Wednesday/Friday upper body Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday Lower Body, Cardio 4x a week totally 2.5 hours (mix between HIIT and LISS)

*Nutrition : Flexible Dieting, counting and tracking macronutrients to determine intake, eating any food I want within the macronutrient profile I am following, making and eating healthy alternatives to the food I love , not being bound to eating at certain times and certain types of food, making sure solid amounts of fiber and micronutrient intake.
 
*Philosophy: Live a balanced life, striving for perfection leads you down the road of failure, you have to give yourself a buffer zone to sustain over the long term, don't let health and fitness dominate my life. Strive for excellence in multiple areas of life.

I want to share what I have learned through my experiences with the health and fitness community so hopefully people can live a more balanced life while still striving towards their health and fitness goals. 

That's why I started Live Young Dream Big. To challenge the ideology of Perfection and share through my own life The Less Than Perfect Approach to a balanced life.

Cochlear implants are looked down upon by many in the deaf community/culture as its seen as ""trying to become hearing"" and the thought that it would destroy ASL (which I'm proficient in.) The decision to get them myself was a very hard choice but I did it for my children, who are hearing, like the rest of my family.

Due to being able to wear hearing aids while growing up I got to experience both cultures as my entire family is hearing and I spent time in a program called Total Communication where we first learned SEE (Signing Exact English) and various speech therapy classes. We eventually switched to ASL and I also attended the Michigan School For The Deaf.

Edit: 3:30 pm. Just woke up from a nap &amp; my step brother is still asleep. What fucking woke me up was sleep paralysis. I saw the 'thing' while sitting on top of me what feels like a 20 lbs of weight trying to suck life out of me, and a transparent white form of my step-brother also sitting on him, trying to cover his mouth &amp; nose. I was not able to move or speak as I wanted to yell ""Mark, help. Fucking. Sleep. Paralysis!"" As he was nearby. That didn't work. I also had auditory sounds from it for the first time. Scary shit. I then woke Mark up and told him what happened.
Anyways- I'm back to reading new replies &amp; answering any questions I've missed. Keep the questions coming! My step brother and I throughly ejoyed it! :)

1373472487.0,1634,self.IAmA,1i0jh7,IAMA architect who's main interest is high efficiency affordable homes - AMA.,Logan_Chicago,3308,1674,1208,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/,"**WHY:**

This was started after I replied to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz11mm) and [a few people asked for an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz7v4h).

**WHAT I DO:**

Currently I work for an architecture firm in Chicago. Previously I worked for an [architectural engineer](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/02/picturequote.html) who designed the mechanical systems for some of the most energy efficient buildings in Chicago. ([1](http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2009/07/going-net-zerofor-effect-1stofitskind-home-in-chicago-will-produce-as-much-energy-as-it-uses.html), [2](http://www.dbhms.com/portfolio/green/green-03.html), [3](http://inhabitat.com/harmony-house-cat-shelter-is-chicagos-first-net-zero-commercial-building/)). I have a [M.Arch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Architecture) degree from IIT. Prior to that I apprenticed as a mechanical engineer/contractor (I built really big complex industrial stuff [1](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/10/picturequote.html), [2](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2011/05/returning-hate-for-hate-multiplies-hate.html), [3](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2009/12/picturequote.html)).

My main interest is affordable energy efficient homes. There are many ways to make a building energy efficient, but making it comfortable, inexpensive, and attractive at the same time is the challenge. There are many people who say they can do this, but there are few actual construction companies and architects who are truly interested in this. Telling someone their home will cost 5%-15% more than a home of a similar size is not a great selling point. Also, banks rarely see the value in it, although things are slowly changing.

The main software I use for energy modeling is PHPP (passive house planning package). It's a very intense excel spreadsheet that requires a good knowledge of physics and a decent amount of coffee to operate. For drawings I use [Revit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit) which is essentially CAD 2.0.

Also, I can give advice on energy retrofits, but please be specific about where you live, what you're trying to achieve, etc.

**PROOF:**

[This is all the posts tagged architecture from my blog](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/architecture). If you scroll down there's a picture of my degree.

[Here's a post announcing this AMA](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2013/07/reddit-ama.html).

**DISCLOSURE:**

Legally I cannot call myself an architect as I am not yet licensed. Technically I'm an intern architect according to AIA definitions. To become licensed in the US you need:

* A professional or masters degree depending on the state
* 5,600 hours of internship under a licensed architect (you can do about 1/3 under a licensed engineer too)
* Pass 7 tests of which the pass rate is 60%-80% per test. If you fail one you can't take it again for 6 months. You have 5 years to complete them or it all resets. Each tests costs $210 to take.

That being said in the state of IL I can still legally design single family homes of a certain size [without a license](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1340&amp;ChapterID=24), and unlike most architects I actually build things ([1](http://alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2011/09/walnut-entry-table.html), [2](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/woodshop), [3](http://alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/11/jatoba-and-aluminum-coffee-table.html), [4](http://logantreed.tumblr.com/post/50416909244)).

**EDIT:** I will answer everyone's questions as I get to them. There's a lot so it may take a few days. Please CTRL-F to see if others have asked the same question.

To the people who told me to do this AMA repeatedly as I rebuffed them; uh yeah I was wrong.

Edit: To clarify, the dick pics are all post-surgery taken today, with the exception of the one with the surgeon working, that was on May 1, 2013.

In May of last year I was having sex with my girlfriend and fractured my penis. This fracture resulted in what is called Peyronie's Disease, which is basically a plaque buildup that causes a bend in the penis. 

The first attempt at addressing my peyronie's was a series of 12 injections of Verapamil which is designed to break up the plaque and eliminate most of the bending. This didn't work. So, last week on May 1, 2013 I had penile surgery to remove the plaque and replace it with tissue from a cadaver heart.

tl;dr: I fractured my penis, had 12 injections in the penis that didn't fix it, and finally had surgery on it last week.

[The comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/tjlc9/man_drills_magnets_into_arm_to_mount_ipod/c4n6dw5) garnered a substantial amount of attention, and I had a bunch of people telling me to do an AMA on the subject. Well, OP delivers. 

Me and two of my friends (who may share their experiences in a bit) had parylene coated neodymium magnets [implanted into our fingertips](http://i.imgur.com/Vrg0s.jpg) in October of last year. We are in no way the first to do this, but you all seem interested in knowing more about the procedure, and more specifically, why the hell we would want to do something like this. 

My implants have allowed me the ability to ""see"" magnetic fields. Any device that has alternating current flowing through an inductive load throws off substantial amounts of magnetic energy. I can feel the shape, intensity, and frequency of this field as the magnets in my fingers shake in response. 

They have changed my life, and I think they are freaking awesome. 
So please; AMA.


Why did I have it done: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tl7pn/iama_24yo_electrical_engineer_with_magnets/c4nls5w) is about the best reason.



**EDIT: Sorry all, I'm going to have to call it quits for the night. My ass is falling asleep and my hands are on fire. I hope I answered enough questions. Thanks for all the interest! I might post up some more pictures tonight if I can finish enough of my grad project to take a break.** 


**UPDATE**

Alright, I'm going to try to sum up some FREQUENTLY asked questions.


* **Why?**

*Because science.*

* **What if you need an MRI?**

*I am concerned about this. I don't want people to think that I'm blowing it off. I do understand the awe inspiring magnetic field that a magnetic resonance imager produces. I do understand that there is a possibility that it could cause harm. From what I understand, and from some VERY rough calculations, the likelihood that it would actually RIP my implants from my fingertips are slim. I am far more concerned that it would demagnetize my implants. Also, I do intend on making sure that any technician that would me giving me an MRI knows about the implants, because I guarantee that he is going to understand what could happen far better than I would.* 

*Now, there ARE people that have these implants that have had to have an MRI and have reported that, although it was uncomfortable, it did not cause any damage. The implants are small enough that it shouldn't be much of an issue at all.*

* **How about other strong magnets?**

*Well, I've played with some seriously strong magnets and it wasn't an issue. I did get near a 300lb lift magnet and that was a little uncomfortable, but it wasn't bad. My concern is that if a magnet stays on the skin for too long, it will cut off the blood flow and the implant will reject. So I generally don't get too close to a super strong magnet. I've been near some HUGE magnetic fields like monstrous permanent magnet motors and big welders, and that was just fun. It feels crazy.*

* **Won't you break _______?**

*Probably not. My implants only have a weak magnetic field (~600uT), which is not enough to harm anything. I can't break a hard drive. I can't erase debit cards. I don't hurt my laptop. LCD screens aren't really affected by magnets. As far as things I might be working with in my profession: really the only thing in the ECE world that would be affected by magnetic fields this small is in MEMS design. This is because the systems you are designing are so small and fragile... I hate MEMS. I work in power electronics and the components that I work with can take a hell of a beating.*

* **How painful was it?**

*Quite. There was a rather sizable incision made into my fingertip, and the magnet was forcibly inserted into a layer of fat below my skin. It didn't feel good. The first week of healing sucked. After that, things were smooth sailing.*

* **Won't they reject?**
 
*There is always the possibility. My implants are coated in Parylene, which is biologically neutral and rust proof. It's the same stuff that they coat pacemakers with. I really hope it doesn't happen, but there is a possibility of rejection with any body modification.*

* **Can I do this without the implant?**

*Absolutely! You won't have the same level of sensitivity that I do, but I've heard of people glazing small neodymium magnets to their fingernails. That would be a good ""test drive"" before you consider an implant.*

* **What does it feel like?**

*Well, they are small. The implants are thin discs ~2mm*0.5mm. I have them in my ring finger and thumb on my left hand. The sensation I get near a magnetic field changes from field to field. AC fields cause the magnets to shake in my fingertips. This causes a similar sensation to bumping your elbow and your fingers going numb. Though, this changes in fields of different frequency or intensity. DC and permanent magnet fields just feel like it's tugging on my finger.*


* **What about playing the guitar?**

*I'm not boss enough to be able to play any instrument. Sorry, I can't answer this one*


* **Are they removable?**

*Yeah... It'd just take a scalpel and some ice. I'd rather not have it come to that though*

* **Do you regret getting them?**

*Not even the slightest bit.*



Alright, I REALLY need to get off of here and work on my grad project. I need to finish a board layout. Thanks for the questions!


**UPDATE 2**
Holy crap, I did not expect this to receive nearly this much attention. I just got [a mention in PopSci](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-05/electrical-engineer-can-feel-magnetic-fields-through-magnets-implanted-his-fingertips)! I really appreciate it. I didn't think people would find this quite so fascinating. 

I'm sorry, but I'm probably not going to be able to answer many more questions. This AMA blew up more than I ever thought it would, and I'm all sorts of behind schedule on my projects now. 

I want to give one last shout out to my local hackerspace, [LVL1](http://www.lvl1.org/). This awesome crew of people are who gave me the last push to have the procedure done.

I somewhat sit up so I can thrust as she rides. Anyway, I get way to into and really start thrusting as does she. Are rhythm failed and she violently thrusted one way and I the other. POP!

By then my brother and his girlfriend were around me and they the girls were assessing the damage. I was already starting to bruise and demanded to be taken to the hospital. Anyway, the prognoses was not good. I had severely fractured (still called fracturing even no bones are involved) my penis. In his words (the worst I've ever seen.)

I ha d an operation to fix the tears and whatnot, but still was unable to get an erection. After 6 months with zero erections I became depressed. So I decided to get a surgery to help me achieve an erection.

What I had installed (lol) was an inflatable penile prosthesis. Once things are starting to look like I may get lucky, I press a button located underneath and to the side of my shaft, that actually allows a big to inflate and make me hard. The erection isn't as powerful as my old natural erections, but it does allow for me to achieve orgasm.

Due to the INSANE amount of demand for me to write a Step-By-Step Guide, I guess OP must deliver.. I'll work on this starting right now and LINK to the Guide tonight at 11pm EST.

While going about my business inside, a lady from outside started to ask who's car was parked out back. After realizing it was mine, I went outside to see what had happened. Here it is (along with articles):

http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/05/29/falling_debris_in_mississauga_was_from_plane_that_took_off_from_pearson.html

http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/28/debris-from-air-canada-jet-believed-to-have-struck-cars-after-engine-fails-over-toronto/

Not wanting to be a douche about it, I decided to not take any aggressive action against the party responsible (Air Canada), in hopes that they would engage in common courtesy regarding the matter. Boy was I wrong. First off, they acknowledged that this was indeed their airplane and their fault. My name and information was everywhere at the time and reporters were having no issues getting my phone number to ask questions. Secondly, after a couple weeks had passed, not a single representative had contacted me about the ordeal. No ""how are you doing?"" Nothing.

Insurance covered most of the cost of fixing my car, but I still had to pay the deductible which cost quite a bit. I reached out to let Air Canada know, and they simply told me to talk to my insurance provider and employer to solve the issue. Basically brushing me off (This was the one and only time they ever communicated with me btw). Fine. I'm friends with a lawyer at my gym and he offered to write a letter to them in hopes of escalating the situation. Air Canada did not respond. I've waited. And waited. And waited. Here we are.

In one month, a full year will have passed. Initially I was fine with them just covering the damages. Mistakes happen. Albeit, this is quite a big mistake. A piece of airplane engine did explode and smash through my car after all. Had I not been inside and in my car instead, who knows what could have happened (well, I'm pretty sure I know what would have happened). The disrespect, dismissive nature and lack of compassion shown just annoys me off. What do I do??

Hello reddit people,

My name is Roald Riepen and I am the managing director of www.FreeOnes.com (nsfw /18+)

For those not familiar with FreeOnes, we run one of the biggest (adult) model databases online since 1998.  We currently have about 2 million daily visitors on the site (desktop and mobile) and we list over 27k models. 

Last March was our 15 year anniversary and because of that we thought it would be fun to do a reddit AMA. Besides that our ""We now accept bitcoin"" thread here was fun to do so lets go! I will do my best to reply as fast as possible and will get help of Petra, one of our all-round managers. She will start her replies with ""Reply Petra:"" to keep all clear on whos who!

We just launched a week of action against CISPA, a dangerous ‘cybersecurity’ bill that blows a hole in virtually all existing privacy laws. 

Thankfully, Reddit has already been spreading the word about CISPA, but if anyone needs a refresher, here is [our just-published FAQ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cybersecurity-bill-faq-disturbing-privacy-dangers-cispa-and-how-you-stop-it) on all the bill’s dangerous provisions that threaten Internet freedom.

Please visit our [Stop Cyber Spying](https://cyberspying.eff.org/) page to easily tweet at your member of Congress using the hashtag #CongressTMI. You can then go to [our action center](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8444) to email your member of Congress. 

But this is an AMA, of course, and we are no Woody Harrelson. So please feel free to ask us anything. We can talk SOPA, ACTA, TPP, our proposed exemptions for jailbreaking tablets and video game consoles, the RIAA’s ‘six strikes’ program, or anything else that crosses your mind.

Obligatory legal disclaimer: We can't offer legal advice, so please don’t give us the specifics about any legal problems in your public posting. Sorry! But if you do have a specific legal issue, [here’s a link](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance) to our page about getting legal help from EFF. There also may be cases we are involved in we may not be able to comment on. 

Our first [AMA is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ot98v/hey_reddit_were_the_activism_team_at_eff_thanks/). And you can [go here to support EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate).

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the questions folks. We can keep going for another 60-90 minutes, even though we've just been scooped on IAMA by Ridiculously Photogenic Guy. What are the chances?

&gt;Some other things that are fairly unique about kyriose's mine:
*has continuously operated since roughly 1910s.
*it is seismically active, it experiences seismic events of about 2.0 on a fairly regular basis.
*It is a thermal mine. The ambient temperature can be &gt;30C in some parts of the mine or hotter if there is equipment operating in the area.
*To deal with the heat, it has a natural heat exchange system where fresh air for the mine is drawn through old workings. This has the effect of heating the air during the winter months and cooling the air in the summer.
*is host to an underground scientific laboratory. Due to it's depth at 6800' below surface, it is the cleanest lab with respect to cosmic radiation. allowing them to do experiments studying nutrinos and the search for dark matter.

Kyriaki is Australian, Jennifer and Rachel live in the USA. We'll all be posting under this screenname, to make the AMA easier, with initials so you know who is who. It's night-time in Australia right now so she'll stay on until she has to go to sleep, and then Jennifer and Rachel will stay during the day.

Candlesandfish: I'm Kyriaki, and I have lamellar ichthyosis. I did a mini-AMA about Ichthyosis three months ago which you can find [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/15lzys/lamellar_ichthyosis/c7nqiko). Proof that it's really me is here: http://imgur.com/n0mL8PP (and yes, there's a typo in the screenname at the bottom, my bad!), which you can compare with the photos posted here (and in that mini-AMA).

The scales shed constantly and there's a much higher skin turnover rate than a normal person, but it takes a different form where they're very thick, and only small parts come off at a time, usually pieces ranging in size between my pinkie and thumbnails. It's messy and weird and actually very painful if it's not kept incredibly well moisturised and then oils used to hold the moisture in. The stuff I used for the first 21 years of my life was about 90% paraffin and literally melted on my skin if the weather was too hot. If you don't keep it hydrated, the scales tighten together and the under layer below the skin is exposed in between the scales, and the gaps show as red skin with no protection, and it hurts like hell. 

Other aspects of the condition are issues with temperature regulation (I can't sweat) and light sensitivity, as well as digestive issues.

I use heavy moisturisers and I've been on roaccutane for about a year, which has worked miracles on my skin which now looks much more normal, albeit dry. I'll probably stay on it the rest of my life now, except for when I want to have children.

Here's me with the absolute best my skin could ever look without roaccutane, taken last January, it took me several hours to get my skin to look this good - the discolouration patterning on my arms and chest is most noticeable, since I did a lot of work to make my face look normal.
http://i.imgur.com/F2xL0.jpg 

This is more like normal: http://i.imgur.com/HVUtX.jpg 

This is in between, about a month into roaccutane, taken because I'd managed to dye myself pink with a bath bomb and it amused me - ichthyosis scales are very good at taking up colour because it's dead skin, and pink scales were funny.

Foot: http://i.imgur.com/FFgGZ.jpg 

Stomach (taken by me, so a bit weird) from a side angle - the pink is at the edges of the scales): http://i.imgur.com/R2Yho.jpg 

And this is me now - the snake must have liked me because we're related, scaly skin and all ;) You can see the remnants of the scales on my upper chest on one side of the v-neck. http://i.imgur.com/vKylH.jpg 

Finally, here's a link to a scientific (but readable) explanation of the reason that our skin does what it does - it's to do with genes being mutated, and I'm finding it really interesting having not come across it before. Lamellar is one subtype of the type they discuss in the paper, and the type discussed is rare. http://www.firstskinfoundation.org/content.cfm/Ichthyosis/Autosomal-Recessive-Congenital-Ichthyosis-ARCI-2008/page_id/700

Confettiskin:  We are Rachel and Jennifer. Rachel and our three boys are all affected with a very rare form of ichthyosis called ichthyosis-en-confetti, and since last year we have been blogging on [confettiskin.com](http://confettiskin.com). Our [full bio](http://confettiskin.com/wp/2012/09/02/welcome-to-our-blog/) has more details. Rachel has posted about how she sometimes has [mobility problems caused by her ichthyosis](http://confettiskin.com/wp/2012/11/12/lack-of-mobility/) (which has a picture of her foot). And yesterday she took some [additional pictures](http://imgur.com/a/LEwDc) for Reddit. We have also written extensively about [harlequin ichthyosis](http://confettiskin.com/wp/category/types/arci/harlequin/)

Lot's of recurring questions:

How much did it cost?  - I spent 10.000USD. Could easily have done it on 4.000USD. I just went nuts a bit.
Where did you go? - Main travel plan: NYC - Chicago - St. Louis - Kansas City - Denver - Roadtrip to Wyoming, south dakota, montana, Yellowstone national park, grand tetans, Idaho, Utah, All National parks in southern utah, Arizona, Grand Canyon, Colorado - Denver - Kansas city - St Louis - Nashville - Atlanta - Orlando - Washington DC - NYC.

We’re also focused on defeating [“ag-gag” bills]( http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/campaigns/factory_farming/fact-sheets/ag_gag.html), which seek to make it impossible to blow the whistle on factory farms and other animal facilities like puppy mills.

My fingers are tingling and my brain numb from trying to answer all the provocative questions. Plus, the dog's barking for a walk. So off I go. Let's do it again sometime. PL

 Hi, Reddit community. I spent more than a decade chronicling the real Los Angeles Police “Gangster Squad” that inspired the current film…and considerable debate on Reddit yesterday. So if you want to know what was true, and what was Hollywood dramatization, shoot me questions (not bullets). By way of background:   

When the cast of Warner Bros. film version of “Gangster Squad” was preparing to stage the movie’s final confrontation – a wild Tommy Gun shoot-‘em-up between the crew of LAPD cops and the henchmen of the hoodlum Mickey Cohen – Ryan Gosling asked me, “Did any of these guys get killed?” By these guys he meant the real-life members of the real Gangster Squad, which was formed by the Los Angeles Police Department back in 1946 to battle the real Mickey Cohen and other mob figures following a series of shootings that threatened L.A.’s image as America’s sun-washed Garden of Eden. I told Gosling that of the eight original members of the squad, two had been shot and wounded on the job, but before they joined the unit. And the only one killed after the squad was formed, the giant Texan “Jumbo” Kennard, died not in a hail of bullets but when his car struck a bus on a rain-soaked Wilshire Boulevard after a night of drinking. In the film version of  “Gangster Squad,” in contrast, one of the squad had already been knocked off by Mickey’s men and another was about to get it in the shootout being staged as Gosling and Josh Brolin stormed an historic L.A. hotel where the film’s Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) was holed up. 

The embellishment should surprise no one familiar with the ways of Hollywood, or the conventions of films on small, elite crews of crime-fighters such as “The Magnificent Seven” or “The Untouchables” – a couple of the good guys are going to bite the dust before the rest prevail over the forces of evil. In this case, Warner Bros. made no secret of the cinematic liberties being taken. As a number of Reddit commentators noted yesterday, the film did not even describe itself as “based on” a true story, it opted for the lesser “inspired by.” On location that night, as Gosling and Brolin grabbed their machine guns to have it out with Sean Penn, the main producer, Dan Lin, termed the unfolding action as, most basically, “Boys with toys.”  In real life, the men of the LAPD’s Gangster Squad indeed carried Thompson submachine guns to intimidate hoods like Mickey but never once fired them. The only time a squad member tried to pull the trigger, when confronting a brother of the notorious Al Capone, the Tommy failed to fire. 

I bring this up because of the extensive discussion on Reddit yesterday inspired by a wonderfully provocative post by the granddaughter of Sgt. Jack O’Mara, the squad leader played by Brolin, declaring, “The movie butchered my grandfather’s life.”  Well, I first met the real Sgt. O’Mara in 1992 and spent many afternoons in his living room, and soon after met the roguish Sgt. Jerry Wooters (the character now played by Gosling), all while researching what first became a series of articles in the Los Angeles Times, “L.A. Noir: Tales from the Gangster Squad,” then recently was expanded into the nonfiction book, “Gangster Squad,” which indeed is quite different from the film. So, as I said, shoot…with questions.

This is her flipping prathas, a type of Indian flatbread: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQaiJIMO_1s

She made this spread yesterday: http://imgur.com/a/oxAV0

And she made these over the past year. Like a true artist, presentation is equally important for her. So yes, amazingly, she did the presentation herself. Photos were taken to include in a cookbook I'm working on putting together for her: (edit--photo credit: Sonya Kumpus) http://imgur.com/a/HgFKH


EDIT: She expresses her gratitude for all questions and birthday wishes, saying that this has been the best birthday so far. She is eager to continue answering more, between preparing the day's meals--we're not allowed to cook anything for her, especially in her kitchen. ""When I come to your kitchen, then you can cook for me.""

I know which of their programs work, which don't, and *why*. 

**I have invited a few other former employees to join me here, and will update with their usernames so you can keep an eye out for their responses**

**The obvious questions:**

*  does it work? - Yes and no, it *really* depends on the language in question. Some languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Chinese, English...) it works very well, others (Arabic, Turkish, Japanese) it is a very flawed endeavor, but *may* still be a useful tool, depending on the person.


* Did you really learn 7 foreign languages with RS? - Yes and no; for some it was my primary method of acquisition, for others it was a great tool, and for others it was apparently an impediment to my success. I'm certified in 2 of the 7. I have former colleagues who I'm friend with who speak 5-10 languages each, and there are others who spent years with RS and just didn't bother to learn anything. 


* Adults don't learn like children, WTF is with their advertising? - It's advertising. Some people subscribe to the ""critical period"" hypothesis and would argue kids learn better than adults could ever hope to, others will point out that 5 year olds are complete fucking idiots and that any adult who spoke at the level of a 5 year old after 5 years of study should be ridiculed for their incompetence in language learning. Both are kind of irrelevant, in that RS is just trying to get people to buy a program that's built around a different framework, using popular ideas about linguistics.

The impact and fall fucked up my knee, broke my laptop that was in my backpack, and sprained my ankle.  I didn't hear the bicyclist coming because his bike was so silent.  This was in broad daylight on a crowded campus with a slight downhill slope.  My guess is that he moved to dodge someone who turned, and hit me.

As tried to get back up, realizing the horrible pain I was in, the bicyclist told me to watch where the fuck I was going and started to try to ride off.  I tried to get him to stop but he didn't.  I called the police.  He was picked up minutes later, but released, because since he wasn't driving a motor vehicle it couldn't be prosecuted under hit and run.  Instead, it is being prosecued under assault and battery.

I am suing him for the cost of medical bills (about 8k so far), the cost of replacing my laptop ($1k), and for two weeks of my salary since I wasn't able to work ($400).

They rallied their biker friends to play the 'entitled car driver' card and leave trash on my car and send me harassing Facebook messages.  One time I had to get campus security to come out and physically remove them from my car, since they decided they were going to sit behind my car and play cards, since I had no other way out.  I am in the process of getting a restraining order against him as well.

EDIT:
Getting a lot of downvotes here.  I'm sorry that some people can't drive, but don't downboat/blame me for being the messenger.

EDIT2:
Apparently the guy is part of some kind of biker club and one or more of them is a Reddit reader.  I found thier (public) Facebook page and there are about 50 of them conspiring to fuck with me on here.  One of them also ran into me at school a while ago and said I better knock it off or that they'll make life very difficult for me.  I'd post the group, but my lawyer advised against.  Fuck this crowd mentality and fuck bikers.

EDIT3:
I've since learned that this cyclist culture really blew up in Poland.  The critical masses, the douchebaggery, the self-entitlement..it was pretty much imported from there.  Cities have been locked up completely for hours because cyclists wanted more 'rights' (as in, precedence over pedestrians on the sidewalk/road/etc).  Then it spread to our west coast, then our east coast, then everywhere else it goes on.  You know how cities can make people with overgrown yards mow their grass, to get rid of the vermin that might take up residence there?  Poland is the home owner, and these douche cyclists are the high grass.  The only real solution is to invade and teach them some order.  That's our burden.

EDIT4:
Okay, enough with the Poland joke.  The other lawyer actually pulled the 'anti-Semite' card today because apparently the defendant is Jewish.  It stems from the fact that I said that he and his group can go fuck themselves the other day before I called the police to remove them from behind my car.  Seriously?  I didn't even know he was Jewish.  It wouldn't matter.  Of course, now I've been receiving calls/emails from his family and friends of his family for being anti-Jew.  I've gotten about ten phone calls and a few emails today talking about how my future career is over and how I'm going to be expelled etc etc.  Lawyer says to keep my cool and not talk to any of them because anything I say will only make them madder and give them more ammo to make me look anti-Semitic.",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,True,unique,,True,t3_dufqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dufqf/iama_pedestrian_who_was_hit_by_a_bicyclist/,

The techniques we teach help servers to drastically improve their tips, which as a measure of customer enjoyment means that customer satisfaction is high.

I have just started blogging about this and hope to release some information products for servers around the world.

This AMA is both for me to see how many servers are out there with questions about making getter tips, and to answer any questions you may have about what we teach, what we think about customer service in general and what we believe will happen as the restaurant industry continues to grow.

A year ago when a video I directed, [*Sexy Saxman*](http://youtu.be/mKSyPoxzT6w), was upvoted to the number-one spot on Reddit for a day, I was exhilarated! I had never thought millions of people would be into something I created. The next morning I figured it'd be business as usual, but thanks to all the love and attention my YouTube channel got, so many doors opened up for me. I was finally able to focus on my passion, which is directing music videos for my favorite artists, creating shorts, my own music, and eventually make a living off [my YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/mikediva).

I got a chance to collaborate on another video that got frontpaged, [DubStep Guns](http://youtu.be/hDlif8Km4S4), with my friends Corridor Digital.

I was also fortunate enough to direct commercials for [EA Sports](http://youtu.be/govyq9f2djo) and [CAPCOM](http://youtu.be/WFW9-b50GAk)

My [latest music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVfU1DY73Tk) is for one of my favorite artists, Kill The Noise, on Skrillex's label, OWSLA. It took me four months to finish and holy shit, RollingStone reviewed the clip saying:

&gt; Diva's vision is a dystopian, zombie-filled future Los Angeles where gore and neon splatter the screen and a band of warriors embark on a video game-esque quest to kill the big bad guy – each of their blows in sync with the bass line.

As you can see I've been busy! I'm currently working on collaborations with Epic Meal Time, Smosh, and more!

I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, believing that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology.

I'm a avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached four of the highest peaks on all seven continents, including Mt. Everest.

**HISTORY &amp; FAMILY**

I was a successful businessman before running for office in 1994. I started a door-to-door handyman business to help pay my way through college. Twenty years later, I had grown the firm into one of the largest construction companies in New Mexico with over 1,000 employees. .

I'm best known for my veto record, which includes over 750 vetoes during my time in office, more than all other governors combined and my use of the veto pen has since earned me the nickname “Governor Veto.” I cut taxes 14 times while never raising them. When I left office, New Mexico was one of only four states in the country with a balanced budget.

I was term-limited, and retired from public office in 2003.

In 2009, after becoming increasingly concerned with the country’s out-of-control national debt and precarious financial situation, the I formed the OUR America Initiative, a 501c(4) non-profit that promotes fiscal responsibility, civil liberties, and rational public policy. I've traveled to more than 30 states and spoken with over 150 conservative and libertarian groups during my time as Honorary Chairman.

I have two grown children - a daughter Seah and a son Erik. I currently resides in a house I built myself in Taos, New Mexico.

**PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

I've scaled the highest peaks of 4 continents, including Everest.

I've competed in the Bataan Memorial Death March, a 25 mile desert run in combat boots wearing a 35 pound backpack.

I've participated in Hawaii’s invitation-only Ironman Triathlon Championship, several times.

I've mountain biked the eight day Adidas TransAlps Challenge in Europe.

Today, I finished a 458 mile bicycle ""Ride for Freedom"" all across New Hampshire.

It was suggested by a handful of people that I come here and do this, so here we are. Feel free to ask whatever you like, but know that there are some questions I simply cannot answer. I'll try to answer what I can. Personal (non-music related) questions are fine too, as long as they're not too personal! :) I'd strongly recommend asking questions not already covered in past interviews.

By the way, I realize the scheduled time of this AMA is not ideal for folks way on the other side of the globe. I'll be here for a few hours answering questions, then will return on May 30th at 3PM Brisbane time (5AM GMT, midnight US Central) to answer questions for a couple hours.

**AMA IS CLOSED**

Ok folks, I think that'll do! Thanks to everyone who took the time to come here and ask questions. I'm sorry I didn't have time to answer them all, it was a bit overwhelming! You're welcome to [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/SamHulick) or [on Facebook](http://facebook.com/SamHulick), though I am more active on the former. Or if you have a more detailed question than will fit on Twitter, you can also ask me [via my tumblr blog](http://samhulick.tumblr.com/). I do read all correspondence, though unfortunately I'm not always able to respond.

Thanks again to you all and to reddit and the IAmA mods! Cheers!

It grows in the back of the nose, and in my case it began growing in my brain and behind my optic nerves, the surgery was a success and medical history was made. AMA.

Proof - http://imgur.com/h5e4P7O

/u/rbrychckn simplifies the document I used as proof:

""I'm in this field, so I thought I'd try to simplify the proof document that the OP supplied.
The Progress Notes section just lists the multiple procedures that were performed. The class of procedures this falls into is Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery. A not-quite-the-same but conceptually accurate video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ki26qyOuNU).
The ""Stereotactic image guidance"" is pretty new and takes a CT scan of the head that was taken before surgery and we place that on a computer screen in the operating room. Using bony landmarks on the head (tip of the nose, bones around the eyes), a set of many electrodes are placed on the face. A probe is used to point at a specific point and the computer shows you where that probe is on the CT scan. A good real-world view of what they look at is [here](http://nycfacemd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/53yo-female-BrainLAB-screen-300x245.jpg).

""IMAX ligation"" has nothing to do with 3D movies. It stands for internal maxillary artery ligation which means that this artery was tied off. This almost certainly means the OP's tumor was being supplied blood from here.
As others have noted, this is benign so it is not cancer. Staging of benign tumors do not have the same connotations as a stage IV terminal cancer. Nonetheless, this is dangerous mostly because of where it is (next to the brain) and any mass that continues to grow will erode into nearby structures even if it doesn't invade into them.

Last, the numbness that the OP is describing make sense as the tumor and the surgery was near the nasopalatine nerve that come through the inside of the nose down toward the roof of the mouth or palate. The lip numbness is tougher to explain anatomically but still make sense from what he went through.""


**Commonly asked questions**

*Lasting symptoms*

-I have numbness of my lip, the upper right portion, the roof of my mouth, and my nose.

-I can only cry out of one eye (left)


*Symptoms that made you check it out*

-Migraines weekly

-Constant stuffed right nostril

-A very chubby face, chubby cheeks, chubby underneath the eyes.  I looked very swollen. 

*Cognitive side affects*

-None 

*Did you die*

-No

*Did they let you keep it after surgery*

-No, they are using it for studies. 

*Did you have to start cooking meth*

-No, I'm not a chemistry teacher.

I started Twitch because while I was working on Justin.tv, the gaming video was the only content I watched. I've played games my whole life, and my one regret is that the bigger Twitch gets the less time I have to actually play or watch games. 

Twitch folk /u/fishstix1 and /u/fuzzyotterballs will stick around after the AMA to help answer the questions I can't get to.

I was unconscious in a hospital for a period of 4 months after massive head trauma.  The doctors had said it was a miracle that I survived, but I didn't escape unscathed - my thinking abilities have been reduced.  While I no longer have seizures, I slur and stutter occasionally and think a bit more slowly.  AMA.

My roommate is helping me by transcribing my responses, as I type very slowly and make lots of mistakes. 

edit:  Roommate here.  Tedsnake has had to retire a bit earlier than planned this evening, but I could tell he loved being able to interact with you guys.  He's particularly forthright and open with his experiences, moreso than anyone else I've met, and it's truly inspiring.  You made his night, his week maybe.  (And to be selfish for a minute, it was fun for me also!  He's got a hell of a sense of humor.)  This will likely end up being his permanent account, as I think I intrigued him when I explained reddit.  Feel free to PM questions or discussions. 

This was really nice, reddit.  Thank you.


edit 2:  Roommate again.  So Ted and I did this AMA last night til about midnight, and we wrapped it up early because of an issue he had with his blood sugar.  Long story short, he's taking a medicine (Prednisone) for a lung infection which is wreaking havoc on his sugar levels.  As a precaution, we took him to be checked out and they're keeping him for a bit.  I'll visit this afternoon, at which point I'll show him more of your responses and such.  I gave him a quick rundown on the phone a few minutes ago, and he was absolutely elated to hear of your kind words and support.  Thank you!

AMA.",i_killed_my_friend,6778,5213,3177,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4hvq/per_request_i_am_a_person_who_accidentally_killed/,"I was a best man in a wedding in my hometown. I had to travel back to the state to visit my old friends and to partake in the wedding. On the first night there the other groomsmen and bridesmaids took me out on the town to welcome me back. After the bars closed I got onto a motorcycle with a good friend on the back, there was one helmet and she was wearing it. She was very drunk and not experienced in riding on the back of motorcycles. While making a left turn she jerked to the right, I can only assume she got scared from leaning into the turn, we made a quick jump to the right, hit a curb and it threw me off of the bike. I landed 15 feet from the contact point and she fell straight backwards. I ran back to her and she was unconscious but mostly unscathed. I called 911 just as my other friends pulled up behind me and tried to help us get out of there. I feared the worse and told them to leave knowing the police and ambulances were coming. The ambulances came and took us away in separate vehicles. She had complications (I have never been told what complications) and was induced into a coma. I was released with a stable fracture in my neck and taken to jail in my scrubs and neck brace. After 10 weeks her parents decided to take her off life support and she died shortly after. I was charged with Involuntary Vehicular Manslaughter and spent a year going from county jail to prison to a prison camp before being released. 
Those are the hard facts, the personal things I remember are what haunt me. When I got up after the accident I remember how much dirt I had in my mouth and how bad my neck was. Once I ran up to her my thinking was still to get out of there before being in trouble. Her shirt was pulled down over her shoulders and I remember fixing it and yelling for her to wake up. I have seen many people knocked out before and expected her to come to at any moment, it wasn't a busy street so traffic and other viewers weren't an issue. It only took me a minute or two to realize it was worse than a knockout and called 911. My other friends showed up and I told them to leave so they weren't involved. 


I sat down next to her and sobbed for what seemed like a week. When the ambulance showed up I was taken in a different vehicle than her and started to freak out, I was strapped down because of my neck injury and scared more than I have ever been. She was next to me in the ER and I strained everything to be able to look over at her, she was quickly taken away and I never saw her again.


I had been drinking, BAC .18, I had been a heavy drinker for years and even though it is almost triple the legal driving limit I wasn't ""that"" drunk. DO NOT think this in my way of saying I don't deserve the punishment I simply use this to explain how clear the moment was. I had no business riding a motorcycle, and was far out of line having someone else on the back.


The court proceedings were very difficult for me, I constantly was taken to court to have a continuance issued and come back in two weeks. After she passed they were able to charge me for the full conviction of killing my friend. Her family wrote an amazing letter supporting me and asking for leniency. Because of a no contact order directly in place after the accident I was not allowed to contact the family, not even to thank or apologize to them. 


The request asked ""how do you deal with it?"". Man, I don't know, it used to be day to day while I tried to drown myself in alcohol. Now I'm doing better, I'm in an amazing relationship with a woman I don't deserve and helps carry me through every aspect of my life. I am attending college and write to my victim's mother when I can. I tried to be as full rounded on this subject but I know there are tons of questions about the wreck, hospital, court, jail, prison, and the after effects. So please ask away. I know what I did was wrong and it sucks everyday, if you feel it's your job to tell me that, then fuck you.
Thanks Reddit, my life would be worse without you.


TL;DR: Drunk motorcycled a girl home from a wedding, hit a curb, fracturing his neck and knocking the girl unconscious. She's induced into a coma and 10 weeks later the family pulls the plug. OP gets a year in jail for involuntary vehicular manslaughter. Thank you carleverett.


edit: I hadn't mentioned the financial aspect of this event. I owe the state $108,000 and the hospital $380,000, I have a 15 year sentence. It was originally $488,000 that was owed to the state, they would call it owing the victims, the judge wanted to ""give me a chance"" and dropped it to $108,000 the rest I'll probably be sued for. Basically to get it expunged I need to pay off the $108,000 within the 15 years, which I wont be able to. After 15 years passes I could be arrested and booked then charged with a new 15 years and given whatever amount that is left to pay back. I will always be a felon.

EDIT 3: Ok, about to go to bed, will check tomorrow for any unanswered questions.

Often asked questions:

-Sex?

It's hard to get lucky in an Islamic country.


-What bike?

Honda Africa Twin. I bought the bike specifically for the trip. It was 2nd hand, imported from Italy (not by me) with 28000km on the odometer. I modded the bike: bigger fuel tank (44liter), GPS (Garmin), heated grips, huge airhorn, steel tube protection frame, aluminium panniers, etc. Also a full service &amp; new tires. All together I think the bike &amp; luggage weighs around 350kg.

-Navigation?

I took maps along of every part of my route. All can be bought online. The GPS helps, nut mostly you just follow the road/path to the next town/village. That can be anywhere from 10km to 600km. Locals can tell you how to get to the next village (but usually not further, they don't know/never been).

-Visa?

Before leaving, I organised all the required visas. Some I got in The Netherlands (The Hague) and for some I had to go to Brussels. It's a hassle, it costs a lot of money, but there is no way around it. You can get agencies to do it for you, but that can cost a lot of money. You can find them on the net.

The Turkmen visa was the hardest to get. Normally, you can only travel in Turkmenistan with a guide 24/7. But there is a loophole: you can get a transit visa which allows you to enter, travel, and leave. So I told them that I would be entering from Iran in order to go to Uzbekistan. I asked for 6 days visa, considering the distance I would be travelling that would give me a day to visit the capital and an extra day in case of emergencies.

-Money?

Some of the countries visited were cash only (for example Iran, Turkmenistan), others have ATM's (for example Pakistan, India, Nepal, China). So you have to bring lots of US$ with you (yes, they accept the US$ anywhere, really anywhere). I carried some on my body, and some was hidden on the bike.

-Costs (EURO)?

Bike was about 3-4K, I spend about 7K along the way, flight back &amp; bike shipping about 2K, paperwork &amp; guides 1K. Add maybe 1K for things I forgot.

-Dangers?

I took a security course in the UK before I left. They cater to journalists &amp; tourists that go to 'difficult' countries. Their analysis was that the biggest danger would be the traffic in India! I took normal precautions, and was never at 1 place for more that a few days. So usually if I would have attracted any attention, I was gone before they really noticed me. But I never really felt in danger. I never travelled at night and almost always slept in hotes/hostels/family homes where the bike was parked in a safe place. Sometimes that would be inside, next to the reception. And, no, I didn't bring any guns (why Americans have such a fascination for guns, I'll never understand).

Contrary to popular opinion, crime rates in most of these countries are very low. In some you have more to fear from the police/military than the population. They tend to be extremely welcoming, friendly &amp; curious.

-Repairs/spare parts

I took a pair of tires with me to switch just before Turkmenistan. I also sent a pair ahead to China, together with oil &amp; air filters. I carried a lot of spares, because after Istanbul, it's really hard if not impossible to get anything for such a (big) bike. I suffered no problems, except a flat tire in China due to a huge iron nail. I also carried spare inner tubes and an airpump. I'm quite handy with tools &amp; repairs, so that was no problem. I took plenty tools along.

-Food &amp; lodging

You can get food anywhere (duh), and they have hotels and restaurants anywhere (duh), although they may not look/taste/smell like anything you've ever seen. A restaurant can be a roadside shack and a hotel can turn out not to have any water .. I always carried a lot of water on the bike, and I had some camping/survival food with me, just in case. I also carried a tent, sleeping bag and simple cooking set. I camped in the desert of Iran and Turkmenistan (amazing).

-Route (loop in China)

I wanted to cross the desert, and I took the Cross Desert Highway, 600km of sand, sand and then some more sand. So I made that loop (clockwise). Cool, you can see that desert from space!

-General

I found people on average everywhere very friendly and sympathetic to my travels. People in remote places are thrilled to see strangers visit them, especially someone from that far away, all alone on a motorcycle. Poor people relate different to motorcycles then we do. For them it's the transportation of the poor, the rich have cars, the poor ride bikes .. so if you're on a bike, even from the west, you can't be rich .. that decreases the distance / creates empathy.

I also 'discovered' that:

-governments suck, not people

-Iranians don't hate the west, they want the best for their childern as well

-Northern Pakistan is the most beautiful place on earth (or maybe Tikal, Guatemala)",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,True,unique,,True,t3_rckrk,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rckrk/i_rode_a_motorbike_alone_from_the_netherlands_to/,
1329767023.0,1558,self.IAmA,py69w,IAMA novice soccer coach that led the 'worst team in the world' to their first ever international victory. AMA,MrMattConrad,5541,3983,1084,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/py69w/iama_novice_soccer_coach_that_led_the_worst_team/,"I, Matt Conrad, and my mate Paul after a few beers had the crazy idea to ditch the drudgery of life and pursue our dream of playing international soccer.  One problem: Who would take us? Neither of us were what you would call ""talented.""

A few more beers and some Googling later we found the island of Pohnpei, a tiny speck in the Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei had never won a game and were called ""the worst team in the world."" Perfect! - we thought. Let's grab a camera, pop over to the other side of the world, wow the locals with some kick-ups, play a game, win and become local legends forever! 

Not exactly. 

After a 48 hour flight we touched down on an island unlike anything we had ever seen. It was beautiful, very weird and everyone was staring at us. We bee-lined to team practice anxious to meet our new team-mates. But lo and behold - there was no team at all! 

From this moment our mission became clear: Help Pohnpei create something pure and noble to call their own - a team capable of competing and winning their first game. Away from the over-commercialized trappings and glitz of the modern game, we had the chance to do something truly grass roots. Our mission became an obsession. 

But, building a team in the middle of nowhere in the stifling heat and driving rain with no funding is no easy feat. Especially on a waterlogged field inhabited by hundreds of toads and dogs. Recruiting players and bridging the enormous cultural gap to instill a professional discipline needed to compete at international level wasn't any easier. Our star player was run over and almost killed by a drunk driver, our funding repeatedly fell through, I got 3rd degree sun burns, Paul got boils - yes boils, ...and we didn't have a working toilet. Nevertheless, inspired by our players, many of whom walked miles to and from training in the pummeling rain, we flew them off the island (in many cases for their first time) to face island rivals and Pacific soccer powerhouses, Guam in Pohnpei's first competitive game in decades.

tl:dr With no money and experience I flew to a small Pacific Island and coached their soccer team to their first international victory.

Along with my friend Beto, I plan to cross the South Atlantic in a few weeks. It will be a great journey as we will sail without a motor or cabin. This is the second leg of a circumnavigation of the globe on a sport catamaran. We have already crossed the Pacific ocean previously and hopefully we will continue with the Indian Ocean.

We will go from Cape town to Rio de Janeiro in a sports catamaran. We will only be using clean energy for this journey and we hope to demonstrate that tough challenges can be met without conventional energy. Since I grew up on a boat where we always had to be frugal with our resources, this is a cause I strongly believe in. I will be happy to answer any questions you have about our trip and everything involved with it.

I finally found a woman that wound up loving me regardless but it was a long and tough road.

Album and YES it is a dead dove result.
http://imgur.com/a/E2T9M

YES, the second picture is me fully erect.

Edit: Just...wow.  So much positivity.  Thanks all of you.  A couple points for the broken records:

I was mirco BEFORE the weight.  Now I am micro and buried in fat.

Penis, before weight gain was 3-1/4"" long (and that was pushing the ruler in as deep as I could) and under an inch in diameter which means short and very skinny.

Thanks for all the weight lose advice.  Working on.  Already undergone radical diet changes and such.  /keto, /paleo and so on have been suggested.  Message received.  I am a Fatty Mc Faterson that needs to eat healthy and exercise.

Currently 4:30am, time has flown.  Will hang on a little while longer.

Edit 2: Found out I don't medically meet the definition of micropenis.  My apologies.  How about supertinypenis instead?  My whole life is a lie!  Point being, I'm in the bottom percentile, the smallest condoms are like baggies on it.

Edit 3: Obligatory holy crap, made the main page and its on a throwaway.  Curses!

Edit 4: For those that haven't read, life is back on track.  Eating much healthier for a while now and weight is slowly coming off.  I have a wife and she likes my supertinypenis.

Edit 5:  4:15pm, 8/25/12 Wow, this really blew up.  About to get off work.  I will try to address more questions as soon as I can.

Edit 6: It is simply staggering how many people make comments without reading anything other than the title.  

Edit 7: After all the messages saying they didn't think my second picture was an erection, here is an orgasm video showing that yes, it is erect.

*Were you ever harassed by paparazzi?

*Cool stories of events, etc that you attended

*How did your life change while you were dating, and how did it change after dating that person?

*How did you meet/begin dating?


CLARIFICATION: They need have already 'blown up' for it to count. Not overly interested in someone who dated a celebrity before they were famous. 

Edit 1: The best suggestion so far is Baby Spoon, Kesha's boyfriend. A quick google search suggests he is part of her road crew but not really famous himself, however I'm having no luck finding any facebook/twitter/email info for him, just links to infant products. 

Edit 2: Seems this request has been asked quite a few times. There has been an interesting ama done by someone who dated Kyle Gass from Tenacious D. Was probably aiming for someone a touch more famous than him, but it is still a very interesting read.

I never said I haven't given any to friends or family already, all I said was I won't give to those begging for it.

1. Showering/Hygiene: $30/month gym membership. EDIT: NEGOTIATE, NEGOTIATE, NEGOTIATE The first offer was hundreds of dollars more expensive than what I got, and I probably could have gotten it lower, but I wanted to shower.

2. Parking: Sometimes street, mostly a Kohl's parking lot that goes dark at 11PM.

3. Reasons: To see if I could, save money, drop my standard of living.

4. Saving money for what? To travel around the world next march.

5. Tried Wal-Mart a few times, my local one didn't like me.

6. TONS OF QUESTIONS. I'm doing my best.

7. Internet: Starbucks, tons of restaurants, and at work.

8. I have a backpackers stove, I just suck at cooking. PM if you want to cook for me in Los Angeles.

9. Address: I use my parents address. Don't judge me!

10. Hobbies after work: Skating or reading in a coffee shop. Mostly skating, and I'll go out with friends too.
     
    Weekends - usually camping, surfing, or anything outdoors. Lots of hiking and stuff.

11. Not worried about safety, the only times I have been harassed is by cops. 3 times. Not a cop hater, just saying.

12. The cab of the truck doesn't smell at all. Where I sleep, in the back, I would describe it as ""Stagnant Air"" LOL


Costs of setting this up: I have owed the truck for 2 years, only set it up this year, but for sake of being complete:

Truck- $7,000
Shell- $595.
Sleeping Pad- $100
Carpet - $10
Platform - $30 mostly recylced wood
Tint - $100

GUNPOINT STORY:
Went to bed about 11:30 parked in front of my shop on the street. Woke up at 12AM to cops screaming with their flashlights and guns held out telling me not to fucking move, don't fucking touch anything! I got out, in my boxers, and they proceeded to search me. I ended up on the curb for 10 minutes in my underwear while they berated me, telling me times are tough but you're not allowed to do this, what drugs are you on, etc. etc. They found nothing, they said to leave. I did a U-Turn, opened the gate to the shop, drove in, locked it and gave them the finger.

AMA,gypsywhisperer,4546,3005,2405,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13f0ib/iaman_18yearold_girl_who_had_a_breast_reduction_6/,"I had my surgery on May 18, and I'm 18 years old. I got it done mostly because of back pain, rashes from skin-on-skin contact, posture problems, and to increase my quality of life (self-esteem and whatnot)

Here are the basic questions I get:

**How much did it cost?**

Around $5,000, and insurance didn't cover. My parents paid.

**What size were you before? And now?**

I was a 32G and now I'm around a 34D.

**Why would you get it/You're slapping God in the face/People pay for big boobs**

I had really bad back pains, dents in my shoulders, rashes under them... blah blah.

**How much boobage did they remove?**

They took around 3/4lb from each, so, about 1 1/2 lbs overall. (293g from the left tit and 281 from the right)

**Will the scars fade?**

They'll always be there, but they will turn white as time goes on. I don't care. I'd rather have scars than have my boobs how they were before.

**Did they give you a lift?**

Yes! Typical reductions (except in the uncommon cases in which it's liposuction only) essentially take a wedge out of your boobs and move the nipple up.  It results in a lifted breast.

**Did they make your areolas smaller?**

Yep. It's procedure, and I see it as a bonus.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/TWVNR) (NSFW) is my progress album with proof.  RES users are encouraged to click on the link for captions because they can be quite gruesome out of context.

Anyways, AMA and I'm looking forward to your thoughts.

During their down time in between takes, the Heismans will be stopping by to answer your questions. Some of the guys may type their answers themselves, others may choose to dictate them to me. Either way, we’ll sign each comment so you know who it’s from.

A little background: Nissan has been a sponsor of the Heisman Trophy since 2005 (they even give us one vote, which we let the fans decide), and this is the third year we’ve worked with ESPN to produce the Heisman House spots. Here are a few of our favorites from last season:

Alright, with that out of the way, let’s get started! ~~**Barry Sanders**~~ **Desmond Howard** will be the first to join us today in about 30 minutes. The schedule of today’s shoot is fluid, so I’ll be grabbing the Heismans whenever they’re free. If your question is specifically for one of the guys, go ahead and mention that.

I've been asked to do an AMA and thought I'd tackle it when I have some more time - which is now! Most likely you know me as the creator and lead developer of the jQuery JavaScript library.

I first started working on jQuery sometime during 2005, while I was still in college, in order to alleviate much of the stress that I felt when trying to build cross-platform web applications. I was hacking on a number of projects at the time and had a couple hacky libraries I was using. I ended up merging them together, refining them a bit, and turning them into what is now called 'jQuery'.

Some more details about me and my projects can be found on my web site: http://ejohn.org/

Yesterday was the release of jQuery 1.6 and I just announced that I'm leaving the Mozilla Corporation to go work at Khan Academy:
http://ejohn.org/blog/next-steps-in-2011/

I'm a long time Reddit user as well (since 2006). I remember first hearing about it from Paul Graham back in 2005 but was still an ardent Digg user. I actually applied to be in the original Y Combinator program in 2005 but ended up getting rejected. Applied again in 2006, got in, and moved to Boston. While there I met Alexis (one of the creators of Reddit) and said something like ""Reddit seems neat, but a bit too high brow and boring."" Needless to say, I was a full-time user within the month. I remember going to at least a couple of their rooftop parties in Cambridge and one of my friends even sublet one of their rooms for a while.

I'm the creator and moderator of a large number of sub-reddits (about 53). I'm the creator of the following 5k+ user sub-reddits: sex, news, boston, javascript, travel, coding, photos, opensource, religion, google, haskell, firefox, mac, and europe. I'm also a moderator of fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu and relationship_advice. I use to own 'blog' but turned it over to the Reddit team (for a while they forgot to turn off my ability to submit new posts - but it's since been disabled - I should've used it when I had the chance!).

My favorite sub-reddits are fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu and starcraft. I read every f7u12 comic every day and I watch more casted Starcraft games than any other form of media (movies and TV included).

I recently realized, after talking with Max Goodman (@chromakode) - one of the new hires at Reddit - that I really need to start getting more involved in helping to improve Reddit. I dipped my toe in by providing an improvement to f7u12:
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/gwm95/rage_faster_fixed/

I recently started working on a new Node.js-based web application that will alleviate much of the stress that sub-reddit moderators feel (by allowing users to self-moderate themselves). I hope to have it done soon, message me if you moderate a sub-reddit and are interested in helping test it out.

So that this AMA isn't completely code and reddit-centric, here are some more things that I love:

* Art: I paint a little bit, collect a lot, study even more.
* Japanese Woodblock Printing: I study this art form extensively and I'm working to start the /r/ukiyoe sub-reddit. This is my primary interest outside of coding.
* Cooking and Food: Love cooking, cook meals almost every day. Travel extensively looking for great, hard-to-find, food.
* Movies and TV: Love film, go to film festivals, watch way too much good TV.
* Board games: Have 1-2 board games nights per week, my recent favorite is Hansa Teutonica.

That's all for now - ask away!

I was conscripted to fight for the Soviets, captured by the Germans, surrendered on the Western front, married a German woman and started a new life in the US. AMA",OldSoldierOpa,2748,1216,461,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xi6ve/iama_92_year_old_azerbaijani_world_war_ii_veteran/,"We're Matt (/u/nitroswingfish) and Mouna, and we'll be typing out the answers for Mouna's Opa (German for grandfather), Michael Mirson (born Mikhail Mirsayef - or as other family members in Azerbaijan write it Mirzeyev). We'll answer the questions in the first person (and where possible we will quote him verbatim to give you a feel for his level of English), and get to as many as possible. Opa gets tired pretty easily, so we will take breaks throughout the day, and if necessary we'll answer more tomorrow. Here's our summary of his story:
 
 
**Pre-War**

Born on a farm in Armenia, my father was taken to Siberia never to be seen again when I was 10 years old. The Soviets used the farm as a collective farm, killed our honey bees, and confiscated all of the livestock. At 16, I escaped from the farm and fled to Yerevan, Armenia. I managed to enter veterinary school, attended for three years, and was conscripted into the Soviet army in 1941. 
 
 
**War in the Caucasus**

The Germans soon pushed into the Caucasus Mountains, probably heading for oil-rich Baku, Azerbaijan, and the Soviets defended fiercely. While fighting in the mountains I was injured from a hand grenade explosion, with over 26 shrapnel pieces in my body. I was transported to Sochi on the Black Sea to a hospital and in November I was sent back out to fight back in the mountains. 

While fighting again the Germans surrounded our battalion, with fighting on all of our sides. I remember an explosion while I charged with my rifle and I was knocked out, awaking to a German kicking me in the back. My finger was hanging from my hand and was bandaged. Germans took our overcoats, and we suffered heavily through the night, with nearly half of my fellow soldiers freezing. Somehow I survived. We marched for four days into a valley that separated Georgia from Russia.

I was marched to a prison camp in a small city in southern Russia called Maykop, where I stayed for about three months. The Russians were advancing on the German position and we were given the choice of marching with the Germans or facing our Russian comrades who would, in our eyes, most definitely kill us for surrendering. Most chose to march towards German lines, though many died during that march. With so many wounded horses I was given the chance to show my veterinary skills and was given a position as an assistant veterinarian for almost three years with the German veterinarian.
 
 
**The War Ends**

Eventually we ended up in Austria, where we were fighting the oncoming Russians. A high ranking German officer came to speak to us. He told us the war was over. He told us we were on our own, and that the American line was about 50km west. He warned us that the Russian line would be more dangerous, but we only had about 5 or 6 hours to make it to the Russian line. 
 
 
**Fleeing to the American Lines**

Taking my time and giving my horse plenty of rest, I made it to the American line and was put into a camp as a German prisoner. With other Soviets, I convinced the American commander that we were not Germans, and just like that he let us go. I found work on a farm in Austria. When we learned that the area of Austria we were in was possibly part of Czechoslovakia, which would be Soviet territory, and fearing for our lives, we fled to an UNRA refugee camp in Germany and sought work.
 
 
**Post-War and moving to the US**

As a free man, I eventually met my wife in Amberg, Germnay, married in 1946 and had two children (including Mouna's mother). After that we came to the US by boat in 1951 in hopes of something better (my first choice was actually to move to Australia, but at the Australian consulate I was rejected because I am a Muslim). We had another child, lived and worked on farms, lived in New York City, worked any job necessary, moved to Boston, owned a diner, had a stroke, and live happily with our three daughters, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

While cataracts are usually an issue for the elderly in the US, cataracts are the leading cause of treatable blindness for people of all ages in the developing world. So far, the HCP team has restored sight to more than 260,000 children and adults in the most unreachable parts of the Himalayas and Sub-Saharan Africa with effective, high-quality cataract operations, and has trained hundreds of eye care professionals to treat their own citizens. 

A new book just came out that describes some of the work I’ve done and tells the story of my incredible colleagues and co-founders of HCP, Dr. Geoff Tabin and Dr. Sanduk Ruit. The book is called Second Suns: Two Doctors and Their Amazing Quest to Restore Sight and Save Lives. 

The book was featured in the [Washington Post] (http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-14/opinions/39972898_1_three-cups-cataract-second-suns)

Though I had some early success, I struggled with the idea of making poker a long-term career as I wasn't convinced it was sustainable as a way of contributing to a healthy and meaningful life, so I went to law school in 2008.  While there, I played and won a few tournaments including the NAPT Mohegan Sun for $750,000.  That win catalyzed my signing with Pokerstars and my return to a career as a pro, this time as a tourney donkey rather than a cash game pro who dabbled in tournaments.  I'm still not convinced poker as a career is fully healthy or meaningful, but I'm doing everything I can to make it that.

I have since graduated from law school and also become the highest earning female poker player of all time, [with more than $7 million in career earnings, ](http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&amp;n=68149) and a bunch of tournament wins.

I am also, incidentally, a lesbian, and a strong supporter of civil rights (LGBT and otherwise).  I am engaged to my wonderful fiancee and will be married in August of this year in New York.

I'll be back in 2 hours - at 2PM Pacific time.  What do you wanna know?

1297431326.0,1525,self.IAmA,fjfby,"IAmA Director of an ISP who was the first person to ever challenge the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act's ""National Security Letter"" provision.  AMA. ",NickCalyx,2883,1358,469,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fjfby/iama_director_of_an_isp_who_was_the_first_person/,"I was concerned with the legitimacy of the National Security Letter (NSL) [I received](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/4610_001_redactednsl.pdf) and I had concerns that the client was being targeted because of political speech.  I believed the FBI was demanding personal, sensitive, and constitutionally-protected information about one of my company's clients.   I have to be extremely careful about what I say when I speak on this topic due to the on-going gag.   I am allowed to say that the NSL sought a client’s name, address, telephone number, length of service, and transactional records including “transaction/activity logs,” “email header information,” account number, billing, email addresses, and anything I “considered to be an [electronic communication transactional record](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080606111.html).”

I refused to comply with the demand for information.  Instead, I called my lawyer and together, we paid a visit to one of the clients of my ISP - the NYCLU - New York Civil Liberties Union - affiliate of the ACLU.  Subsequently, I decided to file a challenge to the constitutionality of NSLs.  After a few bizarre and Kafkaesque discussions (*Q: had I broken the gag order by telling my lawyer? A: according to a literal reading of the NSL, yes I broke it several times over telling my lawyer, the NYCLU lawyer, and the ACLU lawyers.  Q: would a hood be put over my head and would I be dragged away for violating the gag by telling lawyers and filing a suit? A: nobody knew for sure - the original law was unclear as to the penalty*) I became the plaintiff in a court case originally known as ""[Doe v. Ashcroft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft)"" which was filed in 2004.    If you have been following [the news recently](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Tea-Party-Tally/2011/0209/Patriot-Act-upset-vote-Can-tea-party-lawmakers-liberals-be-friends) you will see that 7 years later, the after-effects of the constitutional challenge are still being felt.  

As the years passed and the person who held the office of Attorney General changed, the case was renamed from Doe v. Ashcroft to Doe v. Gonzales, and then to Doe v. Mukasey, and finally Doe v. Holder.  

The constitutional challenge resulted in the NSL provision being [repeatedly](http://www.lawsof.com/page/U.S.-District-Court-Strikes-Down-Statutory-Amendments-Made-by-U.S.-Patriot-Act.html) declared [unconstitutional](http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/59218.html) in the courts. ( As an aside, it was also ruled unconstitutional in [another case in Oregon](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/packet/200710/district-court-strikes-down-patriot-act%E2%80%99s-amendments-foreign-intellige) )  However due to procedural reasons/tactics ( e.g. the law being changed which sent the case back down to the lower court, the request for information being dropped - undercutting my right to challenge the law on 4th amendment grounds ) the case was prevented from ever reaching the Supreme Court and therefore the rulings were not binding on the FBI.  However the law was amended to fix some of the violations.  Also, we have learned a lot of information after the DoJ Inspector General performed [several](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/03/fbi_misuses_und/) [audits](http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6202763&amp;nav=QEMt) of the use of NSL's and found [widespread abuse](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032000921.html).  For years, these developments were in the news and NSLs were debated in congress.  I have strong views about the need for reform of the NSL statute and it is hard to accurately describe my frustration at being unable to participate in the public debate.

In 2007, on the campaign trail, then-candidate Obama said that during his Presidency there would be ""*no more National Security Letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime*"" because ""*that is not who we are, and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.*""   Unfortunately so far that promise has not yet come true.  In fact, their use has reached epidemic levels.  To get a sense of how many of these letters have been used - during just a 3 year period between 2003 and 2006 the FBI put out nearly *1 NSL per 1000 Americans*.  I don't believe there can possibly be that many terrorism or espionage suspects in the country.

For the years I was completely gagged, I read about my case in the newspapers and on websites, I read people commenting about it but I couldn't say a thing.  I heard my friends and particularly my colleagues discuss the case without knowing I was the plaintiff.  I would have liked to have organized the ISP community to speak out against warrantless searches but I was unable to.  Now I feel that I have 7 years of lost time to make up for.

As part of a settlement agreement, I became partially un-gagged in August 2010.  After I was partially released from the gag order I have been speaking out at every opportunity, to let people know why this is so wrong.  I have been profiled in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/business/media/10link.html?r=1), [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080906252.html), and in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/) magazine.  I have appeared on [National Public Radio](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/01/21/04) and on the [Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/11/gagged_for_6_years_nick_merrill) radio show.

Sometimes when people ask what being partially un-gagged means, I explain it this way: If there were 100 things I couldn't say before, now there are 98 things I can't say.  Anything that was ever redacted in the court documents is something I can't discuss under penalty of law, and there is the possibility of prosecution if I mess up any time I discuss the issue. However I feel that it is important enough to take that risk, because the very bedrock principles our country was founded upon are at stake.   I think the FBI has abused its gag power to squelch debate on the issue.  There are recipients of hundreds of thousands of NSLs out there - some of the recipients of those letters might be reading this right now - who cannot talk openly without fear of going to prison.

Internet users do not give up their privacy rights when they log on, and the FBI should not have the power to secretly demand that ISPs turn over constitutionally protected information about their clients without a court order. I hope my successful challenge to the FBI's NSL gag power will empower others who may have received NSLs to speak out.

I am now in the fund-raising stage of building a non-profit organization called [The Calyx Institute](http://www.calyxinstitute.org/) that will offer ISP services and telco services (VOIP), perform legal advocacy and defense, and also produce educational materials - and whose missions are to promote best practices in the telecom industry with regards to privacy and to protect the sovereignty of digital communications.  It is currently seeking a development director, by the way.  However, I should stress that I am writing this as an individual, not in my capacity as Director of that organization.  AMA.  However I may not be able to answer all questions due to the gag order.

tl/dr : I sued the FBI over the unconstitutionality of national security letters and was gagged for over 6 years

•Engine fire on the 10th - Caused everyone to wake up at 5:30 and get their life vests so. It was scary since you smelled smoke if you were on a lower level (we were on level 1).
•Fire lasted for 8 hours and no one could go back to their cabins since the smoke filled most and the heat was unbearable.
•We mostly sat around in lawn chairs for that day.
•You couldn't walk past most of the public restrooms without holding your breath because of the stench and the lower levels had wet, smelly carpets and were uncomfortably hot.
•On the 11th, people started taking their mattresses out on decks and slept outside (we did this as well).
•The toilets didn't work this whole time (this lasted through the 13th).
•We had the Carnival Elation, Conquest, and one more come and give us supplies. This was done through safety boats and a helicopter after one of the safety boats got pretty smashed up.
•Cold food (fruits, veggies, sandwiches)
•Low water pressure

It is their way or no way. They are rude, self righteous and believe they are entitled to everything.
 
They treat their men badly and barely care about their children. They grew up believing that their wedding day is the most important day in their lives and that their main focus throughout their life should be to find some guy that is supposed to grovel before them to marry. 

Not all women are that way but a a great majority as I have seen.
Many of my girl friends have infuriated me with their behavior and attitude towards their boyfriends/husbands, treating them like they were stupid and just plain being unreasonable cause they think that is ok and that is the way they should be. 
Why do you raise your children like that? Why do you continue to behave like that? Some women even acknowledge that how they are behaving is childish and rude but still do it because that ""is just the way it is"".

Edit: wow, I did not realize that this tiny insignificant post would get such a reaction. Thank you all for the interesting and insightful comments. It seems people either give a resounding ""yes"" or a ""up yours"" :D 
Some people seem to have misunderstood my statement to mean that Icelandic women are perfect or European women are awesome, this is not so. We all have our faults. This post is about the attitude I continually seem to run into here in the US. I maybe wrong, perhaps my sample group is to small or not varied enough. But so far this is what I see. Thanks again for all the input.

I really have enjoyed reading your comments (both good and bad) and it has given me lots of food for thought. 
Also, it seems that my comment on where I live got lost somewhere in there, so: I live in Northern California. I am 31 and yes I do have some awesome down to earth, hard working girl friends. I am married (big wooooot! to my hubby for standing up for me more then a few times. Love you baby &lt;3) so no I can't marry you sorry.

I realize that maybe some of these questions maybe answered elsewhere and/or common knowledge, but I haven't followed Mr. Collins' exploits since he's left Top Gear.  Since there has yet to be an AmA from him, I think it would be interesting to see some off-the-cuff answers from the man with a helmet for a face.

Questions: 

1. Aside from doubling as James Bond, whats next for you?
1. Since you had very little to say on the show, were there times when you had a strong opinion on something, if so, have any examples?
1. Not many people have the opportunity to teach a celebrity something new, which celeb did you get along with the most, which one was the biggest pain in the arse?
1. I understand that tensions were pretty high when you decided to reveal yourself as the Stig.  Between the BBC trying to prevent your book from being published and Jeremy's rantings, describe your current relationships with the other three presenters off-screen.
1. What's your favorite, every-day car and why?

Edit:  Wow, didn't expect this response!  I hope the word gets out to him.  Seems like there is still a bit of controversy over the man in reading the comments, but that should make for a good AMA... in my own mind.

Edit 2: Again, yes I realize that these questions are a bit generic and if I Googled I could have found them, but whats the fun in that?  We want Ben here for an AMA, so the rest of us can ask him all sorts of interesting questions that may not have been asked elsewhere.

OK, enough people (even personal emails) asked me to come by. I'll take any excuse to procrastinate from writing.

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.
Although, I will say that when she was guest starring on the show, I was in love with Linda Cardellini. She thought I was too young for her. Boo.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus, I'm joking. No one was an asshole.

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel, etc.). So they went a different direction.

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

5. Maybe, but I guess I don't think there's much point in dwelling on it.
But you're kind of perpetuating the assumption behind your question by not asking what we're up to nowadays.
I'll tell you anyway. ;)
Danielle has been doing a lot of hosting (The Dish) while going to college, and is now doing an MSN show called Last Night on TV: http://tv.msn.com/last-night-on-tv/ She's on twitter here: https://twitter.com/daniellefishel
Ben went to Stanford and is now doing indie films and writing. He is also on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BenSavage
Will is the king of voice over work. Currently, he's Lion-o on Thundercats (he's also writing for the show).
I'm having dinner with Danielle tonight. Maybe we'll post a photograph.

Assuming this is Danielle because of her tweet.

Okay, got a lot of requests for this from twitter! Rider and I are going to start a thread together later but for now, I thought I'd answer these questions.

1. I dated Matthew Lawrence for a little bit when we worked together but other than that, we all felt like family. I did have a crush on every single one of those boys at one time or another though. How could I not?!

2. Honestly no one was an asshole. Even all of the guest stars we had were fun, cool, easy to get along with people. If there was any ""asshole drama,"" I wasn't aware of it.

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

4. Rider and Ben were always good friends. Watching them act in scenes together is one of my favorite memories. Seeing them put together the boy band dance they used to do every week for the live audience was even better! ""Backstreets back, alright!!"" I laugh just thinking about it.

5. I don't think my career has suffered, per se. I wouldn't have a career w/o BMW and Topanga so I won't ever complain. Do I think it's hard for people to accept us as anything other than the roles we played on the show? Yes. But I'm just happy people even care after all these years. :)

P.S. Make sure you follow Rider on twitter (@onthestorm). He is incredibly smart, talented, and funny.

**ORIGINAL VIDEO OF THE BEATING, WARNING IF YOU ARE SQUEAMISH:**  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9y3SIPt7o

**There will be a live video AMA this evening on Vokle at 7 central time.  Thursday, December 1st, 7 central, 8 eastern.**  http://www.vokle.com/series/19652-hillary-adams

Reddit was the reason my mother and I actually have ground to stand on now, because no one ever believed us before the video was made public.  No one believed my father was such a person.  He was so perfect on the outside.

I've gotten messages from literally all over the world, Germany, Costa Rica, Netherlands, Australia, France, Mexico, the UK...  I had no idea it was such a global issue, that so many people were being hurt in their own homes.  I guess nobody really knows how to talk about it, since we're all badgered by our own respective situations into remaining quiet.  Well, that silence has been broken, and now a lot of people are speaking out about their own experiences with abusive parents.  Today I'm here to share my own story with you guys.

Thirty days ago, I was watching open-mouthed as the video's link climbed up to front page.  Reddit, thank you for saving not only me and my mother, but many other people out there who may not know what they're dealing with at home.

And now, I will get some basic questions out of the way to make room for the more unique questions I'm sure you Redditors can come up with.

Prologue:

There was barely a motive except for being frustrated at Dad's harassment over text messaging to both myself and my mother.  My mother would call me and cry, helpless and angry at his manipulation through my little sister.  I was sick of it.

A little over a year ago, Dad insisted on buying me a used Mercedes (I originally asked for a Mazda, but I went along with his idea because holy soap on a rope, a Mercedes!), and then yelled at me whenever I used it to transport anyone other than myself.  The agreement was that I was to return to college, and when I missed deadlines (my fault entirely), he told me to either purchase the car from him or return it and he'd release my school savings to me.  I told him ""speak of the devil, I'm waiting on a callback for a better job"".

Later that day, ""I got the job!  I can pay you for the car!""  Then suddenly, he wouldn't allow me to buy it and called me an ""insulting ingrate"", because I'd dared earlier to reach out to friends on twitter about his treatment of me and my mother.  He couldn't stand that I found a solution and was even more upset that I'd said a few words suggesting he was not perfect, and set me up for failure by demanding the car back and stranding me without a vehicle in the spread-out San Antonio, Texas, so there was barely any reliable way I could hold a job or go to college now.

I was so frustrated by his behavior that I uploaded the video privately and showed Mom, who burst out crying and didn't stop apologizing to me for three days.  She'd known the video existed since Spring, but had not watched it.  I told her I was thinking of publishing it.  She was afraid of what would happen and didn't encourage me nor hold me back.  After sleeping on it, Dad started harassing me about the car again, demanding it be returned.  I finally said ""do that and I release a video to the public of you beating the shit out of me"".

His response?  ""Do that if it will make you feel better.  You were never spanked but obviously should have been.""

**Q:  Why not solve it in private rather than going to the internet?**
A:  Dad was a County Court-At-Law Judge.  This meant he reigned over the county police, the entire courthouse, and different positions in town like the schoolboard.  He was the perfect citizen.  People swooned over him.  He won every election unopposed, and the two times he did have an opponent, he won by a landslide.  During the divorce when Mom felt threatened enough to call the police, Dad would talk to them and they'd mysteriously leave.  She tried talking to a counselor, but Dad had filled him in beforehand on the ""correct"" way to treat her complaints.  Whenever I tried to say I needed help and was being treated horrifically at home, people would scoff and tell me what a wonderful father I had.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO SOLVE IT PRIVATELY, because Dad would squash any outreach.  He controlled the community.  Anyone remotely employed with the government who knew how he really operated was scared to death to come forward, because he could have them fired.  He even threatened my little sister's school counselor's job if she said anything suggesting abuse during sessions.  I even called CPS days before the video went up and asked how to get a kid away from a severely manipulative and emotionally abusive parent, and I got fed a big ream of red tape.  Everything was useless.  He had always been winning and it wasn't changing.

My father once told me that the media could be considered like another branch of the law system, in a different sort of way, because they keep tabs on all kinds of other people.  I remembered this.  If the law was his turf, then the internet was mine.  And if the internet could keep tabs on the law, then...

I anonymously posted the video to /pol/, not saying I had anything to do with it.  When anons became outraged and demanded to know what was going on, I revealed that it was me.  They encouraged me to make the video's youtube link public.  So I did, and comments started appearing.  That's when the fire bit me and I posted it to Reddit.

**Q:  So your motive was...**
A:  To shock Dad into changing.  I wanted him to see that there were a number of people who were saying this was wrong.  It was wrong what he did.  I wanted him to see it and the comments and be horrified and apologize.  I wanted to turn a mirror on him.  Instead, he still believes he did nothing bad, as evidenced in this statement:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye2UeLBGnlk

**Q:  But wait!  He says you were caught stealing!**
A:  I used KaZaA to download video game music and terrible AMVs.  All he knew was that something was potentially illegal.  I was one of the best kids in town, my friends and I didn't stay out late, we didn't cause trouble, we didn't know what drugs and alcohol even were.  We didn't even litter.  Our idea of a fun time was going to a movie and Walmart.  So any tiny thing that I did that could even be perceived as wrong was blown out of proportion.

**Q:  He also says you weren't hurt.**
A:  Pfffffthahahahaha, I showed him the bruises all up and down my legs the day after the incident, and told him it hurt to walk.  He looked at me with his own two eyes and told me ""good"".  It is a preposterous lie that I wasn't hurt and I'm upset he would say such a thing.  He also lied through his teeth in the statement he released to the public, in which he said he was the ""primary"" support for me after I was out of the house, which is frankly a load of bullshit.  I work and my boyfriend works.  We pay our own bills, and we always have.  The only things my father paid for was my car and my phone, so he had control over my transportation and communication.  The perfect puppet strings.

**Q:  Why have you forgiven your mother and not your father?**
A:  Mom and I have always been best friends, and always were able to work through things, even if we squabbled.  We spent so much time together.  She gave up her career to raise me, a special needs baby, and guided me into college classes at age 15, and scholarships like the Coca-Cola Scholarship.  Without her I don't know if I'd be this far.  When I showed her the video, she was horrified.  She was broken.  She cried and stammered apologies to me for three days.  When Dad saw the video, he didn't think anything of it.

My grandmother once said a long time ago that it would take the entire world to get my father to change...  Now we have it, and it's still proving to be difficult...  It's so hard to stick to my guns of wanting to offer him help and counseling, because the more he withdraws and refuses to apologize, the more upset I am becoming.  I still need counseling myself.

No one at all should have to understand abuse or how it works, but unfortunately it's something that should be researched and taught, so we know how to protect ourselves.  Please, if you have never been manipulated or abused, think about inflammatory comments very carefully.  There are lots of people out there who share this unfortunate boat and it won't help a thing to make light of it.  Research battered wives, Stockholm Syndrome, narcissism, psychopathy, and the cycle of abuse that keeps people locked in.  It's frightening and absolutely anyone 100% can fall into it under the right circumstances.  Don't feed that line of ""I would have just walked away"".  **No, you wouldn't have.**  I apologize for being crass.  This is a serious subject.  Hopefully we can together approach it with tact and friendliness.

Alrighty, I think I got the main questions out of the way already.  I know it's a wall of text, but it's so difficult to condense...  Hopefully you guys will come up with some more creative questions instead!!

I really hope you'll join me tomorrow evening for the video broadcast!  :3  I want to talk about experience with the media and what Dr. Phil was like and all that.

But most of all, thank you, Reddit.  You guys saved me and my mother, and you saved countless other people out there too.  I myself had no idea that video was so bad until you guys and /pol/ told me.  Thank you.

To answer the questions that were in the request thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11k29d/ama_request_a_father_who_found_their_daughter_on/

1. When my parents found out, they confronted me and were PIIIIISSED! They pretty much disowned me and told me that they were ashamed to have me as their daughter.

2. They did confront me. See above.

3. They did not tell the family members. They don't want anyone to know. My dad is really high up in the company he works for (Regional Vice President of the company)

4. They were so angry. But its been roughly 6 months or more since they found out and they're pretty cool with it. They still HATE it and harass me for it sometimes but its whatever. They love me now.

So reddit, AMA about what my parents did or anything about doing porn. :D

Edit 2: I'm back. I was doing a dungeon with my friend :D Yeahhh!

**EDIT 3: 7:00pm EST 10/16** So to answer a few questions that everyone has asked... My parents and I are on the same page now. We're on good terms. We kind of swept this under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist. It does come up from time to time but we kind of laugh about it. My mom has told me that she has seen my stuff and she must admit that I am good at what I do, but she does not like what I do. She thinks I should use my talents for better things. Also, I'll still be answering questions periodically. I like the questions!

What exactly do I do?
I shoot both stills and video, as well as edit for a living. I have also performed in many scenes. I am lucky enough to now be an Evil Angel director and be part of that upper tier. 

What is your background?
I am 40 years old and did not make the plunge full time into doing this until 2000. Prior to that I grew up in Western Massachusetts. I was a UNIX SysAdmin for the UMASS campus in Amherst, where I was very active in the 90's running a series of Quake Servers and Counter Strike Servers called Yoda's Barn. I was also active on the SomethingAwful Forums (username: darkpriest) and the Offtopic Forums (username: dv8). Though my life is fairly hectic now, I will always be very much into and a fan of video games. 

Somewhat ironically this earlier comment on Reddit references a thread I have done on SA talking about my time in the industry: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/di6sy/as_requested_i_used_to_shoot_porn_ama/c10ee59

How exactly did you get into this?
I can partially thank Mitt Romey. Somewhat long story, but let me explain... I used to work an adult shop when I was 18 and always had an interest in porn and sex. That began my first insight into the industry from a video stores perspective. I learned a little bit about the business, however it wasn't until the mid 90's that I began really pursing it. I was very lucky to be at a major college (UMASS) right when the Internet was really starting to blossom. I jumped head first into it and when a company called iBill began allowing third party processing for credit card payments, I tried to start an amateur adult site around my girlfriend at the time. I did this out of my dorm room. 

I eventually moved into a full time career at UMASS working as a junior SysAdmin, but on the side still ran my amateur sites. I also began attending CES and would slip away to the adult section and try to make inroads to people there from all the various companies that produce adult movies. I also began shooting female performers while they were on tour at strip clubs in the New England area. I would shoot photos of them at the club for various little magazines like Xcitement or whomever would buy them. 

Mitt Romney became the Governor of Massachusetts and he gut funding to public education. Since UMASS was a state school, it had major budget cuts. In order to save people from layoffs, the union worked out a deal where employees could take a voluntary layoff, which included a small package to take care of you. I knew that my life was at a crossroads. I could stay at Umass and weather the storm or I could take a huge risk and due the voluntary layoff, use that money to relocate to LA and pursue shooting adult full time. I chose the layoff and moved to LA. 

My initial time in LA was at first very rough. Luckily I had made some good contacts by this point, but it is an expensive city to live in. I had gotten a gig at the trade publication for the adult industry (AVN) doing photos of events, tradeshows and performers on tour. I had a chance meeting with Joey Silvera, who is somewhat an icon in the industry. He was a long time performer in the 70's and 80's. He was now a producer/director at Evil Angel. Joey and I kind of hit it off. His assistant the time quit and he needed another assistant. He asked me if I wanted to do it and I started working for him. That really began the day to day shooting and working in the trenches. 

I learned so much from Joey and I spent many years working for him. From Joey I met John Leslie and Rocco Siffredi and John Stagliano and began working at times for all of them. Eventually, after many years of working under them, I began to branch out on my own. I started shooting stills and movies for a wide variety of companies and the rest they say is history. Eventually I was offered by John Stagliano the chance to direct at Evil Angel and now I do that, while also producing content for other companies. My list of credits include: Evil Angel, Hustler, Jules Jordan, Brazzers, Smash, Pink Visual, Reality Junkies, Sweetheart Video, Sweetsinner Video and the list goes on.

What do you shoot with?
For photos I used to be a Nikon guy, do or die. However, when I first saw the Canon MarkII I realized that this might change things. It was a small financial burden, but I dropped all my Nikon gear and glass and reinvested in all Canon gear. I was using the MarkII heavily, but now use two MarkIII's and recently picked up the 1DX. I shoot both stills and video with these cameras. I no longer use video cameras. Prior to shooting with the DSLR's, I was using a solid state Sony EX3 camera. It is still a great video camera, but the quality you can get out of the current DSLR's is amazing. I use a wide variety of after market products to make shooting easier with DSRL's. 

Why do you do this?
That is a complicated question and if I were to get insightful I am sure it has to do somewhat with my upbringing and also my outlook. I was raised in a very serious irish catholic household. Sex was a massive taboo, however I never viewed girls as ""icky"" even at a very young age. The problem was that for a long time I couldn't come to terms with the way I was raised versus how I felt. It caused me incredible internal conflict and as Alec Baldwin once put it, being irish catholic is guilt upon crushing guilt. 

What I now know as an adult is that I feel very strongly that adults should be allowed to express themselves sexually with other consenting adults. Repression is a terrible thing. Porn to me is escapism entertainment. It is like people watching ""professional"" wrestling. Everyone knows its fake, yet people still love it Just like horror movies and other forms of entertainment it allows people to escape the stress of their life and for 15 minutes live out some sexual fantasy they probably will never experience. Sex isn't always rainbows and butterflies. Sometimes we use it to explore our own turmoil. I fully understand that it is not for everyone and not everyone views it the same as I. 

I realize this might have been extremely long, I appreciate you taking the time to read it and would love to answer any and all questions.

Today marks the longest period of time I've gone without it since I started. Four years of snorting and smoking. I never fixed, not once. I don't like needles and never particularly wanted AIDS. Even at my lowest point, the idea of fixing skeeved me out.

I had the help of Prince Valium for the first couple days. That helped me sleep and maintain a bit of my sanity. 

The worst part, the part I was dreading most, rather, were the *super* intense muscle aches. It hurts down to your bones and makes you grit your teeth until you feel like they're coming loose. 

But those have since passed. My nose is still a little runny and I'm shitting like a fire hose. So basically it feels like I'm getting over a bout with the flu. I never puked or itched, two nasty things I was expecting.

I'm a little depressed. Nothing very serious. I went out today for the first time since Wednesday. I forgot how much more laborious everything is without smack, everything requires so much deliberation and patience. This is *absolutely not an endorsement*, but that's the one good thing about the shit: it makes you incredibly passive to life's minutiae. 

I find that I have to pump myself to do small things. Yesterday, I watched an hour of a movie I hated because I didn't want to get up and look for the remote. 

I've ""tried"" a few times in the past to kick smack. And, yes, those quotation marks imply sarcasm. Those attempts were ill-fated from the get-go.

Anyways, if you're curious or you're looking to kick it, ask me anything and I'll be as forthcoming as I can be.

1364135697.0,1492,self.IAmA,1awx2u,[Modpost] Some changes regarding IAmA requests and comments,IAmAMods,3408,1916,552,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1awx2u/modpost_some_changes_regarding_iama_requests_and/,"TL;DR at the top: New rule on celebrity requests, and moderation of comments

1. **New Rule for Celebrity Requests**

For those of you who have never been to this subreddit before, we get a lot of requests for celebrities here. The problem with requests is that they just take up space from actual AMAs. They are tolerated because [they do sometimes lead to actual AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14vlg2/meta_should_there_be_a_separate_subreddit_for_ama/c7gtys2). There are three main ways that this happens. First, the celebrity is secretly a reddit user and sees the request (not that common). Second, someone who knows the celebrity sees the request and tells them about it (more common, but still rare). Third, users themselves contact the celebrity, informing them of /r/IAmA and that there is interest in hearing from them.

This 3rd reason is the reasoning behind the new rule. **From now on, any request for a celebrity must include a way to publicly contact them**. Their twitter page, their facebook page, the contact sheet from their website, whatever. Any way that our users can tell this person that we want an AMA from them. Requests that do not comply with this requirement will be deleted. If you cannot find a publicly available way to contact that celebrity, then do not post your request. 

This does **not** apply to requests for non-celebrities (example, ""AMA request: Joe Schmoe, lead designer of New Video Game), or requests for no one in particular (example, ""AMA request: a farmer""). It **only** applies to requests for celebrities. 

This does not change **anything** about Reddit's [rules on posting personal information](http://www.reddit.com/rules):

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting a link to your friend's facebook profile.

&gt; **OK**: Posting your senator's publicly available contact information

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting the full name, employer, or other real-life details of another redditor

&gt; **OK**: Posting a link to a public page maintained by a celebrity.

To clear things up, here are two requests: one in compliance with the rules, and one not:

[**Acceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1bp/iama_request_jason_bateman/)

[**Unacceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1dc/ama_request_jason_bateman/)

2. **Moderation of comments**

[Although the mods have implored our users to act respectfully and courteously](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/184yf5/mod_post_voting_guidelines_and_etiquette/), unfortunately that just isn't enough sometimes. In order to continually get good AMAs from people with interesting experiences, /r/IAmA needs to build a reputation as being different from other interviews where users can ask anything, but also as a place where people will be treated politely and actually listened to. In order to balance those two interests, the moderators **will be removing comments designed solely to harass, abuse, or threaten the OP**. This *absolutely* does not mean that you should not ask tough questions; only that you should do so civilly. From now on, something like ""Fuck you, OP"" will be removed, but ""OP, why did you do [something I disagree with]"" is perfectly fine. Slurs and other hate speech will be specifically targeted. From now on, **please** report any comment that just insults and harasses someone answering questions. 

We hope that both of these rules will bring about plenty of good AMAs from whoever the users want to hear from.

I am sorry for not being able to answer a lot of your questions but the internet in Egypt was blocked for the six past days, I really want to share what happened with us the past few days because the world knows nothing about the chaos in Egypt since last Friday.


I am deeply grateful for all your wishes and kindness in my last thread, although I've seen most of your comments just now, you guys made me feel that the police is still throwing us with tear bombs.

I am going to give you a live report on the last few days and hopefully I will answer all your questions along the way.

This started on Tuesday when I went to a protest for a democratic change in Egypt, I really can't claim I'm a political activist, I can just claim to be a normal Egyptian fed up with the corruption I see everyday, everywhere, affecting everybody.

I wouldn't consider myself poor, but I wouldn't consider myself rich either, but I would consider myself one of the privileged citizens in Egypt for having steady income, a car and living in a relatively high-class suburb.

I've slept on the street for the first time in my life on Tuesday 25 January, when more than 20K protestors stood in ""Al Tahreer"" square in Egypt protesting corruption in Egypt, it was one of the best days in my life, I've seen the true face of Egypt, there were people of all ages, sexes and classes in protests that day, I've seen the poor, the rich, the striving minority, Christians, Muslims, opposition and even Army men.

Moving on to Wednesday 26 January, I already provided details on my arrest, I was arrested at the protests and was released after 12 hours, in the dawn of the next day.

Thursday was kind of a slow day, I was at home recovering of my wounds from being beaten badly by the police, I wrote [my first AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f9zac/i_was_caught_and_brutally_tortured_in_the_recent/) here on reddit, to my amazement it jumped to the frontpage, I wasn't expecting near that kind of response but I thank you guys for that, apart from some tear bombs being thrown by the police not much action that day, apart from reddit action of course. Facebook, twitter, Aljazeera, BBC, and a couple of other sites were blocked Thursday night.

The big event was on Friday at noon, and I note that by then Egypt has been thrown into complete solitary confinement, everything was cut down; the internet, mobile signal, Messaging services and even some landlines.

I walked nearly 50 Kms that day, thinking of it I can say that I've walked in the past week further than what I've walked in my entire life.

I walked from one suburb to the other, the protest was getting more people every minute, we reached the point where I couldn't see the beginning or the end of the march from an elevated position, it was a huge march but it was only one of tens or hundreds of similar marches in Cairo that day.

Near downtown it was obvious that there was an intense presence of police forces and when we reached the suburb of ""Attaba"" the police forces became unbelievably violent, they were throwing tens of tear bombs at the crowds and children were suffocating, I carried a trapped girl on my shoulders while running and vomiting heavily because of the tear gas being everywhere, I was shot a couple of times by rubber bullets but kept on running, I actually thought they were shooting live rounds and judging by my last encounter with them I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

As I said before there wasn't much resentment towards the US in Egypt apart from supporting Mubarak's dictatorship, but once some people pointed out the ""Made in the U.S."" Mark on the tear bomb cans everyone entered a deep state of anger towards both America and Mubarak's regime.

Soon we learned that not only ""Attaba"" was viciously attacked by the police but everywhere else, and from being there I can testify that the police started the violence in what I have seen myself to be a peaceful march.

Later that day the violence escalated and we were treating the police as our enemies -and they have proven to be so- and Mubarak's arrogant speech got everyone more provoked.

At night we saw the Egyptian heavy artillery roaming the streets, and I'm noting here that Egyptians love their army to death, although no public demands have been answered or met we were happy to see the Army and considered that to be a phenomenal gain.

As the army's presence increased the Police were escaping the protestors' violence -which the police initiated and provoked- and after the burning down of most police stations all the criminals escaped -some claim by the police themselves- and Cairo had thousands of thugs and criminals on the streets and a complete absence of police forces, I see that as a major treachery from the police, please contact me with what I should do if you happen to know any legal actions that should be done, I will leave you guys for a couple of hours I have to go get me some food and when I'm back I will post details about my life after the police vanished from Cairo and answer all your questions.

Edit: Continuing

I must note a couple of random things, On Friday I got shot by rubber bullets and another kind of bullets that splits mid-air into hundreds of metal pieces and hurts a lot on impact, I saw death twenty feet away, I felt scared like I have never felt before in my life, I saw a building collapsing in front of my eyes and my respiratory system now runs on oxygen and tear gas.

Later that day I heard of thugs being released into the streets and I was terrified for my family, I went home to find people gathered and taking shifts to guard our neighborhood, I took place at the top of a 15-story building as a lookout for thugs that come in groups armed with AK47s and pistols stolen from the police stations, I stood in place till dawn and I saw an army vehicle opening fire on one of these armed mobs a couple of blocks away, it was terrifying and some of my neighbors nearly opened fire a couple of times on individual thugs.

Saturday and Sunday were the worst, due to the absence of the police force a couple of prisons were attacked and a lot of convicts got away, I heard a lot of bullets being fired that day, a couple of armed thugs were arrested downtown and proven to be police officers, which increased the state of hatred we all felt towards them.

I was a ground trooper the next few days, I got my ancient air-gun out and took shifts walking down the streets, I was given a walkie-talkie and was in touch with the neighborhood leader, a couple of thugs threw molotov cocktails on our cars and fired a couple of rounds but were arrested and handed to the army.

Till this hour we still have guarding shifts and mine starts in about 5 hours, I just want to note that we took care of our neighborhood better than the police ever did, people were out handing us food and drinks and blankets, I feel proud of every Egyptian that took responsibility these couple of days but a couple of questions are still unanswered: Should we let the police take control of the streets again despite their obvious treason to us Egyptians? What can I do to help in punishing those officers responsible for beating me up? 

**Important note:** As I said there were a lot of Christians in the protests, the protests were not dominated by any political party nor is this by any means an Islamic revolution as the stupid ""Fox News"" is trying to make it appear, these protests were purely political and social and not religious.

**Flickr:** [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59057377@N07/sets/72157625960891810/) you will find every picture I took, photos from the past week will be added, when they arrested me they confiscated my memory card so unfortunately not all the pictures are with me, I'll upload what I can. 

**Important edit: Help! Some of my friends just called to let me know they released hundreds of thugs downtown Cairo under the guidance of police officers and intelligence agents with the sole purpose of infiltrating the protests and lots of protesters were killed, I'm in shock right now and I feel so helpless, PLEASE HELP.**

I would like to focus primarily on the battle of Okinawa, but other topics are free game, such as the Great Depression, growing up in Queens, NY in the 1930s...or anything Marine Corps related.

At that point I begin to seriously question my decision to leave my desk job and [take on $87,932 of debt](http://i.imgur.com/rYWPh.jpg) to try and get what I thought was an important message out there, and also be able to keep coaching high school sports year-round.

Coaching has been an invaluable way of getting in touch with exactly where our upcoming generation is at in terms of race relations and values - I've coached both welfare kids and some of the wealthiest and notoriously privileged private school kids in the country. 

After being loosely affiliated with a couple social media companies, I decided to just go ahead and [throw the entire thing up online where you can read it for free](http://tremblethedevil.com/?page_id=1131). If you want to get an idea of what it's like, [this post is a general overview of my take on terrorism](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=12), and [this one gets into specifics about just how damaging the War on Drugs has been](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=2310).

In the same way that you can go into a bookstore and browse as long as you'd like or listen to just about anything online totally for free, but to really take something with you, you have to pay for that convenience - if you'd like to keep reading offline [you can buy an e-copy of the book for your Kindle or Nook](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=1307), or get [a physical copy of it](https://www.createspace.com/3631725).

1295899831.0,1461,self.IAmA,f89jr,Six years ago my wife and I sold everything and bought a 90ft tunnel oven to make cookies. We're now shipping between 1 and 4 thousand pounds per week.  AMA,begreen123,3101,1640,1461,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f89jr/six_years_ago_my_wife_and_i_sold_everything_and/,"I'm a business owner and entrepreneur and I haven't worked for someone else since I was 19. I'm doing this AMA so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.  The cookie business wasn't my first, nor most successful but it is the one I'm proudest of. Some background:

My adventures started when I was 6 with my own Fire Department in Cleveland, I would pull my red wagon up and down the street with a step ladder, fire extinguisher and garden hose looking for fire (until I got discouraged &amp; spent my time building forts). At 9 I ran a multi-route, paper route and hired other kids to deliver for me. By 19 I was eager to ""begin life"" and I dropped out of Bradley University in Peoria. Shortly after that I started my first ""real business"": it was a burglar alarm for apartments. I developed &amp; manufactured the product and sold them by hiring an off-duty detective from the local police force to give “security presentations” in luxury apartment buildings. We would use the party room, he would present statistics, speak about crime and the responsibility of protecting property and I would give a product demonstration and collect orders. A friend would go the next day and install the alarms. This worked out well as I had low overhead &amp; was making a good income.

Some amount of “beginners luck” helped me along the way, the first product that I ever developed with the intention of mass producing was chosen as one of the 100 most important products developed in the world the year that I developed it. This was in 1977, back in the “mechanical” age. Since then, I've developed impact recorders, mechanical accelerometers, temperature recorders to monitor the shipment of perishables, and a widely employed derailment detector to stop subway derailments before they become catastrophic. 

Currently I run a business that employs 30-40 people and we produce everything ""in-house"" near Los Angeles. We are selling high quality dog treat &amp; nutritional supplements in about 2,500-3,000 stores nationwide, a disposable poop scooper (we produce about 20 million annually) and the best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat which I started because I missed the 70's style cookies that made the original Famous Amos a Los Angeles sensation. My cookies are currently being sold in about 200 stores and we're shipping anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 lbs per week.

Not directly business related but things you may find interesting. I was on “[What’s my Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_My_Line%3F)” and got to hang out with [Soupy Sales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soupy_Sales) for an hour, I inspired a front page article in the New York Times regarding corruption and I've coached entrepreneurs &amp; spoken to groups when invited. I’ve been very fortunate in life &amp; see my overall purpose as propagating happiness through my cookies &amp; being of service to others, if I can contribute anything here feel free to ask. 

I've been very impressed with Reddit and the community and this inspired me to do an ""AMA"".  Hope you find it useful.

EDIT: Added some pictures: [Tunnel oven and the bus we lived out of while trying to start this dream](http://imgur.com/a/bj6w3)

EDIT2: Here's the picture of the [bus](http://imgur.com/WB73u) originally and [today](http://imgur.com/a/p022m).

EDIT3: Please be patient with me, I'm a slow typer

EDIT4: I've been asked for a coupon code (and about 42 boxes of free cookies) so you can use reddit for 30% off on our [website](http://bartsbakery.com).  This allows us to cover our costs only, just for you guys!  PS. I may have a job for someone who can help us build a better site.  We're having some problems with this one.

*EDIT5: Reddit is more amazing then I could have ever imagined!*

EDIT6: Here are some pictures of the [interior](http://imgur.com/a/fejph), there is a long 4-page story that goes with. I'm not sure if this link works [scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/47495891/our-bus-story) but this is our bus story!

EDIT7: Can't believe the support, thank you. If you'd want free cookies join our [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/bartsbakery) page and we're going to do them for people's birthdays (fair warning, I'm not sure how yet).

EDIT8: I'm seeing a lot of comments regarding gluten free cookies and wanted to say that we HAVE tried this but with no success, we can't get them to come out crispy.  With this much interest though we will be trying again.

ALMOST FINAL EDIT: Thank you everybody, Your responses have been wonderful &amp; your comments were appreciated &amp; questions intelligent &amp; important. For everyone who's ordered, we're baking your cookies on Thursday &amp; shipping on Friday &amp; Monday. They're being sent by USPS &amp; this will takes about a week. Many more interactions to follow -thank you all for your great support, Bart &amp; Judy Greenhut &amp; the bakery team.

STILL CLOSER TO FINAL EDIT: We baked about 2,000lbs of cookies for Redditors &amp; shipped our first batch yesterday, more will be sent out on Monday. We heard back from the butter creamery in Normandy so in about 6 or 8 weeks we're going to try a run using what we think is the best butter we've ever tasted. -you guys can let us know what you think.
Look for something very cool in a few days...  besides cookies! -we're going to change the world, together SOON!

FINAL EDIT: what a great experience! I hope everyone is enjoying their cookies and having a wonderful moment. ",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,True,business,,True,t3_f89jr,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f89jr/six_years_ago_my_wife_and_i_sold_everything_and/,
