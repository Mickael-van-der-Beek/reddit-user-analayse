Go to [this link](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/Default.aspx) to find out where your polling place is, and to see exactly what your ballot will look like.

* **I'm not registered to vote, can I still vote?**

YES!  Use the link above to find your polling place, and show up there on election day (between 7am and 8pm) with the following items:

a. Photo ID (if your current address is on this ID, this is all you need)

b. If address on ID is different from current address, bring the ID and a document with **your name** and your **current address** (such as a utility bill, pay stub, etc) from the **past 30 days**; if you get online bills, just print one out, or bring your laptop/smartphone

* **I just moved/I don't pay any utilities/none of the bills are in my name, what do I do?**

Bring someone else with you who lives in your precinct and is registered to vote.  They can vouch for you that you live where you say you do.  If they're not registered but they do have proof of their residency, have them register first, then vouch for you.

* **I want to vote but I can't walk/drive to my polling place**

No problem!  You can sign up for a free ride to the polls, and someone will pick you up at whatever time you want.  There are several organizations who will do this.  One of them is Minnesotans United, and if you call **800-801-9286**, they will sign you up for a ride.

***

Now for the personal appeal:

Voting is a very important civic duty, and regardless of who/what you vote for, I hope that you and everyone you know will go out and exercise your civil rights.  That said, it would personally mean a lot to me if you vote NO on the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment.  Here are some reasons why they matter to me:

**Voter ID**

1. The amendment is written very poorly.  It doesn't account for a lot of unintended consequences.

2. Unlike voter ID measures in almost every other state that has them, the writers of this amendment didn't make any exceptions for active military personnel or the very elderly who no longer have birth certificates.

3. No other state with voter ID laws has same-day voter registration. Election officials have said that the law, as currently written, would force same-day registration to end.

4. Unlike other states, the way the law is currently written would not allow students from non-state schools in Minnesota to use their student IDs.

5. The amendment, as currently written, is estimated to cost the state $30-50 million.  The state will have to pay for it by increasing property taxes.

6. Once it's in the constitution as currently written, it can't be changed, even if the legislature realizes that is has some unintended consequences; they will be forced to enact those laws because the constitution is the highest law; therefore, we should send it back to the legislature and make them rewrite it, and decide **beforehand** how they plan to enforce the law, so they don't force us to vote on something without first knowing all of the consequences.

**Marriage Amendment**

1. No one would want to be told it's illegal to marry the person they love

2. Gays and lesbians will always be in the minority; therefore, it's up to everyone, especially straight people, to stand up for and protect their rights

3. No single religion should be held above others and put into law, especially not the Constitution. Many religions, such as 3 of the 4 Jewish Movements (including mine), 5 of the 6 Minnesota Lutheran synods, many Baptists, Episcopalians, Anglicans, Quakers, Unitarians, and others, have same-sex marriage.  We shouldn't be discriminating against those religions.

4. The polls show that the vote is 50-50.  Whether the amendment is defeated will come down to how many people show up on election day. **You could be that 1 vote that makes the difference** (think of Al Franken's election)! How empowering is that???

***

Thank you all!  Please pass on all the information about how to vote to your friends.  This is a really important election and it's really important that you actually go out and vote!  I'm happy to answer any questions about how to vote if anyone is still not sure.

1370910690.0,33,self.Minneapolis,1g31y9,Please please PLEASE lock your bikes! That's three posts about stolen bikes in less than a day.,nullrend,44,11,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1g31y9/please_please_please_lock_your_bikes_thats_three/,"Where not even halfway through the summer yet and this is happening. Come on guys, don't have your stuff stolen:

* Always lock when left unattended:
I can't remember where I read this but apparently the vast majority of bike theft is *opportunistic*. That is, someone leaves the bike alone for two minutes to go get some coffee then goes back outside to find the bike isn't there anymore. I've seen plenty of people do it all around town and while they might justify it by saying ""It was a piece of shit bike, I'll just get another"", you can't really say that when the bike was expensive, had sentimental value, is your only owned means of transportation, or had all three properties at once.

* Lock both frame and wheels:
A nice u-lock for the frame is basic now, but having a cable, cable lock or another u-lock for the front wheel really helps when you have to leave the bike outside. If you have quick-release wheels, it's a must to lock both wheels. How many bikes have you seen without their front wheel? I've seen many.

* Lock in a visible place: That is, somewhere people are around and where someone might say something if a lock is being cut or a wheel removed. Some places hide their racks 'to avoid an eyesore' but really, that just makes it easier for a thief to do his thing.

* Don't fucking buy a bike from some dude in a street corner. You know it's stolen.

A really determined thief will always get the bike he wants, specially at night. If you can, always bring your ride indoors for the night. You might complain about carrying it three floors up, but you know no one is going to take it while you sleep. If you must leave it outside, don't use a puny 4-digit combination lock that anyone can pull on. Use a lock you could brain someone with, along with another, lighter one for the front wheel.

If you really care about your bike, you could try using [SpyBike](http://www.integratedtrackers.com/GPSTrack/) or [BikeSpike](http://bikespike.com/).",,False,self,t5_2r3bl,1370911742.0,,,True,t3_1g31y9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1g31y9/please_please_please_lock_your_bikes_thats_three/,

Holy. Fucking. Shit. This god damned road construction on University is getting old, really quick. After 2+ months of solid jackhammer noise and construction nonsense, they FINALLY finished the sidewalk and infrastructure improvements. No more waking up at 7:00am against my will due to excessive noise. All is well in the world.

NOPE.

Motherfucks are back at it again. Apparently, a few small standing puddles near the sidewalk corners are unacceptable, and they are spending thousands of dollars to tear up the sidewalk they *just* poured a week or two ago. Not to mention pouring asphalt **between 12am and 2am on weeknights** with loud construction noises waking up neighbors... it just won't end.

I mainly work from home, so I've had to put up with this shit all day every day this summer. It's especially painful because they begin working at 7:00am sharp and have no fucking mercy. Jackhammers at full force, with no regard to the neighbors. Anyone else sharing this pain?

Video example taken a few minutes ago of the shit I have to deal with all fucking day: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bSuOYpybtk

Sorry for the rant.

Also, and I think this is the most important part, I have had the best customer service experience of my life with this company.

I've already checked the impound lot's website and called the police (it's been an hour and a half and they still haven't shown up, so I figured I'd make this post in the meantime). 

My car is a dark red 1997 Honda Accord 4 door with a rear spoiler [(stock photo without spoiler)](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/vehicle-pictures/1997/honda/accord/96802041990217-480.jpg). If any of you could keep an eye out for it, I'd really appreciate it. I have some personally meaningful books and CDs in the car, as well as both of my yoga mats. 

It was stolen not far from [this intersection](http://goo.gl/maps/IDrNn), sometime between 8:30pm last night and 6 pm today, which was when I first noticed it was missing. Any help or suggestions you can give would be really appreciated. 

**UPDATE** - Got a call this morning saying it was found at the St. Paul impound lot, and that it's stripped and isn't driveable. Wish I could find the people that did this and turn them in so they couldn't do this to anyone else. I appreciate everyone who took the time to upvote or comment. Thanks for all the help and support.

I'm looking to start a team in the Kenwood Park Kickball league.  I played tennis at Kenwood Park a lot last spring and noticed that there were some sweet kickball games going on.  There's gotta be somebody here who is in that league.  I couldn't find much when I googled it.  

EDIT: ding ding! i found my answer!  quoth morganbird: If it's Tuesday or Wednesday night I'm 95% sure it's a pickup game. I sometimes play in a pickup game at Painter Park and sorta know a few people in the Kenwood game. You can probably just go introduce yourself and ask to play with them if you want to.

EDIT 2: The-Cure says:The Painter Park League starts Wed. April 25th, at 6pm. They meet every Wednesday until July 18th. There are other Leagues for every other night of the week, but they play in various parks near Painter Park (Bryn Mawr Meadows, Northeast Park, Bossen, and a few others). If everyone wants to start a team, lets figure out what night would be best. They are all co-ed 18+ Adult League, 10-20 team members (equal ratio of men/women mus be fielded at all times). Fees are $395 for the season. That's 12 regular season games and maybe potential for playoffs. Registration begins in 1 week, Feb 19th. 

EDIT 3:auriolrd says:**Hello! I am a weekly player in the Tuesday night kickball game. It is 100% a pick up game and open to anybody who wants to play. We're very loosely organized but announcements on when in the year we're going to start playing are done via our Facebook group page. PM me your Facebook info and I will invite you to the group!**

Please let me know if any of these are you! PM me of comment if you are comfortable! 

I currently live in a studio by myself and am lonely. 

need someone to reassure you I am awesome? I my bf has a reddit account, too. 


Hope you are just as nerdy as I am and loves to hang with cool people cause me and my cat are looking for you!!! lets chat it up! Go out for a drink or two and see if we click!!! 

BTW if you have a boyfriend as well, but not looking for him to move in as well, that wouldbe awesome, too!!!! 

**edit:** After some reevaluating I have noticed where I went wrong in a step here. My boyfriend is not comfortable with me living with single men. Its not a me thing. I am generally really reasonable, but I do not wish to go against his wishes. I also dont talk about him all the time. I talk more about my cat (dont even get me started!) and no, I am not a crazy cat lady. She is the first pet I have ever had on my own and I am just very proud of her and love het to bits.

I am moving to your city in a few weeks. My apartment is located in Uptown, in the Lowry Hill area. I have been reading about the public wifi available in Minneapolis and, as someone who spends too much time on the internet, am a bit concerned about having super slow internet all year. 

I know it varies by location and people probably have varied experiences, but I was hoping to learn a little more about it and what the people of Minneapolis really think about the public wifi system and how effective it really is. I'd also like to hear from anyone who is using something different for their internet service. I'll continue to do my own research but I thought I could get some valuable input from you guys.


Also, if anyone knows how I can figure out what the average electric bill would be for my future apartment, I'd really appreciate it.

I'm wondering if it would be smart to bundle previous posts requesting housing advice because we seem to get that question here 2-4 times a month?

For example, the Frisbee subreddit compiled their cleats advice posts because it kept reappearing on the thread. [Here's what it looked like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/mc6ik/cleats_suggestions/)

We could do the same thing where we divide them up into housing advice on Uptown, Northeast, and U of M.

One of my friends had a bit too much to drink and so two of my other friends were helping her while I went to find a taxi.  For full disclosure, they are all females and I am a male.

They stood back by the building while I ventured towards the street to try and hail a cab.  After about four minutes I wasn't having any luck, but continued to raise my hand in the air as cars came by.  I was standing fairly close to the curb when a police officer came up to me from my blind spot, telling me I needed to get out of the street.  I explained that I was trying to hail a cab and pointed to my feet, which were not even a foot away from the curb.  

At that point the police officer seemed to snap and pushed me full force with both of his hands on my chest.  I staggered backwards, now fully on the sidewalk and said ""Ok, I'm off the street...sorry,"" expecting that this would be the end of our interaction.  He proceeded to push me 3-4 more times, with the same amount of force and didn't say a word.  He pushed me until I was knocked down into a potted plant near the building side of the sidewalk.  I had no idea what was going on and tried to continue walking backwards but then he took me around the chest and another officer grabbed my feet and they pushed me to the ground.  I was then arrested and the rest of my story truly doesn't matter here.

I'm reaching out to r/minneapolis because my friends told me that they saw people with their cameras and phones out, either taking video or pictures of the incident.  I realize it is a crazy stretch to think anyone who sees this will either be one of those people or know them, but it is worth it because if there is any evidence that the cop was behaving unjustly then it is far more likely I can have the arrest and the charges dropped from my record.  So please, if you were around the Depot/First Ave at about 1:30-2:00 AM Sunday morning or know someone who was, I would greatly appreciate any help you can give me.

**TL;DR: I was provoked by a police officer into arrest on NYE and I believe someone took video of the incident.

This summer there's a 99% chance that my family and I will be staying in your beautiful city for a couple of months. I've lived in Minneapolis before for five whole years. Each year we lived in a New House, so I've been in a few different neighborhoods including Kingsville, Kenny, Diamond Lake. Still, they were all still in the same general area. Not to mention I was ages 6-11, so the only places I visited were the creek, Lake Harriet, Southdale Mall, Kenny Park and (on very special occasions) the Malt Shop. I'm still a young'n (15), but this summer I would like to explore more of your amazing city. My plans so far are to take the bus in to the city and explore, try and see some good concerts, and just bike around a lot. I will be visiting a lot with my friend, who's lived there since she was two, but she's kind of a hermit. Anyways, I'm sure I'm just giving a lot of meaningless information, so here's my point. If you could suggest some places to visit (music venues, shops, whatever) that are easy to attend and relatively friendly for my age, I would very much appreciate it. My brother played in a high school band when we lived here and he played at the Twin Cities Underground a lot, but I can't seem to find anything on it online. If you also know of another site that I could find more info, that would be great. Thanks!

I have some general questions about Minneapolis (which I have visited twice or so).

* I notice Minneapolis has basically no traffic, I was able to make it from downtown Minneapolis to St. Paul in about a half hour during rush hour.  Is this normal?  I am from Seattle and used to huge traffic jams.

* What is it like when it snows?  Do roads and things get cleared fast?  Would you ever stay home from work because of expected snow, or is the city and infrastructure just well geared to handle snowfall?  Do people ever get stuck at work?

* When is the best weather?  Also are there any times where it's like 50 degrees, sunny and dry?  Or is that really rare?  

* What are some neat neighborhoods to live in?  I spent some time driving around Uptown last time I was there, and it looked a little...bland perhaps?  Not particularly lively?  I do love all the outdoor cafes downtown though.  When I was there they weren't hopping, but I would guess in summer they get crowded?

* What do people do for fun outdoors around here?  Is there hiking nearby?  ",,False,self,t5_2r3bl,False,,,True,t3_1fdozd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1fdozd/some_questions_about_minneapolis/,

I sort of want to leave my car behind in Montana. Is just having a bike a good idea? 

What areas of town should I absolutely avoid?

How many parkas should I bring?

I have so many questions about the Twin Cities but I'll limit it to a few.  Here is my basic situation:

Recently accepted into UofM for a masters program.  My girlfriend will be relocating with me.  She works in retail and expects to transfer into the Mall of America.  We have two dogs and two chinchillas.  We currently pay $1500/mo rent but are hoping to decrease this either with a roommate or lower cost of living than where we are now.  I drive and have a car.  She does not and relies purely on walking and public transportation.  The public transportation here is limited to a fairly basic bus network with one hub.  We aren't big drinkers/party scene people so we don't need to be near the bars.  We can get there for the rare times we go out for that.

So, first question...where should we look to live?  We would really like to rent another house, as we have for several years, and have grown attached to amenities like a garage (I have a small wood shop), a yard for the dogs, and our own laundry.  I don't mind driving to school (unless public trans is cheaper/easier) but I want to ensure she has the easiest possible commute without multiple bus transfers.

Driving in the Twin Cities - I've only been to Boston and NYC.  A car is mainly a hindrance in both of these cities.  It's almost impossible to park, costs a ton to park when you do, and most rentals offer no parking.  Is it similar in the TC?  It will be difficult to adjust to a life where I can't even drive to the grocery store or a restaurant because there is no real parking offered anywhere.  Should I begin to prepare to scale down my driving?

I know it is really general but what can I expect to be drastically different than living in a city of 43k in New England?

I am going on a trip to the Bahamas with my girlfriend and her parents at the end of October. Due to several reasons I have to take a different flight than them, which leaves me stranded in Minneapolis from 7PM until 9AM.

My budget is rather tight (almost next to nothing, sadly) and I was wondering if I could get any tips/advice on things I could possibly do at night/any hostel recommendations whatsoever. I am also wondering if it's a ""safe"" city, as in not having to worry about being mugged whatsoever if I walk around at night. I'm asking this because I am still not sure what I am going to do. I could book a room but that's spending money and I don't think I will be returning to Minneapolis any time soon, so might as well make it worthwhile :)


I would really appreciate it! Really looking forward to seeing this city as well, even though it's only for a couple of hours:)

The Camden Promise Food Shelf is through the Gethsemane Lutheran Church and meets the 1st and 3rd Saturday of each month. The church also hosts Angel Food Ministries so you can order food packages to be picked up there, and they accept EBT as payment.

Pastor Paul's Mission is a great foodshelf they give some bulk items, and produce! Plus they have Items that you can buy for super cheap (squash, zuccinic, green peppers, it varies) and have a meal club you can join, not to mention a clothes closet. They are located at 1000 Oliver Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55411

There is also a foodbank from the Salvation Army at 2024 Lyndale Ave. N, Minneapolis, MN 55411 phone (612) 522-4871 Mon - Fri at 2 different time slots per day. Get there early they run out fast!

Also I want to mention Loaves and Fishes There are several locations throughout the Metro area that serve  meals, no questions asked mon-fri from 5:30 - 6:30

Here is a list of more places

http://www.emergencyfoodshelf.org/

Second Harvest Food Bank, 8405 10th Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55427, (763) 593-2712

http://shutdownriseup.org/ Is providing meals in the evenings during the goverment shutdown.

There are several Churchs that give out free bread anytime no questions asked, I can't recall the names but I will research it and post them when I find out.

http://www.sharingandcaringhands.org/ also gives out meals daily, even breakfast!

I have heard that http://houseofcharity.org/?page_id=75 gives out mid-day meals to all even on weekends which is rare!

There are also 2 places probably more, but 2 that I know of where you can buy discounted food. Fare For All and Greater Lake Country Food Bank

http://sisterscamelot.org/ is another place to check out.

I've been posting this around, trying to figure things out...

So, two years ago at the age of 86, my grandpa rode his bike to the library to renew some books.  He skidded on a patch of gravel and fell around the corner from his house, and died in the hospital the next day.

So this past weekend, when I was in town to visit the extended family that still lives in Minneapolis, I made/put up a ghost bike at the corner of his accident (28 west and W Lake of the Isles Parkway).  I left a phone message with the Lake of the Isles Park Board, and emailed the manager, Amy Olson, explaining what the memorial was and why it was there.  I haven't heard back from anyone.

That was Tuesday morning.  Now, on Thursday, at 10:00, I just got off the phone with my widowed grandmother, Libby, who just called to tell me she drove by the spot and the ghost bike memorial had been taken down.  I'm not sure if it was stolen or cut down by the city, but my hunch is that it was the city.  Is there any way that you folks know of to make a formal complaint, or to officially register this ghost bike with the city?  I've seen some others around that have been there for a while without being taken.

I currently live in Baton Rouge, LA but my girlfriend is from Minnetonka.  She has an interview for a job in Minneapolis (not sure where exactly) that she seems to be pretty much a lock for.  Now, the issue is that I can't go with her unless I find a real job to go to (ie something kinda in my field).

So, I turn to you /r/Minneapolis.  I have never lived in the Twin Cities area and don't really know where to start. I've done the typical poking around on the mass job boards and a couple more specific ones but haven't seen much.  I was wondering if anyone here could help point me in the right direction.

A little about me.  I have two B.S.'s in Environmental Science and Zoology from Oho State.  My background is more specifically with wetlands/aquatic systems and   I have worked at two research centers giving tours, working with the education programs, and being an all-around handyman.  I have also worked as a field assistant with the USGS and as a intern drone for the Ecological Society of America.  I currently work as a Dog Trainer.

I'm going to be leaving nola and visiting your fair city during my Mardi Gras break this coming week/end. While I am extremely excited to be seeing a college-friend after years of distance, I'm a little sad to be missing out on shenanigans back home. 

I was wondering if there's anything going on in Minneapolis (St. Paul?) for Fat Tuesday? Or if there are any New Orleanian things I could do as a gesture. My friend is going to be working during the day, so I'd like to find things to occupy myself with next Tuesday.

Are there any good bakeries with King Cake (or beignets)? 

Are there any bars that serve Ramos Gin Fizz? (I know, not as New Orleanian as the Sazerac... but I don't like whiskey.)

Are there any restaurants that serve gumbo or boudin?

At the very least, does anyone have bar recommendations for day drinking? I'm a cocktail-drinker, not beer, so I'd imagine in other cities it'll be harder to find a casual daytime joint where I can read a book and slowly work myself toward intoxication.

I have a beautiful older, male, neutered, de-clawed, long furred, soft grayish cat named Sydney. He is very laid back and likes to nap a lot. Seeks out attention when he would like some love but he is never pushy or annoying about it. Not a big meow-er, unless you are opening a can of wet food for him and then he is very encouraging. 

I have had this cat since he was a kitten; he is just the most amazing cat and is so important to my family! We are in a bad situation and cannot have him at the hotel with us. My brother was caring for him but is now moving to a place he can’t take Sydney. We literally have until the end of this week (28th of October) to find someone to watch him for us while we try to find an apartment. I hate to have to do this but I am afraid that if I can’t find a temporary home he will end up in a shelter that will put him down because he is old. This would be devastating. 

Please if you love cats, help me keep mine safe! He is such a good boy; he blends in like he belongs. He is just the right mix of independence and snuggle. And his fur is SOOO soft. He loves being brushed. He is a purr box, and will purr you to sleep if you want. For more information please message me.

He's done perfectly fine with all of them, although there is an adjustment period with other cats.

The issue I've found myself in is that he's always been an indoor and outdoor cat and, apparently, has recently started visiting my neighbor who happens to be deathly allergic to cats. My neighbor wound up going to the ER a couple nights ago because of exposure to my cat and the doctor says that if she had waited too much longer she probably would have died.

Over the last couple of days my wife and I have been keeping Cosmos indoors, but he's been very vocal about not wanting to stay in the house. My wife also suspects that he peed on one of our blankets. I know these aren't the best selling points, but I assure you he's a good cat who just wants to go outside. It's just an insane liability for us to let him. We're running out of options and the Animal Humane Society doesn't have any surrender appointments for two weeks.

I feel like I'm a special case.  I've been to Minneapolis for a sum total of less than 24 hours in my life.  I flew in one evening for a job interview, and flew out the next day.  It's too good of a position to pass up, but I really don't know much about the city apart from people telling me ""you'll love it!"".  I don't doubt that I'll be happy there, but I have absolutely no clue on where to live.

Information about me:

* 24 year old male

* Software developer

* Passion for motorcycles and old cars

* Enjoys drinking at pubs

* Listens to heavy metal

* Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, lived in Milwaukee for 6 years

I was told there is a decent metal scene, which I hope to get in to.  I would like to live downtown near where I'll be working, so that I can either walk or take the light-rail to my office (located off Hennepin and 5th).  More importantly, since I will know no one in the city, I'd like to live near social venues in order to get to know people.  I'm quite social, but I prefer to not just wander aimlessly around a city I'm not all that familiar with.

I'd rather stay away from anywhere that is super ""collegy"".  While I love to go out and drink at the bars, I prefer to live in a quiet apartment (pet friendly).  Is light-rail easy enough to take to downtown?  Is it pretty reliable as far as scheduling goes?  I'm uncomfortable leaving my motorcycle outside, so anywhere I end up needs to have covered/underground parking available.

Additionally, are there any good metal bars in the downtown area, or other areas?  Are there any motorcycle groups that go out for rides?  Is there a hackerspace?

Thanks in advance for any and all responses!

I currently work as a project manager for a federal government contractor in Washington DC, and I will be relocating to the Minneapolis/St. Paul area in the next few months.

I am moving because my fiance will be starting a PhD program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus, and as that will take up the next 5-7 years, I thought it would be a good opportunity to escape DC.

In applying for jobs in Minnesota, I have encountered an interesting challenge; my resume is basically built from the ground up to work in federal contracting (more specifically in international development and foreign assistance).  There are a few sporadic companies in the area that do that (like Land O'lakes International Development), but generally speaking I will probably have to reach outside of my current career field for a new job.

Has anyone here gone from federal contracting in a place like DC to a position in Minneapolis, where the field of companies and industries are completely different?  If so, how did you approach the challenge of landing a new job?

I'm now arranging a visit with UofM and I was hoping to ask for advice once again.

I'm traveling with one other adult (my mom) and we will be staying in the TC from Thursday (5/23) - Sunday (5/26).  We will be making a go at using only public transportation and our feet, so it will be an adventure!  I primarily need to visit the various campus locations, CURA, etc. but we are hoping to explore the city in general.  There have been a lot of posts about see X, Y, etc. so I will look those over but are there any specific sites that would be awesome to see around Memorial Day weekend?  We are going for more of an urban exploration vibe rather than a museum tour, as I can do that on my own when I relocate.

So, my real questions.  Suggestions on places to stay?  Budget is tight, so we want to avoid swanky but also avoid smoke-stained, bed bug infested type places.  My parents traveled cross country and enjoyed Holiday Inn Express but there must be somewhere more interesting to spend $100/night.

Also, food.  I was thinking about checking out some of the Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives locations but I don't know how cliche that is.  Again, our budget is fairly tight.  As I stated before, I've only been to NYC, Boston, and Baltimore but we are looking for less than $14/plate, if possible, as I don't know what prices are like in the TC.  We aren't looking for surf-n-turf, as we are perfectly happy with a good burger, sandwich, or Chinese.

President Obama will announce his plans for the war in Afghanistan in a speech to the nation on Wednesday evening. Early reports indicate that he will announce a withdrawal of 5,000 to 10,000 troops this year, followed by the additional withdrawal of 30,000 troops starting in 2012. This plan will leave 70,000 U.S. troops and 110,000 private contractors in Afghanistan, in addition to 50,000 NATO troops. The Minnesota Peace Action Coalition (MPAC) endorses the call for a special statement at the Wednesday vigil. The coalition of Twin Cities-area peace and anti-war groups have issued a statement that says in part, ""There can be no withdrawal gesture; the U.S. war in Afghanistan must end and all U.S. troops must be brought home now. Gestures are transient. Unless the President makes a clear commitment to bring the troops home, the U.S. war in Afghanistan will continue with all the tragedy that war brings and billions of dollars wasted. Any token withdrawal will not bring an end to the war. A war-weary U.S. population, the majority of whom want an end to the war in Afghanistan, will not be satisfied with insignificant troop withdrawals,"" said the statement. The recent U.S. Conference of Mayors overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for an end to the war and for funds to be transferred to domestic needs. The financial cost of the war in Afghanistan is $122 billion for 2011 alone, an average of $10.17 billion per month. ""Billions are spent on the war in Afghanistan while millions who have lost their jobs and homes and needed social services are facing massive budget cuts,"" says the statement.

The light rail is only useful if you live right on it.  

The buses are unreliable and don't nearly cover enough ground.  Plus they seem to be mostly good for commuting to downtown, not just getting around the city.  

Biking is great, but we are seriously lacking in bike lanes.  I love the trails, but they don't really go where you need them to.  

It's definitely not a walkable city unless you live downtown.  Especially in the winter.  

Add to this that all transit stops from 1:30 to 4 am right as thousands of people are leaving bars forcing them to get behind the wheel of a car.

I have a lot of family around Minneapolis and I thought maybe I should start trying to make contacts in the area in case I'd like to move there in the future.

I visited pretty much every year when I was growing up but have only been back a handful of times as an adult.

About me: I'm Patrick. I'm 28. I've lived in Oregon all my life. Most of my family that doesn't live in Minneapolis lives in Hawaii. Everyone immediately pegs me as an artist, which I guess I kind of am. I love to draw, paint, etc. I'm a struggling independent graphic designer after quitting a soul-sucking job last year.

I bike everywhere. I love to run. I don't like many video games made after 1996 (I love Tetris, Battletoads, and anything Metroid). I love music and am currently pretty into Japanese stuff from the 70s and 80s, tropicalia and bossa nova, dance music from the last decade, and Ethiopian jazz. I don't read much, but I love Bret Easton Ellis and Douglas Coupland and my favorite novel is *The Crying Of Lot 49*. I love cooking and eating, but I think the current food crit craze is really out of hand. I'm in love with jQuery. I have some hipster tendencies. I'm gay and get along well with most gay crowds.

I think most people are too emotional. Lots of people have tried to amateur-diagnose me with Asberger's over the years. I'm a moderate ent. I have really good hair.

If I sound like one of your friends, [friend me](http://www.facebook.com/apetickler). or, obviously, you can talk to me here.

(NE Minneapolis),warfrogs,6,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/f7xv7/legal_advice_needed_with_intrusive_landlord_ne/,"Hey guys, this is my first self-post but I don't really know who else to ask and you all seem somewhat knowledgeable and if not, at least maybe I'll get a laugh out of it.

I know it's late, and I'm on a pretty tight time frame in asking for suggestions within 6 hours, BUT, I really need some help.


Long story short, I moved into a place in Northeast off of Central and the 26th in October and things have been so-so.  Friend of a friend was living there and needed a room-mate since his current room-mate (the son of the landlord) was moving out.  The first few weeks were fine until things started breaking.  First the lock on my door didn't work.  Then the door to the downstairs apartment didn't close OR lock.  The upstairs shower leaks onto the furnace whenever we use it, and there's a lightswitch that if you touch it the wrong way you get a bit of a jolt.  Well, that was all alright, I could deal with it.

Then the landlord's kid started showing up unannounced, usually with the premise that he was getting things he left (which are still here) but occasionally just to do stuff around the house, none of which we ever saw any change from.  He harassed my room-mate who was supposedly behind on rent, would post things on his door, leave dirty footprints through the house, and generally act somewhat unnerving and obnoxious.

It's gotten way worse over the last 3 weeks.  During all the snow emergencies, I got towed 3 times and thus was short on rent.  I told the son that and that I would be paying a month and a half's the next month (which I have) and then another month and a half the month after that (still upcoming).

He said it was fine but that I had to pay.  Well, the day came that rent was due (on the 15th), so I mailed the check to his father (instead of how he wanted me to which was a deposit slip into his checking account).  He showed up that very day to my work, in front of one of my employees and said very loudly in front of customers that I owed him rent and have been avoiding his calls, which I haven't as I haven't received a single one as far as I can remember.  I told him to leave or I'd be calling mall security.

I figured the issue was done since my rent should have shown up by now, until I came home from work and I found my bedroom door (the lock to which I replaced at my own expense) open, which I never do, all of my lights on, and some of my possessions in my closet rifled through along with a note to call the father immediately about further renting.  (Their words, not mine)  I've never met the dad, but our downstairs room-mate has and says he's a reasonable guy and that this sounds more like the son on a power trip, but I'm not really sure.

Now, I work a lot, around 40 hours a week at one job and 10-15 at the other plus side jobs, but as a kid just out of college with student loans, rent, utilities, car payment, and car insurance payment, I don't have a lot of money to consult a lawyer, but I have to believe this is illegal.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what I could possibly do?  I'm calling the cops in at 7 in the morning on 311 before work to report trespassing, but I don't have a real lease, no renters' agreement or anything, but I do have deposit records and the like.  Would I be absolutely screwed if I took him to court about this?

What in the world should I do?

**EDIT:  Called 311 this morning and was floored when they said that it wasn't a criminal matter since it's his property, ended up getting pushed to the Housing Authority, they said it was in fact criminal trespassing and breaking and entering, got pushed BACK to my local precinct and filed a report.  The officer said that it was B&amp;E with trespassing but because I'm on a ""oral month to month contract"" that there's not much I can do without ending up on the street.  He said my best bet was to look for another place and once I found it to take legal action against them.  Lesson learned?  Don't bother with 311, call your local precinct.  Hopefully I can get somewhere quick, because I'm still super floored.  I'll check the thread again tomorrow and keep you guys updated with any developments.  (I'll also be calling the ACTUAL landlord tomorrow instead of his son with whom I've had most dealings so that should be interesting.)**",,False,self,t5_2r3bl,True,,,True,t3_f7xv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/f7xv7/legal_advice_needed_with_intrusive_landlord_ne/,

Thought I'd share this experience, in case anyone else finds it useful.
I live in Minneapolis and get internet service of 40 mbps down / 20 mbps up through Century Link. I had a 6 month promotion from when I signed up for the service. During the 6 month promotion I was paying approximately $40 per month for the internet service and modem lease. I do not use or need a home phone line or television subscription so I only had this internet service.

The 6 month promotion period recently expired. When it did, my bill jumped to about $80 per month for the same service.

I looked up the prices/promotions for new customers at Century Link and Comcast. New Century Link customers can still receive what looks like the same promotion I had when I started with Century Link. New Comcast customers can get 50 mbps service and a basic TV subscription for $50 per month (for 6 months).

I called Century Link customer service. From the list of automated options, I chose billing and then asked to talk to a customer service representative. I told the representative my bill recently doubled and I want to see what can be done about it or if I should look into other services. I told the representative I could get faster speeds for less money at Comcast -- the 50 mbps for $50. The representative said she could offer me lower speeds at lower prices, but that's all she could do, she would have to transfer me to another department if that wasn't satisfactory. I asked to be transferred to the other department.

When another representative picked up, I told him the same thing I told the first representative. He was able to offer me a rebate off my bill for the next 12 months. With the rebate, my bill will be about $48 per month for the same 40 mbps service. I went along with that.

Don't know if this will work for anyone else. But figured I'd offer up my experience in case it can help you avoid overpaying for internet.",,False,self,t5_2r3bl,1376434179.0,,,True,t3_1kb5x7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1kb5x7/how_to_lower_your_internet_bill/,

Some questions I have:
-What is the riding experience like? I plan to ride coach, does upper or lower level matter?
-Did you experience any delays? Its a long 22 hour ride, so I am worried about potential delays.
-What are the seat arrangements like? Was sleeping an issue? 
-Can you bring on your own booze?
-Do you have any advice about riding Amtrak - what to do or to avoid doing? 
-How did you like it? Would you do it again?

Even more jarring, I learned that while we DO recycle, the company that handles our recycling isn't able to keep up with the sheer amount of recycling that comes out of the stadium, so they were only going to be collecting our glass recycling. That is only ONE THIRD of the recycling that can be processed from each game. 

Is there something that can be done about this? I'm not really sure how to go about getting this fixed. It is absolutely disgusting to me that with all of the pressure to recycle, its actually the recycling facility that is preventing it. Is there more than one recycling facility that could be contacted? Or is it more of a funding issue that needs to be brought to a city council meeting?",,False,self,t5_2r3bl,False,,,True,t3_zq20l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/zq20l/what_do_we_do_about_our_recycling_program/,

I have an 8 year old rescued husky/malamute mix (had him for 6+ years), great dog (minus the shedding) and runs between 60 - 65 pounds. Not that big of a dog!

While we were still back in Vegas though we bought a gun and would go shooting. We tried the indoor ranges, but they're so much money. The cool thing about vegas was just a small drive and a little ways out from the city, and its all just desert. 

Well, there is this known out door shooting area to the locals. But it's nothing you would find in a phone book. 
Part of growing up there comes with perks. One is you just kinda know its there, it becomes common knowledge. 
It was about 30 to 40 minutes out of the city, in a 100% desert area with hills and rocks ect. 

So many people have gone out there and taken advantage of it, it has become a soda can, glass bottle, car part, computer monitor, grave yard. Everything half destroyed or broken from being used as target practice, and the grounds were covered in gun and rainbow colored rifle shells.

One of the coolest places we found to go shooting.

So my question is directed to some of the long term residents to the area. Is there anywhere in Minnesota that has a similar place to go shooting? Ideally not more than an hour or two away?

If anyone knows of any info, I’d be so stoked to find a similar place to go have some fun and shoot again.
Thanks all!
