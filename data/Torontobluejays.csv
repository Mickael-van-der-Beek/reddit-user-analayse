1360594699.0,104,self.Torontobluejays,18b6p8,Tips &amp; Tricks in the SkyDome,matdwyer,109,5,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/18b6p8/tips_tricks_in_the_skydome/,"Jays fans - let's get a little collaboration of tips &amp; tricks that people may not know about the SkyDome. If we can get this big enough maybe we can sidebar it. Try not to encourage anything illegal or likely to get you in skydome jail (i.e. sneaking booze in)

Here's some of my best:

• You can buy a ticket in the 500 levels but stand at the railings on the lower bowl, beside the ushers all the way around the infield. This is a good spot for a foul ball as well, and you get to watch embarrassed people try to sneak in.

• You can go any time to the lower levels from the 500 level - if they try to stop you, just tell them you're going to the jays shop.

• Budweiser runs a program for Designated Drivers - go to the customer service desk (one up and one down) and fill out a form to get a free pop (I got a free bottle of water once, but it took a manager who was walking by to do it)

• You can watch the game without buying a ticket by going in the hotel entrance &amp; then turning right - this is ""Arriba"" and it's fairly expensive, but it's pretty good - you can call and reserve a window table, but sometimes it's not busy. $7 for a beer, $15 for a chicken caesar wrap with fries. I went to watch monster jam there and got nice n' drunk for the same price as my ticket would have been.

• You can bring in almost ANY food from outside - I've ate full pizzas, subs, even the same peanuts that they sell there (buy them at sobeys!). The ushers will all make a joke but you're 100% allowed. You can bring a picnic if you want to

• If you PM me I'll be happy to share cheap parking around, although I assume most already know. There is free parking as close as King &amp; Bathurst on sidestreets (and 1/2 priced wings at the Wheat Sheaf Sunday/Mon/Tues... 50 wings $22) 

• If you're drinking hard and you want to make your money last, try to get an extra ticket (from a scalper after the game started, fan pass, etc) and leave after the 4th/5th inning. Jet over to St. Louis across the street or to the Union Station LCBO, drink a couple beers, and head back in. You'll miss an inning but save money compared to buying those atrociously priced beers (I've got my ""reentry"" ticket for as little as $2)

• A good deal on scalper tickets is 25% under face value for decent games ($40 baseline tickets for weekend matinees). The key is walk up with money in your hand, know what you want to pay &amp; where, and then say ""that's too much"" and walk away. 90% of the time they chase you. Don't do it in front of other people trying to buy. 

• If you get to bobblehead games late, look for a) families and b) away fans on the way out - offer them $5 for their extra bobbleheads (since they'll all get one) - the away fans usually are game. I've heard the skydome parking garage entrance always has more bobbleheads, but I can't confirm this (or if you can enter in there without driving down?) 

• The nachos at the 100 level market thing are decent (expensive, but at least they taste good)

• As people are leaving you can buy/get their ticket off them (i.e. if they were in the 100 levels) and then you can go sit in their seat. 

• You actually win stuff on twitter tuesday - currently wearing a Vote Jose shirt haha. The Budweiser trivia before the game is won by the same people all the time but try to beat them if you can. If you go to a lot of games enter the text in to win things every time, my buddy won a blackberry last year that paid for his fanpass. 

• You can drink for free (usually 1-2 beers) at Steamwhistle before the games, but it's VERY busy. You can get free tours there by taking a picture of their billboards &amp; DM'ing it to them on twitter (or just go in and ask, they'll give you a business card)

• There is a tour you can take of the Skydome - I haven't done it yet, but there are 2 for 1 coupons floating around (in the Entertainment book, I think with CAA). It's about $12. 

I know when I go to away arena's / stadiums I look for threads like this, so throw your tips on here &amp; everyone wins. ",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,,True,t3_18b6p8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/18b6p8/tips_tricks_in_the_skydome/,

This brilliant insight was based on... that they have a losing record this season.

I know it would get in the way of your ""anti-everything"" posturing but as a supposed sports analyst maybe you should think a little deeper than that:

AA inherited a mediocre farm system with few genuine top prospects, Doc who was going away either way, and a ~110M payroll that somehow had no long term solutions in place.

Now for more like 70M we have locked up Morrow, Romero, Santos, Lawrie, Rasmus, Bautista, Edwin, Lincoln, Janssen, Escobar. 

Barring a complete outlier number of injuries, we would have a similar .500 record in an even tighter division than 3 years ago, for about 50% less cost and with the good ones locked up multi-year (as opposed to V Wells). 

Plus our farm system is the most improved by far of any team.

AA has now said that he thinks we are near that point where free agent signings are worth it, because we're that solid underneath. And he said those signings would be for the rotation. 

It's coming together - despite how the injuries have skewed it for now.

Thank you for your continued support. We at the mod team are doing our best to provide fresh new content and deliver some exciting exclusive stuff just for this subreddit.

We're spitballing the idea of more celebrity/athlete AMAs. There are some feelers with some of the blue jays staff (non-player), as well as some of the various media and we're going to try our best to have some discussion going in this sub. 

Thank you all for keeping the atmosphere conducive to a positive and lively discussion about our favourite team. The passion that you all have and the interest Canada's club is definitely something we appreciate and hope that it continues as it has. 

We're almost at 2,200 subs this year, putting us in the top 10 (7th last I checked) for all MLB team subs. More than the Dodgers, Rangers, Angels, Cubs, Tigers and just behind the Cardinals.

So in terms of fans on reddit, we definitely are a ""big market."" Hopefully yesterday got the ball rolling in growing our fan base and getting more of them to buy into baseball and buy into the Toronto Blue Jays. 

Anyways, thank YOU all for being members. Continue to tell your friends about this sub. Post your opinion, share your ideas, talk about crazy rumours, upvote what you like, downvote the Yankees and Red Sox!

* It's the Opening Series! Welcome back, boys! And this is a quick and dirty version of a series thread, to gauge interest. I'll add more stats and info, and hopefully make these prettier if they take off. Can a mod at a link at the top of the subreddit so this stays visible?
* Both Cleveland and Toronto are coming off similar 2011 seasons (80-82 and 81-81), and both are looking to improve in tough divisions.
* The Jays are hoping that their hot spring training record (24-7) will give them some early momentum.
* Louis Valbuena has been claimed by the Chicago Cubs off waivers.

## Notes

* [Game Preview](http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_02_clemlb_tormlb_1&amp;mode=preview)
* Welcome back! The Jays hit the diamond tonight to start their 2013 campaign, one which has seen a fair bit of hype caused by a significant retooling of the roster in the offseason.
* One of the main parts of that retooling is on the mound for Toronto tonight. R.A. Dickey won the NL Cy Young last season with the New York Mets.
* John Gibbons also makes his return to Toronto tonight, managing the team again for the first time since 2008.
* Cleveland has undergone something of a rebuild themselves, adding the likes of Drew Stubbs, Nick Swisher, and Michael Bourn, under the leadership of former Red Sox skipper Terry Francona.",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,92,True,t3_1bjge1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1bjge1/game_thread_april_2nd_toronto_blue_jays_vs/,

I wanted to thank all of you for your advice and amazing hospitality this past weekend! I was fortunate enough to be able to get to two games while I was up there, one each with the roof open and closed. 

They were the last two games of the streak and it was amazing. The crowds were really into it, and with everyone's advice I was able to get some great food. Only one guy gave me a hard time for my Yankees shirt too, so that's a plus!

I was looking at my fridge magnet schedule today and was shocked to realize the season is winding down, and there aren't too many home series left.  With labour day weekend and some crappy series, there are even less good home games left.  So, I am going to grab the bull by the horns and get a /r/TorontoBlueJays game day meet up started.  

When: Friday September 13th.  Hope you're not superstitious.  Game starts at 7:07 pm  

Who: our favourite bird bros the Baltimore Orioles vs the Toronto Blue Jays.  And me and you.  And you, and you and you.  

Where:  Pre-meet up drinks and/or food ~5pm at Shoeless Joe's on Queen's Quay.  Why Shoeless Joe's on Queens Quay?  It's a 5 minute walk to the stadium box office but is off the main drags of Front St and Bremnar Blvd, so we shouldn't need a reservation.  The bar area is pretty big as well.  Walking distance or easily bus accessible from Union Station.  
  
How much: It takes 20 people to qualify for a group rate, and I doubt we'll get that many people.  I don't know what the other subs do, but I don't want to spot any cash for you people, anyway, so just bring cash and we'll grab 500-level tickets from the box office around game time.  ~$15-$20  
  
Post game we can plan an after party with whoever is interested or go our seperate ways into the night.  
  
So, who's game?  Comments and suggestions are of course welcome however I tried to hammer out a day and meeting place to avoid possible confusion and indecisiveness.  Hope that works for people.  
  
Hope to see you all there!

I guess I should specify on the tools count. This is based on the MLB scouting scale of 0-80 (0-8 for BP) so 4-5 is average tools, 6 is plus, 7 is plus plus and 8 is basically unheard of.

Before Sunday's game I headed down to the bullpen because I knew JPA would be there and thought it would give me a shot to get an autograph on my jersey. Unfortunately I was a couple minutes late and he had finished signing and was doing warmup drills with Andreopolous. He saw I was wearing his jersey and he jogged over towards me and unprovoked he said "" I really gotta get going, but pass me your jersey."" He signed and flipped me the ball he was doing drills with. Two little kids were behind me and he turned around and said ""I have to go but you guys are too cute."" He then signed their hats and left to go play catch with Buehrle. Though its far from the first time a ballplayer has been accommodating to a fan, it was really cool that he just came over and offered. 

Although he's having a tough season and going through an even tougher stretch, JP was totally accommodating and gracious with us. Catching a day game after a night game, he'd be excused if he just wanted to go about his business (He remarked he had so much IcyHot on that he felt like he was on fire).

Despite his replacement level-ish performance this year and the feud with Zaun and Dirk, JP is truly one of the good guys on the team and I hope things turn around for him. ",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,,True,t3_1jvdpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1jvdpd/in_defense_of_jpa/,

Seeing as how we're all kind of bumming out about how the season is going so far, I thought it would be fun if we could implement this onto our sub. I could keep a points system going and the top 3 scorers at the end of the season could get a fun prize. 

How does it sound? 

Edit: Since there seems to be an interest in the idea, I've done a little more research modeling after the Bucs threads and they usually do something like this: 

+1 point if you guess the game winner 

+1 point if you guess the score 

+1 point for a misc. bonus question 

I like their scoring set-up, but I might change the ""picking correct score"" category into ""guess how many total runs will be scored.""

Thread",HW_Plainview,36,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/197b5r/the_official_where_can_i_stream_the_blue_jays/,"Hey guys. Last year in this sub there were questions almost every game about where to find a stream of the game for those of us who don't have MLB.TV. Since spring training games have now begun and people are filing in it seems like a good time to post this.

The answer: vipbox.tv. If there is a Blue Jays game on TV there is a 99.99% chance it will be on vipbox. All you have to do when you're on the homepage is click on baseball and then find the Toronto game. There will usually be several links to choose from, I recommend the SportsTV one. If you cannot find a stream of a game I will personally give you one free upvote.

I also would recommend you get the ad block plus add on for Firefox because the amount of ads is insane. I'm not sure what the ad block equivalent is for chrome so if someone could post it that would be appreciated.

Then at the game, the couple beside us told us we should post 'em here. New to Reddit, so I hope I'm doing this right: http://oi41.tinypic.com/mtngqq.jpg

We got 'em made at Freshly Baked Tees on Queen St., but they were kinda pricey ($30+tax). Scrolling down I saw the guy selling the EE Parrot shirt, and Teespring looked to be cheaper, so if you wanna buy 'em here you. You don't have to though, this is mainly for the couple at the game.

Of all the pitchers who have been hurt like he got hurt (on multiple occasions) I always made sure to check his status whenever I would find myself on the Blue Jays' website.  So many years of well wishing a monster pitcher to make his way back to the club came to fruition today.  It is friggin wonderful that the Jays won in 18 innings, but my biggest joy of the day was watching Dustin come out of that bullpen.   I thought Mcgowan looked great out on that mound considering he hasn't been up there for so many years at that level, and not to mention it was in the 10th inning with 40k fans assuming the worst was a significant possibility.  He fought through the error by Derosa and hit 98 on the radar gun to get his first out/strikeout of the year.  Not going to get into what ifs regarding being a setup man or closer, I just wanted to welcome him back, wish him luck,  and I don't think I'm the only one that has been waiting a long time to see him back on that mound throwing heat for our Jays.  Welcome back Dustin.

First row. Upper deck. Free.

My only rules are:
1. If you take them, you'd better actually GO.
2. You'll need a printer, so don't ask unless you have access to one.
3. Don't go late. Don't leave early.
4. Please don't be a jerk. These are season seats. Have fun, boo players, do whatever. But don't get obnoxiously drunk, swear in front of kids, or throw anything on the field.

Who wants 'em?

Should this be first come, first served? Maybe a contest of some sort... 

Ok, how about this: Who's the best and worst Jay all time and why (for each)?

EDIT: Azncookiecutter 'won.' But unfortunately, it turned out that he couldn't go. So I ended up giving the tickets to missspiritualtramp. 

I will quite possibly do this again sometime. GO JAYS GO.

* Hi there! Not Canadave, I offered up my assistance for today. Be nice!
* I'd like to welcome anyone who's come over from /r/TexasRangers. We hope you enjoy it here, these game threads have been pretty great for us, and it's always fun to have the opposing fans come visit.
* Drew Hutchison makes his first start at home in an attempt to even up the series
* Texas sends out Naftali Feliz, who has had a bit of a rest not starting since April 21st, but Texas Manager Ron Washington assures, ""He's fine. I don't think the rest is going to make him erratic in any sense.""
* Encarnacion is still lighting up the Blue Jays stat leads for this season, with a home-run last night (his fourth game in a row taking one deep)
* Josh Hamilton sat out the first game of this series, still unsure whether he will play this game. Will update this note when the line-up is posted.",,False,,t5_2sb61,True,,Logo3,True,t3_t22zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/t22zf/game_thread_may_1_toronto_blue_jays_vs_texas/,

1372637498.0,25,self.Torontobluejays,1he7fl,Comparing Bonifacio and Kawasaki (with Major League Equivalencies!),dylan89,31,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1he7fl/comparing_bonifacio_and_kawasaki_with_major/,"Since there's been quite a bit of discussion comparing the two, I thought I'd compare Bonifacio and Kawasaki's batting abilities. I decided to do the work and compare their careers.

It's generally considered that the Japanese league is mid-level AAA talent.

From: http://www.nationalsarmrace.com/?p=3008

&gt;Japan: the Nippon Professional Baseball League rates, by various accounts, as a mid AAA-level talent league.  Baseball Prospectus’ Clay Davenport did a stat-heavy analysis in 2002 and concluded that the NPB was at least AAA level, perhaps close to MLB level.  However, the prevalence of mediocre players from the US going to Japan and being super-stars seems to indicate that Japan is no better than AAA, and may be a bit weaker.  And, not to claim this is about talent levels per race, but there have only been a very small number of Japanese-born players who were really impact players upon arriving here.

I ran into a problem though, when I discovered that [Kawasaki's stats were incomplete.](http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=kawasa001mun). I filled in [some of the blanks](http://www.japaneseballplayers.com/en/player.php?id=mkawasaki), but there were still some.

Using [Baseball-Reference's data yearly data from the Japanese League](http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?code=JPPL&amp;class=Fgn), I conservatively calculated an estimate of the amount of runs, doubles, triples, stolen bases, times caught stealing, and times hit by pitches for Kawasaki. (If anyone wants them, I can provide these equations.)

Combining my tabulations with the Japanese Ball Players website, gives me these totals for Kawasaki's time in the Japanese Pacific League:

AB|R|H|2B |3B |HR |RBI |BB|K|SB|CS |HBP|
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
4573|620|1343|186|51|27|369|323|527|245|93|54|


I entered these into the [Major League Equivalency calculator](http://mlsplits.drivelinebaseball.com/mlsplits/mlecalc), using the PCL as the AAA league because the transition is tougher.

---------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR**:

So with all that being said, here's the comparison:

Name|AB|R|H|2B |3B |HR |RBI |BB|K|AVG|OBP |SLG |SB|CS|HBP|
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Munenori Kawasaki|4668|464|1151|153|38|20|276|242|569|0.247|0.290|0.309|202|102|40|
Emilio Bonifacio|1847|266|481|66|26|9|113|161|417|0.260|0.319|0.339|121|31|5|
Munenori Kawasaki (600 AB)|600|60|148|20|5|3|35|31|73|0.247|0.290|0.309|26|13|5|
Emilio Bonifacio (600 AB)|600|86|156|21|8|3|37|52|135|0.260|0.319|0.339|39|10|2|

In terms of their major league careers, Bonifacio bests Kawasaki in all three slash categories. However this season, Kawasaki is besting Bonifacio.


Kawasaki's currently hitting .225 /.337 /.325 with the Blue Jays. So he's hitting lower than his MLE Career batting average, but with a better on-base percentage and slugging percentage.

Bonifacio's currently hitting .205 /.236 /.307 with the Blue Jays. So he's hitting lower this season in all three slash categories.

---------------------------------------------------

With all that said, Kawasaki is the better hitter right now, and is **without a doubt a better fielder than Bonifacio (whose defensive inability is costing the team wins.)** Because of this I think we should allow Kawasaki to be the everyday second baseman. Bonifacio could hit .300 for the rest of the year, but is so poor defensively, it's not worth it.

## Notes

* [Game Preview](http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_12_tormlb_kcamlb_1)
* Happ is coming off what has been by far the Jays' best outing by a starting pitcher this season.  He went 5-1/3 giving up no runs and only one hit against Boston.  
* Mendoza gave up two hits and one run in six innings against Philadelphia in his last start.  
* The Jays are looking for a long outing from Happ after overworking their bullpen in the first nine games of the season.  He needs to be more efficient with his pitches after giving up three walks and striking out six last start.

I don't post to reddit very often, but as a lifelong Mets fan who has had the pleasure to watch R.A. over the past three years, there are a few things I felt important to share.

1. If the past three years have meant anything, R.A. will almost always give you a quality start. And when he doesn't, he's genuinely dissapointed in himself and quick to make adjustment.

2. He's a class act. Spent a good half hour at spring training in 2011 signing autograph after autograph, smiling the whole time.

3. Follow him on twitter @RADickey43 - his tweets are interesting, insightful, and there will be countless photographs of him and his children dressed as Darth Vader. He occaisionally, in between starts, will spend a few hours answering questions via twitter ranging from baseball intracies, to the inane things about his life.

4. Read his book, ""Wherever I Wind Up"" - it's well written, interesting, intensely personal and conveys his voice clearly. 

5. Look forward to him batting in interleague play. He takes every at bat very seriously, and has his fundamentals down pat. After impressively pitched games he'd often be more interested in talking about a great bunt he laid down.

6. He has a nasty pick off move, especially for runners on second base. To this day, I don't understand how he contorts his body like that.

7. He's an overall awesome guy. Loves and understands baseball. Tremendous competitor. 

8. His bat are named after Lord of the Rings swords, his at-bat walk up music last year started as the Imperial March, and eventually became the Game of Thrones theme. (My girlfried and I brought this sign to the games he pitched.)

9. He owns a screen print shirt of Jose Reyes. Somebody get the guy an updated Toronto one, pronto.

10. The documentary Knuckleball, which I was shown at Tribecca Film Festival last year is (I think) in limited run. Dickey and Wakefield are the stars, along with the storied history of the Knuckleball. Check it out if you can.

[Here are pictures of Dickey in the Reyes shirt, and the King in the North poster I made](http://imgur.com/a/VrMrE)

Enjoy every one of Dickey's starts. They're often electric (especially when he's got his strikeout knuckler going.) I'm certainly going to the Bronx to see him beat the Yankees this year, and I'm going to try to get up to Toronto too. Gotta make sure my Dickey jersey isn't wasted.",,False,,t5_2sb61,1355787147.0,,,True,t3_150qp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/150qp4/10_things_to_know_about_ra_dickey_from_a_mets_fan/,

Please, if you have not already, take some time to read the reddiquette FAQs. (http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). 
I am not going to impose any restrictions yet (removing arrows, adding bubbles) as I hope this issue can be resolved this way. If you have an issue with a topic/comment/user (other than you not agreeing with the comment), please message the mods instead of down voting them to oblivion.  

I like how Rustyarrowhead put it.

2. upvote if you like it, if you agree, think it contributes to the conversation, gives accurate information

I just wanted to say that I think this is total bullshit. The only factor that will affect how well the Jays do is whether we can play up to the level of our own talent.

This latest stretch has really shown that we can win any number of ways and we should expect to beat every team we play. The lineup is solid and the pitchers are solid. We have the combination of speed and power to play any situation.

It is not like we will keep winning every game for the rest of the season, but nobody can play with us while we are on, so as far as I am concerned, the schedule doesn't matter. What does matter is: Can our pitchers keep pounding the strike zone, can our hitters keep coming through when it matters.

Looking forward, here is what I hope we see:

-Keep Edwin at 3rd, keep Rajai in the lineup

-Slightly less of a rotation in the middle infield and keep Bonafacio and Kawasaki ready to run for someone late and as late defensive replacements.

-When Reyes comes back, get Rajai at the bottom of the lineup, to give him some solid RBI opportunities, and more opportunities for the other top-of-the-lineup guys to have two speedsters on the basepaths for them.",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,43,True,t3_1gl4bx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1gl4bx/its_about_us_not_them/,

I'll do my best to answer these in a concise manner.
1) They will. RA Dickey cost a lot, as we know, but he has improved every year the past three seasons and is coming off of a Cy Young winning season. He will be a stud and most batters in the AL will not be used to his knuckle, due to him being in the NL with the Mets. Reyes gives us an elite top of the order shortstop. We all know he is capable of leading the league in average and steals. This guy excites me to no end. If Josh Johnson is healthy and finds his stuff from a few years ago, we may have another ace in our rotation, and Mark Buehrle is the definition of consistency.

2) Melky will not be a distraction. He will be eager to put any questions from last year behind him and let his play do the talking. He is a good defender in left field, and even if his bat doesn't meet the expectations of a number 2 hitter, we have options there (Lawrie comes to mind) and we will still be dangerous with him lower in the order.

3) It will prove to be dominant. Just look at the names - all of them save Buerhle could be number ones on most other MLB teams (assuming we get 2011 Ricky, not 2012). Brandon Morrow is my favourite and I think if he's healthy he could be the best of the bunch. I don't have much to say about this question, as I think the only real questions are the health of Morrow and Johnson, and which Ricky Romero are we going to get? He doesn't have the added pressure of being a number 1, and he has something to prove this year. However, he is a player who performs well when he is confident as we saw when things started to fall of last year, he really struggled. Being bumped down to number 4 in the order must be hard to take, but hopefully it lights a fire in him and he shows the league what he can do.

This post is going to be a couple days late. I was on vacation and didn't have access to a computer besides my cell phone (bacon-reader doesn't support mods very well). 
I just want to quickly re-establish some rules, ones that I think are key to any sub-reddit or forum on the internet (mind you this IS the internet, thing do not always work out the way we want it). 
Please do not attack people for difference of opinion. Please do not resort to name calling or bashing because you simply do not agree. If you see something out of line, something/someone that offends you in any way send us mods a message and we will check it out. I believe in a fairly hands off approach to this sub-reddit. I do not believe we require a heavy mod presence because I think we have a fairly good bunch of users.

My opinion:

- Boston is a fierce division rival
- They want our manager for the same job
- If they want him they better be willing to overpay. Fair price means nothing when talking to a division rival with the type of knowledge he has on our team, our players, and our management.

Oh... and F*** The Red Sox!

EDIT: Would Terry Francona be a good manager for the Blue Jays? IF so, are they waiting for him to finish up with TBS/Fox?

EDIT 2: [According to sportsnet.ca](http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2012/10/06/terry_francona_to_manage_cleveland_indians_report/), the Cleveland Indians have hired Francona.

1333559468.0,17,self.Torontobluejays,rt518,"Ok, Blue Jays, let’s… play… ball: What I expect from 2012",unstoned,18,1,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/rt518/ok_blue_jays_lets_play_ball_what_i_expect_from/,"In following the Toronto baseball media (online and traditional) and the baseball media outside of Toronto, I’m getting two pictures of the 2012 Blue Jays.

Folks in Toronto are high on this team.  They love the youth and energy and minor league depth of our team, and expect contention, if not an outright division win, this year.  And if the hype is to be believed, Brett Lawrie will be elected to the Hall of Fame on November 1, 2012.

Outside of Toronto, the Blue Jays are still in an AL East group behind New York, Boston, and Tampa Bay.  Nobody really expects them to make the playoffs this year, though all are sure they’ll finish way ahead of Baltimore.

The truth, as usual, is probably somewhere in the middle.

The lineup is solid one through nine.  The trouble spots seem to be 1B, 2B, and CF. If Lind gets healthy he should rebound to a solid 5th hitter.  If Kelly Johnson pop 20 homers and plays solid defence, that’s more than enough.  Colby Rasmus, however, seems like a lost soul.  I saw a game in Florida last week, and he looked down on himself even before entering the batter’s box.  He was too in his head, never made solid contact.  His defence will carry him, but I worry for the kid.

On the mound, we have a pretty good top 2.  Romero is a solid stud, and should be good if not great all year long.  Morrow, on the other hand, has a higher ceiling.  I feel good about him putting it all together this year, becoming a pitcher and not just a thrower.  If he wins 18 and K’s 240, I would not be surprised (on the other hand, he’s fragile enough to fall apart and post a 4.50 ERA).  After that, obviously, we have question marks.  I’m pretty good with Alvarez, though I worry he won’t be durable enough for a full season.  The other two spots in the rotation are filled with question marks, and that’s never a good sign.

I don’t see the team making the playoffs this year.  And that’s okay.  We’re still young, and we have tonnes of potential.  If everything breaks our way – Morrow lives up to his talent, Rasmus gets his head together, Lind’s back hold up, etc. – we could certainly contend.  But too much has to go right for that to happen.  I see the Jays winning 85-87 games, contending for the second Wild Card for a couple of months during the middle of the summer before falling off in September.  And I see them being a whole whackload of fun.  There are too many young and energetic players with exuberant personalities for them not to be a hoot to follow.

So, r/BlueJays, what are your thoughts?  Put your hometown biases aside and describe your expectations…",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,Logo1,True,t3_rt518,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/rt518/ok_blue_jays_lets_play_ball_what_i_expect_from/,
