with multiple people in the comments confirming it works and also reporting their accounts were stolen.

Here's how it works:

1. Sign up for a new Skype account. Use the victim's email. A warning will come up that an account with that email already exists, but you can still proceed with filling out the form and account creation.

2. Log in to the Skype client with your new account.

3. https://login.skype.com/account/password-reset-request - request a password reset using the victim's email.

4. You will get a password reset notification and token in your skype client. Follow the link to pick the victim's account and reset the password.


It appears the only way to safeguard yourself for now is to change your main Skype account email to one that's 
not publicly known.

Recently there was a thread in which one of our users posted a link to a .zsh_history file on github that contained filenames and terms commonly associated with child pornography, along with indications that such content had been viewed by that guthub user. 

Another user then posted possible identities linked with the github account along with associated personal information.

Without discussing the legal &amp; forensics aspects of the validity of such a claim, I would like to remind you that posting personal information is against Reddit's TOS. If you post someones personal information you will be banned, if not by us then by the Reddit admins.
  
Thank you to those of you who responded appropriately by reporting comments that contained personal information.
  
I would like to point out that there are lots of venues for reporting crimes of this nature; a public forum such as Reddit **is not** one of these venues. Thank you to those of you who took the proper course of action and reported it this individual's school, the FBI, and the national center for missing and exploited children. 
  
Subsequently, another user suggested that reporting the person for the act of viewing child pornography would do more harm than good, which started a heated debate. There a lots of places where you can go debate child pornography laws and criminal punishment. Guess what? Regardless of your position on the subject, /r/netsec **is not** the place for this.
  
Up until this point, we (the moderators) had limited our actions to removing personal information. Unfortunately someone posted the thread to /r/ShitRedditSays, and that was the end of that. The thread was flooded with trolls, legitimate comments and content pushed to the bottom of the thread, and a circlejerk shitfest of epic proportions started.

Because of how far out of hand the thread had gotten by the time I woke up this morning, I had to sink the entire thread. 300+ comments deleted; mass censorship of both view points, legitimate content was also removed. Additionally I banned pretty much every participant (on both sides.) Sorry, but that's what happens when you can't be adults.
  
I shouldn't have to spend 2 hours of my morning cleaning up after a bunch of overgrown children. It's ridiculous.
  
Moving forward there is a zero tolerance policy towards drama and off topic comments. If we see it, you will be banned. Not because we support or don't support your view, but because this is not the place for it.

Thank you for your continued support,

1340198470.0,629,self.netsec,vbrzg,Etsy has been one of the best companies I've reported holes to.,damontoo,799,170,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/vbrzg/etsy_has_been_one_of_the_best_companies_ive/,"A month ago I was browsing Etsy when I noticed they had a dedicated help page and email for responsible disclosure so I decided to give it a quick search for XSS vulns.

I found one of their JSON requests wasn't being properly sanitized and was being sent as text/html so XSS was possible (all their other XHR requests were fine).

Now, I've had issues in the past with companies failing to take XSS seriously, so I spent some time crafting an example of how it might be exploited by an attacker.

I inject the following payload into a site via iframe -

    window.addEventListener('message',function(e){
    	eval(e.data);
    },false);
    window.top.postMessage('READY','*');

Then in the parent window, I use postMessage to execute more code with the result also wrapped in a postMessage call.

Using this, I was able to eval code on the target page that made an XHR request and grabbed the settings page for the logged in user that loaded my example. Sending the page body back up to my parent window, I then used jQuery to convert it into an object that could be traversed like a normal DOM object.

    var doc = $(pagetext);
    var email = $("".t_close-account-description"", doc).prev().find(""p"")[0].textContent;

And that's it. Now my parent window has the email of the user. My example displayed not only the email, but full name and address as well.

Also note that Etsy obviously anticipated the settings page being a target in a situation like this. They were using X-Frame-Options on all settings pages to prevent clickjacking, but that didn't stop another page from their own site requesting it.

Back on topic..

I discovered the vuln late Friday afternoon and wasn't quite ready to email it to them. Saturday morning, I confirmed the hole was still there and fixed a few bugs with my demo. 

I had my girlfriend test it from her house. It didn't work for her. I tested again and it had stopped working for me. Sure enough, it was now properly sanitized and had the correct JSON MIME type.

I emailed them anyway for two reasons. First, while I was positive the reason for the fix was because they detected my requests, I had already written a nice demo and draft email. Second, I thought that since they patched it before I could report it, they might assume I had malicious intent and report it (I never use proxies etc.).

The following Monday I received a response thanking me for reporting it, and telling me I was right. They had detected my requests and pushed a patch Saturday morning before I could email them. This was by far the fastest response time by any company I've reported to. Not only that, he told me he had messaged the account I created for the sole purpose of testing.

Why did they react so well and so quickly? Their engineering manager that emailed me was Zane Lackey, former security consultant for iSEC.

My experience with Etsy is what I believe other companies should strive for. Better detection, fast response, and excellent communication. At least have a page describing how researchers can go about responsible disclosure.

Thumbs up Etsy. You make me feel like your site is one of the safest places I can shop on the web. :)",,False,,t5_1rqwi,1340223299.0,,,True,t3_vbrzg,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/vbrzg/etsy_has_been_one_of_the_best_companies_ive/,

Link to publishers apps [here](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=myournet&amp;start=0&amp;num=12&amp;hl=en). I just randomly stumbled into one of the apps, recognized it and noticed that the publisher wasn't who it was supposed to be.

[Super Guitar Solo](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.power.SuperSolo&amp;feature=search_result&amp;hl=en) for example is originally [Guitar Solo Lite](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.codingcaveman.SoloTrial&amp;feature=search_result&amp;hl=en). I downloaded two of the apps and extracted the APK's, they both contain what seems to be the ""rageagainstthecage"" root exploit - binary contains string ""CVE-2010-EASY Android local root exploit (C) 2010 by 743C"". Don't know what the apps actually do, but can't be good.

I appreciate being able to publish an update to an app and the update going live instantly, but this is a bit scary. Some sort of moderation, or at least quicker reaction to malware complaints would be nice.

After ~~some dexing and jaxing~~ (where did I get these terms..) decompiling the code (with [dex2jar](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/) and [JD-GUI](http://java.decompiler.free.fr/)), the apps seem to be at least posting the IMEI and IMSI codes to http://184.105.245.17:8080/GMServer/GMServlet, which seems to be located in Fremont, CA.

The apps are also installing another embedded app (hidden as assets/sqlite.db), ""DownloadProvidersManager.apk"". Not sure what it does yet on top of monitoring what apps the user installs.

According to [Android Police's analysis](http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/), the installed app can download and install more code.

Note, that Google has apparently started pulling at least some of the apps.

EDIT: The developer account and the apps have been removed from the market, and the links to the apps above do not work anymore. The app details are still available at [Appbrain](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=myournet), also check [this](http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/) and [this](http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/02/update-on-the-malware-monster-droiddream-is-an-android-nightmare-and-weve-got-more-details/) on Android Police, and [this](http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/03/security-alert-malware-found-in-official-android-market-droiddream/) post by Lookout Mobile Security for a list of additional malicious apps they found on the market. Also I'd like to give credit to the devs at [Teazel](http://www.teazel.com/) for helping in identifying the exploit yesterday.

EDIT2: According to [Lookout Mobile Security](http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/03/security-alert-malware-found-in-official-android-market-droiddream/) these malicious apps were published on two additional dev accounts on top of the one I originally spotted. Appbrain links: [Myournet](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=myournet), [Kingmall2010](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=Kingmall2010) and [we20090202](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=we20090202). Kingmall2010's account seems to be the oldest of the bunch, according to Appbrain it started publishing around Feb 11th (so older than the four days). The other two around Feb 23rd. 

Looking at the download counts for all three accounts on Appbrain. They're lagging behind the real counts, as they don't update daily, so when the Market's real download counts for Myournet on tuesday totalled at 50k-200k, Appbrain is only totalling to 10k to 35k. Even so, adding Kingmall2010's download counts from Appbrain (48k to 224k) to those I nabbed from myournet's account on Market yesterday brings the total downloads to 98k to 424k. And that estimate is probably on the low side.

Ask me (almost) anything!

I manage the Cyber Fast Track (CFT) program (http://www.cft.usma.edu/) as well as several other programs. CFT aims to be a resource to boutique security companies, individuals, and hacker/maker-spaces for overcoming hurdles such as time and money to realize their research ideas without changing their cultures. CFT funded performers keep any commercial intellectual property developed. Since 2010, DARPA has funded almost one hundred research projects under CFT, and we seek a few more before the April 1, 2013 response date. Learn how to submit proposals here: http://www.cft.usma.edu/.  

I will be on here live from 2 PM to 4 PM EST. I’m looking forward to responding to your questions.

I am trying to make this information available to a wider audience than just security folk.]**


NOTE: Physical machine access is not required.

I just came across this disturbing feature of the COMCAST homepage.  If you access the password reset page ( https://login.comcast.net/myaccount/reset ) from a computer with COMCAST Internet it presents you with the challenge question ""Please select the street address associated with your account"" with 3 answers, the correct address and 2 wrong ones.  Refreshing the page gives the correct address and 2 different incorrect answers, so it is trivial to figure out the correct street address.

This allows anyone with access to a machine to determine the billing address which is often the physical street address of the machine.  Obviously this is not a good thing.

EDIT: Since it looks like this post is getting some views let me add that in my opinion any prompting that involves giving the user choices rather than a free form text input is flawed because it would still leak potentially valuable information.  Even in the case of a free form text input, the number of attempts should be limited to prevent brute forcing.

EDIT: Additional info thanks to commentors:
- Seems to work for residential service and not business service
- May require ipv4 and not ipv6
- Soom users are prompted for a username so there appears to be some variance due to undetermined factors
- Report of being able to use the mechanism to actually perform an unauthorized password reset (i didn't bother going through the motion, but i'm not surprised)
- The correct choice of address is actually given away via the use of abbreviations (eg ""ST"" vs ""STREET"")

STATUS (12/30/2012) via /u/cafihapa: *""I reported the error to Abuse, by phone, and the rep I spoke to confirmed that Comcast was aware - it had been mentioned in their meeting at the beginning of his shift. He didn't seem too concerned about it, so I explained why it was an issue. shrugs Comcast, for ya.""*

I just wanted to let you know about my recent experience with the PayPal bounty program.

After collecting bounties from Google and Mozilla and responsibly disclosing bugs to countless other companies, I thought I knew what to expect. I reviewed the program terms and made sure I followed the rules. I'd like to focus on the one most important rule -

&gt; The bug bounty is valid for all PayPal web sites only.

After a quick search I found a hole in developers.paypal.com. I wrote a message explaining the issue, signed and encrypted it and sent it off. I immediately got an auto-responder saying the message was received and they would investigate the report. This was on July 4th. On July 31st, I *still* hadn't heard anything else from PayPal and the vuln still existed so I emailed them again asking for the report's status. Today I finally received a response.

They said that the subdomain is an x.com site and outside the scope of the bounty program. They also still haven't fixed it more than 30 days after the report. On top of that, they also asked me to report it to a different department.

Conclusion: Unless your vuln directly affects www.paypal.com, it's outside the scope of their bounty program.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,False,,,True,t3_xwstl,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/xwstl/paypal_bounty_program_dont_bother/,

So, I dumped the contents of my Tools directory to a spreadsheet. These tools have been collected over a number of years, some for CTFs, some for client engagements. Not everything got archived in the Tools directory, so some stuff that was important at one point is missing.

I've asked a few friends to help contribute, but I'd like it even more if you guys here in netsec would add your own list of miscellaneous tools. If you'd like to contribute directly to the spreadsheet, request access via Google Docs, and I'll add you as an editor, otherwise you can supply your suggestions in this thread.

The details are not relevant, aside from a Cisco -Guest network broadcasted off of a water tower. Enough time without Internet and I started to get desperate. The router would process TCP SYNs to all IPv4 addresses on port 80, and force you to login via a simple web form over HTTP. I could not find any default passwords for the router. No obvious trickery defeated it, either. Any sort of SSHing out was dropped and I had no way of freeing myself. Of course, in those few days without Internet I relaxed and probably became a better person. But, I did find a plausible way around the cruel restrictions on the router. The one thing it passed through was DNS traffic. I confirmed I could even send traffic directly to my own name server. I realized then that one should be able to tunnel/VPN out solely via DNS traffic.

I was right. I went home and found out about some software called Iodine: http://code.kryo.se/iodine/

I was already using port 53 for authorative DNS on my VPS, so I spun up another server. I launched iodined. Then, iodine from the laptop. And, with some tweaking, it worked! I used this setup with the occasional option change for a couple years. There's numerous Starbucks, airport, and -Guest networks which this works on. I even found a case where it would have worked on a free wireless network, where somehow the router did not route properly, except to the resolvers.

I'd always wanted to offer this as a service and finally had the chance to wrap it up. It's currently 398 lines of C and Bash to handle registration, payment via Bitcoin, and authentication all over SSH.

I would really appreciate it if you guys played around with it. It hasn't seen a single user yet, and even if it doesn't take off it'd mean a lot to me to see it in action.

http://dns.canhasinter.net/

Let me know if you have any questions about the site or tunneling via DNS/raw UDP traffic. I haven't jumped into all of the specifics that much, but have a decent grasp of what's going. I know there are some better explanations of DNS tunneling out there and there's also a Perl daemon that does it, and probably more. And apologies for the ugly site. I'm dating a girl with a graphics design background, so perhaps that will change some time :-).

Thanks,

Teran/sega01

**Edit**: Thanks for the comments everyone! I made an offer out on the Bitcoin Talk forums for a free 5GB credit for three people. I'm extending that here to the next three people who comment or send me a PM with your DNS account's Bitcoin address after you register (via ssh nopass@dfw1.dns.canhasinter.net). Reedit: 5GB credits 

**2nd Edit**: I'm seeing the occasional person try the registration menu (ssh as nopass user), but disconnecting at some point. I have some really weird code in that registration shell, so please let me know if you're having any problems with it.

**3rd Edit**: 50MB free credit per account! After that, it's 0.01BTC per GB. I'm working on improving the page text. It's really confusing right now. Added a Javascript Bitcoin QR code generator in case you have your coins on your phone and want to scan in the address to send to easily.

**4th Edit**: Added a Mac OS X 10.8 script/tarball. It's pretty streamlined, so please give it a try and let me know how it works for you!

**5th Edit** 2013-03-28: Added OS X 10.7 package. Lowered prices to 0.001BTC per GB and upped the free credit to 500MB.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,1364490854.0,,,True,t3_19uh24,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/19uh24/most_payfor_wifi_networks_vulnerable_to_tunneling/,

There wasn't much information other than vague comments about client-side crypto and AES...

While poking around I noticed some interesting JS calls like this one:
    var aes = new sjcl.cipher.aes([111111, 222222, 333333, 444444]);

Looking at the lib [here](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.com/sjcl/doc/symbols/sjcl.cipher.aes.html) it appears to be setting ""an AES key for both encryption and decryption"". Obviously it got my attention.

It turns out that the code is hashing a bunch of javascript and html files found in variable 'jsl' (although it doesn't seem to bother with checking css files listed there??).
The contents are also mangled a bit prior to 'encrypting' by adding 10 'X's on the end of each. The hash is then passed back in for each subsequent file in jsl.

Finally the hash is compared to the 'correct' hash 'h'
    h = [1855138067, 858455619, 1009192277, 475246000];

So
* if you want to do js injection you need to workaround the above check
* if you can do something naughty in css then there are 3 to choose from

That's all I have for now - just thought people might be interested...



UPDATE:
Have a look at the var 'localStorage' 

This is a redacted version of mine:

    Storage
    attr: ""{""u"":""9EOvjXYZZZ"",""s"":0,""email"":""my@emailaddr.com"",""name"":""Bob"",""k"":""No idea what this does"",""c"":1,""pubk"":""my public key goes here - not sure what this really does yet so I'm taking it out"",""ts"":""No idea what this does""}""

    sid: ""No idea what this does""
    test: ""1""
    ul_skipIdentical: ""0""
    wasloggedin: ""true""

The pubk/privk are interesting - more work to figure out if they are the real deal.
The treenodes I think relate to the folder I created.
No idea what k,ts and sid are used for yet.

I found that ul_skipIdentical is the test which uploads a hash of the file first to check for dups. I noticed you can opt in/out of this service.
Next step is to extract the pubk/privk and setup a test to see if I can encrypt/decrypt using them...

UPDATE 2:

Sorry - my ul_skipIdentical comment is probably crap. It appears to control the behaviour when a file already exists with the same name and file size at the given node (position in the file tree).

(alpha version)",WabeMaster,356,58,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/tkriv/a_redditlike_p2p_social_network_idea_based_on_rsa/,"**NOTE: I'm looking for feedback**  I think everything is correct.  In particular, looking for feedback on the cryptography, proofs of work, possible attacks, and trust aspects, use of neural nets.

Demo running here: http://jk43lztczbrel2lp.onion/ [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ehYPa.jpg)

You can figure out most of the system from playing around with the demo.  It's pretty easy to download the source code for it - just save the page and look at the server source link.  Sorry it is on Tor, but it is pretty convenient to do it this way.

I'm calling this Wabe right now.  ""Wabe's A'Based on Encryption"".  That's a code name, I'm sure this can be named better later on.

**Edit**: The server was down for a few hours but is back up.  To respond to comments: I did not implement RSA in javascript; I used [this](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) and modified it slightly.  The base64 representation is a little different (""0"" = 0, instead of ""A"" = 0) (see jsbn.js).  I'm assuming this will be thrown out for better encryption library.

**A reddit-like peer to peer social network.**

This is entirely based on public key cryptography, proofs of work, and open, ad hoc standards.  A person creates a key, gives out the public part.  The key is owned by that person, and the assumption is that *anything* signed by that key *must* have come from that key - an accepted fact of RSA.  The big difference from reddit is that this happens on the client side.

It's a wild wild west sort of internet.  There is no deleting or censorship, no moderation or admins.  The servers might suck, or they might work.  But through cryptographic guarantees, one can be assured that a message from a friend comes from a friend.

Information is easy to spread, and easy to verify.

This is:

* A distributed, unstructured searchable database. (or, it will be)

* A JSON-based specification of message signing and proof of work

* Consensus on how to interpret the data

Features:

* Messages are signed.  They can be proven to be from a source on the *client side*.  They cannot be deleted.

* Votes are signed.  This allows trust networks to happen.  (One can make votes from another key than comments to decouple them)

* Proof of work needed to publish messages, to curb spamming.

* Based on JSON data - extensible, easy to implement in a browser and libraries exist in every major language.

* Open, no standards except key data elements (public key, signature, message, proof of work).

* Simple search method on server, one that is hashable, cacheable.

Hypothetical FAQ

How do you deal with spam/vote bots?

This does the opposite.  Rather than assume everyone is a person, and try to root out spammers (which is difficult and elusive, since identities are cheap), the system enables a way to deal with it, by making the source of votes public.

With this knowledge, a neural net or other machine learning technique can predict likely trust given previous votes.  Basically, if you agree with someone's votes, you get a positive correlation.  Your client could display a ""predicted"" vote by looking at the already cast votes and running them through a neural net.

Isn't this inefficient?

Yes.  It is more efficient to do this like reddit does, on a few servers with centralized information, and ad revenue coming in.  The gain is a better social network.

Database replication?

This is necessary for a larger network.  The idea is to do this based on searches.  Databases can store results like {signature=""a\*""}, {signature=""b\*""}, etc., which are essentially hash table entries.  So it can cache these results.  For this network to work, all relevant messages have to be stored somewhere, so they can be requested.  This is the server side.

Existing solutions like Kademlia?

It may be worth using Kademlia to store databases, as this network has replication and already exists.  This could be used to look up single messages or groups of messages, *but* it would be difficult to look up, say, everything that replied to some given post.

The main difference is that searches are looking for *multiple, dynamic results*.  Kademlia might be able to store a new search result every 10 minutes, but actual search servers are still necessary to provide quick knowledge of new posts.

Proving *when* a message was sent?

This has to be collaborative.  A scheme like bitcoin's block chain might be used - where all the new messages are hashed with a nonce so they can be proven to have existed at the time of discovery.  Namecoin has already integrated with bitcoin, and left the door open for other hashes to enter, so it may be possible to join this as well.

Isn't this a lot like OpenPGP?

Yes.  OpenPGP allows for message signing, but the specification is much bigger, very old, and assumed to be crufty.

Key?

* ""n"": RSA public modulus (modified base64)

* ""e"": RSA public exponent (modified base64)

* ""d"": RSA private exponent (modified base64)

* ""f"": Difficulty of proof of work (not part of RSA).  Difficulty is the number of consecutive 0's in SHA1(f+e+""/""+n), much like bitcoin.  One would do a lot of computation to prove that he really cares about his identity, by searching for a value of ""f"" that produces these properties.  Maximum difficulty is 160.

Modified base64.  I'm only using this because the jsbn library I picked up didn't want to use the standard alphabet.  It does have the advantage that 0-&gt;""0"" instead of 0-&gt;""A"".

    standard base64: 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_'
    modified base64: '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-_'

The update is DAT 5958, and seems to effect Windows XP machines. 

This seems to be a *very* widespread problem.

Just fyi.

*EDIT:*

What we did... we wrote a vbscript that rolled back the .dat version (and did some other stuff) and we pushed it to our domain through group policy. It seems to be fixing MOST computers after a few reboots - not all. 

*Edit's edit* For those people who were unable to obtain the fix via group policy (because svchost.exe was deleted, which in turn killed a lot of necessary services), we had to send people out with flash drives to restore svchost, and roll back the DAT.

So what the fuck does this do? well, basicly, it seems to be bruteforcing random addresses at the .ru tld. Loading them up as iframes.

the address its loading is: [exactly 16 chr random string].ru/runforestrun?sid=cx.

as far as i can tell, this seems pointless, and i almost wounder if the random functions are rigged to give the same address out every time, hiding its true purpose

The frame loader only seems to be running once. So unless im missing something in the wrapper code that repeats it, I don't think this is as it seems. and im almost sure i'm starting to reach over my head on this one =\.

UPDATE: Confirmed for rigged random generator. It seems to propose a predictable set of addresses.

addresses found so far: pgmxykzlqomziebp.ru nbxrjalwllvnbmfs.ru

address function showcased: http://scenexpress.net/payloadtest.html (safe)

Now I work in our security department and my boss has been to countless training courses so his logic went as follows: netcat is used by hackers everywhere as their tunneling tool of choice therefore it's bad.  I pressed him further and apparently netcat is a backdoor utility that encrypts all traffic in a secure tunnel.  TIL.  I reminded him that netcat is just a traffic re-writer and does nothing of the sort and that it's a ""swiss army knife"" to which he said ""exactly, if it can do all that stuff it's too dangerous to use"".  What? Guess we better ban everything!  Anyway just needed to vent and was curious if you guys had similar stories...

P.S. It turned out fine since it gave me an awesome excuse to play with some new programming concepts (actors) while I re-wrote the basics of netcat in Java (well scala).  Over-engineered? Yup but I learned a ton which I'm now using for more projects so w/e.

Edit:  Wow holy crap didn't expect this kind of response.  I see most of you are harping on my boss and I feel I should say he's normally a pretty smart guy except for the few times when he doesn't quite get technical things.  He doesn't really have any programming background so most of the info is taken literally whereas usually you need to read between the lines and understand where the exceptions are (sometimes hard if don't understand how low-level things work); I feel he's good at getting the ""big picture"" of security which is what his job is so... Again I was just venting in frustration and as I ""P.S.""ed I'm glad because now I frackin love scala and am pretty sure where I'll be taking my career.  Anyway I was mostly hoping to read similar stories like what arbiterxero posted.

Also to everybody saying symlink netcat... I don't even have access to the server I just need to give them a solution so that would fall on its face.  Plus now that I've asked him and he said no -- that would put me in the insubordination category if I blatantly went behind his back like that.

1290601809.0,224,self.netsec,eb2lb,[ModPost] Please use the [PDF] tag when directly linking to a PDF.,sanitybit,335,111,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/eb2lb/modpost_please_use_the_pdf_tag_when_directly/,"When linking directly to PDFs, please append **[PDF]** to the submission title. If you don't, some people will have a nervous breakdown and trip balls. 
  
A quick refresher course on PDF security &amp; risk mitigation:
  
* The PDF format isn't inherently insecure, the problems are in the software used to display documents. 
  
* Adobe Reader is the most popular, and hence, targeted the most by attackers. There are lots of good alternatives to Adobe Reader.
  
* Whatever reader software you use, keep it up to date.
  
* Adobe Reader 10 has sandbox isolation ([on supported configurations](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86063.html#main_Unsupported_configurations)).
  
* On Windows, install and enable [EMET](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/09/10/use-emet-2-0-to-block-the-adobe-0-day-exploit.aspx) for your reader software. While you're at it, enable it for your browser and anything else you use to frequently interact with questionable data.
  
* On Linux, use evince (the default GNOME document viewer) with an [AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) profile. This should be enabled by default on Ubuntu 9.10 and later. You can check the status of AppArmor by running the following command as root:
  
        apparmor_status
  
* Google Chrome has a built in sandboxed PDF viewer (check about:plugins); you can also enable it in Chromium builds with [minimal effort](https://gordonazmo.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-enable-googles-pdf-plugin-in-chromium/).
  
* Configure your browser to always ask what you want to do when you click a PDF, rather than immediately downloading and opening it.
  
* You can use the Google Doc Viewer to safely view PDFs in your browser. Automate this w/ a [user script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/62538).

        https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://site.tld/evil.pdf? 
  
* Employing common sense and critical thinking goes a long way.
  
* Enable custom styles in your Reddit preferences &amp; browse to http://reddit.com/r/netsec directly. Any link that ends in .pdf will have a PDF icon next to it. This applies to both submissions &amp; comments. [Example](http://example.tld/evil.pdf).
  
There is no reason to be afraid of a PDF if you take the right precautions. Stay safe!
  
P.S. Don't comment on how unsafe PDF is every time a PDF is submitted. If you're scared, go to church.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_eb2lb,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/eb2lb/modpost_please_use_the_pdf_tag_when_directly/,moderator

What can be done to mitigate this?,xaphanos,302,83,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/fds0i/im_under_ddos_attack_right_now_what_can_be_done/,"I work at a small hosting company. One of our customers is experiencing a DDoS attack - and has been since 6PM last night. It is determined and focused on this one company - striking at multiple domains in multiple datacenters. It started as a syn flood, then moved on to a ""http get /"" flood. Currently, we see assorted attempts to simply overwhelm the webserver.

We've implemented a firewall that uses a script to add hosts to a blacklist if they open more than 20 connections in a minute. That's certainly reduced the impact, but the sites are still suffering terribly.

Can anyone recommend a vendor or a documented best practice to weather this storm? And perhaps any advice on how to move beyond the ""sniff, analyze, improvise, implement, repeat"" cycle we seem to be in - and on to an ""implement, defend, stabilize, get some sleep"" mode?

Please forgive my incoherencies - I've been awake for 26 hours running at this point - with no resolution in sight. Thanks.

**EDIT:**
WOW. The response has been far more helpful than I could have hoped. I should have posted when this all started - it would have saved a lot of head-scratching.

At this point, the senior network guy and my boss have both gone on ""break"" (naps). The customer is satisfied with our response - while we stayed and fought and got things working our ""competitor"" (the other datacenter hosting the ""extra"" domain) called for a ""specialist"" that STILL hasn't shown up yet. I am in a holding pattern handling all the regular daily tasks here (the weather means a few folks are out today).

The customer sites are working, albeit slowly and with occasional timeouts. The CPU on the servers (and, for that matter, the load balancer) is under control. The ball is in the customer's court - hire a performance/security consultant, buy an IPS appliance, or wait it out.

What we learned is that our best practice for this is to plop a VM with iptables and our special ""learning+throttling"" script in front of the entire environment, and then go after the outlying issues. We will follow up with researching a few more tools that are very likely to help, but have not been used yet. ""Sniff, analyze, improvise, implement, repeat"" is not so bad after all. Oh - and always keep a spare shirt at the office.

I will post once this moves forward again. But right now we're all spent and the customer isn't screaming so we're taking a break.

*Edit: Since a lot of people commenting saying that I'm paranoid, I just wanted to make it known that I don't have all of these constantly running. I'm also not running a rootkit scan every 5 minutes with a tinfoil hat on my head. I listed all of the tools that I have used before and that I do use occasionally. I made this thread to show what I use/have used in the past and to learn of other tools that I haven't heard of before.*


*tl;dre: The only tools constantly running on my PC are Microsoft Security Essentials with execution-only scanning, Comodo Internet Security with Defense+ in Paranoid Mode, KeyScrambler and RUBotted. And I suppose you could include TrueCrypt, because it's always running so I have access to my sources and various projects.*

I myself am aspiring to get into InfoSec, and I'm glad he got the job.

However, I must question the circumstances. Has he not technically broken the law? Specifically [Title 18 § 1030](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001030----000-.html)?

A friend of mine spent half a year in jail for doing quite nearly the exact same thing he did. (Alerting a wireless user to the vulnerabilities on their machine by exploiting it, and then telling them via email.) The vindictive person on the other end had all the evidence they needed to prosecute him.

There seem to be many ethical and legal implications here. With shades of gray.

Facebook's new ""messaging platform"" has 3 key features that together are insecure.

1. Being able to send email to any facebook user that has registered for a @facebook.com address

2. Displaying email messages in the same list as regular facebook private messages (the only distinction is a very small and subtle mail icon in the top right of the message).

3. When you receive an email message sent to your @facebook.com address and the from address is associated with ANY facebook account (whether or not that person is your friend), facebook chooses to display the name on the facebook account, rather than the email address


This results in the ability to spoof messages on facebook, where previously, users have had reason to believe that messages from friends or other users were authentic (unless that account was compromised).


There are only 2 ways to determine that the message may not be authentic

1. In most cases (but not all!), facebook displayed a small exclamation icon at the top of the message and when you hovered over it, it displays ""Unable to verify &lt;Bob Smith&gt; as the sender.""  This is ONLY displayed when you open the message directly.  It is NOT displayed in the message list itself nor is it displayed when you receive an email notification saying you have a new message.  I was able to spoof a message to myself from Kevin Poulsen's official facebook account and no such icon was displayed in that case

2. There is a small and subtle mail icon displayed, again, in the message itself, but not in the message list or notification emails.  Hovering over this icon displays ""Sent from &lt;email@address.com&gt;""


**How to test this security hole**
*Do not use this hole for evil, use it for educational/verification purposes only*

1. You need a facebook email address (I believe it's still not open to everyone) registered with your account

2. You need access to an open mail relay server (which allows you to send a message through SMTP using any address)

3. You need to know the email address of someone with a facebook account and that email address needs to be the one they associated with the account.   I used klp@wired.com (Kevin Poulsen), whose email address is quite public.

4. Send an email TO your facebook email address and FROM another address associated with a facebook account.  Subject and message contain do not matter

5. Login to your facebook account and check your messages

6. You may also optionally enable email notifications for messages to see this in further action.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_ezr93,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/ezr93/facebooks_messaging_platform_is_broken_and_they/,

boxes due to the exim remote root exploit",Chet_,289,79,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/en650/details_of_the_root_kit_that_got_installed_on_my/,"Some of my Debian Lenny boxes were running unpatched exim4 4.69 and as a result [were vulnerable to a remote root exploit](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/682457).  It looks like I was hit with [a scripted attack](http://ownage.pastebin.com/p6H27tUs).

Anyway, I couldn't find any reports of the results of the attack, but here's what happened to me:

All the binaries in the [procps](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/procps) package were replaced with compromised versions.  It also added /usr/include/mysql/mysql.hh1 (a text file containing the word ""dropbear""), created a /usr/include/sslv3/ directory with dropbear and mig.  

It created an /etc/exim4/exim4.conf and /etc/exim4/exim.conf, but in at least one case, the top of the file actually contained the output of a wget command to fetch an exim.conf, including the IP address of what might be the attacking host.  

Also installed was a /etc/init.d/xfs3 fake service start file that attempts to set iptables (which didn't work on all the hosts due to differing configurations) and run dropbear from /usr/include/sslv3/dropbear.

To get in, it created a number of temporary files in /var/spool/exim4, including a small C program which it compiled and setuid to get root access and run a shell as root:

    -rw------- 1 Debian-exim Debian-exim     117 Dec 15 16:41 a.conf
    -rw------- 1 Debian-exim Debian-exim     119 Dec 15 16:41 e.conf 
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root        root             75 Dec 16 18:00 rk
    -rw------- 1 root        root        4421289 Dec 15 20:13 rk.tgz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root        root              0 Dec 16 13:26 s
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root        root              0 Dec 16 13:26 s.c
    -rwsr-xr-x 1 root        root           6764 Dec 15 23:29 setuid
    -rw------- 1 Debian-exim Debian-exim    3120 Dec 15 16:41 setuid.1
    -rw------- 1 Debian-exim Debian-exim     130 Dec 15 16:41 setuid.c

Note that the rk directory contained the installer for the root kit.  The last step of the root kit install script says:

    echo ""Don't forget to:""
    echo ""cd ..""
    echo ""rm -rf rk rk.tbz2""

I guess someone forgot.

Here is a list of (most?) of the files that were considered compromised or created by the attack on one host.  The content of /var/spool/exim4 varied from host to host.

    /bin/kill
    /bin/ps
    /etc/init.d/xfs3
    /root/.ssh
    /sbin/sysctl
    /usr/bin/free
    /usr/bin/pgrep
    /usr/bin/pkill
    /usr/bin/pmap
    /usr/bin/pwdx
    /usr/bin/skill
    /usr/bin/slabtop
    /usr/bin/snice
    /usr/bin/tload
    /usr/bin/top
    /usr/bin/uptime
    /usr/bin/vmstat
    /usr/bin/w
    /usr/bin/watch
    /usr/include/mysql/mysql.hh1
    /usr/include/sslv3
    /usr/include/sslv3/dropbear
    /usr/include/sslv3/mig
    /var/spool/exim4/a.conf
    /var/spool/exim4/a.conf.1
    /var/spool/exim4/e.conf
    /var/spool/exim4/e.conf.1
    /var/spool/exim4/rk.tgz.1
    /var/spool/exim4/setuid
    /var/spool/exim4/setuid.1
    /var/spool/exim4/setuid.2
    /var/spool/exim4/setuid.c
    /var/spool/exim4/setuid.c.1

On one host, it also left two files in /tmp: e.conf and c.pl.  They were zero bytes when I found them.

All of the procps files and many of the other installed files were made ""append only"" and ""immutable"" (via chattr) to make it harder for root to delete or fix the files.  This basically meant that the kit flags most of its files so you can hunt them down with a recursive lsattr.

I also found root's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with a recent modification on at least one host.

I haven't seen any reports of any of this anywhere yet, except on [one twitter post](http://twitter.com/carljm/status/15547708198617089).  If anyone has any advice on where else to post this, please repost it there or reply here.

Could anyone please advise?",anastas,268,58,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/d5wmp/my_vpshosted_website_university_of_reddit_was/,"I originally posted about this in the University of Reddit subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/d5vui/university_of_reddit_was_recently_hit_by_a_ddos/) and a commenter pointed me in this direction.

I am not an experienced sysadmin at all and thus would appreciate advice on how to approach this problem. 2 Gb/sec would eat my monthly bandwidth allotment in 12 minutes, so I don't know what to do once Linode removes the null route in 24 hours. It doesn't help that the web console that Linode provides is slow enough to be unusable.

I have no idea who launched this attack or why anyone would target UReddit. Linode is not releasing to me any information on the attack itself aside from the fact that it was 2 Gb and 2 million packets per second.

**Edit:** Linode's CEO got involved once I pushed for more information, and here is that he said:

&gt;I looked into the history of 69.164.216.74, and our system has either never allocate it to anyone else, ever -- or it has been such a long time that the history of it has expired. This is likely measured in at least months, as it's been that long since we last ran the purge script. So, it's unlikely that it's a stale IP issue, fwiw. Our system also allocates the longest-unused IP first, to avoid stale-IP issues such as the one you described.

so it looks as though my website really is the target, not the IP or the network by some coincidence. And:

&gt;I can tell you that the attack was UDP based and all from the same source IP, and given its magnitude I'm absolutely certain the source address was forged on the packets. So, we shall never know how many machines were involved, nor what their actual source IPs were.

Well, unfortunately it is possible. You would think there would be some sort of protection against this, right? I've only tested this in v5.0, but I'm sure it works in most (if not all) other versions. 


But yeah. Any extension you make/download has the potential to make itself hidden from about:addons (which is what the average user uses to manage their addons) - and do sneaky stuff in the background. You can always check your extensions folder if you're feeling paranoid, though.

So, as long as the dictionary is larger than 2047 words, e.g. you use semi-obscure lexicon, it should be fairly secure.

The break-down of access to their website is:

* going to thepiratebay.se will go to a transit router

* that transit router is owned and operated by the administrators at TPB (The Pirate Bay)

* it points to a load balancer (also owned by TPB admins)

* that load balancer points to one of many servers hosting their application

* if a server receives no communication from the load balancer then it shuts down automatically

The transit router and load balancer are physically managed by the admins while the application servers are virtual and with many different cloud providers (on multiple continents), and the communication between the servers and load balancer is encrypted (so as to prevent snooping on the cloud provider's part). **Can this be insecure?**

Another important note is that the server images are password-protected and encrypted (another anti-snooping measure). **Can this be insecure?**

An interesting quote from the article:

1335098192.0,184,self.netsec,smjxv,AskNetSec: Can an OpenVPN connection be inspected by the ISP? (I'm a resident in an authoritarian country),throwaway15435,227,43,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/smjxv/asknetsec_can_an_openvpn_connection_be_inspected/,"Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm in [VNM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_codes:_U%E2%80%93Z). A hot topic about 2 years ago was the mining of B--xite in the country. I'm currently reading some ""cablegates"" from wikileaks about the matter, namely [09HANOI927](http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09HANOI927) and [09HANOI537](http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09HANOI537).

They mention a website in 09HANOI537 (¶4). I almost tried accessing that website right away, then realised that I could be put on a netizen watch list of some sort, so decided to use a VPN connection to read that instead.

The VPN connection is running through OpenVPN 2.2.2 - it is located outside the country. I have a push directive that makes the client send all traffic through the VPN connection. Additionally, I've set up iptables to forward that traffic. As well as forwarding all those traffic, DNS is also using the VPN server to resolve. Checking on ifconfig.me shows me completely masked and trying to access a website while having wireshark capture packets on the normal connection shows that DNS are not routed in the open.

Now, accessing that website shows a blank page instead. ""b--x---v---n--.info has address 204.12.230.69"" seems to be the correct one.

I think that the website might actually be blank from outside but unfortunately I have no 100% sure way to check. Even using an OpenVPN like this makes me wonder... if the connection isn't being cut?

Now comes the **question**... please excuse my paranoia but it is reasonable to be so after a few arrests lately... is it possible for infrastruture holders (ISP, Government) to actually perform deep packet inspection on an OpenVPN connection? Provided that they've been able to snoop all handshake packets, are they able to perform MITM techniques to inspect my packets?

And, would using Tor be better or worse?

You always hear stories about people's asses being saved by True Crypt and not giving up the passwords when the cops come knocking. My friend claims that you will be charged with obstruction of justice if you don't give it up though. I remember there was a law in the UK about this but I'm not sure if it ever passed. Anyways does anyone have any experience with this? 


Obviously sometimes it is defiantly better to take an obstruction charge over something that could be way worse and more incriminating on your harddrive. But would they even charge you with obstruction of justice for withholding the password to your harddrive? Especially if they don't have much other evidence otherwise?

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses everyone, it is a very interesting subject.
I think the conclusions we came across are as follows:


**In the US:** No clear precedent, although most speculate you are protected under 5th amendment rights.

**In the UK:** You must give up the pass or face prison up for to 2 years. (May or may not be worse depending on what it is encrypted)",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_hzqrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/hzqrz/can_using_truecrypt_mean_being_charged_with/,

But what is the ""best practice"" these days?  Surely most of the L2/L3 threats have been mitigated in the router filters -- why bother with a firewall?

Personally, I would question the value of the traditional firewall at all. Why bother? It seems to me that egress filtering in the router, combined with application layer inspection (both in Web proxy and using Snort) would be far more useful, since a large percentage of attacks will bypass the firewall entirely, and try to compromise the browser.

If you were going to rebuild your firewall architecture again today, would you even bother to specify a firewall? I think they're obsolete.

My approach: basic stateful filtering in ingress and egress routers.  Separate IDS with IPS capabilities selectively.  Most of the attention should be looking for malware delivery in email attachments and web proxy traffic.  Combine this with comprehensive end-point detection, additional screening between internal VLANs, and multiple functional DMZs, and add seasoning with regular pentests, aggressive patch management and traffic anomaly monitoring to taste.

Not only the password on the e-mail can be sniffed, but in order to remember the ""strong"" password, I will have to select a password from my ""strong passwords for serious web sites pool"" which means I had to give it a password that I use on other web sites, or make up a new password and forget about it or write it down. This password will stay on their system forever, be exposed in a number of vulnerabilities over the ""forever"" period of time and at the end it will probably be sold when the company goes bankrupt...

my personal views/opinions:

The book is simply 750 pages of amazing work. Here are a few things its covers:

* setting up a malware analysis lab
* keeping yourself safe &amp; anonymous when doing Internet based recon of malware
* dynamic analysis of binaries and running processes using debuggers, sandboxes, and other tools
* honeypot setup and monitoring
* volatility memory analysis using Volatility

and tons of other topics. I usually don't get that excited about security/forensics books, but the amount of (well written) information in this one is staggering.

So I have my own domain name, and I use a unique email address for every company I deal with, so that I can easily identify email from them, and track who they pass my details on to. For example, for Amazon I might use amazon@mydomain and for Tesco I use tesco@mydomain.

I've seen a few posts over the years on netsec from people in similar situations, where they suddenly start receiving spam on specific email addresses. A few weeks ago, I received a spam email from The Sun (one of the largest UK tabloid news companies), which was sent to my tesco address. I don't find it very likely that The Sun would try brute force generating email addresses, so I can only assume either:

* Tesco passed on my details, which is in breach of their privacy policy.

Or...

* The Sun have obtained a list of email addresses that originated from a dubious source obtained maliciously from Tesco (i.e. harvesting from a security breach on their website, or stealing it).

So, I did two things. I checked my account to see if there's any mention of, or some checkbox, which gives them permission to pass my details on to other people. There are no such options. Secondly, I contacted Tesco to tell them. I specifically asked them to pass these details on to their online security team.

The first reply simply stated that they never pass on customer details to any third parties, and copy and pasted what they have in their privacy policy which states as much... adding that the only people they ever pass details onto are the police when requested.

I reiterated that that The Sun have somehow got an email address that has only ever been used with Tesco, and asked again that they pass these details onto their security team, but their reply simply stated that they use SSL so it's not possible.

I again replied, telling them that their use of SSL is not the point, and again requested that this be taken seriously, but that was two weeks ago, and I've had no reply.

It should be noted that I'm a consultant for one of the worlds largest e-commerce solution providers, and security is one of my areas of expertise (I told them this). I've seen email harvesting performed on other sites by simply incrementing the counter used in a user's login cookie and their ""My Account"" page displays someone else's email address.

I don't know what to do, if anything. It annoys me that Tesco has such a crap response to a potential security issue raised by someone whom they were informed knows what they're talking about.

So I was just on Facebook and I noticed some spam on my wall. 


Here's how it works:
The user (you, me, our friends, etc) clicks a link on our wall and it directs us to /plugins/serverfbml.php on Facebook, which is an FBML (Facebook Markup Language - I won't rant about this now, but I've got to say it's a little pretentious to add a colon to a tag and define it as a new language but we'll save that for another time) renderer which takes the FBML and 'converts it' to HTML/JS.




They actually let users pass code into the URL and display an interpreted version of this on their site (potentially - oh and successfully) allowing XSS attacks to be executed. Again, I understand that they require this functionality, but there are people who abuse it - obviously.



So here's where it gets funny. The attacker passed in a form and some other FBML elements to:
Get the users post_form_id and fb_dtsg (randomly generated keys that are passed to every form to prevent external websites from manipulating their accounts and spamming their walls) via a regular expression, then pass those to an external url via a GET, and post to their walls from an external website which in turn keeps the website viral. 

The bad thing is this isn't the worse thing that the attackers could do.

And no, we're not here to give you free security audits, many here do it professionally and why should we waste our time with your flawed/insecure ideas.


I understand that no programmers write flawless code, but when it comes to crypto, the stakes are high. If you fucked up somewhere in the many fuckable realms of designing/developing crypto systems, you are doing a disservice to both your users and the infosec community.  You can potentially expose your user's secret, put them in danger, and give a bad name to crypto.


I'm posting this since I've been having a on going argument with [Kaepora](http://www.reddit.com/user/Kaepora) in this deleted [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/jdiip/cryptocat_creates_a_private_encrypted_chatroom_on/).  I can't seem to get the point across that more considerations are needed before deciding to roll out with these services, it really bugs me that n00bs keep on insisting that web-based client-side crypto services are a great solution.  This is the same redditor who rolled out with the now [defunct cryptb.in](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/gb1mk/new_version_of_cryptbin_released_now_with_public/).  Even the crypto.cat [tutorial video](http://vimeo.com/24583701) makes me cringe, Bob and Alice are better off sharing their public-keys before parting and communicate over GnuPG, that way they can use a trusted and mature program and encrypt just about anything digital, instead they are sharing symmetric-keys that could be compromised and using an untested service that the government could be [sslstrip](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/)ing.  The better idea is to teach the user to do it right the first time around, teach them how to use trusted+mature crypto suites.


As [robozome](http://www.reddit.com/user/robozome) pointed in the deleted [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/jdiip/cryptocat_creates_a_private_encrypted_chatroom_on/), this [article](http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/29/final-post-on-javascript-crypto/) is just a few reasons why browser-based client-side crypto is a bad idea.


If you're an attention whoring InfoSec wannabe, stop whoring half-baked crypto ideas, go whore with some other ideas that is less dangerous.  If you want well deserved attention, come out with novel exploits or new security paradigms.  When you redesign or re-implement ideas that has already been well thought out (GnuPG, OpenSSL, etc), you're denying all those before you who put much more effort in crypto development and have considerably more experience than you have.  Maybe its worth standing on the shoulders of giants rather than a dwarf standing alone.

Leave the designing and implementation of production cryptosystems to those who are actually qualified to do so. Experienced crypto specialists are few in numbers and a very small subset of infosec community.  And if you want to join them, by all means you're welcome to do so, but the knowledge must be learned and don't be a hack.

If you want to practice developing of crypto systems, sure that's fine however you **shouldn't** push it onto the web, advertise it as a ""secure"" service and entice people unfamiliar with crypto into using it, this could very well lead the user to suffer unintended and potentially dangerous consequences.

Instead of wasting your effort on designing and developing flawed web-based client-side crypto systems, you're better off doing your homework on the proper way of using mature+trusted crypto systems and educating users on how to properly use it.  Here's a tick list:

* Learn about [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography)
* Understand [web of trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust)
* Learn to use [GnuPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard)
* Generate your first key-pair
* Learn, join, and hold [key signing party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party)
* Publish your signed keys at [MIT PGP Public Key Server](http://pgp.mit.edu/) or other public key servers.
* Use GnuPG email integrate, Thunderbird+[Enigmail](http://enigmail.mozdev.org/home/index.php.html)
* Sign and encrypt stuff

&lt;/rant&gt;

 *tl;dr: Crypto n00bs can be dangerous.

**update** I just ran that again against ns1.linkedin.com and the Google nameservers and there are still around 90 domains pointing to the 204 server.

**edit** I might have mixed up some of the IP addresses here, I got a message on twitter that the 204.11 IP is a DDoS mitigation service. but then a DDoS mitigation server would look almost identical to an intercepting proxy.

1368166999.0,151,self.netsec,1e202m,A few years ago I posted here about a front-end Facebook exploit I found which brought me quite a bit of attention. It's been long fixed so I felt like sharing -- Often it's the simple things we overlook.,duffmanhb,228,77,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1e202m/a_few_years_ago_i_posted_here_about_a_frontend/,"So a while ago, I posted here asking about how I could get FB's attention about a potential vulnerability people could exploit for nefarious uses. I was personally using it just to mess with my friends in college. Basically consisting of me posting on their timeline on their behalf to usually promote something humiliating or funny. 

Soon as I posted it here, I immediately got contacted by Facebook's security team, as well as many tech blogs asking how I was posting on just about anyone's behalf that I chose. Initially I didn't want to say anything to the blogs, because I didn't really care for it. I told Facebook what I did, but didn't go into too much details. They just promised to put me on some sort of white-hat list which I had no care for at the time (However, in retrospect it would have been nice to put on my resume). 

The reason I didn't go into too many details after the first email was because someone contacted me explaining how much more lucrative and interesting having this capability is. Either I could just troll FB and gain some of that precious FB troll fame, or I could spam it and gain some of the precious USD. Either way, both sounded much better than being put on some pointless list. See, I also have a method to get around the spam filters that still works to this day, with most spam filters, so I'm not going to get into that.

**How it was done**  
It was so easy. I don't know how others didn't connect the dots. See, at the time if you went to facebook.com/mobile you'd get a landing page that contained a unique hashed email address for whatever FB account is currently logged in. The email was used for remotely updating your status. At the time, smart phones were just becoming popular, so FB wanted to create a way to update your status via text message. Text/email the hashed email address, and FB will update your status with whatever the body is.

Initially I was just getting this email by sneaking on friends computers and saving it on my thumb drive. Then I'd later update their status with something predictably immature. Then, one day, I realized I was doing it the hard way. It would be much easier to just session hijack someone on my wifi and steal it that way. This way, I didn't have to get sneaky with them. 

Then, it dawned on me. My university has an unsecured ""guest"" wifi that most students chose to use. Mainly because logging in through the student wifi was a pain in the ass to login to (Student ID plus very secured PW -- which the browser couldn't save).

And as we all know, just about every student in every class has FB open in a tab somewhere. So I created a script that would session hijack everyone I could on the wifi and save their name, FB update email, and phone number, if it was available, into an XML document. 

By the end of the week, just about everyone in my classes were vulnerable to me messing with them (My XML totalled about 3500 unique emails). I mean, so were a lot of other people, but I didn't care for them. It was much funner just to update their status about their secret crush on the guy/girl next to them and watch them get awkward -- For instance, ""OMG, yeah I do think jake blake is HOT!"" followed with, ""OMG OMG I meant to send that in a message. How do I delete this? This is so embarrassing!"" So even if they did delete it, or try to cover their tracks they looked guilty. 

**Anyways**  
That's how it was done. When I was contacted, I talked with the guy about running this script through a botnet and seeing how many unique emails we could get to have some fun. I mean, it only takes one hit at a university with a similar wifi setup to get 1000s of emails. 

It was super simple and required no real technical talent. The only thing FB knew about it was that I was exploiting something on the /mobile page. I assume they quickly figured it out because the feature was removed 2 days later. 

In retrospect I realized I really played all my cards terribly wrong. I could have just shut my mouth and had a fun exploit to use on my friends, or use to gain some of that precious USD/FB notoriety. Or I could have fully explained it to FB and get on the white-hat page.

   I am also using NoScript, HTTPSeverywhere, and refcontrol(although i am not entirely sure how to use refcontrol). Do i need to be using Privoxy?

   Is it even possible to access the .onion network if I am not using Tor properly? Also, is TOR still usable in an internet ""killswitch"" situation, or am I misunderstanding how that would work?

   No one is looking for me, so I don't need to be 100% anonymous, but it would be nice to know if what I'm using is worth it.

Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR: public key resolves to IP address, a timestamp is used as a tiebraker so IPs can be updated.",deletecode,183,43,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/oqge0/distributed_dns_idea_based_on_rsa_encryption_does/,"**TL;DR: To own a domain name, you possess a private key.  Instead of giving out a normal domain name for your server, you give out your public key.**

Edit: as pointed out by firepacket, [Namecoin](http://dot-bit.org/Main_Page) (also [/r/namecoin](/r/namecoin)) accomplishes roughly the same thing using a modified Bitcoin algorithm.  Edit2: also, Namecoin addresses a big potential problem with this algorithm: people have to attack the entire block chain instead of targeting a single domain.  Essentially, the more people using Namecoin, the more secure it becomes.

Edit3: Also pointed out by iusz and Krayons, [Tor hidden services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29#Hidden_services) is another approach to this but through a layer of anonymity, since people don't even know your IP when they use your server.

Edit4: [i2p2](http://www.i2p2.de/) and [i2p2 search engine](http://eepsites.com/Content/Search/SearchResults.aspx)

**OP:**  I'm sure this scheme has already be invented.  It seems like the most bare-bones solution you can get with RSA.  I'm wondering if this has a name already.  I'll jump into the technicalities:

In order to point your domain name to an IP address, you encrypt a message and broadcast to the p2p network.  Nodes on the network remember the messages:

owner of domain name does this:

	message=encrypt({ip_address, timestamp++, constant}, private_key)  // encrypt step

	broadcast({public_key, message}) // broadcast step

other p2p nodes do this:

	messages[public_key].add(message) // remember step

When resolving a domain name, you know the public key, and have a list of the messages for that public key.  Each one is decrypted, and the one with the highest timestamp is taken to be the ""winner"", and the domain is resolved to that.  (constant is used to verify the decryption)

	ip_address = nil
	for message in messages[public_key] {
		d=decrypt(message)
		if(d.constant == constant &amp;&amp; d.timestamp &gt; max_timestamp) {
			ip_address = d.ip_address
			max_timestamp = d.timestamp
		}
	}
    return ip_address

Just wondering if this algorithm has a name already, or if it's already running somewhere (like i2p2).",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_oqge0,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/oqge0/distributed_dns_idea_based_on_rsa_encryption_does/,

&gt;We are writing to inform you of a security measure we have taken to protect the integrity of the domain names and information associated with your account.

&gt;Name.com recently discovered a security breach where customer account information including usernames, email addresses, and encrypted passwords and encrypted credit card account information may have been accessed by unauthorized individuals. It appears that the security breach was motivated by an attempt to gain information on a single, large commercial account at Name.com.

&gt;Name.com stores your credit card information using strong encryption and the private keys required to access that information are stored physically in a separate remote location that was not compromised. Therefore, we don't believe that your credit card information was accessed in a usable format. Additionally, your EPP codes (required for domain transfers) were unaffected as they are also stored separately. We have no evidence to suggest that your data has been used for fraudulent activities.

&gt;As a response to these developments, and as a precautionary measure, we are requiring that all customers reset their passwords before logging in. If you use your previous Name.com password in other online systems, we also strongly recommend that you change your password in each of those systems as well.

&gt;Please click the link below to reset your password:
[LINK REMOVED]

&gt;We take this matter very seriously. We've already implemented additional security measures and will continue to work diligently to protect the safety and security of your personal information.

&gt;We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. If you need any additional assistance or have any questions please email customercare@name.com. We'll continue to be as open and honest with you as possible as additional important information becomes available, so keep your eye out for a blog post or additional emails.

&gt;Thanks,

More recently, situation improved, with servers being protected on the network layer with stateful firewalls, ids, ips etc

With public cloud networks like amazon ec2,rackspace etc - it seems like we have gone back to the old and inferior model. Your servers exist on a shared broadcast domain, on a network that anyone can create an account on, and are only protected by host based security measures.

this seems like a huge departure from current security best practices, yet I don't see it discussed often as a significant downside of cloud based implementations. Instead you see blogs describing how to enable nfs on ec2

am I making wrong assumptions about cloud security? If not then it seems like the cloud may be making a lot of companies a lot less secure. cloud is sold as a way to quickly grow your infrastructure with less effort, but it seems to me that implementing a secure cloud design would take a significant effort, I think much higher than most companies would put into it.

Edit: for people complaining about nat. Nat is a security tool. A window workstation behind a linksys router is many times more secure than a windows workstation directly connected to the Internet. There are no absolutes in security, it's all about mitigating risk. Nat is just one of the tools. My point is that by moving your company to a public cloud you are throwing away most benefits provided by network security and restricting yourself to host security. 

Edit #2: removed nat from first sentence. It really is not relevant to the point and it seems lots of people see red hearing nat and security in one sentence. Also sorry for the typos, using a phone.

To explain - I currently have 1 ISP, a few ""vendor"" networks (i.e. semi trusted but still dodgy), a DMZ environment and then my internal networks.

My approach up until now has been to use a Cisco ASA with physically separate interfaces for ""outside"" (internet), ""inside"" (fully trusted), a vlan'ed interface for a mix of semi-trusted DMZ and vendor, and then the last interface for the health/heartbeat interface.  All my external/vendor/dmz traffic is on a pair of ""vendor"" switches, and the trusted traffic is attached to my entirely physically separate internal switch stack.

Someone recently recommended I stop over thinking this and go with a 4 port etherchannel between the ASA and the vendor switches, and then connect the internal trusted vlan to my internal trusted switch stack.  I can then get better port redundancy/resiliency.  Mixing vlans like this on one relatively dumb switch makes me extremely uncomfortable but it could be I am living in the past and that this is considered totally safe these days.

Any thoughts?

**TL;DR:** Thinking of reconfiguring my cisco firewall/router/switch and wondering if it is safe to have untrusted and trusted vlans on the same switch.

**EDIT 1:**  Just wanted to say THANKS for all the great info.  I guess common sense is the majority answer - vlan hopping is *possible* but not the likeliest or easiest of vectors, that said, why risk it if you dont have to.  To answer people's specific questions, the equipment is 2960 series for the internet/vendor switch pair (independent, non stackable, trunked together via cable), a pair of redundant ASA5520s, and then a 3700 series stack for my internal core.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_q7bf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/q7bf2/can_i_rely_on_vlans_to_be_secure_and_separate/,

It took just a couple days to find and report my first XSS hole. I don't consider the hole critical as it didn't affect a core product like email, search etc. but still an exploitable vulnerability none the less.

Here's my self-censored email conversation with the Google security team -

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt;I've recently begun poking at Google properties after the web app sec bounty announcement and I've found an XSS hole in the &lt;redacted&gt; site.

&gt;I'm not sure if this one qualifies for the bounty but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.

&gt;
&gt;Just a heads up.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;redacted&gt;

I immediately received an automated response indicating the bug had been received. This was followed by a template response but I appreciate that they tell you it was sent by a human. -

&gt;Hi Damon,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. Google takes the security of our services very seriously and we are currently investigating your report. As you might expect, we’ve seen increased interest due to our new Vulnerability Rewards Program, so our response may be a little slower than usual. We appreciate your cooperation and discretion on this matter while we are looking into it. We will follow up with you soon.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Daniel, Google Security Team
&gt;
&gt;[NOTE: This message was sent by a human]

Then I got this and the reality set in that I may actually get nothing. That was kind of dissapointing as I was fairly excited but hey, I still got a little thrill knowing I found something others missed (you know what I'm talking about!). -

&gt;Hi Damon,
&gt;
&gt;Just FYI, we reproduced the problem and filed an internal bug.
&gt;
&gt;This is a bit of a tricky case, as &lt;redacted&gt; is a relatively recent acquisition, so the reward panel will have to review it individually, but we will keep you posted!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Michal, Google Security Team

I took a few minutes to research the acquisition only to find it to be almost a year old. I wondered what Google considers to be recent (they have since [clarified this](http://www.google.com/corporate/rewardprogram.html)).

&gt;Hi Damon,
&gt;
&gt;The &lt;redacted&gt; team just got back to me and explicitly told me to thank you for reporting the issue. They have fixed the issue in the repository and will push the patch next week.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again - and good luck for your further vulnerability hunt. :-)
&gt;
&gt;Daniel
&gt;
&gt;PS: We're still waiting for the panel decision whether this qualifies for a reward. We'll let know you as soon as they decide.

Fixed! Glad I could help. :) Four days later I got this -

&gt;Hey Damon,
&gt;
&gt;Congratulations! The panel has determined that this vulnerability is eligible for a reward of $500.
&gt;
&gt;We ask that you not disclose the problem until we’ve got a fix in place. As soon as this is done - hopefully very soon! - we will finalize the payment process; at that point, if you wish to blog, tweet, or buzz about the bug - go for it!
&gt;
&gt;If we end up taking a longer while to deploy fixes (more than two weeks or so), we will proceed with the payment ahead of the time - but we ask you to keep the details private for a while longer.
&gt;
&gt;To get the ball rolling, we need to collect some payment details as soon as possible:
&gt;
&gt;1. In order to get you paid, I need you enrolled as one of our suppliers. Please go and fill in https://services.google.com/inquiry/supplier_enroll. Here is what you need to know:
&gt;
&gt; - Supplier type: Individual/Sole Proprietor
&gt; - Requestor name: &lt;redacted&gt;
&gt; - Requestor phone number: &lt;redacted&gt;
&gt; - Requestor e-mail address: &lt;redacted&gt;
&gt; - Country where goods/services are being delivered to: United States
&gt; - Type of goods/services provided: Services
&gt; - Please include a short description: Vulnerability Rewards Program
&gt; - Currency: USD (please make sure your bank will accept USD payments!)
&gt;
&gt;Please double check that the wire details given are accurate, and that your account will accept USD payments. It is very time-consuming to fix any errors with the wire information!
&gt;
&gt;2. If you are outside the US, we will need a W8-BEN form on file in order to process your payment: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf
&gt;
&gt;Once you’re enrolled as a supplier, you’ll receive an email requesting a copy of the above form. You can respond with a scanned image of the completed and signed form by e-mail.
&gt;
&gt;3. Lastly, please let me know if you’d like your name on a page that credits you for your contribution.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam, Google Security Team

I wasn't expecting to be paid like this. Honestly I was hoping for a check so I could copy it and keep a little souvenir. I asked my contact about it -

&gt;Hey Damon
&gt;
&gt;No probs about emailing me directly.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, the process we've outlined is the only way we can pay you. It's one of the downsides of working for a large company - doing seemingly simple things like paying someone cash is a little complex.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam

Bah. Oh well. I filled out the form and waited for the wire. A few days later I got this -

&gt;Hey Damon
&gt;
&gt;This issue is now fixed; feel free to have a poke and see if we've missed something. I'm not 100% sure how long payment will take, but I'm hopeful you'll receive it next week.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam, Google Security Team

Sweet! Now let me just...

&gt;Hey Adam,
&gt;
&gt;The issue is definitely not fixed. Example -

1313876594.0,125,self.netsec,jp541,My private website has been the victim of a DoS attack for the past 36 hours. What can I do? Who would do that?,hootenanny1,158,33,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/jp541/my_private_website_has_been_the_victim_of_a_dos/,"Hope this is the right subreddit, first posted in web_design, was referred to here. Don't know if this would rather qualify for techsupport?:

Hey Reddit,

I'm running a small German-language (100 visitors per day) website about pizza and pizza making. Mostly pics, recipes, pizza related blog posts. Nothing special, not monetized at all sofar. In fact I recently started introducing adsense on some pages, but no clicks yet.

So, yesterday I got an email from my hosting company that my domain was currently being hit by a DoS attack and that they're doing everything they can to stop the attack and protect my domain from future attacks.

Roughly 24 hours later they emailed me saying that unfortunately the attack is still going on, but that they moved the domain over to a seperate server for now in order to protect other domains and accounts (shared hosting).

Now, my questions are:

* When the fuck will this stop? The site recently started to rank well for pizza-related terms and I'm afraid being unavailable for such a long time might severly hurt my rankings

* What in the world would anyone gain from attacking this page? It doesn't carry any political messages, nor is it trying to sell you anything. And as stated before I haven't made any money (yet) from this page whatsoever.

* I'm a bit worried about my adsense account. I hope it won't get banned for ""invalid activity"". But I think I might be safe because there are no ads on the frontpage and when Google Analytics still worked (haven't had the chance to check server logs yet) I only saw hits going to the front page, no other pages. So, do I have to worry?

* To me it seems the hosting company is handling the whole thing rather well. But what can they possibly do? In their first email they stated that they won't reveal any information about the attackers or their counter meassures.

Thanks for your help!

**UPDATE**: Anotherwebguy helped me out quite a lot. We banned all non-German traffic via .htaccess with quite some success. However I notice the hosting company is also doing something and I even lost ftp access for a while. So right now, the page is available, but slow. I can't seem to contact the host which is not too unsual considering it's 3:30am here. Which is also the reason why I really need to get some sleep now. However thanks to all of reddit for all your help, I'll keep you updated.

**UPDATE 2011-08-22**:

We've recognized some patterns now in the attacker's visits. I'd rather not say, what it is, since I still don't know who the attacker is, and if it's against me personally, then it's probably not to difficult to find my reddit account, either.

Anyway this morning I was slightly shocked when I realized yesterday's server log file is 4GB in size. Does anyone know of any software that can even process log files that big or do I have to split them up manually? All the prgorams I've tried crash after around 10% of the file. Those 10% seem to be roughly 4 million hits, so I assume 40 million hits per day - not bad for a shared hosting service ;)

All of them received 403s of course, but still that is quite some traffic there...",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_jp541,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/jp541/my_private_website_has_been_the_victim_of_a_dos/,

In the comments [mricon](http://www.reddit.com/user/mricon) [explain](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1720c2/how_to_secure_ssh_with_google_authenticators/c81wjq7) some of the downfalls of the normal Google Authenticator PAM module for larger installations.

This interested me greatly but as I investigated and tested the solution I found some issues:
* The script is cgi only so it's a pain to run under anything other then Apache
* The backend is Postgres only
* There's  no ORM so lots of hand coded SQL
* The [pam_url](https://fedorahosted.org/pam_url/) module that it relies upon does not provide two-factor authentication. It's designed as a complete replacement for the normal pam_unix auth system.

Because of these issues I've spent the last week or so create a new [pam_totp](https://github.com/nevins-b/pam_totp) module and a complimentary [totp-django](https://github.com/nevins-b/totp-django) server.

Some things to note:
* I'm not a professional developer so the code bases need to be audited before you throw them into use in production
* Because the server is in Django and backend supported in Django is usable
* I've only tested the pam module on Ubuntu 10.04LTS currently. I'm planning additional testing soon.

If you have any time or interest, please look at these codes bases, run some tests and submit issues or pull requests to the projects. I'd love to make these better and production ready.

I work in a physicians office and am trying to set up a secure way for the doctor to send patient files between his home computer, tablet pc, and office computer. The problem is that HIPAA has strict regulations on what programs can and can not be used; all EMR programs have contracts with the gov. I want to use truecrypt and dropbox as they seem to be the easiest for the doctor to use, and truecrypts encryption will comply with HIPAA, but as far as I know there's no way to decrypt the files in dropbox from a tablet.
I was also thinking of establishing an SSH tunnel between computers but that would exclude the tablet, which is important to him for on the go work.
Does anyone have any solutions/better set ups to securely transfer medical data within a private organization?

Thanks in advance for your time, I'm new to network security and any help would be appreciated.

**EDIT: First, thank you everyone who replied! Tons of very helpful information and advice. The company we use for patient management is still in the process of developing their full EHR software and do not currently offer a tablet application (which is why I was looking to use cloud storage or remote access for the mobile patient files). However, you all very clearly showed me why any external network would be irresponsible and impractical for my purposes and convinced me to go with the HIPAA compliant professional EMR program (even though it costs thousands).

A friend and I were discussing reCAPTCHA and what its expected lifetime is. On one hand, there seems to be many [successful attempts at writing automated tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA#Security) that can beat reCAPTCHA. On the other hand, reCAPTCHA seems to be the only mainstream CAPTCHA system that wasn't beat by the [Stanford research team's automated CAPTCHA solver](http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-stanford-outsmart-captcha-codes.html). Furthermore, many of the big sites use reCAPTCHA which means a lot of people are putting a lot of faith behind it. What I am wondering is how much longer can distorted pictures of text be used to stump computers? My bank can process checks that look like they were written by Michael J. Fox so I have a hard time believing that the same OCR technology being used by my bank is that far away from being able to solve reCAPTCHA puzzles. If spam is as economical as recent research shows (I swear there was a paper that UCSD recently published on this but I can't find it right now) it shouldn't be that difficult for big time spammers to buy the appropriate OCR technology to defeat reCAPTCHA. Oh, and Human CAPTCHA Solvers should sorta throw a curve ball into things for all CAPTCHA providers.

I don't work in security but I understand the importance so here's a quick run through of the steps I took:

* Started taking time-stamped notes.
* Analyzed the situation. Confirmed the leak. Secured and backed up log files.
* Informed my team lead and project manager. 
* Informed service management and took down the service.
* Revoked the affected user IDs and prepared new account details, so when the application is fixed we can go live immediately.
* Contacted the application team for a fix.
* Tested the fix was implemented properly.
* Re-activated the service and allowed users access.

The thing is that our team do not have a defined process on what to do when we think there has been a security breach.

I've seen it advertised on here twice, and although it says ""We do not see nor do we store your password or unencrypted plain text on our servers,"" on http://cryptobin.org/faq, if you look in the source, it actually copies the plaintext to a hidden form element called ""dummy"", encrypts the plaintext and puts it into the ""cipher"" textarea, then sends BOTH to the server.

Lines 67-72 from http://cryptobin.org/ [new paste page]

    f.dummy.value = f.cipher.value;
    f.cipher.value = Aes.Ctr.encrypt(f.cipher.value, f.password.value, 256);
    if (f.cipher.value.length &lt; 16777215) {
        document.getElementById('error').innerHTML = '';
        f.password.value = '';
        submit();

As you can see since the ""dummy"" element is within the same form as the ""cipher"" it gets submitted (you can verify with wireshark), and it never gets nulled out, on line 67 the plaintext is copied to it (the hidden dummy element), the cipher text is encrypted [line 68], the encrypted text length is checked, then both are sent. The password is nulled but that doesn't really matter if the plaintext is sent. A simple remedy is to add ``f.dummy.value = '';'' after the password null so it is suspicious as to why that is not there. It seems it's done on purpose to collect the data.",,False,,t5_1rqwi,True,,,True,t3_is8uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/is8uq/stay_away_from_cryptobin/,
