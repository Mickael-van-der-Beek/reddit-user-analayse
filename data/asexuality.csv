1337577153.0,60,self.asexuality,tx3g0,Today was a pretty good day for me.,piggy_teapot,64,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/tx3g0/today_was_a_pretty_good_day_for_me/,"I would like to tell you all my story.  It's a long, rambling story, so beware the imminent wall of text.  It's just something that I need to say.

As a teenager, I was curious about sex.  It seemed to be kind of a big deal.  Mostly, I learned about sex from online fan fiction and Cosmo articles.  It was fascinating to me, but somehow I couldn't imagine myself doing it or enjoying it.  I never watched porn.  I started masturbating at a fairly young age, but I didn't think about sexual acts while I was doing it – I just liked the feeling.  I wasn't sexually attracted to anyone I met.  Sometimes I had crushes on boys, really big crushes even, but while I imagined them hugging me, kissing me, telling me I was beautiful, I never wanted to have sex with them.  As I got older, I begin to feel occasional instances of hypothetical sexual attraction – I could imagine myself being sexually attracted to a person, and I fantasized about some imaginary man who would make me feel that way, but I hadn't met that person yet.

When I was seventeen, I had my first boyfriend and my first, extremely traumatic sexual experience.  Then we broke up.  My biggest support during my break-up was my male best friend.  He was my rock.  I loved him more than I could express.  As the months went on, I begin to feel romantically attracted to him.  He was aesthetically attractive to me and I felt very emotionally close to him.  Eventually, we started dating.  Our sexual relationship progressed much more slowly than it did with my first boyfriend, but when we had sex, I felt like I wanted it.  For the first time ever, I felt real sexual desire for somebody.  It was elating.  However, on the whole, I could not feel sexual attraction to any person of any gender, other than my boyfriend.

I began to feel like a freak.  Other men and women around me were talking about sex, constantly.  My sisters and female friends would prattle and rave about “hot guys.”  My male friends would drool over scantily clad women.  It was the biggest deal in the world to everyone but me.  I started to resent them.  I even felt angry towards my boyfriend for watching porn and being attracted to other women.  I couldn't understand how he could be sexually aroused by someone he wasn't in love with.  I thought it meant he loved me less.

When I was nineteen, I started restricting my diet severely, then escalated to binging and purging.  I hated my body so much.  I wanted to punish it and control it, I wanted to own it in a way no one else ever could.  I hated my body for when it aroused others and for when it didn't arouse others.  I hated it for not desiring sex the way “normal” people did.  I wanted to be separated from this horrible body that wasn't me.  I wanted to make it disappear.

I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and started to see a therapist.  With time, my body image improved, I started to hate my body less for the effect it had (or didn't have) on others, and my eating disorder faded.  My boyfriend was supportive through the whole thing.  I felt better, but I didn't feel cured.  I still had very negative feelings towards sex.  The concept of sex made me feel awful.  Other people's sexual desires made me feel so...alone.  Left out.  I really hated other people for this.  I hated them for being normal, while there was still something very wrong with me.

My boyfriend and I got married when we were twenty-two.  He is my best friend in the world.  Our relationship is the stuff of fairy tales.  In our year of marriage, we have had no major problems and few fights.  In the past few months, however, I started to feel angrier and angrier about sex.  I loved having sex with him, but it made me so mad that he was sexually aroused by other women.  Not jealous...just mad.  I also hated the thought that other men might be attracted to me.  It seemed they had no right to feel that way about me when I could never feel that way about anyone else.  I told my husband these thoughts one night in between a fit of sobs.  I said I just wanted to be normal, to be fixed.  We talked about the possibility of going back to therapy.

Then, today, while browsing reddit, I saw a post that linked to comments in /r/asexuality.  I had heard of asexuality before, but I was very misinformed about it.  I assumed that couldn't be me, since I had been in love and had crushes, masturbated often, and was sexually attracted to my husband.  Out of curiosity, I clicked the link.  I perused the comments thoroughly.  I saw someone mention the term “heteroromantic demisexual.”  I googled it and found an entry on demisexuality in the AVENwiki.

It was like my mind exploded in sudden simultaneous surprise and understanding.  Reading through the entry, I started to cry and shake.  Tearfully, I called my husband over to the computer and had him read it.  “This,” I sobbed happily, “this is me.  I don't need to be fixed.  There's nothing wrong with me.  I'm just this.”

Finally, after so many years of feeling like a freak, I know what I am.  I am a heteroromantic demisexual.  Obviously, labels are rarely 100% accurate, but this is the closest I have ever been to feeling like there are other people like me, like there is nothing wrong with me.  My anger has vanished almost instantly.  I don't feel afraid any more.  I don't feel ashamed.

Edit:  This subreddit is fantastic and you have a great community here.  Thank you for all of your support!

This hit the nail on the head for me. 

Whether you're an ace, unready, or unsure, it is **not okay** that our society expects that you owe sex to someone, simply because you've been on a couple dates. It is patently unfair. You do not ""owe"" anyone your body, or your discomfort.

This truly is rape culture, and I'm glad someone put a name to it. By all means, if you plan on staying with someone long-term, inform them if you're not interested in sex. But you shouldn't feel *guilty* for not wanting sex. It its neither bad, nor wrong, nor abusive. It is your own personal comfort level, and not something you should have to apologize for.

1365447498.0,45,self.asexuality,1bxno9,"Guys, what does Asexual Pride mean?",jahago,46,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1bxno9/guys_what_does_asexual_pride_mean/,"I've been thinking about it quite a bit lately. It started about a week ago when I saw a girl walking down the road with gay pride everything everywhere. A pin on her bag with two girls holding hands against a rainbow background, rainbow bracelets, rainbow knee highs. This girl was proud. In a town where I was given confused looks for not being registered republican, this girl was unashamedly displaying who she was. During a time where so much is happening for homosexual/homoromantic rights I can understand wanting to openly show your support in face of adversity.

But what about us? What about asexuals?

While playing a drinking game of Never Have I Ever with friends the other night, I obviously stated ""Never have I ever had sex."" Now, when people respond with 'Seriously?!' or 'For real?! Like, not at all?!' I find it kind of amusing. But this time...this time the response was a lot of pity. Everyone kind of looked at me with a sad smile and reassured me. 'It's ok, jahago, there is nothing wrong with being a virgin.' or 'Yeah, it's ok to wait, don't worry about it.' I never worry about it, but their genuine concern threw me off. It got me thinking: **Is there anything for me to be proud of as an asexual?**

I find my dealings with being asexual have mostly been understanding, acceptance, and helping other 'new' asexuals understand themselves. Personally, I have never actually felt *proud* of my asexuality. I've felt relieved. I've felt happy to connect with other aces. But never proud.

Is not having sexual attraction even something to be proud of? As an aromantic, wouldn't flaunting the fact that I don't want or need sex or a romantic relationship make me seem like an asexual elitist? Is it the fact that, in a world where sex rules, being asexual is like breaking the mold? Is that even something to be proud of?



Really, I don't know what to be proud of and that makes me a bit sad.



I think back to the rainbow girl I saw. Is asexual pride just buying an ace button for my bag? Is it changing my fb picture to an image of the flag?  Maybe tweeting a link to AVEN? Is it just making people aware that we exist?

I want to feel proud of being asexual instead of just blandly accepting who I am. I just don't know where to start.

**TL;DR**: What is Asexual Pride? Is it simply visibility? I don't know. What are your thoughts?

**Update**: If anything, this thread has made me feel pride in this subreddit, AVEN, and the community at large. Just the sheer effort people put into visibility, how accepting and all encompassing our community is, and how we haven't kept quiet and are gaining some momentum.  This is great. You guys are great.

He was a funny, kind, adorable guy and she liked him a lot.  In the first week of the relationship he would kiss her goodnight on the forehead and it was sweet.  In the second week she received her first kiss, and it was wonderful.  In the third week she french kissed for the first time and it was absolutely lovely.

In the fourth week he felt her up, and something felt weird.

By the fifth week they had to have a talk.  He wanted to start having sex.  She wasn't ready.  She wanted to wait.

""I guess that's fair,"" he said.  ""How long do you want to wait?""

She thought about it.  What felt right?  About how long was enough to feel truly connected enough to be that intimate, but still be a reasonable time span.  Her mother would of course tell her to wait for marriage, but that was silly.  This was a natural part of the human experience.  But how long until the time was right to engage?

""A year,"" she finally said.  Long enough to get to know each other, but still reasonable.

""A *YEAR!?*""

She would never forget the tone of his voice or the look on his face when he said those words.  What had she said wrong?  Why was he so shocked?  Was waiting a year really that big of a deal?  Was it that unreasonable?

""Well... yeah.""

""A *year,*"" he said again.  ""Why would you want to wait that long?""

""I, um, I don't know.""  She wasn't very sure of herself.  ""I'm just not ready.""

""No seriously, why though?  We're not in high school, we're adults.  I thought that by now we'd...""  He trailed off.  He was trying really had not to be the jerk, but he was as confused as she was.  

""I'm sorry?""

""I don't get it.  I mean unless you want to be celibate, it doesn't make sense-""

""It's not that! It's...""

Something of a realization popped into her head in that moment.  It felt the same as when you figure out an answer to a riddle or remember the name of that song stuck in your head.  But she didn't say it out loud.  It just sounded so silly, and she wouldn't know where to begin trying to explain herself.  He would think she was making up excuses.

----

*The reason I want to bring awareness to asexuality is so that the girl in that story might have heard about and known what was going on inside of her.  She might not have thought there was something wrong with her.  She might not have let her boyfriend pressure her into doing small sexual acts that she took no pleasure in.  She might have been able to explain things to her boyfriend so he wouldn't feel as though she was trying to maintain control over the relationship by withholding sex.*

*She might have been able to say the words that popped into her head that night, completely on their own, before she'd known anything about asexuality:*

1374601939.0,38,self.asexuality,1iwbkc,My thoughts on my asexuality.,YearWithTheYeti,44,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1iwbkc/my_thoughts_on_my_asexuality/,"When I first heard about asexuality, I didn't really understand it. My mom and I listen to the NPR weekend game show, ""Wait Wait Don't Tell Me"", and one of the comedians, Paula Poundstone, is asexual. So I knew it was a thing. I knew it was one of the possible sexualities, but I didn't think it applied to me. 

I read a lot of Harry Potter fan fiction. And a lot of that fan fiction has smut. I would read these romantic works and think of how wonderful it was going to be when one day, I was going to feel these feelings for another person. I was going to lose myself in hot, fiery passion and have sex. 

Well, as I grew up, I was reading more and more and watching television and movies where everyone was experiencing these fantastic things and I started to get disillusioned. This feeling isn't real, I thought. This fantastic feeling is a fairy tale. It doesn't exist and everyone just accepts that. 

In high school and college, I thought that I had super human self-control because not only could I abstain, I could keep myself from these feelings all together. I was proud that I never was tempted to make bad decisions like unprotected and pre-marital sex. Why was it so hard for everyone? Why were people getting pregnant? It's not hard to say no. Or so I thought. 

I began my first relationship when I was 21 years old. I loved my boyfriend. I loved his smile, his blue eyes, going to movies and laughing too loud in the theatre, and even snuggling against him and drifting off to sleep. This was it, I thought. Soon, I was going to start to want to have sex with him. A year and a half later, the relationship ended (for many reasons and on good terms) and I was still a virgin. 

It was at this point, and with the help from a professional, that I remembered asexuality. I spent two days reading, watching videos, and looking into myself before I realized that I am asexual. And that's okay. 

I still want a husband and children. I wanted them before I knew I was asexual and I want them now. It is no harder now that I've labeled it because whether there is a label or not, I've never have any interest in sex. None. Zip. Nada. It simply isn't on my radar. 

The one important thing that has changed is my view of other people, especially sexuals. I understand now that it wasn't super human will power or intelligence that kept me from temptation. I never had any temptation in the first place. I understand now that it is difficult for people to control their passion like in my fan fics or in the movies. 

I accept others. And now it's time for them to accept me. Telling me that I have a sex ""phobia"" or that the right person is out there isn't helpful. I'll meet the right person. And we may or may not have sex. I may even develop a sexual desire, who knows. Sexuality is fluid and personalized. And my sexuality is ""a"".

However, what does entirely piss me off is when someone that I had just met a few hours before found out that I was asexual and, after asking what asexuality was, his next question was, ""so do you masturbate?"" Not even one of my closest friends, who was among the first to find out that I'm ace, has asked me that question, and I would be honestly shocked if he did, since there are just certain things that you don't really blatantly ask someone. Apparently that general courtesy was ignored by a guy I barely knew, who then also wanted to know if I had been to a doctor, if I was abused as a kid, or if I was just upset that I don't date that much. Seriously, what the fuck.

I guess all boundaries and general social rules go out the window when you come out as asexual because obviously there's something wrong with you and every single person is a qualified expert to subject you to questioning and suggest ""scientific experimentation"" (yes someone did bring that up to me once) to find out if it was just because I had never tried it. /sarcasm

""Were you abused as a child?""  
""What the fuck is wrong with you?""  
""You realize that calling yourself asexual is a cop-out and/or a cry for attention, right?""  
""Have fun being alone for the rest of your life.""  
""Have you even had sex?""

""Why do people feel the need to make up new labels for themselves?""  
""Obviously there's something wrong with your hormones; you should see a doctor/psychiatrist.""  
""What's the point of dating if you don't even have sex?""

People don't realize that we live in a society where everything is sexualized, and if you don't want to fuck everything that moves, you're obviously a mentally deranged freak. Most people are accepting of gay/transgender/what-have-you people, but *not* wanting sex is just inconceivable.

I have tried so many times to explain what asexuality is and how I know I'm asexual, and I've been bullied, insulted, and shamed over and over because of it. It's absolutely ridiculous.

I don't need other people to validate me, but being told that I'm a lesser human being who is unworthy of being loved is just fucking horrible.

How do you deal with it, fellow aces? It's really getting me down.

**Edit:** Thanks for the support, guys. This happens mostly when I bring it up with acquaintances, but it's happened with (people whom I've thought were) close friends as well. I'll try to educate people about asexuality and cut the people who aren't okay with it out of my life - I don't want to be friends with assholes who don't accept me for who I am, anyway.

1373725540.0,36,self.asexuality,1i7vb4,Reflections on a year of being in a relationship with an asexual,hagulden,41,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1i7vb4/reflections_on_a_year_of_being_in_a_relationship/,"I am a 20 year old man, and I have been in a romantic relationship with an 18 year old asexual woman for a bit over a year now. A bit of context and backstory:

Neither of us has been in a relationship before this one. We were friends for about a year before we realised we each had a crush on the other and became more than friends. I am bisexual and have identified as such for a long time (I had my first crush on a girl when I was about 9, and my first on a boy when I was about 10, and have been attracted to people from all genders ever since). I have always had unusual (for a sexual person) feelings towards sex, though. I remember feeling and saying that if I really loved someone, having sex with them is the last thing I would want to do with them. I was also very anxious about the idea of having sex or kissing someone (although I had no problem with the idea of hugs). My girlfriend is heteroromantic and is attracted to men in a non-sexual way. I don't know when she started thinking of herself as asexual, but I think it was some time between when I met her and when I asked her out. She has never been sexually attracted to anyone (she says she thinks she has experienced sexual feelings before, but never for a person, and never an actual desire to have sex).

Before I asked her out, we talked about sexuality a bit. At this point I think we knew that we were 'interested' in each other. She told me she was asexual, and I was actually *really* happy to hear it. I told her about my 'weirdness' regarding sex. We already felt like we were a perfect match in so many other ways - and we were really happy to discover that we were better matched sexually than we expected.

Since then, we have developed a very strong and enjoyable relationship. Someone once asked me - if we don't have sex, what makes us 'in a relationship', rather than just really good friends? Well, we do kiss (we usually have very innocent 'peck'-like kisses; we have kissed 'with tongue' a few times, but I can't even remember the last time that happened... it was several months ago. I don't think either of us are fussed about that) and cuddle and sleep in the same bed. But that isn't the answer - we have a very strong emotional connection. I trust her more than anybody else. I enjoy her company more than anybody else's. I see her after not seeing her for a while and my heart explodes with joy. Then she goes away for a few weeks and I cry at the airport. None of that applies to anybody else.

The physical situation: we have never had sex (not 'regular' nor oral nor... hand-based... etc.). (Just to note - I know that it works for some people, but I have no desire for an 'open relationship' or to be sleeping with anyone else whilst still attached to my girlfriend). In fact, we have never even seen each other naked (we sleep in pyjamas and look away when the other is changing - I think we've both accidentally seen bits of each other and that's not a big deal, but there are also bits of each other that we haven't seen and that isn't really a big deal either). As I said before - we do hug sometimes. The hugs are very nice, but usually not very long, and I always get the impression that they make her uncomfortable (although I have asked several times and she says they don't). We kiss a bit, as I said, but we almost never kiss on the mouth except as a 'kiss good bye' (and then it's still a peck as I described above).

In terms of 'my needs': Most of the time, I am absolutely fine with the lack of sexual contact. My girlfriend is very attractive and (in my opinion) very sexy - I am certainly attracted to her sexually. But that has nothing to do with why I asked her out, and I am very happy with our relationship.  I have asked her, and she says she has never masturbated (and I'm sure this is true). I do masturbate regularly (sometimes I go a couple of months without masturbating - not intentionally, I just don't feel like it - but usually I do it a few times per week). Sometimes when I'm around her I can get very aroused, but I try not to let this interfere with our interactions. Sometimes I will just disappear to the bathroom for a few minutes to 'relieve the tension'. Occasionally I will find it hard to sleep because of this arousal - and I have at times masturbated next to her in bed, but she is never involved with this and I try to be discreet and not disturb or bother her with it. I think that she is fine with this and it doesn't usually have an impact on anything between us.

We talked about sex and sexuality a lot in the beginning. I made it clear that she should never feel like she has to do anything sexual with me, and she made it clear that while this is the current situation, I should be aware that she might feel differently in the future (i.e. she may be more interested in sexual things at some point). We have both read a lot about asexuality and we are aware that in many sexual-asexual relationships, sex happens as a compromise to satisfy the sexual partner's needs. However, I don't feel like my 'needs' are that strong (I wouldn't say I have a *need* to have sex at all - definitely a desire at times, but never a need). I think that if we started doing sexual things, 'regular' sex would still be a long way off - she is asexual, and I am still not very comfortable with the idea of it (although I would be comfortable with the idea of building up to it, probably). That might happen eventually - but as a natural course of development, not because either of us is unsatisfied with the way things are and in need of a compromise.

One issue I have struggled with a bit is self-esteem. The one person in the whole world whom I would most want to be sexually attracted to me... isn't. Some people probably are, but the *one* who counts (in my eyes) isn't. I know she loves me (and I hope she knows that I love her!)... but I think that the lack of physicality does make that harder to get into my subconscious, if you know what I mean. I love romantic comedies and stuff - I have spent my whole life being shown by TV and films that when people love each other, they kiss passionately and the camera pans away as they get into bed. Of course, I don't really think that that implies love, or that love requires that stuff. But something somewhere in my brain sees it missing and says ""hey, what's the deal?"". My girlfriend is not a very outwardly affectionate person anyway which can make these insecurities worse. But I have learned to understand that when she *is* outwardly affectionate to me, it really does mean a lot. I hold on to those things, and I know that she loves me a lot, and that (in *this* relationship, at least) has nothing to do with occurrences of physical intimacy.

There was a time in my mid-teens when I thought I might be asexual. I don't think any more that I am - but I think that my sex drive must be lower than a lot of people's. Maybe this helps the success of our sex-free relationship. People have said that they couldn't be in a relationship like this, they don't understand how I do it, things like that. They obviously don't have a clue how *amazing* it is to be in a relationship with someone as wonderful as my S.O., physicality be damned! And as I told someone who asked me about it once - it frees up a lot of time for more interesting things! We hardly waste a second of waking time together - we are both very busy students who also have other jobs and responsibilities, but we share a lot of fun hobbies and interests, and we spend as much of our free time as possible doing really fun and exciting things together - I may be a sexual guy, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't trade the evenings and nights we've spent doing those things for sex!

I don't have a conclusion. I don't have a point. I don't have any questions, and I'm not asking for advice. But when I began my relationship with an asexual, I spent a lot of time reading people's stories on this subreddit and elsewhere. I just wanted to put our story up somewhere so that people of the future looking for an idea of what kind of relationships sexual and asexual people can have together, they'll be aware that this is one of them. (That said, if anyone does want to talk about anything I mentioned above, do let me know).",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,False,,,True,t3_1i7vb4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1i7vb4/reflections_on_a_year_of_being_in_a_relationship/,

This is probably down to films/TV portrayal of it, as most people when they are honest say that it was clumsy, and probably painful. Not this great myth that has been spread.

So I wasn't suprised when having sex for the first time wasn't mind blowing. Clumsy, awkward, a little painful, and could be described as a failure. I assumed it would just get better. While it certainly got less clumsy, and painful, it never felt good, let alone the best experience someone can have. My first thought was that not only ""the first time"", but all sex is overhyped. An emporers new clothes effect if you will. No-one wants to be considered broken, so everyone lies to themselves and each other, saying it's the best thing ever.

So my first thought, upon discovering that sex lacked that ""amazing"" factor, was that. ""I'm sure it's like that for everyone!"", I thought.

But I've spoken to my girlfriend, and to other people, and it doesn't seem to be the case. Other people genuinely enjoy it, and it's not all just this illusion created by people all lying to each other. Perhaps sex is a bit overhyped, but to say it's all because of the hype is just wrong. Apparently there's something that's enjoyable about sex.

I'm 29, female, asexual, homoromantic, and I've never been in a relationship. The older I get, the more I fear spending the rest of my life alone.

I know I shouldn't put so much emphasis on pairing with another person, but it's hard when you log onto Facebook and see nothing but wedding and babies and couples going off and doing all sorts of stuff together. It used to be I would go off with friends, but now those friends are married and most have children. They don't have time for excursions, and if they did they would be going with their families.

It frustrates me that I'm not sexually attracted to anyone, that the most I can offer someone is friendship. I guess I would just like to be someone's best friend. I would like to be the special person in their life who does nice things for them and goes places with them. But I'm so shy. It's hard enough just making friends in the first place. 

The older I get, the harder it is to deal with all of this. I try to find happiness in another areas of my life but the loneliness never goes away. I go out a lot and every time I do I can't help but think of how nice it would be to go out with another person.

* The Queer society - well, firstly we're not a society, we're supposed to be a support group.  Secondly, while I'm happy to reclaim ""queer"", not everyone is.  Thirdly some asexuals/intersex/demisexuals/other may not consider themselves under the branch of ""queer"", thus would feel excluded.

* The rainbow society - I don't know how clear it is to international students that rainbow = queer etc, and as a untraditional name it has the same problems as GSRM.

If you weren't one of those 40, that's fine, you're more than welcome to join, just start posting in here.

The first thing I'd like to say is that if a mod wants to take the reins on this one, I'll be happy to hand them over. Now down to business.

First thing's first, we need to pick a time and date. I don't know when to start it to have the highest impact, so let's discuss it. We should also take into account how many people will be available to answer questions at any given time.

Other than that, the body of the post should be determined by this community. I suggest we have different blurbs from different groups, just to get the ""what is demisexuality"", ""Are you like amoebas or something?"" and the like out of the way. Different groups that I thought of include:

Aromantics

Demisexuals

Grey-Asexuals

[X]romantics (should these all be merged?)

Partners of asexuals (invite 'em!)

So if you belong to one of these groups, get cracking! Post any input in this thread, we'll probably use the most upvoted or combine them or something.

Finally, I think we should have a bit at the end about why we're doing an AMA, why it's important to raise awareness, etc. 

If you have a better idea for a format, post it.

I'm going to be staying out of this discussion for a while, because I don't want to dominate it; this is our AMA, not mine. So go on ahead without me, first post wins some cake!

**EDIT 1:**
Alright, jumping back in.

I'll be posting a top level comment below with all the people
 and orientations that I've seen sign up. If you haven't 
signed up in this thread, or I missed you, respond to that comment
and I'll edit you in. Same if I misspelled your name or anything.
I haven't talked to the AMA mods yet re: whether this is an appropriate
AMA (they have a rule against AMAs about sexual behaviours, but orientations
may be okay). I also intend to talk to them about flair, which is why it's 
very important that you sign up. If flair doesn't happen, I'll put the list
in the body of the post.

I still haven't seen any submissions for the body of the post, so maybe
I was unclear: I think we should have a description or writeup about
aromanticism written by aromantics, a demisexuality writeup written by
demisexuals, etc. If you don't think this is a good idea, that's
fine, I just wanted to make sure I was being clear.

Choosing a time for the AMA seems to be moving slowly right now, so let's
split it up into steps: Weekday evening or weekend afternoon?

Finally, I'm working on some text for the body of the post, just copypasted from aven and other sources.

My friends are accepting of my sexuality but a lot of them just don't get it or pass it off as a temporary thing, but it's really not the case. I'm 15 years old and I've never been aroused or sexually attracted to anybody, there's just nothing there. But nobody seems to understand that. I think the only person who's actually understanding and well aware of the fact that asexuality is the real deal is a very close friend of mine (who was actually the one who showed me this subreddit), and hes having some troubles with his identity/sexuality himself.

It's just very frustrating to be shot down all the time. I've been asexual for as long as I can remember, I just didn't know there was a name for it until about a year ago.

&gt;Hi all,

&gt;This post is me ""coming out"" about my sexual orientation. 

&gt;I'm not heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. I'm on the asexual to demi-sexual spectrum, closer to the asexual end. Which means I don't experience any sexual attraction to anyone, except in very rare cases when I am already very emotionally connected to someone. I have always been this way. I am often attracted to people as relationship partners in a non-sexual way and enjoy non-sexual touch. 

&gt;Over the years, I have come out to a number of people, and there have been two common reactions: If I came out to a man who is attracted to me/I have been (non-sexually) attracted to, he will often been angry and/or violent. (This is why I no longer date without making it very clear up-front that I am asexual.) When I come out to someone who cares about me, they often feel and express concern or worry for me. This is due to confusion about what asexuality is. If you've read this far, I'd like to encourage you to watch the following video that does a great job of explaining this orientation. I would love more people to be aware of asexuality, and understanding asexuality is a wonderful way to be supportive and respectful of my orientation and the orientation of others you may know.

I'm sharing it because I'm curious to see if it strikes a chord with anyone else.]

_____________________

Think of it this way.

Everyone in the world carries around a travel mug of tea. Tea-drinking and especially tea-sharing are central parts of the culture. Everyone is very concerned with tea.

Some people have black tea, some have green tea, some have some exotic kind, like white tea, or a blend. Some people only want to drink others' black tea, some are only interested in people with green tea, some don't care and find all tea tasty. Some people just don't like any kind of tea.

Some people will share their tea with anyone; some people will only share theirs with that special someone; some people spend all their time and energy trying to get to taste other people's tea. Some people's cups are empty, and some are full to overflowing, and every level in between. Some people are always thirsty, some never are. And some people are quite happy with their own tea, thank you, and how much they have or how often they drink is nobody's business but their own. 

Me, my cup has a little bit of green tea in it, and I like my blend. In fact, I prefer it to all the others. I don't mind trying some black tea every now and again, for variety, but I'll always want to go back to my own. I don't much need any other kind.

For me, the world's tea cups all have lids. Your tea might smell great; I might like your cup a lot, and I might really enjoy watching you drink your tea, but sharing that tea isn't something I think about. That is, not until I know you, and like and respect you, well enough for the lid to come off. I really only want to drink tea with people I already know and trust.

Here's the thing: variety is great. It's always exciting discovering a new thing, be it tea or anything else. But when it comes to tea, I like mine best, and I prefer to drink it alone. I'll share tea with you, if I like you enough, and I think it's important to keep our relationship strong, but it's not what I prefer. I don't get thirsty all that often, and when I do, my blend of tea tastes best. I'd be quite happy just to sit companionably beside you, without drinking any tea at all.

This isn't wrong. It's not any more wrong than someone with black tea only wanting to drink other black tea, or someone being born with a strange mix of black and green they don't quite understand. It's a little unusual, because in this culture so much centers around tea-sharing and its attendant rituals, but people who don't share their tea — or who don't drink tea at all, and don't want to — are just fine. 

What's important is to figure out what you like — what flavors or blends appeal to you, if any, and under what circumstances. It's important to explore if and when and how and what kind of tea-sharing ceremony would suit you best. And it's so, *so* important to figure out how to tell other people, who may find your blend intoxicating and who might really want to share it with you, what you've learned. Hence this essay, which isn't really about tea.

I thought it was very well done and wanted to post it on reddit for questions and comments. 

Not everyone is interested in having sex. It can be hard to imagine in a culture as sexualized as America. Two out of every three shows on the TV contain sexual content. In a study for Kaiser Family Foundation, fifty hours of TV watching included 156 acts of sexual intercourse. A study with the University of Georgia shows that the number of commercials that use sell to sell their products has risen from 15% to 27% by 2003 (I’m sure it is even more now) . And ""Approximately 92% of the 174 songs that made it into the [Billboard] Top 10 in 2009 contained reproductive messages,"" according to Professor Dawn Hobbs of New York State University. Yet despite the prevalence, there is a small percentage that do not relate to those feelings. 

Researchers believe around 1% of the population to be asexual (Swash, R. 2012). An asexual is defined as someone who does not experience sexual attraction. “This is a definition about desire - how you feel, and not about sexual behavior - how you act.” (DePaulo, B. 2009) Unlike celibacy, there is no choice involved, it is an innate characteristic. Founder of The Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), David Jay (2012), describes it [sex] this way, “Imagine the most ridiculous thing that you can, and then imagine that it’s all anyone else cares about.” 

Asexuality only directly refers to sexual attraction, romantic attraction is often present in asexuals and they might identify as an asexual, heterosexual, homosexual, or other romantic orientation. Some identify as aromatic and do not experience romantic attraction either. The asexual community includes a very diverse group of people. 

Many unfair assumptions are often made about asexuals. Some of which are, asexuals just haven’t found the right person yet, they have been previously abused, and that they are really gay and just suppressing their feelings. These comments are very degrading and frustrating for asexuals. Psychiatrists occasionally try to say that this lack of sexual desire is a biological error; however there has been no data to support this. 

Asexuals do not understand why people care so much about sex just as much as others can’t understand how they don’t. This is especially disorienting in the early teen years when most peers begin to develop sexual interests. David Jay discusses when he was a young teen and his friends began to talk about sexuality and he just couldn’t relate. Asexual males are given an exceptionally hard time since sexual prowess is so often tied with masculinity. Oliva Gordon (2012) points out, “there is marginalization. In a world saturated with pornography, Viagra and sex scandals, asexuals – especially young ones – can feel as if they don’t officially exist.” 

There is nothing wrong with having no sexual desires, but in our society, that goes against the hypersexual norm. After receiving a lot of exposure lately, it has become “a 'problem' as it became more visible, and in a sense it's become the new stigma."" ‘Coming out’ can result in attempts to help them realize that they are just ‘misguided’ and can get ‘fixed’. 

	The key factor is generating more self-acceptance is education. Although asexuality has been in the media frequently as of late, there is still much skepticism and ignorance on the subject. It is hard to encourage discussion without there being a basis of willingness to listen without rejecting it based on unfamiliarity with the concept. However, sites like AVEN and asexualitic are creating safe places to connect with other asexuals and ask questions. Organizing informational meetings for parents, teachers, and students can provide a level of understanding that has not previously been established. Those years when the other kids begin to become ‘sexually aware’ of each other could be much less confusing and alienating if the authority figures in their lives had some level of education on the matter to be able to answer some of their early questions and hopefully foster conversation with their peers. Supplying them with information and ways to connect with others, and a providing a vocabulary to effectively communicate with will give them the tools they need to gain confidence and acceptance of themselves at an early age. 

	It is important to remember that being asexual does not define a person any more than being heterosexual does.  Every individual is unique. We do live in a very sexualized country but we also highly value privacy and individual freedom. University student Anwen Howard sums it up perfectly when she says, “I’ve made it a mission in my life to let other people know it’s perfectly fine to be different.” (Gordon, O. 2012)",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,False,,,True,t3_1azh8k,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1azh8k/a_paper_on_asexuality/,

I realize that asexuals threaten ""normal"" people with our very existence. We challenge everything that they hold near and dear by not desiring it. I know that people fear/hate what they don't understand, but COME ON! IT GETS OLD!

It's not enough that people think we're delusional, won't acknowledge the fact that we exist, we don't know ourselves, we'll change one day, we're just prudes, no one will sleep with us and that's the reason for our sexuality ! No, the very subject of asexuality disturbs them to the point that they don't even want to look at it.

It's easy to be lonely when you're ace. That 1% statistic is daunting. I'm sure many of us, if asked, would say “I'm the only ace I know.” But are you?

It's important to remember that, unlike most of the other gender/sexual minorities, *we can pass.* Nobody knows we're ace (or grey, or demi — I'm not trying to leave anyone out here, “ace” is just much easier to type) unless we tell them. Flamboyant little gay boys don't get that option. Girls that never grow out of their tomboy phase don't get that option. The men and women whose bodies don't match their brains don't get to pretend to be “normal.” Their lives are often made much, much harder because of it — but that also gives them the opportunity to find others like them. Aces are stealth. You'll never know if somebody's asexual just by looking.

In fact, you might bump into one on the street and never know. Just run the numbers: one person in every hundred is estimated to be on the gray/ace/demi spectrum.

*One whole percent.*

* That's 708 million in the world today.

* 3.1 million aces in the USA.

* 110,000 aces play World of Warcraft.

* 82,000 aces live in New York City.

* 7,000 aces in the state of North Dakota.

* 6,000 aces in the city where I live.

* 270 aces ran in this year's Boston Marathon.

* There are probably ten in your big Psychology 101 lecture class.

* There are maybe five aces on any given 747 flight.

* Two or three on the subway platform, waiting for a train...


We're out there, all right. We're *legion.* Maybe not all of us know: maybe not all of us care. Education and outreach are important — the more people you tell, the higher your chance of hearing “me, too!” in return. That's something you have to decide for yourself. But please, try not to feel so lonely. We're out there. We're just on the down-low about it.

For six months I have delved into depression and denied it because of fear.  Drifted from the only forum that had supported me in this.  Finally this morning I came out to my wife. 

I came out about everything from my aversion to sex, to the panromantic attractions I experience.  

My fear was unfounded.  She took time to process it, then told me its okay she is open and understanding and I should follow who I am, and not try and be someone I'm not.  It wasn't expected as she has always indicated that male attraction to another male would be the end of us.  

But perhaps its because there won't be any sex that she is cool with it.  Either way, I feel so much better.  Its like a weight has been lifted of my shoulders and I can breath again.

However, there were a lot of things about sex that I didn't like. As a woman I felt obligated to fake orgasms to please my partner. I swear I did it every time, and every time I wished I didn't have to. I would make sounds that were forced (not unnatural sounding, but not what I would have done if I didn't feel like there was this social obligation to do so.) I gave a lot of blow jobs - all of which I hated - the motion, the gagging feeling, the taste... BAD. I did a lot of alternative positions to please my partner, all of which I hated except for missionary. And even with missionary I really was just waiting for that moment afterwards when we just hold each other in a nice afterglow. I really liked that. 

I liked to be seduced, kissed on my neck, but it was the idea that I was liked and desired more than anything.

I'm 32 now, and I have decided that I really don't want sex ever again, and I don't really masturbate much anymore. It's less and less. To imagine sex to me is to think of childishness, which is ironic because really it's a thing adults do. I don't want another relationship either, or friendships either really. I just don't like people much and don't want to bother with any social obligations of any kind. The reward just doesn't add up to the cost.

All I really want to do for the rest of my life is pursue knowledge through philosophy and research. I have made it my goal to know everything in one lifetime. I think it can be done! It gives my life meaning and purpose, and it fulfills my competitive nature as well.

Anyways, that's my story.

1328406710.0,26,self.asexuality,pbbu3,How can you know if you never tried it? My attempt at ace comedy,Singulaire,29,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/pbbu3/how_can_you_know_if_you_never_tried_it_my_attempt/,"Hey, [/r/asexuality](/r/asexuality), I've worked out this comical diatribe that I hope should amuse you. It's my first time, so be gentle. Here goes:

A common response you hear when telling people you're asexual is: ""Well, how do you know you don't like sex if you've never tried it."" On the face of it, it seems like they have a point- a theory needs to be put to the test to be confirmed. The thing is, the people saying this aren't saying it because they are thorough, principled scientist, they're just trying to wave away things that don't match their understanding of the world.

Suppose you indulge them. You go out and you have sex with someone. Unsurprisingly, it sucked, but at least now you've confirmed what you've always thought. They have to believe you now, right?

""Oh, the first time always sucks, you have to try it a few times for it to get really awesome."" Oh come on! I did what you asked, why do you have to be so obstinate?! This makes me angry! But they are right, most people report that sex is pretty lame on the first try. And why wouldn't it be? You have no idea what you're doing! So okay, lets indulge them further.

You have sex a dozen times, just for good measure. It's not great, actually it's a pretty rough experience, but you're commited to this course of scientific experimentation, so you slog through. Now they'll surely admit that you're just different and simply don't enjoy sex!

""Well, sex doesn't really get mind-blowing until you've been in a committed relationship for a while and spent a long time figuring out what works for each other"" You bang your head on a desk. And again. And a third time. It's a 3-headdesk kind of comment. And yet, you are forced to admit they have a point. Repeated attempts at sex with the same person, while trying different things, could reasonably be expected to produce better results than random fornication. You think we're getting in too deep? This is nothing, I'll tell you when we're in too deep!

So you go out and socialise, and you enter a committed relationship with this lovely, understanding person. with time this relationship takes on a sexual nature, and over the next three years you have sex hundreds of times, trying something a little different each time. It doesn't get better. Well, no surprise there. But now, **NOW**, the people you talked to absolutely *must* accept that you're asexual.

""Some people just can't enjoy regular sex. You have to really get freaky with it and try out different kinks and fetishes to find out what it is that'll work for you."" Your shriek of frustration pierces the night, waking dogs and frightening small children. Seriously, what's it gonna take?

But hey, you've come this far, you might as well keep trying. Plus, your long-term partner would really like for you two to find something that works. So you scour the dark side of sex, trying out every fetish, kink, and niche interest you can find. Man, who knew there were so many of those? Eventually you run out of steam, you've done a lot of thinsg you never though you would dare, and sex is still something you're forcing yourself to get through. Okay, now there's no way those guys can weasel out of admitting you're asexual, absolutely no chance in he-

""Okay, so maybe you just can't enjoy sex, there's a small minority of people who can't get off. But you can't seriously mean to tell me you're asexual, look at all the sexual things you did. Especially the kinky stuff. Come on, what asexual person would do that?"" FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-

Remember when I said I'll tell you when we're in too deep? Yeah... we're in too deep.

When I was growing up I haven't felt different than other boys. While everybody got rid of their virginity as huge burden and declared themselves to be ""grown up"" I haven't been interested even in self pleasure, which didn't bothered me anyway Of course I had sought romantic relationships. I have always wondered why relationships never lasted more than three months, which was a mystery for me.

I have never wanted it. Nudity has never been more intriguing than Chukchi clothes. Most of the advertisements with naked, smiling ladies because of the salad, iron and everything else seemed to me like a global, tasteless joke.""*Just look at the barely not pornographic lady enjoying her new razor like it is her wedding day - How can it possibly work on anybody?*"" I have thought every time I saw any advertisement, ""*They have to have more respect for the ladies.*""

For four years my virgin girlfriend struggles with me because she is sexually curious and is willing to explore ""The dark side"", because receiving oral sex ""is just not enough"". -*""Well, I just don't know, I don't want it..""* -*""Do I look so bad? You don't like me?""* -*""I just.. don't know. I love you very much, I respect your body, you always say that you feel like stealing from other because of all the attention you get and.. I just don't feel the need for it.. I don't think I will enjoy it..""* -*""How can you know if you have never tried?""* -*""How can you know you will, if you haven't tried...?""* -*""...""* Later on I have learned that she feels very bad, undesirable, which is absolutely not true. -*""I can't understand the problem..""* -*""Me neither..""*

We have researched all the internet for tips on how to get ""the spark"", but nothing seemed to be working. Have asked help in /r/deadbedrooms, which haven't provided any help and were just offensive jerks instead. Done exercises. Completely nothing. Everything ends with passionate kissing and talking. -*""We can try if you want it so badly.""* -*""No. It won't happen if you don't want it as sincerely as me.""* -*""Well, I wish I would die as a virgin""*. This, in my opinion innocent, remark now haunts my GF for months. I have almost visited sexologist. Not to mention my idea -*""Hey, if you want it so much and I oppose it so much, then why won't you find somebody for purely physical pleasure?""* -*""What the hell? I am not a whore! How the hell can you come up with something like this!?!""* -*""Well, if nothing else works, I thought this would have been the best alternative for both of us..""*

Now 23 with my girlfriend for four years, haven't seen each other for months due to the project I work on in the international community. It is funny for me how even the sworn enemies forget politics and embrace one another in sexual acts, how confess their mishaps and regrets, broken hearts, all the gossips. *""What the fuck is wrong with the people?""*

Only last week I have found out about asexuality in a very funny way. We had film forum with friends and this time we have watched *""[Come as you are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_as_You_Are_%28film%29)""*. I could not enjoy the movie because I see no motives of character actions and spent rest of the movie just analyzing previously seen movies involving sex, thought about all the poor families separated by sex and was puzzled about *""Why would anybody want to do it?""*. I had no realization why do the characters want to get laid so badly. I was oblivious even to possibility that *normal people* feel the same way as the characters. *""I just don't understand why would anybody want to get laid. [Probably] It is not the world's best feeling anyway.. Sex tourism is very popular for some reason also in my country,""* I said to spark the discussion and by the looks of other film forum participants, from whom one was 23 year old chubby virgin lady, I understood that I have said something generally terrible as a healthy, young, almost athletic youngster who has respect from everybody involved in the project.. *""Fuck..""* was my first thought.. Best friend forwarded the discussion from sex in general to disability/pity-sex instead and we have had small talk, after which I have red wikipedia a lot about sexuality until I have arrived to ""asexuality"" page, which I clicked just because *""Ha, you can't just reproduce by copying yourself..""*

That was it. **Asexuality**. Clicked on related sites, have red some AVEN forum posts and stories which were peculiarly familiar. *""Let's check reddit if it has some comrades in similar situation..""* and huge was my amazement to see 2.700 aces and all the stories which could have been written by me. It was three a.m. after exhausting day, but I could not sleep. -""What if I was *normal* and acted differently in situations like ..."" and it blew my mind how many times I have been offered sex and ""be the first one"", but which has never happened, because I haven't even realized it.

I still struggle with thought that I am *a minority among minority*. I feel bad for my GF, since It just can't be ""fixed"". I could not embrace the thought that I am not as others. That I can't give her all she needs. The only thing what is missing. I still hope to end my life as a virgin. I would be glad for her if she would find somebody who can fulfil all her needs. i am excited to find comrades, but I feel *so lost* for the first time since many years. I wish I wasn't unlike others, but I like how I am now, despite all the troubles with it.

Thank you everybody. It would have been easier if they taught it in schools. It would be easier if local LGBT community had some information about it. I feel at peace with my sexuality, but the thoughts about all of it takes toll on all the productivity and energy. I feel lost. Eventually I will find myself. Eventually I will lose my previously *""meh""* about my virginity I came to like the past week, because I don't want to lose the best person I have ever met (and even making friends is very difficult for others).

I'm a nice person, so people they think I'm hitting on them, so I started avoiding meeting up with men. Because I'm not ""girly"" I can't really relate to my female friends about their relationship dramas, I am not interested in shopping for make up and clothes, and I don't enjoy bar scenes or partying. It's a bit isolating.  
   
However, I noticed over the past couple of years that I now feel disconnected from complete strangers. I suck at networking and socializing. I have almost no friends. I don't use Facebook. One person I've known for 8 years calls me her ""best friend"" and I feel ambivalent about this. I had a realization that if my father wasn't family, I'd never hang out with him because we have absolutely nothing to talk about. I don't really ""miss"" people. When I was young, I was never homesick. When my grandmother died last year, I was the only one who didn't cry. I was fond of her, and miss her, but she was very ill and went peacefully. Oddly enough, when my pet birds die, I become very upset and can get depressed for weeks.

But in the end, I'm not here to please anybody else. I'm here to make MYSELF happy. Not you. Not Jim Bob. Not Sean Connery. If not having sex makes me feel satisfied and whole, then I'm not going to have sex. If you can't handle that, then just don't date me. It's really simple.

It's the basic mammalian need for caring touch, and the craving we get when we go without.

This is something I didn't think about until I thought about it, if you know what I mean. Western society (especially in the US and UK) is becoming increasingly touch-averse. Incidental contact isn't something that seems to happen much any more. But touch is something we literally can't go without.

As a population, I think people on the ace spectrum probably have an especially hard time with this, partly because relationships are often difficult for us (for various reasons), and partly because skin hunger is often fulfilled through sex. 

Thinking about it, I don't have many friends, I'm not a ""touchy-feely"" person, and my SO and I have different enough schedules that I don't see him more than once or twice a week. I get most of my touch from my cat and my horse. I think that's sad. I'd like to do something about it. 

What are your ways for getting enough touch? I'd like to hear from everyone, all across the spectrum, but I'm most interested to hear from folks who are single, or aromantic, and people who shy away from others most of the time. How do you deal? Are you lonely? Does it bother you?

Of course, the need for touch exists on a spectrum just like everything else. Some people need a lot of touch, some people don't. Are you getting as much as you need?

Quick history: due to a religious upbringing, my husband and I decided to wait until marriage to have sex.  After marriage, we (slowly and painfully) found out that I was asexual.  This has really messed with me, and I am terribly unhappy about it.  And my husband is...less than satisfied with our sex life, being your average sexual person.  My single biggest desire in life right now is to be able to physically enjoy sex with my husband (I currently have sex with my husband about once a week, but I experience no physical pleasure from it). I have set up an appointment (this coming Tuesday) to speak with a doctor about any options I may have, in case my lack of sex drive is a result of something medical.  And yes, I am bringing up that awful question we've all heard before, ""Have you had your hormones checked?""  A lot of things about my life point to perhaps a hormonal imbalance (in my case), and I want to explore this avenue.

My question to you all wonderful people of this subreddit is this: Would you be interested in a running account of my experiences, as they happen?  For example, Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning, I'd recount how the doctor's visit went, and what the next steps would be.

I am hesitant to involved /r/asexuality in all of this, because there is such a vibe of ""Asexuality is perfectly normal, and you are a wonderful, complete person.""  I feel like my unhappiness with asexuality doesn't really jive here.  If you guys don't wanna hear about it, or don't think it would add anything to this subreddit, I'll delete the post and you'll never hear from this throwaway account again.

tl;dr: I want to want to have sex, and am going to get my hormones checked.  Do y'all want to hear about it?  (Also, if you happen to have any bits of advice for me, they would be greatly appreciated)

All through high school I never partied or anything. And, for lack of a better word, it really annoyed my dad. Where I live guys are expected to screw anything with a pulse and women are expected not to date until after marriage (it's a rather fucked up ideology). I went through the entirety of high school without so much as a singe date or kiss or anything. In fact my only crush was a close friend, but nothing ever came of it. I was always a source of disapoiment to my dad (for this and a mirade of other reasons) who fully imbolizes the above ideology. For a while he thought I might be gay (which in this area is the equivalent of being a witch in the Monty Python universe). 

I'll be 24 in October and I've only had one girlfriend which failed spectacularly. I thought maybe if I dated someone long enough I would eventually be attracted to them (note: fucking terrible idea). My dad now just thinks I'm weird but at least I doesn't give me *The Eye* anymore. My biological father (who abandoned me at a early age and i don't really cinsider my dad) even flat out said ""what the fuck is wrong with you"" when i moved in with him, at 19, and showed no interests in girls. But now my mom and grandmother and great aunt (who is more like a grandmother) are all playing this baby guilt game. In this town you're *supposed* to get married by 20 or 21 so that you can start having kids around 22.
It's depressing. It's like all these people I respect and love now just see me as broken; like I don't fit the mold so I'm not good for anything. 

They don't even know what asexuality is. They still think gays and lesbians are an abomination against god and nature. So I smile politely, wave and dodge their comments about how I need to marry a girl with brown eyes so that my mother can finally have a browned eyed baby or how I need to ""hurry up"" and meet some girl.

Recently I've been super confused (about my sexuality, stuff like that).
I consider myself a lesbian, because I would never consider having sex/dating/loving a man, *ever*. Don't get me wrong, men are cool, but I could never find them attractive.
So that was step one.
But I've been confused about this for quite a while. 
Like the average teenager, of course, I masturbate, but only to get rid of the nagging feeling that other people describe as being horny.
To me, this feeling is just annoying, and I get rid of it through masturbation.
Like, I honestly cannot grasp how it feels ""good"" other than the fact that the horniness goes away. And people describe sex as a necessity and a way to show love, ect ect, but I just can't think of it that way.
I've tried watching porn and stuff, but the only thing I find interesting is how they love each other.
I've told some friends about this, they say I'm not asexual because I masturbate and I have tried to elaborate to them that it doesn't give me pleasure but I guess they don't feel like what I feel is possible.
I need you guys to help determine what the line is between asexual and sexual, because I am honestly, utterly confused and need some insight on this.
I'd rather cuddle than have sex, and sure, I would definitely have sex with someone if it gave them pleasure, but I don't think it's so great.
Can you guys help me out with this?

I'm a panromantic asexual female. I'm single and always have been. I find a lots of people attractive, and I'm really cuddly but have no one to share that cuddliness. I'm afraid of romantic relationships, because I don't think I could ever find anyone to date, since I'm repulsed asexual person. 

Since I find so many types of people attractive, my biggest fear is that someone really nice and good looking comes hitting on me, and me being exited about that, agree to go date with them. And if that goes as far as building a romantic relationship with them, we're in trouble because of my asexuality and that could only lead to heart break.

So this fear of imagined and future hear break causes me to change my appearance to more ugly. As a woman I wear baggy clothes, cut my hair short, use no make-up etc. to not to be attractive to straight males, and I avoid places where I could be hit on by lesbians (and try to look enough of a boy for them not to recognize me as a girl).

I would like to have a nice ace girl-/boyfriend, but odds finding one are so slim I've given up. Now I just have to avoid sexual peoples attention in a certain way.

I've been in college 6 years for 2 majors, Anthropology and Fine Art, and 2 minors in Archaeology and Art History. My focus is Forensic Anthropology.)  Anyway, 2 days later, she wants to 'talk about the elephant in the room'. So we talk. As the youngest of 3 daughters (30, 27, and me at 24) it came up as, ""So when am I getting Grand Children from you"" my reply was ""My baby maker is off the market and out of bounds. Permanently.""  She says, like everyone else in my family, “Oh, you will grow to want some when you are older. You just haven’t found the right person yet.”

My reply to that is:  “One, Due to my many many many health problems that would be passed down to the child, no. Plus, I don’t want a tiny, germy little human permanently attached to me. No. Just… No. 

 Second, I don’t want, never have wanted, and probably never will want to have sex. No swapping of bodily fluids for this girl. 

Third, I am Asexual, and although there is a possibility of being fluid on the Kinsey scale, I doubt that sex and children are in my near future. Or far one. Or any of it. Unless they aren’t mine.

Then, after explaining Asexuality and everything that comes with it (for a second time in 3 years) she says: “So. When did you decide to become…  Asexual. I mean, it has to have been a conscious choice. You are just hiding behind the name ‘Asexual’. At least admit that you chose not to be sexually active.” ……..  

Uh. No? It wasn’t a ‘choice.’ It’s never a ‘choice.’  So then I explained how I’ve always felt. That I dated because it was the ‘norm’. Didn’t she realize those ‘boyfriends’ never lasted more than a week? Or that I never got physical? That the only time’s I’ve ever been ‘kissed’ was when they literally grabbed me and made me kiss them? That I never been physical with anyone.  Seriously. No. One.  I admit, my  middle sister 'slutted it up all over High School', and then my Oldest retreated into gaming and anime and became (Still is) a crazy childish, Otaku-ish type person that (we unwillingly found out) likes to do bondage and sleeps with ‘whoever will have her’. ((If you don't like this discription, go to the end and see my *Edit)) I guess my mum doesn’t realize that I’m just not like that. I still have my Virginity, thank-you-very-much.
Anyway, for the past few months-ish, she has brought up all of my male doctors that I have had as a child and has asked me if they “Ever did anything to you, like touched your or something? You can tell me.” Seriously? Does she think I got groped or whatever and that is why I’m Asexual? Oi-ve. 

 I’m not sure how else to handle this. What else I can say. I’ve explained it (twice in 3 hour long sessions),  given her web-sites, information galore, but she still treats me like a heterosexual female that is just going through a ‘phase’ ish type thing. I haven’t had any type of ‘partner’ since I was 15. Seriously. 
Long-story-short: My mum and I had a huge discussion after her drunken ramblings of how I’ve wasted the past 6 years of my life at college, I’ll never amount to anything, I’m her least favorite daughter because I’m never around (I’m at school/work from 7am-9:30pm) and I never do anything for her, blah blah blah, etc… Then, we have the ‘let’s talk about what I did/said because I don’t really remember and we should make-up’ talk, that led to the, when am I getting grand-children from you, which led to the ‘we’ve already had this talk, my baby-maker is of the market permanently, I’m Asexual, which she says that I had to have made that decision to be Asexual, and I say no, It’s how I’ve always felt.  And now, she is acting weird around me. Not wanting to hug, not wanting to talk about anything really, kinda avoiding me but still treating me as if I were a hetero-sexual female. I’m not sure what to do about this. This is the second time I’ve explained it. She seems to think that I chose to be Asexual as in –I quote- “Well, when did you decide to become ‘Asexual’? You had to have made a conscious decision to become Asexual. If you don’t want to have sex yet, that’s fine, but don’t tell people you are ‘Asexual’. That is going too far. You shouldn’t associate/call yourself ((After I told her we are part of the LGBTQIAA Community)) or label yourself with those kinds of people. You should just say that you don’t want to have sex yet, or whatever, and then later, when you want to, you can just do it.” 

Which led to another argument that people don’t choose who they love, who they are attracted to, or what they feel. People are born this way, and it is just as natural as having different skin color, or eye color, or their looks or height. It’s natural to be different, and that includes sexual orientation. She refuses to see it that way. I refuse to give in to her views. Now she has no idea how to act around me. I told her that I am the same person I was when I told her, but she is still being weird. I’m not sure what to do besides giver her information, time, and space. What do you guys think????

**Okay: Edit: The describing of my sisters sexual way's were how *they* described them. They used those words to describe it that way. And I'm not passing judgement on how/who people sex it up.

1353912424.0,23,self.asexuality,13svk7,How would you REALLY know? (Demisexuality),gorbenchop,27,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/13svk7/how_would_you_really_know_demisexuality/,"I feel like I'm at something of an impasse. To put things shortly, I don't know if I'm demisexual or if I have a pile of anxieties surrounding sex and intimacy. 

I'm 22, male, and maybe a 1 or a 2 on the Kinsey scale as far as my orientation goes. I've never been in a romantic/sexual relationship and I've never been sexual with anybody. I'm comfortable saying I experience romantic attraction or at least a ""liking"" for certain people, I know I want to be around them and rarely I'll get a little ""whooshiness"" or a dropping feeling in my stomach.

I've never felt a pressing need to say ""Wow, I'd fuck her"" or profess my straightness to other guys in the way guys often do. There is an amount of macho posturing involved amongst hetero men so maybe that accounts for some of it - maybe most guys actually wouldn't have sex with a random stranger if they had the opportunity to. But, it seems that honest to God most guys would. I don't feel that way and I feel comfortable saying that, actually having sex with a stranger isn't something I'd do if the opportunity arose.

I do find women attractive and the idea of sex does not repulse me. I've been aroused before, and when I am, sex seems more plausible, meaning that if I had a willing partner maybe sex would happen. Obviously that's never happened for me so far. I'm not sure if I fantasize more or less often than most people. A highly sexualized culture suggests that I do it less but I really don't know.

When I first heard about demisexuality I thought ""Hey, that kinda sounds like me!"" so the idea has intrigued me for some time. However, I don't know if I actually AM demisexual or if I have mental blocks to get over.

While I haven't been diagnosed I'm pretty sure I've got some depression problems, some anxiety and maybe one or two other things. My lack of a love life causes me quite a bit of stress and depression, it's almost definitely the #1 cause of me being down in the dumps since probably the end of high school. I've had a low self image and I've never really felt as if I was worthy of anybody for as long as I can remember, probably since I was 12 or 13. I feel a lot of pressure, in a sense, to be in a relationship so if the opportunity arises I feel very anxious about our interactions. Just recently I met a girl at school, she's great, we went on some dates, and I could have had sex with her if I wanted. I decided to not continue seeking a relationship with her (another matter that I might elaborate upon if it turns out to be relevant). 

When I found out she wanted to have sex with me I felt really freaked out by it. Definitely way too soon. I find her very attractive physically but again, I don't have a powerful urge to have sex with her. I can't relax around her and there's no way I'd feel comfortable initiating physical contact with her that has the intention of leading to sex. Maybe it's the reliance on nonverbal scripts that freaks me out, I have a hard time deciphering anybody's intentions so somebody else's sexual interest in me immediately triggers a bunch of nervousness and anxiety with a feeling of pressure, and I felt like a failure after hearing that I ""could have"" (her words) had sex with her if I wanted.

I don't know if this is ""normal"" IE it's something sexual people commonly experience - to feel freaked out at a prospective ""first time"" especially if relationships are completely new to you.

I don't know if this is a deeper anxiety problem because my mentality towards myself has always been self defeating, depression, low self esteem at times, shyness, low confidence - these are all generalizations and they don't apply to me equally at all times, they're situational.

And, I don't know if I feel this way because I'm ""actually"" demisexual and sexual culture pressures me to feel otherwise, creating a palatable dissonance in the form of my anxiety, since I'm not anxious around women who are friends of mine, probably since I know where the boundaries are and sex doesn't enter the picture. Maybe if I am anxious, my anxiety is preventing me from feeling sexual attraction that I DO experience, I just deny to myself. I have no idea.

Any thoughts?

My textbook either has a really hard time differentiating sexual interest/arousal disorder in women and hypoactive sexual desire disorder in men (wow, those are mouthfuls) from asexuality, or it is actuality describing asexuality as being a disorder.  

According to the book, it states that ""Sexual interest/arousal disorder in women refers to persistent deficits in sexual interest (sexual fantasies of urges), biological arousal, or subjective arousal. For men, (...) hypoactive sexual desire disorder refers to deficient or absent sexual fantasies and urges.""

Now, normally I would just grumble and be annoyed with it, but the ""Clinical Case"" in the book sounds a lot like a perfectly healthy ace. It says:   

""Robert was a highly intelligent 25-year old graduate student in physics at a leading East Coast university when he sought treatment for what he called ""sexual diffidence"". He was engaged to a young woman, and he said he loved his fiancee very much and felt compatible with her in every conceivable way except in bed. There, try as he might, and with apparent understanding from his fiancee, he found himself uninterested in responding to or initiating sexual contact. Both parties had attributed these problems to the academic pressures he had faced for the past 2 years, but a discussion with the therapist revealed that Robert had had little interest in sex -- either with men or with women -- for as far back as he could remember, even when work pressures decreased. He asserted that he found his fiancee very attractive and appealing, but as with other women he had known, his feelings were not passionate. He had masturbated very rarely in adolescence and did not begin dating until late in college, though he had had many female acquaintances. His general approach to life, including sex, was analytical and intellectual, and he described his problems in a very dispassionate and detached way to the therapist. He freely admitted that he would not have contacted a therapist at all were it not for the quietly stated wishes of his fiancee, who worried that his lack of interest in sex would interfere with their future marital relationship. After a few individual sessions, the therapist asked the young man to invite his fiancee to a therapy session, which the client readily agreed to do. During a joint session, the couple appeared to be very much in love and looking forward to a life together, though the woman expressed concern about her fiance's lack of sexual interest.""   

Am I interpreting this wrong? Should I try and correct my professor? Should I just ignore it? I don't like being grouped in with people with Schizophrenia and DID when I don't think there's anything wrong with us.

Edit: Okay, I sent an email to the professor. Hopefully I'll get a response soon. My biggest concern is how it will affect what he teaches in the lecture tomorrow (I read a bit ahead in the book).

Edit 2: So the professor emailed me back. He said that:

1) He does not endorse everything in the textbook (he says it's more like a supplement), and he encourages us to be critical of what it says.

2) He pointed me specifically to a point in the book where it states that a requirement for sexual dysfunctions in general is that they cause significant distress or functioning problems. Thus, it didn't need to be stated for specific disorders.

3) He said he actually had plans to the case of asexuality to argue that low/absent sexual desire is not always a problem, and thus is not always a diagnosable mental disorder. So I'm excited to see how he handles that in the lecture tomorrow. I'll give another update for that.

Edit 3: Yay! The professor did explicitly talk about asexuality in class, and he explained how asexuals are generally content with a natural lack of attraction. On the other hand, people with sexual interest/arousal disorder in women and hypoactive sexual desire disorder in men are distressed with a lack of attraction that is more often caused by relationship problems or sexual abuse. It actually helped clear up some of my own questions. My final conclusion is that the professor did a very good job, but the book itself still has a lot of issues. Specifically, it needs a better ""Clinical Case"" example, and it should talk about asexuality the same way it talked about exactly why homosexuality and gender dysmorphia weren't classified as disorders.",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,1343338381.0,,,True,t3_x1i8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/x1i8x/annoyed_with_my_abnormal_psychology_class/,

It took me over a YEAR into our relationship to get there. and even then, he fucked up my trust by being forceful when I wasn’t ready thus messing up every sexual experience later for me. To where I couldn’t even touch him by the end of our relationship.

but jesus. I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL. Most people my age have already have sex. Or are at least somewhat sexually attracted to people. and I’m not. I mean. I find people attractive. like cute. and handsome. but as far as their genitals go. no. I just don’t.

Do I want to have sex someday? yes. if someone is willing to be patient with me. and understand that I’ve been through sexual trauma in the past. (I’ve been raped. by a girl. my ex knew this and still was forceful, even forcing his hand down my pants on several occasions.)

but yeah. there isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t hate myself because of my sexual orientation. It sucks. a lot. even my mom once told me “so, are you going to get over your ‘touchy-feely’ thing?” like wow. she doesn’t even understand. You would think a parent would be happy their kid has no desire to have sex. but no. instead it’s weird. I just. I don’t know. It sucks.

and just today I jokingly called my ex 'gay' on twitter for now buying a poster of a naked girl and he got super pissy about it and said ""stop trying to make it seem like everyones gay. Just cause you don’t know for sure what you want doesn’t mean everyone is the same way."" and I told him I was joking and apologized and he said whatever and I told him I should be the one who's upset because he basically just put down my sexuality. to which he said ""You put your own sexuality down like all the time. I'm not gonna feel bad for what I said.""

Basically I'm really really upset about this. I mean, I understand I dragged him through a 2 year relationship not knowing what I really wanted and thinking I wanted sex but it never ending well. Mainly because he really wouldn't be patient with me or understand my views on sex (I think it's mainly for the use of reproduction, and if I end up with a non-asexual partner who's willing to be patient, then sure.

There are questions there related to sexual orientation and romantic orientation, and I thought I'd share a preview of some of the results.

As far as I'm aware, the accepted figure is 1% of the general population is asexual - but from this survey, 

* about 11% of respondents identify as on the asexual spectrum (that is, asexual (3%), demisexual (5%) or grey-asexual (3%))
* 81% of the respondents identified as sexual. 

As for sexual orientation, 

* 5% identified as asexual or demisexual (3% asexual, 2% demisexual)
* 29% identified as bisexual, pansexual or homosexual (12%, 9% and 8% respectively)
* 56% identified as heterosexual.

For romantic orientation, 

* 3% identified as aromantic
* 1% identified as demiromantic
* 55% identified as heteroromantic
* 26% identified as bi-, pan- or homoromantic (9%, 10%, 7% respectively)

For all of these questions about 4% identified as questioning.

Anyway - thought the figures were interesting and quite encouraging! Of course you'd have to take into account the fact that SRSers are probably more aware of different sexual orientations than the average person out on the street, so there might be higher representations of asexual spectrum people.

Hey there, /r/asexuality!

I am Jake_Of_All_Trades, you may have seen some of my posts throughout various threads on this subreddit. To let you know, I am not a mod of this subreddit, but I have been a fairly active account and have always had the best interests for the awareness of asexuality and sexual orientation in general. I have also have talked in front of LGBT groups, Human sexuality college classes, and in small local newspapers. While nothing too large or in the public awareness, I believe that I have helped many understand asexuality and general human sexuality. 

That brings me to the focus of this thread: A mod from /r/Demisexuality made a thread regarding the low visibility of asexuality and demisexuality in other subreddits, specifically /r/LGBTeens. It is also true that there is a more confusing topic regarding the difference of sexual and romantic orientation throughout a lot of LGBT communities/subreddits. This is a large part of the discussions that arrive at /r/asexuality and we would like to offer our stories and lives so that others which may feel lost, confused, or undecided (regardless of sexual orientation) may better understand themselves.

At this moment, the general plan right now is that both subreddits will have a list of ""spokespersons"" that would be active the entire duration of the AMA (TBA) answering any questions that those of LGBTeens may have. Note, not all of these spokespersons will be teens, but those who do talk will definitely have experience dealing with their sexual orientation in their life more proactively than most. This doesn't mean that others from each subreddit can't pitch in the discussion (you can, in fact, that would be absolutely amazing! =]. Nor does this mean you have to be asexual, perhaps you are a partner of an asexual person, your experience as a SO would be very insightful.

If anyone would like to participate or like to be a spokesperson for this group AMA, please comment or PM me. For spokespersons, it  woudl be appreciated if you have had some experience speaking to groups of people about your experiences or asexuality. 

So, in recap or TL;DR:

* /r/asexuality and /r/demisexuality group AMA for /r/LGBTeens the time of such is currently TBA
* Giving awareness about the differences of sexual attraction and romantic attraction.
* Need spokespersons to be active during the entire AMA answering questions/comments. (Preferred if such persons have previous experience talking about asexuality in front of groups of people)
* Having a fun and great time spreading visibility to asexuality and demisexuality!
* If you would like to participate, please comment below or PM me saying so.

General questions expected to be answered:

* What is asexuality/demisexuality?
* What are the different attractions?
* Difference between sexual attraction and sex drive (libido).
* Difference between sexual attraction and romantic attraction.
* Personal accounts on what it has been like as asexual/demisexual.

Other notes:

* I have a Twitch.tv stream account which I could do live answering of questions, but that is still up in the air.
* I have already gotten the A-O.K. from the mods at /r/LGBTeens for this AMA. They will also put a notice up on the subreddit up to the day of the AMA so we can get more visibility!

My question doesnt really revolve around the specifics of our relationship but i feel it's important to note that we were friends for a year and a half before developing a very deep romantic connection. In every respect we were perfect for eachother but going in I knew she wasnt sexually active. After a few months, she decided that she wanted to start developing the sexual side of our relationship. Long story short, we struggled for 18 months to figure out what if anything could be done to help the growing problem we were facing.  Ultimately I was able to accept that this discovery was something i could not help her with and she acknowledged that she needed to work on this on her own. 

I care about her very much. The pain and frustration of losing someone so important to me has been excruciating. She has a lot of searching to do, and I dont actually feel she is truly asexual from our experience, but that's really beside the point. 

I wanted to briefly explain my situation just  to really frame this question.  Do you feel obligated to tell people you are attracted to about your sexual orientation up front? Should you? I'm not stating it one way or the other, i'm curious how you have managed your attraction for someone who is not asexual.

 It must be very hard for members of this community. For a homosexual person at least there is a fairly large distinction for your dating pool. Thankfully now as homosexuality awareness rises I hope its easier for homosexual people to both acknowledge and accept their sexual preference and find other like minded people. 

I guess what I'm driving at is do you feel the asexual dating pool lies only within the asexual community? Considering the unpredictable way in which people are attracted to eachother and become romantically (but not necessarily sexually) attached, how could you avoid inevitably falling for someone with a more mainstream libido? And what should you do if that happens? 

I'll go ahead and admit that i have my own agenda. I hope that most asexual people are confident enough in their life choice to be up front about it. Through this whole relationship and the ensuing loss i've managed to come away with a kind of pro-asexuality mentality, or more accurately i'm in support of asexual awareness. 

I dont want this to be read as some push for having hard labels for this issue. I certainly dont think of asexuality as some kind of isolation tool. On the other hand, my interest in this topic is born entirely of the anger, frustration, lowered self esteem, and depression i wrestled with (and still do) as a result of truly loving and being sexually attracted to a woman who became my best friend through our time together. Losing our relationship has been hard, but even worse so is the knowledge that this ordeal broke down our friendship as well. 

I know there are a ton of people who struggle with sexless relationships. Hell, a quick peek through  /r deadbedrooms should reveal enough anger and confusion surrounding what is effectively a fundamental difference in sexual orientation (correct me if i'm wrong). 

There are certainly many degrees of asexuality. For many of you (my ex included) i understand that asexuality doesnt mean not wanting any kind of physical inimatcy. Most people have a desire to be close to the people we love and intimacy certainly isnt always sexual. But for so many of us that intimacy has a shared ground or is expressed through our sexual desire for our significant others. 

Ultimately it's the individual person's decision whether or not they are happy in a sexless relationship. Although there is no doubt in my mind that I would have happily married my ex if sex wasnt an issue i knew i couldnt live in a sexless relationship and marriage. Every aspect of my life degraded as this feeling of guilt and sense of not being good enough ate away at me. The struggle certainly wasnt easy for my ex either. I know that trying to come to terms with a topic she was very uncomfortable with (she has a general anxiety disorder which didnt help anything) was incredibly difficult. And my pain and frustration, no matter how much i tried to be patient and understanding, didnt help the situation. I know it hurt her to see my depression and loss of self esteem, and i hope she doesnt feel guilty about it now. 

I truly believe its not her fault or anything. 

I'm sorry this post is so long. In many ways this is cathartic for me and i'd like to hear your thoughts or experiences from an openly asexual point of view. I just hope more people can accept if they have no interest in sex and seek out other people who want romantic relationships but share their views. I think a lot of people have suffered simply because they loved some one genuinely and sex was just something they had to do to fit in. At least until the stresses of marriage and life crept in. 

**TL:DR: do you feel/should you feel obligated to explain your asexuality before a romantic relationship develops to avoid the pain and frustration for both parties involved of trying to sustain a romantic relationship when libido's dont match?  How hard is it to accept or explain your asexuality to the people you care about, especially potentially romantic interests you know dont share your views. **  ",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,1370257786.0,,,True,t3_1fkoku,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1fkoku/a_question_about_one_aspect_of_asexuality/,

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14p33m/have_you_had_your_hormones_checked_update_1/)

Wow.  A lot of things have happened since I last spoke with you all.  It will probably be easiest to just go chronologically.

Okay, so after my last appointment, I got my prescription filled, and took a half-dose for three days.  No effect (though, at the time, I kept joking with my husband that it was like when you've smoked pot but you're not high yet: ""I...I think I feel something...no, wait...maybe not....oh, is that it?"").

At this point, I had my first session with a counselor.  I was really nervous, as everyone referred to the counselor as Sister [Name]--I'm not remotely Catholic, and am more atheist than anything.  I was dreading being lectured about God and morality and stuff.  But surprisingly it was very helpful and eye-opening.  I won't go into the gory details, but trust me when I say that I had/have a lot more issues to deal with than I thought.  The biggest take-away from that session was restoring the tiniest bit of self-worth and the will to live.  It wasn't much, but it was enough to get me through the next couple of weeks.

Stepped up to full dose, and for the next copule of days it was more of the ""Am I feeling anything yet?""  Note: my friend that I mentioned in the last post, the one who is very familiar with anti-depressants, told me at this time, ""Oh, you'll know.  Trust me.""

And then Monday comes.  That week was probably (mentally and physically) the worst week of my life.  You know that feeling when you're driving along, then suddenly a cop pulls out behind you and flips its lights on?  That sudden drop in your stomach, that intense feeling of dread?  I was getting that sensation (both physically and mentally) about once every 10 minutes for hours at a time.  About once an hour I'd get a short dizzy spell.  I started sweating more (took me a while to realize that one); apparently ""excessive sweating"" is a documented side effect of Wellbutrin.  The most persistant side effect, though, was the nausea.  Before all this, I was counting calories, trying so hard to stay under that target number (usually failing by a beer or two).  But between not drinking and feeling like barfing 24/7, eating has become a challenge.  I've lost 8 pounds in the last month, which isn't negligible considering that I only weighed 120 to begin with.  I mean, I did want to lose weight, but not this way.

The following weekend was the weekend before Christmas...and suddenly something clicked.  Most of the side effects dropped off.  I no longer dreaded anything and everything.  I could feel my depression lifting.  It wasn't so much that I necessarily felt better; it was more that at my worst I was much more positive than what it used to be.  Amusingly, every once in a while, I would catch myself just being happy/upbeat for no reason.  My gut reaction would be to tell myself ""You can't be happy.  You're worthless.  Just don't even pretend.  You're embarrassing yourself.""  And then I would catch myself and say to myself ""What the FUCK, brain.  I'm going to be happy, dammit!""

But the most unexpected change was that my sex drive and my ability to become aroused came back. Things that I had thought were icky (such as making out or bumping uglies) now turned me on just thinking about them.  It was difficult to bring it up to my husband (especially because we were staying at his mom's house for Christmas), but after getting over that initial hump, we truly enjoyed ourselves for the first time in a very long time.  And we have continued enjoying ourselves and (re)discovering my sexuality and our chemistry.

Simply experiencing those feelings of arousal gave me a sudden clarity to the last 7 years or so of my life.  Up until age 18 or so, I was extremely naive and sheltered and cowed into sexual submission by my religion.  I didn't really understand that the nice things I was feeling was actually arousal.  And then, around 19, I became depressed.  The first symptom that I acknowledged was the asexuality; my feelings of worthlessness followed later.  My grades began to slip, and I didn't really want to finish my major (but I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do more, so I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did so).  Due to that progression/history, I had assumed that I had always been asexual, and my depression stemmed from that.  Now I believe that my brain chemistry changed around age 19, causing my asexuality AND the depression.

Anyways, about a week ago, I had another meeting with my counselor.  She was and is helping me change my attitude towards myself.  Even though the Wellbutrin keeps me from spiraling too far downwards, I still have a lot of bad thinking habits to undo.  I am happy now, but I still feel worthless.  She is also helping me relax in general (to quote Ferris Bueller, if you stuck a lump of coal up my ass, it'd probably be a diamond when you took it out in a week), mostly with different breathing techniques and mental processes.

Yesterday I got the results back from getting my hormones checked.  Everything was normal. (Insert wry smile here)  We also discussed ways to minimise some lingering nausea (neither of us wanted to mess with the dosage of Wellbutrin).

Regaining my sexuality has been wonderful. I feel whole and complete again.  But I still have a long way to go.  And my husband and I still have a long way to go.  Again, I'm not going to go into the gory details, but let's just say that [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1695he/have_you_had_your_hormones_checked_update_2/c7u0be5) hit disturbingly close to home.

The future: I am meeting with the gynecologist next week, and I will spare you those gory details :) unless of course they're relevant to asexuality.

My advice for those of you who are unhappy too: Persist.  In the past, I spoke with a gynecologist, three nurse/practicioners, and a counselor about my lack of sex drive, and none of them were helpful in the least.  And if this group of people hadn't been helpful, I would have moved on to another one.

He lives in London and I'm in Madrid, but he's Spanish and home for Xmas/New Year's. So I said fuck it after I received a message from him on a dating site. Sure, you're 27, I'm 22, we're both adults.

We walked around the Retiro, which is a big park here in Madrid, and saw some sights, the normal stuff. Hung out and talked by the pond. It was cute. He mentions the *teleférico* and I say ""can we see if it's open now?"" so we just up and left for Moncloa. As we get there, the last unit is leaving for the countryside, so we missed out. Whatever, nbd. He suggests a drink so we go looking around.

We find a place that neither one of us has ever been too, so we go in and start ordering rounds. It was dirt cheap, so we downed twenty beers between the two of us. But we were both very sharp and alert because we'd been there around two and a half hours total. So we walk to my house, which was about 25 min away. We go up to my room and start a little foreplay, which I don't mind, and he knew I'm asexual so it was no big deal — I still like touching.

But he flipped me over at some point and started to try bareback. For some reason — and I mean because of pure infatuation with this dreamboat — I let him. No condom. The only lube being his spit. My god I sound like a barbarian, but I enjoyed myself, as weird as it felt, especially seeing how much pleasure he was gaining from our rendez-vous.

Afterward, though, I could see he wasn't totally into it, and he said, ""fuck, we should have used a condom"" but neither one of us had one in the first place. I haven't fucked anyone since 2009, so why would I? I'm not into that… But he was paranoid and flipping out personally (definitely not letting me know how much that fucked with his head), and we went to wash ourselves.

When we came back to my room, he held me tight and apologized, seeing I was falling for him already, and reminded me in seven days he's back in London. Me? Well after he left (apologizing at least three more times), I took to my room and started bawling, really sobbing heavily. ""He fucked me,"" I said. ""I let him fuck me."" I did want it because I wanted *him* but I shouldn't have been so so so stupid in so many ways. When I can, I'm getting tested, and when I'm back home in the States, I'm probably going to a shrink because I feel so lost right now. I shouldn't be so *enamoradizo* and I shouldn't have been so goddamn reckless. I'm not going to get worked up over the potential for disease until I get any results but… I'm an emotional hot mess.

Also, sorry if this gets long. I've never been very good at being concise...

I'm a heterosexual female in my early 20s, and as long as I can remember I've never really felt attracted to people in a physical sense. I mean, I can look at a person and judge their appearance as ""attractive"" or not, but even so, there has never been a time where I've seen someone and thought ""My, what a pleasant looking man. How I'd love to have his penis in my vagina."" (Granted, I'm not sure anyone says exactly that, but you get the point.) 

My relationship experience is abysmal. I wouldn't say that I enjoy being alone, but it's always been the case that good friends were company enough, and while I always thought the idea of a romantic relationship might be nice, it's never been something I felt that I needed, so I never went out of my way to pursue one. 

Nonetheless, I started talking to/hanging out with a guy around April, and he's great. We share interests and have common traits, which is awesome, and he's never really pressured me to do anything physical, but all the same, I KNOW that he wants it, and the thought is just something that terrifies me. I'm not sure what my problem is. I'm afraid of getting pregnant (no desire to ever have children, which is unusual as well), but I realize there are many precautions to prevent that, so that's mostly paranoia. I grew up in a conservative household, so maybe this is a result of some sort of guilt complex they programmed me with so I wouldn't saddle them with grandchildren at an early age? 

It's so hard to explain, but sex is not an activity I can see myself participating in, and if I'm completely honest with myself, it's not something that I ultimately desire. I could probably die a virgin at a ripe old age, and it wouldn't bother me, except that I'm afraid that would involve living a sad, lonely life. 

I've expressed these concerns to friends before and all of them just tell me ""You'll find someone eventually you'll want to have sex with"", but I don't think that's the case. The concept of sex just seems like a colossal waste of time to me. I've even talked to my boyfriend about it, so he's aware of how I feel, but I think he just is hoping I'll give it a try and change my mind. Maybe I should? I don't know what to do. I want to make him happy, but not at the expense of my own comfort. Does that make me selfish? I feel like I'm broken, and I want desperately for it to be something fixable like hormones, but maybe this is just how I'm meant to be. But if that's the case, I may as well get ready to be a spinster, huh? I don't get the feeling there are many men with this affliction, and I can't ask someone sexual to deal with this.

I'm someone who's very open about and interested in human sexuality in... I guess the intellectual/sociological sense? I enjoy orgasms and masturbate relatively frequently, and some physical actions and kinks I find arousing, but aside from fulfilling those arousals when they occur, I have no real *drive* to have sex/orgasm. Usually I masturbate because I know orgasm will feel good, rather than out of any need. Adding another person to the equation hasn't really added anything to the experience, and I have very little desire to pleasure someone else. I'm not sure if I consider myself aromantic - I want to be someone else's Most Important Person, but I've realized I'm okay if this doesn't include any real physical affection if I have that emotional validation.

And I don't know if this counts me as asexual and/or aromantic 'on average' because most of my ace friends are *very* aromantic, zero interest in genital-involving activities of any form, little to no interest in physical affection, even on the 'common between friends' level, etc, and I know this leaves me with a kind of biased sample to compare against. And I know my fairly sexual, frequently poly friends are probably not a random sample either - but even comments from other friends like 'I really wish I had an SO :c' or 'I'm craving cuddles' or 'oh my god [actor] has the most amazing abs, mmmmm' are things I just... don't really get. Or empathize with, I suppose - I can understand where they come from logically.

I admit that the ensuing argument I started with this commenter may have been a bit off topic and based on a strawman attack, but the insinuation that something is mentally or physiologically wrong with asexuals just rubbed me the wrong way.

But I've just been noticing that this kind of attitude is all over reddit. I frequent a lot of fitness subreddits as I've recently gotten interested in improving my health and appearance. Unlike a lot of other people with physique goals though, being sexually attractive isn't one of my reasons for it. 

I guess it's just frustrating to deal with people who aren't aware that an alternative to being sexual even exists. I can't really blame them as a year ago I was the same. And I feel like ""coming out"" as asexual just opens you up to more of the ""something is wrong with you"" angle from people who don't understand.

The House MD episode a while back with the asexual couple didn't help either. This was around when I was coming to terms with my possible asexuality and I was excited at the premise but was disappointed when it turned out it was just another medical case.

I wonder if it is difficult for people to comprehend experiences that are vastly different from theirs.

Yet it is odd that the concept is so unknown. I hear many think that claiming to be asexual means you're gay...which makes no sense whatsoever. Apparently it is a problem for some of the Christian faith to accept, which I find especially odd considering how much focus on chastity and ""pureness"" there is.

-----

I'm a sexual male currently dating a gray/asexual woman. The relationship is pretty new, and all of this is very new to me. After fooling around a few times, (oral, etc.) my girlfriend expressed a desire to try having sex, and with patience and lube, we succeeded. She said, ""that was the least awkward sex I've ever had,"" and expressed enthusiasm for repeating the experience in the future. I know I'm not changing her or curing anything. I know that's impossible, and it isn't my aim. I am, however, excited to be part of her enjoying sex to whatever extent she can or desires to.

We had sex one time after that, and then I did a really really stupid thing. I drunkenly made a comment about how it would be nice for her to initiate some sort of sexual activity, since the nature of her libido generally results in us running a script where I make advances and she permits or denies them, which doesn't feel like the best consent in the world to me. She initiated a blowjob the next morning, which with the absence of arousal, was very unpleasant for her and resulted in her crying as soon as it was done. (I hate myself!) I didn't understand that this would be uncomfortable for her, because I'm a big dummy. I would have stopped her if I had realized what she was feeling, and I wish I could undo the experience. I had to leave for work shortly after, and didn't see her for a few days. Last time I saw her, she seemed uncomfortable making out for long periods of time, which isn't typical for her. (Thankfully she was still cuddly.) I'm afraid I ruined the level of physical comfort she had with me.

Obviously I can't really know how she's feeling without communicating with her, which I intend to do when I see her next, (we're both very busy) but I'd love to hear from other asexual people about how they would feel in her place and how they would want a sexual partner to behave after the events I described. I'm also hoping the anonymity of the internet may provide me with information she might withhold to spare my feelings.

Did I ruin this? I really like this girl, and as difficult as this is, I enjoy being with her much more than I've enjoyed being with sexual people. I'd feel horrible if this one experience poisoned our relationship.

   I found this subreddit about 3 weeks ago, and it was one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. I've never seen a group of people who were so kind and accepting, and I've never felt more comfortable than I have when reading the posts here. I want to thank you all, also, for helping me realize that I myself am a heteroromantic asexual. That being said, I'd like to share my ""story"" with you, as it's really all I have to give back to you at this point. Maybe someone out there will find something useful in it. 

   In middle school, I remember everyone being so obsessed with dating and relationships. I even thought relationships were cool, until guys tried to take things a bit too far with me. I got called a ""prude"", among other things. This wasn't too much of a problem, as I still felt I had my dignity. I gave up on relationships for a while. 

  High school came, and it was there that I started my most serious relationship. I started dating the guy who had been my best friend for a few years. By this point, sex was a common thing for the people I'd grown up with. My classmates were all having sex, and so I felt like that was what I was supposed to do. My boyfriend did not ask for it, but I still felt like that was what I was supposed to do. I'd never felt like sex was important, and I'd never been sexually attracted to anyone. I decided that maybe I could.... ""Fix"" it. So, I treated him, and over the course of about 3-4 years, I watched the relationship crumble. By trying to make the relationship ""normal"", I'd wrecked it. The whole thing was then kind of sadly duct-taped together with sex that I didn't even want, or like. How I managed to put myself through about 3 years of it, I'll never know. Of course, the thing crumbled. He got into hard drugs, I decided to go to college, which brings me to where I am now.  

  My mother expects me to have children some day. She doesn't know I've ever had sex. I'm sure she worries that I'm a lesbian, as I've been single for about 3 years now. Recently, I had a bit of a crush on a friend of mine, mostly because I knew that he wouldn't be looking for a relationship with sex involved, and he's a nice guy. Unfortunately, he also wants kids one day, his own biological kids, and I feel like starting a relationship with him would be pointless, especially after he rejected me. *shudder*

   My best friend is an attractive man. He's great, I love him to death, and I know he wouldn't date me. I'm okay with this. I just want to help him out through life however I can. 

   My family is very conservative. To them, marriage and children are the end game. I'd like to get married one day. I'm agnostic, so it's not the spiritual part of it that attracts me. I feel outcast at family events. Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas, and other family parties are very uncomfortable. Everyone else in the family can tell that there's something different about me that they don't feel comfortable with, but they can't place their finger on it. I'm sure they, like my mother, have assumed that I'm a lesbian. 


   I'd like to thank all of you again. I'd heard of asexuality before, but never really looked into it. Finding this subreddit by sheer chance was nothing less than a miracle for me. While I'm not comfortable ""coming out"" yet, I still wanted to get it off my chest. Thank you, you wonderful people. Go get some cake and smile, because you are all great.  :)

Update #1",unhappyace,26,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14p33m/have_you_had_your_hormones_checked_update_1/,"[""Have you had your hormones checked?"" prologue](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14k4ah/have_you_had_your_hormones_checked/)

Hi everyone! I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded to my preliminary post a couple days ago.  Everyone was very kind and courteous, even those of you who disagreed.

A bit more backstory:  My husband and I recently moved to a new city, so we've had to find new doctors for everything.  So the clinic that I found was through my health care's website Find A Doctor thing.  When I originally made the appointment, I glanced at their website briefly, then went ahead and made an appointment.

This morning: I get to the clinic, and I'm a bit surprised to find out that it's a clinic for low-income people, who may or may not have insurance (and may or may not be able to afford a doctor's visit).  It's also kind of an all-in-one type clinic, with lots of different types of doctors (optometrists, dentists, family practitioners, etc). So right off the bat, I'm a bit intimidated--I feel like I'm in the wrong place, or like I'm using up resources for people who need it more than I.  But it turns out that everyone was super nice and friendly.

I fill out some paperwork, and then a nurse-practitioner comes in, and we chat for a bit.  She asks me what I'm here for today, and I pretty much just say ""I would like to get my hormones checked, because I don't have a sex drive.""  She asks me how long this has been going on, *for as long as I know*, when was my last pap smear, *February*, am I taking any medication, *birth control, and I've switched it up a few times to make sure it wasn't this particular birth control*, anything else I want to mention, *[sexual anhedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_anhedonia)*, etc.  We talk about my sexual history, and how my relationship with my husband is in general, how much stress I have in my life.  She's very kind and understanding throughout the whole thing.

Pretty quickly, she agrees that I should get some blood work done.  She also mentions that she wants me to see a gynecologist, just to check it out.  They have one on staff at that clinic, so that's cool.  She says she needs to go do some stuff, but she'll be right back in the room in a couple of minutes.

After a few minutes, she comes back in the room.  She says, ""I forgot to ask earlier, do you feel depressed at all.""  Oh fuck, that's my magic cry button.  I admit I have felt a little depressed, yes.  ""How do you find it manifesting in your daily life?""  I tell her that's it not really that bad during the day, but at night, if I can't sleep, I just find myself telling myself over and over how worthless I am.

She tells me that I do sound depressed, and she asked me how open I was to medication and/or counseling.  I said both, and that I had been considering finding a therapist for a while.  She tells me that they also have a counselor at the clinic, and that she would like to put me on an anti-depressant.  I ask which one, because I know a lot of them absolutely kill your sex drive.  She agrees, and says, ""I'm going to put you on [Wellbutrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellbutrin ""no seriously check this out, it's pretty fascinating"").  It's a bit different of an anti-depressant, it doesn't usually have as much of a negative effect on your sex drive.""  She sends the prescription to my pharmacy.

So she wraps up, I thank her, and then I'm shuffled over to the lab, where I'm to get my blood drawn.  I've never ever had my blood drawn, so I was rather nervous.  But it was quick, and was less painful than an immunization, so that was over quickly.

I set up an appointment to meet with the counselor, someone named Sister Rosario.  I'm a bit apprehensive about this, as I'm a bit on the atheist side.  Oh well, it'll be cheap.  If she is a good fit, great.  If not, it'll be the kick in the pants I need to find a therapist that I like.

Last, I set up a follow-up appointment with the nurse-practitioner for after Christmas to discuss the results from the bloodwork and how the Wellbutrin is treating me, and I set up an appointment for later in January to meet with the gynecologist on staff.

I go home, then go to work for the rest of the day.  After work, I pick up the Wellbutrin.  I'm actually going to be taking the generic Buproprion.  For the next three days I'll be taking 150mg, and after that, I'll be taking 300mg a day.  A friend of mine who is no stranger to the world of anti-depressants, tells me this: ""If something like that [asexuality/no sex drive] is having really ANY negative impact on your life it's enough to take medication.  What it does, is give you the power to consciously control your own emotional systems.  And just to warn you, the first few weeks you are on it are probably gonna suck. Your body has to get used to it.  But once you get to that point it can make an amazing difference.""

So right now, I'm still processing everything that happened today.  It just felt like a whirlwind, and that things are moving fast.  But it's also nice, in that *I'm being proactive about my life* kind of way.  I'm currently sipping on a [beer](http://www.lefthandbrewing.com/beers/fade-to-black-vol-3), which will probably be my last until the follow-up appointment. :(

Depending on how immediately the effects of the Wellbutrin are felt, I may update either next week, or not again until after Christmas.  We'll see how things go.

tl;dr: Had blood drawn, set an appointment to see a counselor and a gynecologist, and will start taking Wellbutrin.

* in order to reach anyone they would have to be within a certain age range
* in order to reach anyone outside of the merely curious, they would have to already consider themselves in the queer spectrum

So what do I suggest? It's simple. We redo the AMA. But this time in a different sub. I say we go for the main two. /r/AMA and /r/IAmA would give us a better audience and a chance of finding those who are asexual or somewhere on the ace spectrum that may not realize it yet. Also we would need an even wider spectrum of asexuals and nonasexuals to help with it.

I think it could also be a good idea to contact the mods of /r/AMA and /r/IAmA about doing a joint one advertised on both, as well as the mods for /r/subredditoftheday ad see about whether or not we are up for a day of being an 'oftheday' to coordinate with the AMA.

Basically, I think I might be asexual. But it's not as simple as that. I'm attracted to all genders. But the idea of any kind of sexual contact, by myself or with others utterly repels me. I try to persuade myself that it's just boring, and I think it probably would be, because I honestly don't think I could (god, I struggle even typing this) get any pleasure out of the experience. 

I'm 23, and I'm female and a virgin. I've never kissed anyone. Around the time other people were losing their virginity I suffered quite severe mental health problems that I'm still dealing with today. Whilst my family was open about sex I have this real feeling of disgust and 'dirtiness' about it. It feels wrong, like I shouldn't be doing it or thinking about it. I'm not religious in the slightest, so I don't know where this comes from. It's just this feeling in my gut of 'urgh, don't do that'.

Also I'm terrified it'll hurt. It's odd, because I'm good with pain, but that sort of terrifies me. And I have issues of control. I don't want someone to have that level of control over me. It really frightens me. 

So basically, I call myself asexual and I know that's wrong, because it's not what you're about from what I've read. I can't see a therapist about this, because I can't take talking about this in real life.

But I want a 'real' relationship, and I know I can't have one with this hanging over my head. I'm not saying asexual people can't have healthy relationships, it's not that. It's this dichotomy between my head which says, yeah, maybe, give it a go, and another part of me saying, no, it's filthy. 

I really hope I haven't offended anyone with this, it wasn't my intention. Sexuality can be a minefield, and I've tried to tread as carefully as I can. I just want to know if I'm alone, or if anyone else feels like this, and how I can fix it?

Outside of that, I'm a repulsed asexual. I'm grossed out by sex. Even the thought of it makes me nauseous.

So, my best friend and I are involved with each other and operate polyamorously, going on 3 years now. I have had one recurring problem, though. When he has sex with other people, my repulsion of sex spills over onto him. I'm a sex-positive person who encourages people to explore their sexuality, so I can't help but feel ashamed that this is even an issue for me. He is his own person with his own sexuality to nurture, but I guess the fact that our sex lives are connected is triggering these reactions. I place so much value on being so entirely comfortable with him, so for me to have this disgust that affects that comfort is really difficult to deal with.

I don't want him to feel bad about his sex life. He's doing nothing wrong, and I want him to continue exploring and doing what feels right to him. He's unconditionally loving and supportive of me, and I'm worried about the effect my reactions have on him and how supported he feels in our relationship. He's already made a few comments here and there indicating that it *is* affecting him negatively (which is definitely understandable), so it's been the kick in the ass that I needed to seek advice from the ace community on how to approach this issue.

I told him to take his hands out of my jeans and that I didn't want that very clearly. He said ""My exes liked it, you will too if you give it a minute, I'm sure."" It took repeated requests and a kick in the balls to dissuade him.

I thought I was broken, and I really just wanted to be able to work like a normal person, so I assumed I was the one being weird.

So, for the past week or two I've been heavily researching asexuality, in a bid to find where I fit on the spectrum, if at all.  Since finding out that asexuality DOESN'T necessarily mean that you don't masturbate, want/have a partner, and so on, its felt rather descriptive of me.  However, a huge stumbling block in identifying as being on the asexuality side of the spectrum been trying to figure out exactly what ""sexual attraction"" is, and whether I experience it or not.

Since 'sexual attraction' is the ONLY aspect which defines asexuality according to AVEN, I expected to find a fairly uniform definition of it.  Instead I found various different interpretations of it, and that despite the 'primary/secondary' distinction many seem to have their own view of what exactly constitutes sexual attraction.

I got really caught up with this issue for a while, because I probably DO experience some form of sexual attraction, but at the same time absolutely NO desire for partnered sex.  I can tell someone is particularly sexually appealing, whether something makes them more or less attractive, and can feel a desire to cuddle with them depending upon those traits.  Only, the desire to actually have sex never pops up for me(inside or outside my relationship).  I could rename it 'sensual attraction,' or 'aesthetic attraction;' but between what I've read self-identified sexuals write, and the very definition of primary sexual attraction on AVEN(""may or may not lead to arousal or sexual desire""), it seems disingenuous to suggest that it is anything less than low-intensity sexual attraction.

So going purely by the definition, I do not appear to be asexual.  However, there is also the aspect of my sexual desire, which is pretty much nil.  While I don't mind it, and even enjoy it for various reasons(the chances to cuddle, making him happy, etc.), I have pretty much NEVER felt what I can really say is a desire to purely have sex with someone else.   I felt it once when cuddling with my boyfriend, but looking back that just kind of confirms that about 99% of the time I'm perfectly and utterly content to cuddle and stuffs.  In nearly a year of being with the love of my life, I've felt a desire to actually 'go to the next level' about once and don't mind at all when sex doesn't occur for a month(as long as there's cuddling and affection!).   That is not really what you'd call a sexual person's experience.

Eventually, I decided that the definition is indeed a guideline and not a rule, and am very close to identifying as a gray ace(just need some more time to solidify that), but I can't help but feel that the current AVEN definition doesn't very accurately reflect, acknowledge, or properly explain the experiences of a  fair number of asexual-identified people, for whom the question of sexual attraction is incredibly complicated.
 While there is definitely wiggle room, and an emphasis towards self-identification regardless of definitions; that is not readily apparent to anyone beginning their journey of self-discovery and who reads the short statement that  ""An asexual person is a person who does not experience sexual attraction.""

 [This post by Naosuu](http://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/77043-defining-sexual-attraction/#entry2235166) (titled ""sexual attraction debate 101"") is an excellent read, and a very eloquent enumeration of the issues I see with the current definition of asexuality/sexual attraction.  To get at the heart of it, I would suggest that a better definition is the one suggested in section **1.4** :

&gt;an asexual is someone who “doesn’t experience sexual attraction and/or who does not want sexual relations.”

Perhaps with an additional acknowledgement that asexuality is a spectrum, placed at the end.  **Edit:** I would also reword the second part to ""does not experience an internal drive towards partnered sex,"" since 'not wanting sexual relations' is a pretty broad description.

**TL;DR**: Does anyone else feel that the current definition of asexuality, put forth by AVEN, is in some way lacking?  If so, how would you improve it or how do you define it?

And as might be expected, all this rattling around in my head on a constant basis has landed me alone, again.  It's difficult because regardless of how much I love someone, and how deep my emotional connection with them may be, without sex it's assumed i don't really care.

I don't know where this was headed other than to finally get all of this out of my head.

Thank you so much.,Jake_of_all_Trades,21,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1gfiiq/from_the_deepest_depths_of_my_heart_thank_you/,"“*... it was because I had a blueprint of what I should be, instead of what I actually am and want to be.*”

Recently, I have taken another step in accepting who and what I am -- I am straight, I feel sexual attraction. Before now, I have always considered myself an asexual since middle school, and this was true, I WAS asexual, was.

This isn’t a “see, look you can change too” or a “all you need is time” post. I know in a deep and personal way that asexuality exists. It is a real ‘sexual orientation’*1 which can be confusing to be and confusing to those who aren’t. If anything, Growing up as an asexual can make you feel like you are disconnected from others (like many here probably experienced themselves). That realization creeps up on you, and when you realize that word ""different"" applies to you in a way that sometimes others won't understand, then it hits like a punch. Sometimes you attribute other words like, ""alone"". On good days you may call it, ""Unique"", on bad days, ""freak"". It isn't always easy being asexual because it is confusing, that is a fact. 

Some people have asked me in the past, “what is the hardest part about being asexual?” The hardest part is self-acceptance. This goes for many things in life, but rings louder being asexual. I believe being asexual  is more confusing than many other sexual orientations especially when you discover that it is a known orientation and that you really **aren’t alone**. Those who do experience sexual attraction have concrete evidence that they are something. As an asexual, you have to base the fact that you are something by *not* experiencing it. 

&gt; They [Asexuals] experience no sexual attraction for a great deal of their lives and this can separate them from their peers in adolescents because relationships are largely based upon sexual urges and cues.

&gt; Let's say that they look online to find that there are others that are asexual, who understand this orientation. Many of them don't have sex (or are repulsed by it), many of them do not have a high libido, many of them are aromantic.
&gt; This person sees this and constructs a social ""norm"" and attempts to fit into this norm. 

&gt; Then, let's say that this person then one day finds a person that they feel something different towards: 

&gt; ""But wait, I shouldn't want to be romantically involved in this, asexuals don't"" they think. 

&gt; As an asexual he/she still doesn't experience sexual attraction, but their libido kicks and urges them to please their partner: 

&gt; ""But wait, I shouldn't want to ever have sex, I'm asexual"" they think. Then they enjoy it, let's say, and that kicks them in the existential behind and they think, ""I shouldn't be enjoying sex, I'm asexual"". But the fact is that they can feel these things and the most troubling for them is that they do sometimes experience these things. When or if that does happen they feel lost because they aren't being ""asexual"". Many aren't informed the difference between sexual attraction and libido, many aren't informed the different types of attractions, and many are confused when they attempt to figure those things out.

For me, That is why I was very confused when I realized I was asexual but with a high libido, that is why I was confused when I found a person that I love, and why I felt confused on why I wanted to please them sexually; **it was because I had a blueprint of what I should be, instead of what I actually am and want to be**. That, however, is self discovery and you can only teach so much about the self, one has to experience it for themselves or in this case; not experience it. 

Most of all, I was more confused when I started experience sexual attraction. It was scary because I never felt such intense feelings before. I didn't *want* to be sexual, I felt like I wasn't myself. “*And, what*”, I worried, “*What will my significant other say? What will my friends say? They will believe I’m full of crap. Maybe I am, maybe I never was asexual and it was that I repressed myself because of some reason*”.

The truth is, though, I was asexual -- **was**. I’m not now, but I was asexual and there are others out there who are asexual and **always will be**, but I am not one of those. I’ve come to accept myself for what I am and what I do.

I have a choice accept what I am. You have a choice to accept what you are. If you try running from something that you are, it will haunt and hurt you. Hold those who accept you lovingly with dear closeness and ignore those who treat you with ignorant disdain.

Sure, some people will be understanding and fully supporting, others not so much. What matters is that you accept who you **truly, honestly, fully are** whether heterosexual, demisexual, asexual, transexual, or whatever. You have a choice to realize that your sexuality has zero impact on if your quality of character. If something changes about your sexuality then do not hide from it. Accept it as just something you are and realize that something you weren’t.*2 Also, you aren’t alone. There are many asexuals out there:

As quoted by /u/quo__vadis in a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1f6crw/she_was_one_in_a_million_so_theres_five_more_just/):

&gt; In fact, you might bump into one on the street and never know. Just run the numbers: one person in every hundred is estimated to be on the gray/ace/demi spectrum.
One whole percent:

&gt; * That's 708 million in the world today.
&gt; * 3.1 million aces in the USA.
&gt; * 110,000 aces play World of Warcraft.
&gt; * 82,000 aces live in New York City.
&gt; * 7,000 aces in the state of North Dakota.
&gt; * 6,000 aces in the city where I live.
&gt; * 270 aces ran in this year's Boston Marathon.
&gt; * There are probably ten in your big Psychology 101 lecture class.
&gt; * There are maybe five aces on any given 747 flight.
&gt; * Two or three on the subway platform, waiting for a train...

&gt; We're out there, all right. We're legion. Maybe not all of us know: maybe not all of us care. Education and outreach are important — the more people you tell, the higher your chance of hearing “me, too!” in return. That's something you have to decide for yourself. But please, try not to feel so lonely. We're out there. We're just on the down-low about it.
And /r/asexuality will always be here for you. They were here for me all this time.

1368571653.0,18,self.asexuality,1ecg6w,Does anyone ever long for understanding instead of the stereotypical relationship?,zoserintherain,20,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1ecg6w/does_anyone_ever_long_for_understanding_instead/,"I'm 22 and female. The reason I'm here is because I do identify as asexual, but I feel like it is a result of an aversion to the stereotypical relationship. I've never felt sexual attraction or desire for sex, but I think that's because that's just not what I'm looking to get out of life. I've been in a couple of relationships, in which I consented to the relationship because, I guess, that's what girls are supposed to want. But the romance wasn't appealing, and I felt that prior to and throughout my relationships, my main desire was to find a place of mutual understanding with another human being.

I attempted to reach this place of understanding through the romantic aspects of the relationships, but the more involved I became with these people, the less understanding I felt. We were bonding, on some level, but we fell into routines and a commitment to one another that we would never change. But we were, in fact, growing and changing people, and the more we attempted to ascribe to this person we were when we met, the more we restricted our changing feelings. Our individual lives became increasingly shrouded in secrecy, though we both denied it. And we did so for the security of the relationship - the security of, ironically, the illusion that we knew another person completely. We wanted to know our needs would always be met, and that we could rely on this other person no matter what.

But this always seemed to conjure feelings of obligation and restriction. The things we did to keep the relationship secure were things we essentially did for ourselves. We wanted to stay the way they wanted us to stay, and we wanted to, so that they would stay the same, too. We had to be the person they could count on, so they'd be the person we could count on. 

But it didn't feel like this was something we'd strive to do even out of respect for one another, and definitely not out of a mutual understanding. We aimed to be this way, to stay this person they ""knew"" us to be, out of a commitment to provide that security to one another. But I think that's where hurt feelings come in. We give and do not get, or we get knowing we don't have to give, and unless everything is equal in the relationship, we feel hurt. But things can't always be equal. We'd say we understood that our partner needed to spend more time on school or work than on being with us, but we felt neglected. We said we understood when our partner needed time to themselves, but we struggled with the feeling that we wanted to be with them.

I always strove for this place of understanding where I imagined we would just know that someone completely understands us, regardless of the actions they take. Where we can understand one another's life struggles and search for individual meaning, and be vulnerable about the fact that we just don't know anything about ourselves. I imagine reaching an understanding through this sort of shared vulnerability.

It's a kind of understanding that says, ""I don't know what I'm doing either, and I don't know who I'll be tomorrow. I might not even be here. But no matter where I go, or what I do, you'll always know me, and I'll always know you.""

It's not a commitment. It's not an effort to become something or someone, or feel or believe a certain way. It's like a mental companionship, I think, where we let down our walls and discard our facades to share in the fact that we're scared about life and about the future. We don't know anything about anything, and we don't have anything figured out, and we never will. It's a place where we share in this, in the struggles of daily life that we're led to believe should not be struggles. I feel like this is a place where we could unite as human beings, and a place where we wouldn't feel alone. 

To everyone else, we may still display a person that has everything figured out, the way we always had, because that's what people are supposed to do. But we'd know that somebody knows us, someone knows that we are always trying, always struggling, to do things right, to be what we should be, to get by, and find meaning for ourselves. When we make a mistake, instead of becoming angry at others or ourselves for our supposed inadequacy, we'd have someone who knows we really were trying to do our best. To have someone to admit that to, knowing they'd never think any less of us, because they understand our struggle to get by in the world, and we understand their struggle as well, seems so comforting. I think two people in completely different positions in society, one respected, the other not, could even unite in this way, because both would understand that both are afraid, and not as confident as they appear. 

But I think out of this develops a genuine confidence, a self-assurance at the point of admitting we really have no idea what we're doing. It's a confidence that comes not from knowing what we're doing, but becoming honest with ourselves about the fact that we have no idea.

I feel like I have always lived my life with this understanding, but have never found another individual to share in it with me. I see well-intentioned people and ill-intentioned people, but I feel like I understand the reasons for their intentions, and so I don't take things personally. Maybe I have a flawed perception of the world, but I feel like people do ""bad"" things when they feel helpless. I don't condone these things by any means, but I don't condemn the people themselves for committing them. I think they make decisions or take action when they feel vulnerable, and not having the control over it or over themselves that they feel they should. I often feel like having a place to honestly admit having no control would ease tension. A place where it's okay to admit our faults to people, because they understand and look for ways to help us help them, because we all understand that we are all just trying to do what we can to make use of our strengths for the common good. A place where genuinely giving all we can is always good enough, because everyone understands we are truly giving all we can.

Well, this got off track, but that is something I guess I've always believed possible. Certainly not probable, but I imagine a world like that working that way. 

But in the end, to feel that kind of understanding with someone else, seems like it would be pretty nice. To feel like someone understands that in me, too, would feel like the most secure companionship possible, even though it might not include commitments or the security of routines. It wouldn't be about sex or a need for someone to fulfill those needs. It wouldn't be a companionship based on emotion, even, or I don't believe it would be. Just a pure understanding.

I might be idealizing the possibility of this concept, but I have chosen not to pursue any other relationships, as I fear they will feel eternally empty. It's not about what you've done in life or will do. I don't know, it's not about the tangible experiences. I really do believe people want to share themselves and their strengths, and want to know it will always be enough, and having a companion like this would allow them to know that it always will be, to at least one person. I think it would encourage people to give all that they have, and become satisfied as a result, because they are not acting out of fear or anxiety about what others will think about them. They do their best to help make the world a better place, to make life easier, happier, for other people and to enhance their life experience and understanding of themselves, too. 

Again, I am looking at people as inherently good, but it just makes sense to me that they are. I feel as though neglecting to care for others or feeling disinterested in it has more to do with the fact that they know others will not appreciate it, because they won't understand us or our motivations, and if what we give is ""not enough"", we are shamed for that, instead of appreciated for our good will.

So, again I may have rambled and gone off track, but I'm trying to convey what I really mean by this, and not sure I'm doing an effective job. Does anyone understand what I mean? Does anyone think it could be possible? Perhaps not on a large scale, but between two people? I am totally open to any alternative perspectives, or discussions. I think a lot about this on my own, but think it would be interesting to know the way other people think about this as well. I thought I might have some luck here, since it seems like asexuals are generally not seeking the stereotypical relationship, but if you have any suggestions for another place where this would be more appropriate, please let me know. Thanks. :)

Basically I've never told anyone.  I'm not ashamed or anything like that, but I just didn't want people to treat me differently.

In December I was visiting a close friend from high school, and he admitted to me that he had wanted to ask me out for two years back then but never worked up the nerve (but insisted he was completely over that now).  We kind of laughed about it and then he asked me, ""But seriously, why have you never had a boyfriend?  Not even now that you're in university?""

I felt blindsided--I was sick of lying at this point, but I wasn't ready to come out, so I just told him ""I don't really want to talk about it, I'm not ready yet.""  He went silent for a bit, but dropped the subject, and we moved on.

Last night I saw him for the first time since then.  He never brought it up, but eventually we got onto the topic of heteronormativity and LGBT issues, and I felt that now was the time, but I got really nervous and  ended up going on a ramble that eventually ended in ""...and if I had to define my sexual orientation, it'd be asexual.""

He just said ""Oh,"" and was quiet for a while.  Eventually he said that ""Actually, that makes a lot more sense.  I thought last time we talked you were hinting you were gay, and I couldn't really imagine it.  This fits you better.""

And that was it!  He asked a lot of questions after, but was pretty open-minded, and I am so thankful.

My name is Dominique and I'm a reporter with The Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dominique-mosbergen/). I'm currently working on a feature piece for Gay Voices -- our LGBT advocacy and news page -- about asexuality. 

In particular, I hope to explore two broad questions: What is asexuality? And -- what are the challenges facing the asexual community? 

Within that, I hope to explore other questions regarding an asexual's coming out process, about role models, about relationships, about puberty, etc. 

Broadly, this is a profile piece. Specifically, this is a report that I hope will raise awareness and dispel myths. 

For my piece, I'm planning on talking to a wide variety of individuals -- from advocates, to academics, to medical professionals, and everyday people. 

I thought I'd send out a plea on Reddit to see if anyone would be willing to talk to me -- preferably on record -- about what it has meant for you to be asexual, or to have known/be in a relationship with someone who identifies as asexual.

At that age, I found out that my friends were discovering porn so I went and found some on the internet. I find it odd that I never connected porn to masturbation and didn't start masturbating until after I turned 21 when I found out that I was the only one in my friends group that had never done it. 

I found that I can still arouse myself using my dominance drive for masturbation purposes, but I just don't understand lust. I have tried pretty hard by surrounding myself with people who feel a lot of lust to see if I can learn the feeling through observation and copying but I'm beginning to realize that you can't really teach yourself lust.

The media has done a great job at telling me what is physically attractive and I can pick out hot from not in both genders equally based on degrees of separation from body and facial features displayed in print and television. 

I've also found that if a woman can evoke a strong emotional response from me, that I can use that for arousal as well. This has only actually happened once. I would gladly have sex in exchange for the type of companionship I've seen in some of my friends' relationships. I have had multiple occasions where I've had a girl in my bed and just couldn't bring myself to care about getting laid. I was lonely and starved for companionship but really didn't have any feelings for the girl in that situation.

I believe I am romantically attracted to women over men because I have a strong desire to one day have a kid to raise so it seems to be a more pragmatic option. Just kissing a guy was enough for me to confirm I'm not just gay. Also, since I'm pretty sure I learned attraction from the media, it should follow that I would end up straight.

We knew each other for about two months before I initiated our relationship, and during that time I thought it was clear that she loved me too e.g. we would spend hours together talking late into the night, nearly every night of the week.   When I told her how I felt, her reaction was not like I expected; she acted as if she had no idea I felt this way, and at first she said ""no"", but a few days later changed her answer to ""yes.""  

Two weeks later, she initiated sex, to my total surprise.   Being asexual, I had never thought of wanting to have sex with her throughout this time, and it was certainly not my motivation for initiating our relationship (my motivation was romantic love, I wanted to be closer to her, to have a unique role in each others lives, to have more personal intimacy).   She was a virgin, but didn't even tell me.

As our relationship continued, she was always the one initiating and pushing for sex.  This went fine because I always said yes, because it feels good; it's just that I never spent a minute wanting or looking forward to sex.   About 6 months in I got some skin tears on my penis, and these were taking forever to heal, so I said we couldn't have sex for a while - we never got the routine back after that.

Our relationship had other problems.  We both had fairly major mental health issues - me having bipolar disorder and being in the closet about being transgendered, and her having ADD / brain fog and episodes of alcohol induced mania.  This double co-dependency and lack of sex led her to break up with me.   She secretly dated / tried to date the friends I had introduced her to, and our whole social scene was such a mess that she ended up switching schools and moving away.

We've gradually reconnected through email, and now we are good friends again (talking on the phone for hours...).   I'm out of the closet and transitioning, she has been through rehab many times and is back in school.   I didn't know about ""asexuals"" and ""aromantics"" back then, but in retrospect I was asexual (maybe that will change from my transition, but maybe not), and she was aromantic.   I say that because, though for a long time I thought she just wasn't into me, she used to say things like ""sexual attraction has nothing to do with liking someone intellectually, I'd want my partner to be a guy version of a bimbo wife.""  In fact, she has been with the same guy for the past few years, and she seems happy enough with that but it doesn't sound like love.

I'm still very much in love with her, but I doubt our relationship will ever have a physical component; I'm still an asexual, and while I'm becoming a woman she has always seemed thoroughly straight.  I'm not jealous of her boyfriend, but rather happy for her that he fulfills that role better than I did.  I think she has always had the same romantic feelings towards me as I do towards her, but she calls them by a different name (she says we're ""really close, special friends""), and for her the feelings never got confused with sexual attraction.   She doesn't believe that I'm asexual, because in her mind I pushed a physical relationship on her, and to her physical relationships are all about sex.   Going back and talking about this stuff is a delicate issue for us, because it was painful, and because of how far we are from seeing eye-to-eye about what happened.   For now I'm resigned to just enjoy our friendship, and fall asleep every night thinking about how much I love her.

I tried to get into all kinds of weird fetishes, but my orgasm was always really weak. I eventually figured out that the porn I watched didn't do anything for me and it was just the rubbing that did it. Outside of my weekly masturbation sessions I never thought about sex. I thought there was something wrong with me, so I guess I was trying to force myself into sexuality. Then one day I found out about asexuality, and how it's okay to not like sex. ""I'll give this a try"" I thought, and didn't bother trying to masturbate. Three months later the thought still hasn't crossed my mind. Now I'm secure and very happy in my asexuality.

I've thought before (I mean, lots of people point it out) about how often Hollywood et. al. feels the need to introduce a love triangle or some sex desire into otherwise perfectly interesting characters.

This constant barrage of sex drive on TV enforces the idea that everyone must be running around with sex as their number one priority. It can be rather disheartening to watch such stories all the time, as I'm sure many of you aces can agree.

Until now, I've only shared bits and pieces of the story with various people, so consider yourselves exclusively privileged! Warning: it's kind of lengthy, and there may be a detail or two some of you won't appreciate, but typing this out helped me, and it might even be different enough to interest a few of you.

I'm a 21 year old male, and I never really considered the possibility of asexuality until a year or so ago. Being in college and getting forced out of my shell on a regular basis, I was gradually succumbing to the pressures of sex and dating that were routinely imposed by my peers. It may or may not surprise you, but my experience in these areas was exceedingly limited compared the people I hung around with. Usually I was able to keep my callowness fairly low key, but as many of you have come to know, social pressure can become pretty overbearing at times. I ended up meeting a girl on a dating website who was really into me, and after talking to her for a while, she agreed to meet me for dinner and spend the night at my place. We ended up watching a movie and cuddling together, which I enjoyed quite a bit, but naturally, she wanted to take it a step further. At this point, I had only ever had one relationship and a couple sloppy sexual encounters, but I figured it would run more smoothly this time around. We ended up having sex several times, as she was quite enthusiastic about it, but I simply couldn't derive any shred of enjoyment from the activity. This just left both of us feeling incredibly confused, and made her very inadequate. Needless to say, we didn't meet up again. 

It wasn't long after that when a friend of mine obtained what he proclaimed to be unusually strong LSD. While I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about drugs, this particular substance had intrigued me for a long time, and I figured such an opportunity would never come up again in my lifetime. Describing exactly what happened would require an entirely new post, but there was one thought that stuck with me during my trip: I had a decent amount of sex recently, as society expects of men in their 20s, but I didn't enjoy it one bit. Conversely, I had just taken a very illegal drug for which many people would stigmatize me, but I was having the time of my life. This made me ask myself: why am I taking advice from a society full of people who don't even know me when the only person who really understands me is myself? I concluded that sexuality was a continuous, multi-dimensional spectrum, and while it might be convenient to view it ternarily, it was unreasonable to blindly accept that as absolute truth. I decided the most accurate label for myself would be ""asexual"", which to my surprise, turned out to be a recognized orientation with a strong internet community! After I sobered up, however, I started to second-guess myself, as I wasn't particularly thrilled with the idea of incorporating a drug-induced epiphany into my life. I went back and forth for a good year or so, wondering whether I was really ace or straight.

More recently, I met a girl at a party who legitimately interested me. Not even in a sexual way; I just found her beautiful and intelligent, felt surprisingly comfortable opening up to her, and naturally, I wanted to get to know her better. The next week, I invited her over to my place for the sole purpose of hanging out; I wasn't expecting or wanting sex, although I did contemplate the possibility of this turning into a relationship over time. And at first, we were both having a great time. We were cuddling, watching TV, and having fun getting to know each other, until I completely killed the mood. We began cuddling more intimately and kissing, and I could only assume by this point that she was expecting sex. I was perfectly content as we were, but at the same time, I really cared about this girl and didn't want to disappoint her. But before long, the inviting look on her face turned to fear. We stopped abruptly and talked things over, and thankfully were able to bring back the amicable mood from before. But I never got around to telling her that I was uncomfortable with the situation too. This moment still pisses me off somtimes, mostly because I hurt someone I cared about, but also because I succumbed to the trite belief that men are supposed to want to fuck everything that moves. Nevertheless, I try to treat everything as a learning experience, and this time, I realized that sex was not for me, and that the only reason I second-guessed my orientation in the first place was that I was afraid. Afraid of the stigma I would get for identifying as asexual. 

I still have yet to come out to anyone in real life, but just being able to finally admit to myself that I'm asexual has made me feel much better about life. That being said, I sometimes feel distressed when I consider how minuscule the intersection of people okay with drugs and people okay without sex must be.

Anyway, we have been dating for 5 months in high school (both juniors). We both think she is Ace, as she has never had any desires to do anything more than a peck, but is willing to make out every now and then to make me happy. We are very happy in that regard, I'm happy with the pace we are moving physically, and try my best not to pressure her. 

We are hanging at my house for a movie date, and we decided to watch the Princess Bride as she had never seen it before. Great movie! Anyway, as we are watching the movie, we are doing some (sensual) fooling around. Just kissing and cuddling, a tickle here and there. We have some personal conversations on sex and fetishes and such that no one really needs to know but us. Near the end of the date, she stands up to brush her hair so no one suspects we were fooling around. This is where it gets surprising. I stand up, and hug her. Couple kisses. I pick her up, and she wraps her legs around my waist for support. This is pretty normal stuff for us when we are alone. Then, I decide to put her down on the couch with me on top of her. We then, spontaneously, without any talking, have the most intense kissing session I have ever had. That happens for about ten seconds. We stop, get up, look at each other, and decide to try again to see what happens. For Science! Anyway, we repeat all the steps to recreate it, and we have a kissing session that knocks the last one out of the park. We both start rubbing our bodies against each other, kind of furiously. We are essentially dry humping for about 2 minutes. This is from a couple who has never gone past second base. We are both getting off on this. There was some genital on genital action going on, separated by clothes. Just so you guys don't think I misread anything or forced this in her, she was just as enthusiastically rubbing as I was, and actually a bit more intense with the kissing. When we pull ourselves off each other, we are both panting, and she whispers ""that felt really, really good"". I’m dumbfounded. As is she. We are now both kind of confused as to what this means. Previously, we both thought that she would never want to do this. She is kind of scared; she has never had sexual feeling like that. We both had impulses to go all the way in that brief moment. Afterword’s, she thought she was a slut for doing that. I was able to convince her that she was not, and that she just felt sexual for the first time and doesn’t know how to handle the new feeling. I also tell her I would support and try and help her understand it. Looking back on it after 24 hours, I am perfectly happy to try again and see what happens, But she wants to wait an unspecified amount of time before trying again, because she isn’t emotionally ready to try again soon. And I am perfectly happy with that too; I am not pressuring her to do anything she doesn’t want. 

So basically, what our question is, how? We though she was asexual. She still feels asexual now. But in those collective 5 minutes, she felt just as sexual as any other sexual person. She kind of wants to know how to deal with it too. Does this mean she isn’t asexual? Is she Demi? We just do not know, and were hoping you guys could help us out, because we are both confused.

for me rather than do anything with other girls.
(Of course I corrected him and explained the difference with celibacy)
and he still assured it's fine, he'd be celibate for me.
Then he added: ""Besides, I dated a nympho for 3 years. I'll be okay""
That made my stomach turn. I felt really physically ill.

He apologized and said that he shouldn't have and is not sure why he said it but it happened and I can't get over it.
I'm perfectly okay with people having as much sex as they want 
and talking about it freely but this just upset me more than it probably should have.

(A few months ago, his relationship ended with his first love, a girlfriend of 3 years and he mentions her quite often which is understandable) but this was just way way more
information than I wanted to know and it caught me off guard.
I just never expected to hear something like this from someone so nice and sweet.

I remember when my past boyfriend used to point
to random locations while we were driving and say ""I had sex there"" or
a much worse option ""I had sex with her"".

All of my lady friends at one point had this happen to them.
It is supposed to show superiority? Am I supposed to be impressed?
Why do men always do this? and why did his comment upset me so much?

I am a heterosexual male. Back when I was a horny teenager I would sometimes think about ""what if x happened and I was never able to have sex?"" The thought was horrible to me. Sex was one of the things I thought of as a major objective in life. 

Then later it just stopped. The question popped up in my head again. What if I died a virgin? So what? It no longer bothered me. Then not only that, I saw sex as something 'in the way' of other things in my life. 

I still have a sex drive, but when I masturbate it's not a recreational thing, I just do it to get rid of the momentary sexual arousal and get back to whatever I was doing. Essentially I see my sex drive as a burden.

I feel the same way about romantic love. I prefer having a lot of friends to having one person I'm super close to. I've been in love plenty of times, but always hated it. I never wanted to date the girl I had feelings for, I just wanted to rid myself of it and just go back to being friends/acquaintances. Dating's just something I've never had interest in.

I've considered chemical/surgical castration for years, but there are two side effects I'm afraid of. One is the chance of depression. I don't suffer from depression but I'm a mostly introverted person and I like to spend time alone, and I don't know if that puts me at more of a ""risk"" for suffering from depression. Another is the decrease in cognitive function/spacial reasoning ability from the lack of testosterone. I'm trying to get a job as a software engineer and I don't want a side effect that could potentially interfere with my ability to do such a job.

So far anywhere I've mentioned this I've been told it's just sour grapes because I ""can't get any"" or that I have some problem. Is there a group of people who feel this way? Like I said, you guys seem like you'd be the most sympathetic, but I'm not asexual.

For instance, I had periods of feeling asexual, very on the fence about it. Like, a friend will point out pretty people (oh, what a cute girl) and I'll agree on a cerebral level, but it's more of a 'eh, okay' thing. And it was confusing the hell out of me. Like, I was going 'Do I have a type? What is it? I can't think of any features I like or anything, particularly…' 

I was labeling myself asexual or thinking it a libido thing with some periods of *distress* of being seen that way. Like... I would be okay with being asexual but not aromantic and I had some strife where I thought people saw me as both those things.

I've only ever come out to a few close friends but it always marks the start of a downward decline in our friendship.

I'm totally fine with that being who I am.

I have some of the best friends I could ever ask for, friends who got me into asexuality and are totally cool with who I am. They're the best people I've ever met, and I love them as much as I can actually love people. I'm never happier than when I'm with them.

But they have sex drives and romantic drives and they're getting in relationships, and I know it's selfish but I have a bit if difficulty accepting that there are parts of them that are closed to me and that they have people who, just as a default, are going to be prioritised over me, and that's okay, because it makes sense and I'm fine with it.

Right now, life is awesome-I'm doing well in school, spending lots of time with my friends, having awesome hobbies, enjoying life-if things were to stay like this, than there isn't any way I could be happier.

But I'm scared about the future, about when proper jobs and careers and moving in with romantic/sexual partners occurs, because when everyone else pairs up, I think I'm just going to be kind of left, that, just by my friends prioritising their relationships over their friendships, everyone's focus will be elsewhere and people will just walk out of life.

Even if I make lots of effort to be seeing them as much is reasonable, I think I'm going to be alone an awful lot. And that's scary.

I'm not letting myself feel too bad about it, because it's in the future and might not even happen and I'll essentially be being sad that my friends are in happy relationships, and I'm not going to let myself be that selfish.

I just don't want people the way they want me, but I do want them a lot, and the future is scary.

I found [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org) back when I was about 14 or 15, and breathed a huge sigh of relief. It’s okay, I’m just different. There are other people like me. Other people understand. Being a romantic, it was a little disheartening to think my dating pool had been so severely cut, but it was okay. 

When I was 18 I started looking at people with interest. It was weird, and different, and I still couldn’t relate to friends very strongly. All my friend knew I thought of myself as asexual, but now what? Was I never asexual? Was I just a late-bloomer? I quietly withdrew from the asexuality community.

Looking back, asexuality gave me a place, a label, and support of my feelings. The commiseration of others surrounding the same issues I was having was a huge relief. Nobody told me I had to change, or was wrong for feeling like I did.

Change is OK too. Maybe I was a dumb teenager donning a label before reasonable, but, it never felt like that, and it isn’t really helpful to think of it like that. If things start to change, be kind to yourself and take your time. Labels aren’t meant to box you in, but to help describe. I don’t even really feel like I’ve changed all that much. 

I’m not trying to invalidate anybody else’s status by acknowledging my own changes, just to help those that suspect they might be “turning sexual”.

So, here's a question that's been on my mind. I'm a 28 year old male and I've only had sex 4 times, all will ladies. Similar to a lot of posts I see on here, I found it boring, had no sex drive, ect. I'm pretty comfortable with the fact the sex with girls isn't for me. But...

I have never been with another guy. I don't particularly feel a desire to, but I'm a scientist and also usually believe in trying things at least once. I dunno, maybe it's just societal conditioning: don't like girls? Must be gay. That's a horrible way to think, but there it is. Anyway, to get to my main question:

**I'd like to try out having sex with another man. How would one go about that?**

Hook-up a bar? Feels like being dishonest. Here's a weird pick-up line ""Let's have sex, but I probably will hate it."" I'm a first timer but not a closet gay coming out or anything. Seems all around awkward. Also, this may sound weird, but I sort of don't get gay sex. What does one even do for a first time, trade blowjobs?

Okay, so enough of the gross sex talk. In addition to my specific question, I thought it'd just be interesting to discuss the idea of sex with both genders, since I'm guessing a lot of aces immediately get the ""So you're gay?"" question after they come out and tell people they don't like sex. And this question applies equally to both sides (had sex only with opposite OR same gender, but not both).

Post-script: I see a lot of younger people post on here, and just wanted to say congrats for starting to work ""feelings"" out at a younger age. Clearly from what I'm asking above I'd say late teens / young twenties is a great time to experiment if you're feeling at all inclined. And my two cents of life advice: There is SOOOOO much more to life than relationships/sex. Music, travel, food (cake!), awesome lifelong friendships. I think a deep, loving couple relationship is a great way to go about life, but it isn't the only way and it certainly isn't the only ""right"" or ""best"" way.

How can I get it to stop?,HippoGoggles,19,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/10wb6f/people_keep_coming_on_to_me_how_can_i_get_it_to/,"**TL;DR:** My friend is a God damned pervert, and randomly exposed himself to me. My other friend is constantly expressing his ""love"" for me; and I have no interest in sex. How can I get this shit to stop?!


I am a 21 year old girl. I've never wanted to have sex. The idea just repels me for some reason. Sure, I've had crushes on people before, and have wanted relationships... but I'm not sure if it'd be the best thing for me. I usually get over these crushes relatively quickly if I don't see them going anywhere; and even if they DID, I don't think I would ever want to have sex. So it's probably better I just don't get involved with anyone romantically at all; and I'm totally fine with that. I've got friends, and people who care about me, and all the social interaction I need.


Anyways, onto the second part... I have always been guarded when it came to sex. I just didn't want to be involved with it at all. Sure, I'll joke about it and everything just fine. But when people start getting personal on me, and asking me a bunch of sex-related questions. I just close up. I don't want to talk about it.
But recently, it seems that's all people want to talk to me about! 2 of my friends in particular. One of them has just admitted to a crush on me, and I told him I didn't have a crush on him, but I thought that it was cute (so I wouldn't hurt his feelings). And he's been telling me that he ""loves"" me and stuff, and has been hugging me constantly... It's starting to make me uncomfortable, but I don't want to hurt his feelings by telling him to stop.


Then the other one. I don't know what the fuck my other friend's problem is, but he's just gone WAY over the line with me. He constantly asks me questions about what kind of porn I watch. If I find big penises attractive. How I masturbate... Like, what the fuck. Mind your own business. Then he makes inappropriate comments, like he's going to ""masturbate on my face"". But he says it in a joking way. And I make it OBVIOUS that I'm uncomfortable. I ask him to stop, but he doesn't! It's so fucking frustrating, and I don't know what to do.


But worst of all is what he did a couple nights ago. We were talking on Skype, and like usual, he would begin asking me all these questions. I told him I was uncomfortable but OF COURSE he would keep pushing it. Then, at some point in the conversation he said he was leaving to have a shower, and I said ""alright, bye"". About 20 minutes later or so, he fucking walks back into the room COMPLETELY NAKED! I was shocked. That fucking image is embedded into my mind, and I don't know what the hell he was thinking. He just said, ""I don't even care right now"". As he was walking into the room, and I was just stunned... How could he possibly think that was ok!? Especially to me, who has on SEVERAL occasions told him that kind of thing makes me uncomfortable!? I'm just, not furious, but uncomfortable as hell! I can't fathom what would have been going on in his head.


He also says that by asking me all these sexual questions, that it will gradually ""lower my inhibitions"". Well, seems like his inhibitions are low enough for the both of us! And why would he want my inhibitions to be lowered anyways? Why can't he just respect my point of view? It makes me completely uncomfortable to speak with him, and definitely to be in the same room as him. Not to mention that he KNEW our other friend had a crush on me! I don't want to get involved in this shit, and I don't know what to do.

Obviously that hurt. While attempting to meet people and be social I wanted to be honest about this right up. None of my friends from high school and none of my family know that I'm asexual. I tried to tell my mom and she just laughed at me and said it doesn't exist. Honestly, this was the last straw for me. I might as well just go back to pretending I want sex. AUGH. Sorry, just ranting...

What should I do? Should I not have said anything and told people later? Or maybe should I never tell people? I don't really know. I'm new to this whole telling people that I'm asexual. I feel like they would have reacted better if I told them I was a lesbian. Seriously.

My boyfriend wants more sex and I want none, though I'm not about to demand celibacy in our relationship. We maybe have sex once a week or once every two weeks (thus, the ""I want more sex"").

Sex is somewhat difficult for me; I approach it very analytically, I can't just ""get lost"" in the moment. It's stressful. Sex isn't even that pleasurable (I suppose masturbation feels better, to me.) 

But, I want to make sure there's a compromise, and I've been open with my boyfriend about my asexuality. (Oy, tonight he told me, ""I don't want to feel bad about wanting to have sex."", and I told him everyone has always made me feel bad for just the opposite. :/)

I figure that, for there to be a compromise on *having* more sex, we need to restructure sex so that I am actually getting something out of it (because it's always been 100% stress).

So my question for those of you who are sexually active, due to partners and whatnot, is what do you do to make sex more approachable? What do you and your partner do to make sex enjoyable?

I was thinking of maybe making back massages and playing-with-hair part of the ""foreplay"" (since actual foreplay doesn't do much for me).

However, I am interested in finding out if anyone has experienced what I'm experiencing, as it seems to not be the usual case.

From reading many of your posts about discovering asexuality (and aromantic..ality?), the common story is that people felt something different from the beginning. Most say they never saw themselves being able to be with another person, but they didn't know why.  Then they discovered asexuality.

I'm interested in the romantic half of the ~~label~~ person, though I guess it could apply to the gender half as well.

**^&lt;Optional ^Life ^Story&gt;**

I haven't heard of any stories of ""putting it off"", though.  I went to a small high school in a small town.  While the setting has its own allure, my opinions and lifestyle didn't belong there.  I never really wanted to look for a partner, but I figured that once I was able to be out on my own, I could find someone to be with.  I assumed that I was going to find someone.

I passed my 21st birthday a short time ago, and I'm in college.  I love it; it satisfies the need for me to escape, form and keep my own opinions, and a world where I believe I could settle down for a while.  It also happens to be the place where I ran out of excuses to not go out looking.  Actually I have a little inkling in me that DOES want to find someone.  But it's an inkling, and one that doesn't have to be satisfied.  Also, I've looked around at people and asked ""Could I be with this person?"".  Never answered yes to that question, even with the personalities that I admire the most.  I still feel like I""m running under the assumption of it will happen eventually, but until then, I'm perfectly fine being on my own.

**^&lt;/life ^story&gt;**

I'm a 24 year old guy, and I think I may be asexual. I've had issues with sex in the past with girls, so I just flat out assumed I maybe was gay. I haven't field tested it, but after constant back and forth trying to find myself I realized that I don't actually want to be with a guy. So I'm back to square one. 

So the issue with girls is that I just never really want to have sex, I love women, and being around girls, and flirting with girls, but I'd rather just cuddle with them than actually have sex most of the time. I hate it honestly. It's frustrating, because I know sex feels good (i've had a few partners, but nothing really compared to when it was with my girlfriend of a long time), but I still am never in the mood. (even tried nofap thinking it was that, with lackluster results).

Fast forward to a little while ago. Whirlwind romance with this girl, and I can't even exaggerate that. Within the fasted month and a half of my life I've completely fallen for this girl. Not only is she absolutely amazing personality wise, shes hot. But still, I don't feel the drive. She's jokingly called me asexual (and I told her I've actually considered it). The weird part is, I almost feel like she is too, but I'm scared to actually talk about it with her.

I'm not sure what to do, I've even been taking Horny Goat weed, and DHEA trying to boost my hunger and testosterone hoping for anything to work. I'm just frustrated, because I want to please her but I'm just never really feeling it. I love touching her and feeling her body, but I just never really want to have sex, I just like being with her.

...I don't know what I'm asking for, or what answers I'm looking for---I'm just totally lost, full of anxiety and frustrated that I'm not the person I want to be. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it more than you'd know. Thank you if you read it this far.

I've never been interested in sex. Even as a hormonal teen, I never really cared much about it. Wasn't really interested at all in dating girls to be honest (not boys either). I've been in a few relationships and I've had sex with two different women. The 2nd woman I had sex with was really sexually active and would get extremely mad with me because I was never really in the mood.

See I don't mind pleasing someone sexually. Even with my current g/f of 6+ months I don't mind getting her off. It's just when anything comes to the attention of me, I just get weirded out. She's tried giving me oral and handjobs and I usually just go soft because it feels so weird. She said she was ready to have sex and I think she wants to this weekend but I'm not at all interested. I mean I can try to get her off but I won't be into it at all and that's what upset my ex. It really pissed my ex off when she couldn't get me to climax. So I'm not sure what to expect with the current g/f.

Hell I don't even really enjoy kissing but I'm told I'm good at it. I guess I don't mind it because it makes my g/f happy same as I don't mind pleasing her in whatever way I can. I'm happy that she's happy but I get no sexual pleasure out of it. I mean I get hard during it but it's not like I actually want to put it inside her.

The weird thing is I do masturbate quite often. But I'm never thinking of sex when I do it. I'm usually reading stories about mental or physical transformation and pretend that's me in the role and that excites me and gets me off.

I've been lurking around reddit for a few weeks now and I've just stumbled across this subreddit. Sexuality is something I've been struggling with for a while, and this seems like a great place to put my thoughts down into writing without having to worry about fallout by showing it to people I know. I'm not really sure what advice I'm after, but I think writing something here will help me get my own thoughts straight.

I've never really paid any attention to anything sexual. As a teenager I never watched porn, never masturbated, never understood the 'checking out' girls...it just wasn't a part of my life. I had a girlfriend in my mid-teens whom I was with for a few months but she broke up with me because she didn't think I seemed interested. I just couldn't understand why she thought that...we'd talk frequently, spend much of the school day together and I'd spend as many weekends with her as I could. I've only just thought back on that relationship as I started writing, and suddenly it makes sense to me why she broke up with me: I simply wasn't showing her much interest sexually at an age where I guess I should have been mad for it. But it never progressed beyond a bit of groping on the outside of clothing.

At university I never did the whole sleeping around thing that TV shows seem to associate with college. I never felt the urge for sex, or had any interest in dating to get sex. I think I always figured the characters on TV sitcoms were a parody or exaggeration about how much people desire sex, but after reading places like this I'm beginning to understand they're closer to the truth than I thought. I was with a girl for about 7 months in my third year, and yet again I couldn't go the distance. It was during this relationship I was first given the 'opportunity' to play with my girlfriend's breasts but I just didn't get why I would want to. It was being presented to me as a reward or gift or something...I don't know, something I should be thankful for. But it didn't arouse me in the slightest, and I just felt I was doing it for her benefit only. When it came to progress beyond that once I backed out because I started to feel sick. I'm not really sure if it was because of something I ate. I told myself that but I'm not so sure any more.

Fast forward to two years ago, after I finished my undergrad. I started a relationship with a girl I've known since I was 13, and though we're living several counties apart and struggling with the long distance thing, I love her and we're making it work as best we can. However, about a year ago she had a mini-breakdown of sorts because although she knew I love her and cared about her, she didn't know if I found her sexually attractive, largely stemming from the fact that we haven't had sex. I tried reasoning it through in my head and I tried to convince myself and her that it was just because I was a virgin and so nervous about the whole thing that I wasn't initiating in case I screwed it up and embarrassed myself. We never really confronted the issue again, though I can tell it still affects her sometimes, and I feel awful for not being able to help her.

More recently I think I've come to terms with the fact that despite loving her I don't find her (or anyone else) sexually attractive. And I know I have to tell her, and after reading some of the other threads around here I know I have to give her the option to leave, even if its painful for both of us at first. The trouble is, I know it'll hurt her if I say that to her, no matter how I word it, and I can't bare to do that to her. I just can't be a reason to make her cry. And I'm terrified of the fallout.

Can anyone here relate to my story? I doubt the start of the story is uncommon to people here, but how about my current situation? It's weighing more heavily each time I see my girlfriend, and I'm feeling a bit lost for what to do, even though I kinda know what I have to do. Does that make sense?

I am homoromantic asexual — I have a strong attraction to chubby guys and I'm not afraid to admit it. I do get aroused but I have never entered a sexual situation where the other participant can actually ""get me off"".

I feel sort of stuck. Boiling down my sexuality, I know I'm not attracted to sex but I still masturbate. I don't know how to answer the questions ""why do you masturbate?"" and ""why do you have physical preferences if you don't want to fornicate?"" The closest I can come to explaining these things is that (a) masturbation just feels good — it's a stress-reliever and regardless of the fact that I don't want to have sex, masturbation releases chemicals in the brain which calm you down. This rationale is immediately dismissed by sexual types, but I really can't garner a good reasoning otherwise. (b) I'm only human — I may not want sex but I don't want to be with someone whom I can't look at up and down and say ""I like that"". People tell me that's still rooted in sexual attraction, but I'm not so sure. I want a man who can hold me and make me feel warm and comfortable without needing to turn me over and fuck me sideways.

I know it's a common issue/problem for asexuals to have to explain these things, but I'm fresh out of explanations and to be perfectly honest, the few people in my life who do know of my asexuality are highly curious and cannot wrap their minds around my lack of constant desire to be or to penetrate. Likewise, they can't understand why, if I don't want sex, I still enjoy self-stimulation.

Does anyone have a good analogy or something that I can use to at least attempt to express my gray-A-ness? I'm drawing blanks here and it's just getting more and more difficult to cope with when the subject comes up. I'm tired of being mislabeled or having my own understanding of my body completely dismissed by others. I know I'll never get full concordance with my friends and family over this, but I need some way to have the discord surrounding the subject to even partially dissipate.

**Am I an asexual?** I know you get these posts a lot and for what its worth I'm sorry to have to add on to the pile of them. However, none of you ever seem to mind, and, in fact are always helpful about it. I've read most of the FAQ on AVEN's site some and have browsed several posts here trying to glean some information but it seems like everyone's case is different and mine is no exception. Unfortunately, there's no way I can make this quick, it's a lot of information.

**First, a small introduction.** I am 22 years old and still a virgin. I've been ""heterosexual"" since puberty and only recently come to the conclusion that I may be an ace. Since the maturing ages of my puberty sex was pretty much my first priority, top of of the list. Having no luck finding a romantic partner, much less a sexual partner, I did start to become discouraged. I'd say it was maybe when I started college that I came to realize that sex actually isn't a huge deal to me anymore, though at this time I was unaware asexuality was actually a thing so I assumed I was just a heterosexual with a low sex drive. It didn't take long for my other hobbies and interest to become more important to me than my quest to lose my virginity. Though I have to admit that a small part of my aversion to sex is fear of the unknown. I can't assume this, but I think that a persons first time always has at least some form apprehension to it. Or not maybe I'm just weird. So my first point is this: Can I really say that I'm an asexual even though I haven't experienced sex yet? Can I have an opinion on something that I don't actually know? Finally, is this a sign that I may be an asexual or is this just my brain trying to rationalize that fact that I'm 22 years old and still haven't had sex?

**On to my next point,** let me talk about porn and fetishes. Porn is a huge part of my life. I read copious amounts of erotic literature (doujinshi and fanfiction mostly), I actually write prose erotica, and I enjoy masturbation quiet a bit. Porn has even become something of a culture between me and a small group of friends. I've found that I've gravitated more towards hentai and other drawn forms of pornography. I don't think that I have a high sex drive even though I do enjoy masturbation, I tend to think of it more like a massage, just something to bring pleasure but I can't be sure I don't really know how hormones and ""sex drives"" work (I mean I have a vague understand of biology but I don't really know the specifics). Is it possible for an asexual to have a high sex drive but just not want to share it with another person (basically autoerotic, I guess would be the term)? Can you be autoerotic and asexual? Lastly, if you find yourself ""sexually attracted"" to things that don't exist, what would make that make you sexually? (Not saying that I am actually sexually attracted to anything but I've explored that possibility that I may be sexually attracted to art, as confusing as that sounds)

**Let me be absolutely clear** on that last question. Yes, I get off to anime girls and no I don't get off to real girls (well I do switch from art to actual porn, seldomly and randomly...I wouldn't say I'm attracted to any of the irl porn that I watch). If (and its a big if) I were to be sexually attracted to anime girls that don't exist in real life but not sexually attracted to real girls, what sexuality would that encompass? Would that still make me hetero even though the thing I happen to be attracted to doesn't actually exist and if they did probably would no longer be attracted to them.

**In conclusion,** I believe that I may be an asexual but I just can't be sure. At the very least I think that I may be a heterosexual developing asexual. I know that sexuality isn't really something you decide and something that rarely changes but I think that if I keep on like I am I'm bound to be an asexual if I'm not already there. So, r/asexuality, thank you for your time and your help.

1333803708.0,14,self.asexuality,rxszu,Just came out to all my friends,DoctorWheeze,17,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/rxszu/just_came_out_to_all_my_friends/,"...so this seems like a good time to make an introductory post. Is that customary around here? I'm doing it anyway.

A little background: I realized late high school/early college that I wasn't attracted to women, so I concluded that I logically must be gay. I came out as gay sophomore year of college, which was very exciting for everybody. Started attending meetings of our campus LGBTQQA (not sure if the A was for allies or asexual, btw) group and attending dances and other events.

Yeah, that didn't really work out very well either.

I eventually just sort of petered out on going to events (I always found the dances uncomfortable). At some point I learned that asexuality was a thing. I found it tremendously comforting that there was even a word, though I don't think I started really embracing the idea until about a month ago.

Somebody posted a ""Gender and Sexual Minority Megathread"" on, of all places, [a My Little Pony message board](http://www.mlponies.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1155). He mentions asexuality by name in the OP, so I felt compelled to finally just come out with it. My first post is on the second page, if you want a longer version of my story (and I think there was some good discussion on the next few pages too).

And then I started coming out to my friends. I went for my gay friend Jon first (he was also the first person I came out to as gay), and then a few of my friends that live around here. For the past week or so I've been drafting a Facebook message to the rest of my friends. I spent about an hour just hovering over the send button yesterday. I got a few supportive messages from them, which is about what I expected. They're good friends. This hasn't really changed anything about my life, but I do feel good finally getting this out in the open.

The next step, I guess, is to tell my parents. I don't think they'd be unsupportive - my mom has told me several times she'd be okay with me being gay - but I don't know if they'll understand. They've never pushed me into relationships or bothered me about grandchildren, so I'm grateful for that. I don't want them to think that this is something that will make me unhappy, or anything like that. If anybody has any advice re: that, I would appreciate it.

Reading some of this board and the stuff on AVEN's website has been great for me, so thanks for that. It's great to read something and think, ""I've had that exact thought.""",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,False,,,True,t3_rxszu,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/rxszu/just_came_out_to_all_my_friends/,

But I have tried to post questions before an lost my nerve and deleted responses and questions.  I don't have a good answer why.  I am no anxious by nature.

From the time I hit puberty I always had a sex drive.  Well, that is to say I find women attractive, and I maturbate, but when it comes to sex I could care less.  In fact I could care so less that I had problems getting and keeping an erection for sex since my first date.  I am married now, and have kids but have been celibate for at least 2 years.  And I don't miss it and the thought of having sex is nauseating at times. 

My doctor said I have low testosterone.  So we corrected that.  It made no difference at all and my levels are normal now and have been for nearly five years.  I went to a therapist at the request of my wife and she said I was a sexual anorexic.  I stopped therapy when part of the solution was that I needed to start making time for sex.  I can't make time for it, I can't manage to keep it up very long before Im just ready for it to end.  Its not painful I just feel out of place doing it, even if its feeling good.  Nothing makes your partner feel more awesome than losing the erection mid stroke.  

But after lurking here and reading allot I'm actually allowing myself to entertain the idea that maybe the way I have been my entire ""adult"" life (started in teens) is normal.  Maybe something isn't wrong with me that no one can figure out.  Maybe I'm not a freak, or as my wife put it, sexually broken.  

I need to talk to someone but have no one to talk to about it.  Ask me any questions you want.  Under this guise I have no problems answering them.  Has anyone else ever been told they were sexually anorexic? I wasn't sexually abused.  Religion was strict but sex was considered beautiful within the confines of marriage.  I had one girlfriend before I got married.  I crave and love romantic affection but will not do it because it always seems to lead to sex.

I lack any kind of sexual attraction to others. you all know how it works. 

I experience aesthetic and romantic attraction, and I would consider myself a heteroromantic. I've been dating a girl for a year, and she's also asexual, believe it or not.

I enjoy the usual asexual stuff, such as cuddling and holding hands and all of that. I am not *overly* physically driven, but I do enjoy and appreciate it as a wordless expression of the love and affection I feel for my partner. It's the same for her. 

We're very open and honest about things in this area, so we've been able to grow with each other. About 6 months ago we started briefly kissing goodnight, which has slowly evolved into us ""making out""(a loose definition, there's no sexual touching or anything involved, just kissing for extended periods of time) more frequently as we both got more comfortable with each other. It's slowly gotten less and less awkward as we get better at it, and we both thoroughly enjoy it. As this has happened, the intensity has gradually ramped up from just gently kissing to something more involved, more passionate. 

I have disliked the idea of french kissing for as long as I've known about it, as has she, so that doesn't come into play. However! Last night we were kissing and such, but we ended up doing it for much longer than usual, and a bit more intensely than usual. And I noticed that she was using her tongue, albiet subtly. It was just sort of there and involved in the kissing, ha. We stopped, and kind of chuckled, and she said ""I apologize if you felt like there was tongue, because there probably was."" I laughed and she then said ""Sorry, it just... sort of happened."" I asked her how she felt about it, she said she wasn't sure. I said whatever I felt didn't bother me. She laughed and then we resumed. 

After a moment I pulled back and asked ""do you want to just, like...?"" and what followed was not subtle at all. we were full-on using our tongues, and I enjoyed it! it was slobbery and definitely weird but not in a bad way. there's something more intimate to it than just lips meeting, which I now understand. thinking about it now, putting your tongue into someone else's mouth, or vice versa, is bizarre and weird. But in the moment it sort of clicked and made sense. it was an interesting experience. I was surprised with myself and with her, and also with the experience itself. I think it's likely to happen again. 

I have been revolted by the idea of tongues being involved in kissing for years and years, and when I found it to be one of the more common traits of asexuality I wasn't surprised. but now that I've done it and enjoyed it, I have mixed feelings, I suppose. and it's still really really weird. I mean... tongues??
has anyone else had an experience similar to this?

3. If you said you're dating someone who isn't an asexual, how do you handle that? Are you in an open relationship? Do you fear the day they eventually can't contain their desire for sex any longer? 

4. If you're in a relationship, do you feel that you love the person? Like, really love them? What does it feel like? 

5. If you're in a relationship, what do you guys do together? How often are you two with each other? (Or more, if you're in an open relationship. It doesn't matter.)

6. How did you meet the person you are dating? Online? Real life? 

7. If you're dating a sexual person, do they know you're asexual? If they do, when did you tell them? How did they take it? Has anyone ever broken up with you after you told them? 

I think that's all I have.... :u

When I was a younger child, I may have thought kids my age were 'cute' and but nothing more. As I hit puberty, I noticed the minds of my peers becoming more and more sexually driven, but I seemed to remain the same, thinking that perhaps I was somehow 'delayed' or something to that effect. But as most here might guess, I never took on a 'sexual attraction' toward my peers...it all seemed very foreign. Often, sexualized talk and jokes would make me uncomfortable, not because I think myself to be a prude, but because it didn't resonate with me. To this day, that has not changed. 

I guess my point is, mentally, I feel as if a certain portion of me never departed from the innocence and naïveté of my 10-year old self. Granted I've become wiser and have gained life experience, but on the whole, I feel as if in some peculiar way I've retained so called 'childhood innocence'. In pondering this idea, interestingly enough, I've noticed that the characters in movies and stories I connect most with are usually either idealistic / 'free-flowing' adults or children.

Thus I have been wondering how much of a connection asexuality has to it all of this. Has a lack of a 'sexual perspective' in this world perpetuated innocence? 

So, am I alone or does any of this ring true for any others here? 

(Hopefully this doesn't read as crazy, I swear I'm not *that* crazy! :P I'll just blame it on the hour which I decided to try and type all of this out if it does.)

I'm a male, 20 year old virgin, and I'm more than ok with that. I don't exactly know where I would lie on the spectrum of asexuality, but I'm beginning to think I may indeed fit somewhere on that spectrum. While I'm not really out to label myself one way or another, I'm at the point where I feel like I need to at least talk about it, even if it's not to anyone I know personally, to help me understand myself better. 

I've never been in a committed relationship, but I still believe that's something I want down the line (I wouldn't consider myself aromantic). In what was the closest I've ever been to actually having one, I wasn't really sexually attracted to the girl, and I kept that from going anywhere serious because I realized it wouldn't be a very viable relationship (issues with dissimilarity in personalities, interests, and so forth). I also didn't resolve that in a way that I'm particularly proud of, but what's done is done. My point here is that I don't have a good indication of whether I may or may not be demisexual, and while I obviously can't expect anyone to make that call for me, I figured it might be worth mentioning for background.

Anyway, questions!

1. Do you masturbate? If so, how often, and do you enjoy it in any capacity? Do you ever masturbate when bored? And do you utilize porn if/when you do?  I can say that personally, I tend to with relative frequency-- in fact until fairly recently I was pretty consistently masturbating every day or every other day, now I'd say I do it maybe 2-3 times a week. I certainly can't say I've done it exclusively to meet bodily needs-- I've done it out of boredom before, and it's not as if I find the sensation unpleasant.

2. For those of you in relationships with sexual partners, even if you're just tolerant of sex in general, are there any sexual acts that you actively enjoy, or is it a far more general disinterest? Thinking about it, I have to say that I cannot imagine myself enjoying most sexual acts-- the one possible exception being oral. Even then I'm certainly in no rush to experience it (or any other sexual act)-- at least not unless I'm heavily invested into a relationship (in which case I can imagine myself being generally compliant with whatever my partner wants).

3. For those of you who are romantic, how/when do you broach the subject of sexuality with prospective partners? Do any of you who are romantic refuse to have sex? (I would imagine this would inevitably lead to seeking an asexual partner, is that the case if you answered yes to the previous?) If you do have sex with a sexual partner, do you at least enjoy being able to give them pleasure?

4. Perhaps most significantly, when did you realize you were asexual/demisexual/whatever you consider yourself? Did you recognize something was different at puberty, or maturity, or did you realize after your first sexual encounter?

I guess my one worry is that I can't really know if I'm asexual without having experienced sex... part of me is concerned that I'm just making excuses for my lack of any intimate life and/or my personal insecurities in general. So I guess my last meta-question would be about that: based on your experiences, and what information I've given, is that likely to be the case? Given the opportunity, should I ""try it"" to find out?

No matter what, thanks for your time, and thanks especially for giving me a place where I feel comfortable at least expressing these thoughts and questions! (and even if nobody bothers to answer, I feel a bit better having just typed this out in the first place)

Edit: Thank you all so much for your responses! Also, even though I didn't really think it needed to be said, if you're not comfortable answering any of the questions, don't feel obligated to! (yes, I'm talking about #1). I hope I've made noone uncomfortable in this regard-- I'm only here to learn about myself, certainly not to judge or challenge anyone.

I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this - I think I just wanted to get it off my chest or whatever.

Anyway, my life story:

When I was with my first boyfriend I identifed as asexual, and was terrified that I might be a full-blown aromantic as well. The reason for this was because I wasn't sexually attracted to him and didn't fall in love with him, so I figured that's just how I was, read a few ace blog posts, identifed with them, and went on my way.

Eventually ""I found the right person"", and long story short I am now polyamorous and my sexual orientation flows like a river between hetero, homo, and demisexual leaving me to identify as pansexual. 

I've met a few asexuals and always want to say to them, in a sort of ""I know about your identity and can relate to you"" way, ""I identified as asexual for a number of years and now I don't because I found sex and love, but I also know that this must mean I was never asexual in the first place and I don't want to invalidate your identity because I know it's real and people don't take it seriously"". But then I wonder if it really helps.

But yeah, despite my very oversexed lifestyle now, I identify a lot with the asexual community, have a lot of sympathy, and would kind of like to hang out at meetups or whatever (assuming I was welcome as a non-asexual). And I'm wondering if this little fact about my life is something I should just hide away?

tl;dr: How do you feel about people like me saying that they identifed as asexual for a number of years? Would you rather I deny my former identity because it plays into so many ace stereotypes, or keep it because it strengthens my connection to the ace community or something?

(semi-long, maybe tmi)",,14,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/zwzf2/heres_where_i_am_having_trouble_with_being/,"Throwaway alert, I don't really want my friends reading shit like this from my usual account. 

So I'm coming to terms with being somewhere in the gray ace spectrum. I still don't really know what I am but I think homoromantic gray is the best I can come up with (I'm a 20 year old guy in college). Just a little background to help explain my situation better: I have been in love before, and that was coupled with some sort of ""sexual"" attraction meaning that I could get aroused by this person physically and I didn't really mind the idea of having sex with him, even though sex itself really doesn't do anything for me, because I was so into him emotionally. I basically would have done anything for this guy. Aside from that, I have had feelings for a few others, but it's usually pretty far and few between. I can get physically aroused by certain elements of a person's body, but any type of sex really generally is a huge turn off. I have never fantasized to anything actually sexual in my life, all fantasy and arousal typically comes from just the way somebody looks and no sex organs are ever involved. I do not watch porn ever (naked people generally turn me off big time), but I do have a libido that I tend to regularly. 95% of the time I want nothing to do with either touching another person or having another person touch me in any way. 

So as I said, I do get feelings (sometimes very strongly) for other people. But aside from that one guy I fell head over heels for, I haven't and couldn't really see myself getting sexually intimate with anybody else (at least not anybody that I've met thus far). The attractions/crushes are pretty much just emotional, even though I think these people are very aesthetically attractive in a physical sense. I want to be close to them emotionally and physically (as in hugging, kissing, holding hands, cuddling, etc..), I want to share myself with them, I want to show how much I can care and have somebody care about me and show me that they love me. So basically the more typical romantic elements. My problem comes in here: I get depressed whenever I start to like somebody because I don't think that I could ever do anything for them in a sexual sense. I don't want to start a relationship with any of these people because I know that I couldn't deliver on the sexual end, and I would not want to have to put that ""burden"" (I can't really think of a better word) on them. It just doesn't seem fair to them at all. I can't be like, ""Hey, I really like you and think you're cute and want you to go out with me, but oh hey yeah we probably can't have sex, sorry."" I want better for them. I almost feel better when I crush on an unattainable straight guy because I know that there's no chance of that happening. But when I find out a guy I like might be gay, I feel terrible because it's like he's so close to being somebody I might be compatible with, but still behind a barrier of some sort. 

Anyway, I am still trying to sort myself out, I don't really know what my deal is and so far I can only say that I identify more with the ace community than the typical LGBT community. If other grays/aces could maybe give me some insight on how they maybe dealt with a similar issue that would be much appreciated, I am a little tired of getting sad whenever I like somebody because I still feel like even if they like me back, I probably can't give them what they need as a sexual person. And that's really frustrating. I'm not against having sexual experiences or anything, it's just extremely rare that I feel like it's right for me or it's something that I want.

In reality, they sort of *are* heatheresque, and I end up feeling like a (much less violent, much less vindictive) Veronica with them sometimes. They tend to bicker over who's more of a *hottie* or why they think a professor is flirting so much with a student. It can honestly be very entertaining to sit through, especially because I'm at a language school (and in theory I'm typing all of this to you in Spanish [of course!]) and to hear the occasional Spanglish ""creeper"" or ""eww"" slip into a conversation gives me the giggles.

Anywho, one night I was with the group having a few drinks before heading out to a party. For some unknown reason, one of the members of the group is drunk enough to say to another, ""Ω*, I bet you have a great dick considering what they say…"" referring to his height and his considerably large hands. He ends up sharing with us the length and girth of his member. I remember rolling my eyes as everyone got excited to share their own statistics and those of their partners.

When it came down to my answer, I replied, ""Frankly, I have never felt the need to measure myself. I'm also asexual so…"" and I shrugged. Expecting some sort of utter fascination with my ""condition"", I awaited the typical *""wait, you don't like sex?!""*; *""are you a virgin or something?""*; etc.

But in fact, I was greeted with a much more lax attitude. The original target of the question looked me in the eye and shrugged, acknowledging my statement with a simple ""OK"". The lead Heather and I had already had a brief talk about my asexuality before, and he said it's sweet my partner doesn't mind (which I know could be viewed as passive aggressive but he did say it with the best of intentions). The rest of the Heathers carried on talking about whatever the next inane subject was for the night like nothing happened.

**TL;DR: I was quite contented with the neutral response I received from my peers when they discovered I'm asexual. There was no second-guessing my statement nor any sort of prying.**

We've been dating for a few months, and it's fantastic. We talk all the time, we understand one another perfectly, are on the same page nearly all the time, it's wonderful. We've been getting more sexual lately, but I've been getting very frustrated with it because I feel like I'm not getting aroused by it and by him like I feel like I should. I very much enjoy kissing and cuddling and light petting, but once things actually get sexual, I don't really feel much. And this causes a lot of anxiety for me because I feel like such a freak because I'm not turned on etc, and leads to me getting into a depression for the next few hours at least. But it's mostly the fact that I'm not feeling things the way I feel I should be rather than the actual absence of stimulation. I enjoy pleasuring him because I like the sounds and faces he makes, but it doesn't turn me on. It's more fascinating and interesting and entertaining than arousing. 

I'm also very interested in sexuality as a thing, I love to educate myself on it and listening to positive sexuality podcasts and reading blogs etc etc, but it's just when it comes to me that things don't really work out. I was thinking that it may be because of shame because when I was younger (preteen/early teens) I was very interested in pornography etc, but it was still more of a curiosity thing than a sexual thing. I still have a sex drive, but I don't enjoy masturbation and when I do, it's more of a chore more than anything else to get the feelings to go away. I know that I've wondered on more than one occasion what it means to be aroused, it's that foreign to me. 

My boyfriend is fantastic and is more than happy to roll with it if it turns out that I am asexual and is okay with putting more sexual things to the side, and right now I just want to figure out what's up with me.

Over in /r/aspergers, the topic of atypical sexuality came up, I shared pretty much the same info I will now and got some interesting answers. One person suggested I post over here about it and I decided why not?

So, I think I'm Asexual. However, I have a fetish, and quite a weird one too. And the fetish is for a part of the human body, a part that is generally considered unattractive, but still a part of the human body. No it is not a foot fetish I'll say right now, it's something a lot less common. Just establishing that it's far from a normal fetish, as I feel that's an important detail. I get turned on about things related to this fetish, but if the fetish isn't involved there is no sexual attraction whatsoever, and even when it is there's no desire any sort of sexual contact with another at all.

I also have a crush. I can say with utmost certainty that this crush is a real serious crush. Yet despite this, there is no sexual attraction. Romantic attraction there's a lot of, she has pretty much all of the things I'd look for in a woman (Intelligence, adventurous, enthusiastic etc. ). In fact, I actually had a dream about her recently (I don't mean to come off as creepy, and I really hope this doesn't. If it does it is not my intention), and in this dream there was 0 sexual themes or acts of any kind. There were however, limited romantic acts, but the fact they were limited is more because of the topic of the dream rather than anything else. Is this something that would be common for Asexuals?

Next, and my last point. I am definitely straight with my asexuality. What I mean is I believe I would really only have that romantic attraction towards a female (I am a male). However, when it comes to things actually involving my fetish I am most definitely bisexual. Male or female doesn't matter, if it involves that fetish it turns me on.

So, any comments? Help maybe? Do you think I sound like I may be Asexual? Really I'm looking for feedback of any sort, so any would be appreciated. Thanks for taking a moment to listen to me go on about things!

EDIT: To clarify, I know having romantic attraction without sexual attraction is common in Asexuals. My question of would this be common is more is the dream thing common.

EDIT 2: Just an additional detail I wanted to add, even when looking at things pertaining to my fetish I prefer the tamer stuff.

I'm a 21 year old girl and I need a bit of advice...
A couple months ago, I found out about asexuality, before that, I had no idea it even existed. The very idea of sex has always repulsed me for as long as I can remember, and I've been in a couple uncomfortable situations that have, I think reinforced this feeling. (i.e a guy forcing his tongue down my throat, or better grabbing my crotch at the movie theater.)
I've heard people say they thought I was gay, and that was the reason for my lack of sexual desire, and some kept bringing it up and at one point I even began to question myself... but now, I think I have it partly figured it out..

Anyway, I've been with this wonderful guy for almost a year now, and he's really the best guy I've ever dated; he's funny, he loves food as much as I do, he's caring, intelligent, and I know for a fact he loves me very very much, and I feel the same.
Lately, he's been really irritated, due to lack of sexual activities, is the reason according to him. He's been bringing it up more than usual and complains about the fact that all his friends are getting some and rubbing it in his face.
As a result, I'm feeling extremely guilty about all this, and I have no idea what to do. I mean, I enjoy cuddling, kissing and all that fun stuff, but I don't ever get aroused for any reason... Like, if I see an attractive person, my thought is ""ouuuh look at that pretty face, I wanna kiss it and take it out to a nice dinner and treat it like a proper lady, and maybe watch a movie or play video games!""
I talked to my best friend about it, but she doesn't seem to be able to get in my shoes, because she's sexual. 
So, I figured I'd ask you fine people about this, since you're in my situation... Any aces out there currently involved with non-aces, and if so, how do you deal with it?

This was great for a long time, my life was totally fulfilled, I loved a lot of people and I had a lot of people in my life who cared about me.

But, I don't think this can work long-term. I realised today I'm missing something from my life. I don't have anyone who truly loves me, anyone who would make me a priority, or anyone who would make an effort for me. I've got plenty of friends, and a few close friends which is great, but I just don't feel like I'm receiving a lot of love out of that.

I'm starting to think I want someone like that, someone that will be there for me, that will tell me they love me, that cares, that will make an effort to make me happy. I think I'd really like that.

And, I think the only realistic way I can achieve that, is through sex. I'm a really open asexual, but I think it's time to start going back into the closet a bit, at least until I get a relationship going. I might go for a polyamorous relationship.

I really don't know what to do. I'm torn between respecting myself and giving him what he wants. Having sex is not exactly unpleasant, but I just don't want to have sex.

OK so this girl (lets call her C) and I have been more or less involved for about a year and a half now. 

We met and hung out maybe once or twice before we went on maybe one or two dates before we entered into a relationship with titles and all that. (You know, the kind you can update on Facebook.) It had been awhile since I'd dated anyone and when I used to, I'd always move so slow that the girl would think I wasn't interested and would move on. I didn't want that with C so I asked her to be BF/GF very quickly. (Like within a month of hanging out.) While we were a couple we were very honest that neither of us was very experienced (both virgins) and the goal was that we could learn things together. I was easily the one who pushed for more sexual things in our alone time but it seemed that she enjoyed some of it too. After a few months she broke things off unceremoniously and we went a month or two or three without talking to each other much, if at all.

 In that time apart, I lost my v-card in a one night stand with an old and very good friend. A little bit after that C and I started spending more time together but just as friends. That went away on New Years when she crashed in bed with me and we mildly (drunkenly) made out a little. Since then we were moving more and more into a friends with semi benefits relationship. This past summer we even went on vacation together and spent nearly every second of every day together and were thick as thieves the entire time. 

Over the course of our relationship though she has become more and more reclusive and eventually decided that she is perfectly happy (more or less) with being a shut in/crazy cat lady and has figured out that she recognizes herself as an Asexual. She says that it is very rare she has sexual desires or even ones to kiss/hold hands/cuddle/make out. And if/when she does get a little excited it stops at her brain. For whatever reason the wires to go from her brain feeling horny to her body enjoying sex do not connect properly. Whenever she tries to get sexual with those feelings, it feels weird and uncomfortable. So much so that she can't even enjoy masturbation and has never gotten close to orgasm due to this brickwall. She also never gets/feels overly emotional about things. It's like those things just do not compute.

Well this past week we had a ""talk"" and I laid my cards on the table about how I feel and what it is I want. (I really and unfortunately am in love with her and want to find someway to make a relationship work.) To me it seems like she's giving up and sticking in her comfort zone and not trying to grow as a person. She says she feels jealous of others when they talk about sex and love cuz she can't bring herself to get past that horrible feeling of sexual acts and intimacy. All that makes me think that there is a part of her that wants it too but she just needs to connect the wires in her brain to make that ""click"" and push through the brickwall. Although on the other hand, if that's REALLY how she feels who am I to say otherwise. I love her and wouldn't want her to change who she is but at the same time I want her to be happy.
(And I want to be happy.) 

The end of the conversation was that we would continue seeing each other as friends and whatever else lightly-sexual things she felt comfortable doing. But I let her know that I planned on finding a way to make a relationship work between her and me. Perhaps finding a middle ground that could work for us somehow. 

All I know is that when I was younger I always was in a relationship for the goal of sex and losing my virginity but once I did (and not gonna lie, it was pretty great) I now realize that just being around her makes me feel 100 times better/more excited/tingly/pleasurable than sex did. 

I don't know if we can make it work but I want to hope we can or at least put up a damn excellent effort.

This question just popped into my head while I was reading. I'm absolutely aware that answers will be hugely varied - but I'm just interested!

I gathered from the responses to some questions I asked on here earlier, that a majority of asexuals still enjoy romance - the focus being much more on companionship and shared experienced, as opposed to a strong sexually physical connection. 

A lot of fiction, both films and books, have romance as a main plot or at least an important sub-plot. The physical and mental attraction of the characters is often a key element in drawing readers/viewers in and forming a close bond with characters.

Does your asexuality have an effect on your enjoyment of said fiction; a difference you've noticed in comparison to your hetro/homo/etc-sexual friends?

I'm starting to wonder if I might be asexual. I guess I started to wonder when I first heard the term in a couple years when I was 15 or 16, because back then I felt the same way about sex, but I dismissed it because I was young and never had a boyfriend and was too busy with school and all those reasons. I figured once I was older I'd want to have sex.

I realize I'm still young, but now I have had a couple of boyfriends. I've finished high school and my first year of college. And I've still never wanted to have sex. The thought of having sex is strange and disgusting to me. I've never masturbated, and never wanted to. It also disgusts me. I've never had a sex dream. I'm definitely very physically attracted to men, but I don't like looking at naked men. Looking at naked people in general makes me squeamish, but especially men.

Am I just a 'late bloomer'? Should I just go out there and have sex with someone? Because I really, really don't want to. But at the same time, I really want to have a boyfriend. I've turned down every guy who's asked me out in the last year (which has been quite a few, but I go to an engineering school that's 70% male. They're desperate guys), because I'm afraid to get emotionally invested in a relationship only to have it end because I refuse to have sex. And I'm equally afraid to wind up being pressured into having sex just to stay in a relationship.

None of my past boyfriends every pressured me to have sex. And I never wanted to have sex with them, so I never hinted that I would be willing to. We broke up for other reasons, before we ever crossed that bridge. But these were high school relationships. I'm in college now and *everyone's* having sex. So I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm asexual. And I don't want to be; I want a romantic relationship with someone, and I don't know how I'm ever going to get that when everyone expects sex.

1330407781.0,13,self.asexuality,q9c01,Another - am I asexual thread? =p,Without_Wit,15,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/q9c01/another_am_i_asexual_thread_p/,"There's three reasons(and a wall of text) that make me feel uncertain if I'm asexual or just inexperienced or traumatized. I'm 20 years old and male.  

1.) I've never had a girlfriend 
2.) I was abused as a child
3.) I can't fantasize (or have no imagination)

Sometimes I can be aroused by women who are purposely being sexually inciting, but not so much in real life. When I do get aroused, it's usually when I'm sleeping or if I'm wearing tight pants and if I haven't masturbated in days. When I do masturbate, it's usually just me trying to fantasize about something that's supposed to arouse me, but I can't keep the image of an attractive woman in my head for longer than a second, so I just lay there and get it over with. Literally, my imagination is non-existent. Sometimes I just masturbate to myself too, but I somewhat obsess over my body (that's a different story). 

I feel awkward when my friends talk about sex, like really awkward. In fact, I probably would have never lost my virginity if it wasn't for the  my friends who made that their own personal goal and for hanging out with them.  Now the problem is, I find it difficult to even have sex with a girl, I just can't stay hard once we start. I'm not sure why, but it's happened twice now. I wasn't even seeking to have sex with them either, but both times they came on to me and my friends encouraged me. The two girls were very attractive, but they weren't even the type of girls I would consider to be my friend, more like the stereotypical attractive girl with nothing intelligent to say - not my type. I physically can't have sex with a girl if I don't like her, I've tried, even if she's attractive. 

The weird thing is, I do want a girlfriend, but not one who advocates sex or who seems ""wild"". I haven't actually found a girl who has similar interest as me, and who doesn't want to have sex/be friends with me just because of my body. I just want someone to kind of connect with. It's been probably 2-3 years since I last tried to have sex with a woman, but I don't care to, nor do I put myself in a position to meet women. I'm content with my current situation, but I wouldn't mind a girlfriend, just to be around and talk to and hang out. The only reason I've been bothered lately is because one of my friends asked me if I was gay because, and I don't think I am. I'm pretty sure I'm compatible with women, I just don't want to have sex with them, and if I recall I might have been a little grossed out by the act. I guess I'm just frustrated because everyone just talks about sex, both guys and girls. Sometimes I just want to be friends, sometimes I want a girlfriend who will be with me. 

I'm tired of hanging out with my guy friends. And I usually only met women through my guy friends, but not the type that I'm looking for. I think technically I can't be asexual if I have a somewhat sex drive, and I want a girlfriend. Maybe I'm just frustrated and needed to vent :\

tl;dr: Am I asexual? I can't (physically) have sex with random attractive women, I have no imagination when masturbating, frustrated for being around sex-positive people all the time, kinda want a girlfriend anyway, the girls in my friend circle or introduced from the circle are too wild, I realized that I'm technically not asexual because I have a sex drive and want a girlfriend. I wrote this all out, and I may as well post it now. 



Edit: Some notes I thought I'd add. I can be attracted to women in specific clothing or sometimes just the clothing itself. Once the clothes come off, then it kills it for me.

These days I'm single for obvious reasons (though the whole ""no no pants dance"" thing isn't the only one), and wonder if I'll always just have to suffer through sex for the sake of having a significant other.

All throughout high school I wasn't interested in dating. I could look at a guy and find him physically attractive, but I could do the same thing with a girl and never get turned on by either or them.

I went through the motions of dating till I met my now ex husband. (I grew up Mormon so there was never pressure for premarital sex. Sex, petting, heavy kissing, etc. were off limits.) I didn't allow myself to question my sexuality much till I became really close to my ex after dating him for months. In my early 20's I finally experienced real sexual attraction for someone. I even remember thinking to myself, ""Oh this is what it's like to be normal!"" At the time I didn't even know what asexuality was. 

Long story shorter, we broke up, I got back in the dating scene. No longer Mormon at this point, I started dating non-mormons. My ex was different in that he didn't even kiss me till we dated for 3 months. My friends pointed out to me how weird that was, but at the time I didn't find it weird. In fact, I felt like he waited till just the perfect time. These new guys are wanting kisses after the second, sometimes first date. For a while I thought I was just broken, or wounded from my divorce. Then I heard something about asexuality. I struggled for months, wondering if it were possible to be asexual, then not, then asexual again. I tried experimenting (horrible I know) by kissing random guys (even a couple girls) who'd flirt with me at parties, and I even had sex twice with two different guys. Nothing. Porn does nothing for me, never has. And yet I was clearly attracted and sexually attracted to my ex husband. I wasn't asexual. 

For two years I kept this mystery about me on hold thinking I just needed the right guy. Then I met the ""right guy."" I've known him almost a year, we're friends and I like him. We get along amazingly, we like all the same things, I'm super comfortable with him, but he's a sexual person. Because I was trying to respect him, I wouldn't kiss him (outside of a friendly peck) because I felt I would be leading him on. (Remember I didn't know of demisexuality. I thought my lack of attraction was me not liking him but wishing I did.) I tried explaining to him that I wasn't sexually attracted to him and I didn't know why. He was very understanding given my odd behavior and we tried dating. That only lasted a week until I got officially friend-zoned and was replaced by a girl who wanted to cuddle with him, who wanted sex with him, who held his hand, and would kiss him openly. This hurt. 
And here in lies the problem! 

(TLDR) Discovered demisexuality a week ago, my sexual behavior makes sense now, still doesn't solve my dating issues.

I'm a wonderful wing woman. I'm the best gal friend a guy could ever have. But I want something more. 
If I start dating a guy, getting close to him, liking him, he friend-zones me or runs to a girl that will have sex with him before anything can start.
Do I kiss them anyway? Even when I don't feel anything? Do I force sex when after a while it might turn out that I actually *don't* like the person like that? 

How do I go about dating when the guy gives up so soon due to a lack of intimacy on my part? I am an attractive girl, I turn heads. Because of this, guys don't think they have much of a chance with me a lot of the time. Me not really being sexual doesn't help with that.
I tried explaining demisexuality to a couple of my close friends, but none of them understood it. How do I balance my friends from potential boyfriends? How do I even know if I like a guy? 

Any advice?

I am particularly confused about how asexual people can be in functioning relationships with sexual people, which seems to be more common than I would have thought.

So my question is: how does your asexual/sexual relationship deal with sex? Do you sometimes have sex with your partner? (if so how often and are they satisfied with it?) or do you let them have sex with other people (if so how do you/they feel about it?, aren't you worried that they will fall in love with the other person?) or do you just not have sex (and how does your partner feel about that?).

I want to hear your experiences! Not just vague posts about compromise. I'm sorry if I'm asking for too much personal info but I am genuinely curious and, you know, its the internet.

Thanks in advance for all your wonderful responses! :)

As far as me goes though, I consider myself more along the grey-A category. Most of my friends have accepted this fact and are supportive of it, but I will admit that they don't quite understand it. They seem to think asexuality implies no desire for any intimacy at any level, but that is kind of a different matter all together. The issue I'm having is that I go to UT Knoxville, a college of 30,000 or so overly sexualised students inside a relatively small and uneventful town. Usually I can go out with my friends to the local establishments and hang out and have a decent time while meeting new people. Lately though, I've been feeling that every socializing event I've been to has been sex based. Essentially everyone just wants to get laid, which just kind of leaves me there. I feel myself getting pulled more and more into that lifestyle just for the sake of fitting in even though I don't really want it.

Really unsure of what I am.,,18,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/125gnz/a_few_questions_really_unsure_of_what_i_am/,"So I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Basically, my entire life I've never liked the idea of the actual act of sex. Being naked and having another person touch you so much and being vulnerable around someone you haven't necessarily known for that long. But I just thought I only felt this way because I never had the opportunity to have sex arise.

Fast forward to me just turning 20, in a superficial relationship with someone. Let's just say the opportunity arises and not only do I not want to do it, I'm flat out disgusted by the idea of it. Even when it's right in front of me.

A few things that complicate matters, since I was about 13 I've masturbated around once every 2 days. But I've noticed that I don't really do it unless my body tells me I *need* to do it. I generally get headaches and I find it hard to concentrate if I haven't done it for more than 2 days.
Also, I'm sexually attracted to women. I find boobs and ass very appealing, I just never ever want to stick my dick in them.

Also, I'm not sure if all this is because I'm asexual or if it's because I have really significant trust issues, I find it incredibly hard to trust people and it takes me a long time to establish trust with someone. In fact, the only person I would say I truly trust is my cousin, whom I've known my whole life.

So I'm thinking that maybe if I developed trust and love for 'the right person' I know how much you guys hate that phrase, sorry, but I think maybe in that circumstance it might change. I've always thought that if I loved someone enough, and they didn't force me or pressure me at all, I could see myself doing it out of love for them to make them happy.

But I don't know if I should identify as asexual with all that, because I know so many of you hate those stereotypes of 'it's just a phase' 'you'll find the right person eventually' etc etc, but at the same time, as I am now, I feel really comfortable with the term asexual.

I'm 24/f and I think I'm probably asexual, possibly some sort of grey-a form of demi.

The thing is, I don't want to ""come out"" to family or friends as officially ace because I'm concerned that if I end up wanting to get into a relationship and/or have sex in the future then I don't want to feel like I closed my options off or like I'd have to explain my past or current behavior. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I'm pretty sure that a decent number of the people in my life just think the reason I don't date or display any real sexual drive is because I'm in the closet- which doesn't even make sense because I'll admit pretty freely to being bi- but I just say that I'm not really interested in dating anyone. Which is true, but I also don't experience sexual attraction.

One of the other major concerns I have is that because I don't really feel sexual attraction I won't know what to do/how to have sex and I'll REALLY suck at it. Honestly the idea isn't repulsive to me- but I feel like I would have sex the same way I would give a back massage or play soccer. It would be a physical activity that would be fine but not something I ""needed"" the way most people seem to.

The thing is since I don't experience sexual attraction I'm pretty much too scared to do it since I don't trust that that instinct thing that tells people what to do will be there for me. 

Up until now, every ""sexual"" experience I've had has required me to be pretty close to blackout to feel the confidence to do it- even just making out.

A dark place. I have this friend of over a decade. We're close. We behave as if we're in a committed relationship without the sex. And she both wants to date and doesn't. She goes out but feels guilty. I feel awful for feeling as possessive as I do and, as a high functioning autistic, have a hard time expressing myself. I end up being cold to anyone who hits on her or who she goes out with. Its like I'm incapable of hiding. But eventually she's going to find someone whom she has a connection with and an attraction to and I'm going to lose her. That's the reality. Even if we stay friends, I lose a lot of her. I love her enough that Id be willing to compromise in our relationship and give her what she needs but I know things usually involve feelings and aren't solved so simply.

I always saw myself as an aromatic asexual. But maybe my feelings for her are more romantic than I thought. And if they are, what to do about that? Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Being a friend is very important to me. It's central to my entire being. It's my entire code of honor. It's comparable to religion for me. What's the right way for a good friend to behave? Be supportive and understanding? Honest? 

I'm sorry if this isn't the place to post this. Or if it's unreadable. I'm going on my third day without sleep (insomnia) and using an iPad. I just caught myself seriously considering suicide and I shook myself out of that and decided to reach out for advice instead. I'm just looking for some feedback, some stories. I don't have anywhere else to turn. And if someone else has been in a similar place I feel like that'd be enough to settle me and give me the direction I need.

Tl;dr aromantic asexual has a complicated relationship with female friend. Usually healthy until dating gets brought up. Friend goes on a date, hides it and then goes off forcing me to consider what we are and what friendship at this level means. Culminates in days without sleep and suicidal thoughts.

I'm just looking for insight to snap me back to reality, I guess.

I, on the other hand, cannot understand ""hotness"" and how anyone can think like that. It made me very uncomfortable because it isn't a topic I can contribute to, other than smiling and nodding. It especially frustrates me because normally I am quite a talker, and I hate sitting in silence. I spent the whole two hours just wondering how anybody thinks like that.

Is that normal for people to just think about the opposite sex or potential mates constantly?

I've got it registered, I have some official-looking topic set up, with permissions set and prepared for expansion.

Now, there is one problem: I still need moderators.

So far one person has agreed to help moderate the channel, and as founder I was automatically an op (I'll use that term from now on, since op is the term for an IRC channel operator, which is analogous to a subreddit moderator).  However, I realize that that isn't exactly a democratic way of running things, so here is the official decree:

If anyone wants to be an op on the channel, then feel free to say so in the comments.  If you agree that such a person would be a good op, then reply to their comment saying so.  You guys know the community better than I do, and I feel like I can trust you guys.

I'll choose ops based on how many people think they should be op, and what timezone they're in (feel free to list that, as well, for clarity).  Then they have to register their name with Freenode, and join the channel, where I'll then make them op.  Right now I'll continue giving myself op privileges, simply because there aren't many ops around.  If, after this whole thing settles down and we have a good chat going, and people decide that I've outlived my use as op, I'll gladly step down and let the team do their thing.

So yeah, in short...

I think it would have taken me less than 19 years to figure out, if I had actually known that asexuality was possible. I mean, I'd been asked about my sexuality a number of times, but being asked only if I was gay straight or bi. I had only heard of asexual reproduction, and as being a human being, I don't have that ability... Anyways, not a single 'sexuality' quite fit like the comfortable yoga pants I choose to adorn at this particular moment (if I'm gonna identify, then it's gotta fit) I couldn't be straight, cause I liked 'Em' and 'Zee', but being homosexual didn't fit either because I most definitely liked 'Cee' and 'Mi'. Okay, the most logical explanation is 'Oh baby, you're bisexual, more sexy sexy fish for you, Amirite?'

Except, nope. I never had a single sexual fantasy with any of the people I had a romantic attraction for. In fact, if any person came up during masterbation (which never goes very far, anyways) , I would get all weirded out and would have to quit and lose any and all good feeling. It's really feels like one big NOPE! for me. I cannot imagine sex feeling good. At all.

The feelings of I want to kiss, hold hands, and hang, were really noticeable in my last two loves, Zee (f) and Cee (m), but I've never wanted to sex up the people I like... Or see. 

Subsequently I have trouble recognizing flirting because I forget that a great deal of people really like sex, and could imagine not wanting it (which I've never fully understood, but I assume its like needing water?). I can avoid the obvious stuff like ""hai thar, sexy, lemme in yo pants bitch"". I can't tell if they other person is flirting because sex, or if they're just a nice person who likes to talk (like lil' ol' me). Society has apparently deemed me a good looking individual, because enough people try and it's becoming a problem. (Or the people I meet in life aren't after supermodels). I'm feeling like I'm being strung along like a dummy :/ and it genuinely bothers me when people try to hit on me.

I figure I might as well write it down here and see what happens.

I started dating a sexual person a couple months ago. Around the same time, I discovered my asexuality. I know I have never had a sexual thought whatsoever, but because my girlfriend is the first person I've had a romantic relationship with and because I'm still young (15), I sort of feel like this is not much to go on. I don't know, maybe I haven't met the right person yet. Maybe I'm just a late bloomer. Maybe one day I will meet the person of my dreams and fall madly (sexually) in love and I will leave my GF for them. I know this is irrational and things rarely work out like the movies, but the prospect of suddenly feeling this overwhelming passion and sexual desire frightens me.

I suppose it's a measure of how much I love my GF that part of my worry is hurting her if I leave her to have a sexual relationship with someone else. And I guess it's also evident how much media has contributed to this, what with its overly-sexualized, hit-by-a-truck, one true love portrayal of love and relationships. I've never felt like that towards my GF--or anybody--and I guess I feel like I'm missing something. (It probably doesn't help that my GF identifies as hypersexual either.) But missing this something is how I've always felt, and it frightens me to think of suddenly having it. I'm stuck in between the media's definition of normal, and my own normal.

I know it's stupid and silly to expect my life to work like it does in the movies. Everyone is different, and life isn't as straightforward as Hollywood likes to pretend it is. Likely this is why this worry has been relegated to the back of my mind. But it's still there, and I don't know how to get rid of it.

First post here and all and to explain the reasons behind this post, I've recently come out of a pretty long state of depression.

Anyway on to now and the reasoning here there has been a lass I'm pretty close to and have trusted her with stuff in the past she helped a fair bit with the whole depression etc. She has been asking (subtly really) over the past few days about what it was &amp; what I was thinking of as I got ""lost in my thoughts"" one time when out. I was thinking of how to go about saying and if I should.

Every time I've tried writing out a text it just turned to ramblings and beating round the bush only using the term ""ace"" rather than anything else.. as it's a term harder to find what it means, so it's a bit like telling without fully saying if that makes sense.. so really this whole long winded post is about whats the best way to go about saying?

A question/story on self-discovery.,asexualta,13,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1ag780/asexual_semisexual_apathexual_does_it_matter_a/,"Hey all. So, a bit about me. This might get a bit tl;dr and for that I apologize. I'd really appreciate some insight though, because I've never really explored asexuality as a possibility. 

I'm 30 years old, cisgendered, monogamous female. Was in a steady, sexual relationship with a male for about 11 years that recently ended. Since I jumped into an LTR so young and was mostly attracted to men, I just kind of assumed I was a straight, ""normally"" sexual girl. Though I definitely have had attraction to women, it wasn't as strong as attraction to men. I should also mention that me and my ex did have breaks that allowed me to date other people, but none as serious or long term as the relationship that just ended. Here I should mention that I rarely ever cared about sex. Though I do experience sexual attraction, my sex drive is faint and I am pretty much okay with not having any sex at all. However, I am fairly sexually experienced -- I was and am still interested in pleasing my partner and do 'perform' for my sexual partners, and I've been told more than a couple times that I am good in bed. 

But. My ltr essentially ended because he always felt insecure about our sexual experience. I never orgasm, and while I can enjoy sex and even initiate in order to keep my partner happy, my ex knew that I was never really into it, at least not like he was. He stayed with me for years, but ultimately, I think he realized I would never change. And that was the dealbreaker.  

Now. I am definitely romantic. I want a ltr, even a family. And sex is not usually repellent to me. It's just neutral. So given the choice between sex and an ice cream cone? Well, I'm pretty much always going to go with the ice cream cone. And the more I consider this, especially in the light of my recent breakup, the more I wonder if maybe I am somewhere on the asexual spectrum.

And if this is the case -- as I am slowly beginning to suspect -- how do I deal with it? I can essentially play at being sexual, as I have in my other relationships. But I want to be open with my future partner/s, and I'm afraid that playing at sexuality might not be enough for my future relationships. Or it might scare off partners.

So, r/asexuality, I'm wondering if you have advice. On -- anything really. On being semisexual/biromantic (as I am increasingly identifying with), on how to introduce the idea to partners, on how to reassure them that yes -- I find them sexy and attracted and I do want them, but that sex is just a neutral thing for me. Or should I just continue to pay at being ""normally"" sexual? Okay. Thank you all so much for reaching this tl;dr post. I really appreciate any advice you have to offer.

I grew into asexuality, I believe, from outside psychological influences at a young age. Specifically, from about third grade on, a large portion of the student population I was in somehow came to the conclusion that I was gay, and did not hesitate to tell me this fact. It wasn't necessarily bullying, some students approached me with a questioning attitude, asking questions like ""so, what's it like to be gay?"" This all occurred directly before the gay rights explosion, so I was rather isolated. 

Suffice to say, I was rather confused about my situation; by middle school, I had begun to believe, to a degree, this label applied to me. However, I was not attracted to men, never in my life have I had such feelings. However, I also found myself disgusted with PDA, and did not see anything attractive about the female of the species. 

By late high-school, I had made up my mind, and told my parents: I never intended to enter a romantic relation in my lifetime. Perhaps adopt a child, but never engage in intercourse. I had not ever heard of Asexuality at this point, but I basically described myself as one.

Then, quite recently, I began reading a webcomic in which one of the supporting characters was asexual. [Link to webcomic](http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1270.php) **Warning: Contains Furry** (it's rated PG). The stuff described, the way people reacted, etc. Mirrored my feelings EXACTLY.

1354874496.0,11,self.asexuality,14fryz,What is going on with me?,bargainforfrances,16,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14fryz/what_is_going_on_with_me/,"Please bear with me if this isn't the most relevant place for me to post this but I just wasn't sure where else to go. You all seem really supportive and helpful so here goes.

Some context: I'm female; my husband and I are both 25 (we just got married 5 months ago but we've been together for almost 6 years).

Once upon a time, I couldn't get enough of having sex with him. It felt good, it was fun, and I loved being able to make him feel good. I had been a virgin and really sort of freaked out by sex before I met him... I dreaded the idea of it, I'd heard it would hurt, and I couldn't figure out how it all worked -- was afraid it wouldn't feel good. Still, I watched pornography and masturbated a lot and felt sexual arousal watching people becoming aroused.

But when I started seeing him, suddenly wasn't put off by the idea anymore. In fact, I really wanted to have sex. A lot. We started having sex all the time -- I distinctly remember *craving* it, like every day I couldn't wait to see him and do it. 

Then things started changing... it's hard to explain. Maybe I should fast forward to now. At this point it's been three years since I've had a functional sex life with my husband. I still love him; in fact, I love him even more now because our relationship has deepened so much. But I'm feeling extremely averse to having any kind of sexual act performed on me.

I have been thinking that a number of factors may have contributed to this, for instance:

* I have put on weight since then and I feel self-conscious about my changing body, which makes it hard for me to be uninhibited in sex 
* I used to find my husband incredibly attractive and now I'm sort of desensitized to his physical appearance. I notice his zits, his hairy feet, etc. I still think he's attractive... but that whole jump-your-bones urge I used to feel has dwindled.
* We moved back to our respective parents' homes for 2 years after graduating college, which put a complete stop to most sexual activities up until we moved in together
* I get chronic and painful UTIs as a result of sex -- not fun.

But there's another piece of the puzzle. Something that has to do with just being totally indifferent to sexual satisfaction -- I can achieve orgasm on my own, but I'm not necessarily interested in achieving it with him. Something that has to do with being a bit squicked out by sex sometimes. Also something that has to do with not being able to lose myself in the moment of sex like I used to -- for those of you who have seen *Amélie*... you know that scene where she's having sex with some anonymous guy and she almost can't control her laughter at the absurdity of it all? That's the sort of feeling I get sometimes.

I do still get horny. And I very much enjoy the sensation of orgasm. But I'm not particularly excited about achieving orgasm with my husband. I do sometimes feel aroused when I'm er, pleasuring him orally. But that's pretty much the extent of it -- I don't feel like joining him in a mutual pleasure situation. 

You all talk about sexuality with such fluency. Do you have any advice, any ideas at all about what might be going on with me?

I've never felt any sort of sexual attraction. I don't even know what that is like. I look at other people and they all just look like people. Neither males or females really stand out. People talk about how that girl looks cute or that guy looks cute, but i haven't felt that.

I honestly don't know if people are really attractive or not.

I can feel some romantic feelings towards other people when i know about them and their personality, but it still doesn't make me attracted to them.

I do also have a high lean towards males. They are who i feel romantic feelings for 90% of the time

However, I don't completely fit in with the asexual community.

I've had sex before. The physical things were kinda uncomfortable to me. There was some pleasure, however, but it wasn't physical.

In fact, I became addicted to sex, but not for the reasons that other people would. It wasn't for closeness.

It was from hypomania from bipolar taking a minor sexual drive into an overwelming need. but it wasn't just that

It was something else. I love making people feel good. I'll use my body for that. The emotional high that I get from seeing those people so pleased was worth it. It felt so good seeing people happy like that. 

I mean there are other things that I enjoy, but they are psychological. The only thing i enjoy physically is pain, but even that is psychological in enjoyment. I don't like the physical sensations.

I do have a desire for sex. An instinct. But it isn't really directed towards people. The only reason why I am sexual with other people is to make them feel good. The instinct itself is like.. i dunno. It is like a bad itch and you have to get rid of it.

Sexual people don't understand my lack of attraction. Most asexuals I have talked to don't understand my sex drive despite the lack of physical enjoyment.

What i get out of sex are things like the compliments. The positive energy that the other person has. It is hard to explain, but I enjoy it because the other person enjoys it. It also gets rid of my sexual urges, which is something i can do by myself. But i don't need another person to do that, it is just handy to do.

I also do find ways to enjoy it despite the physical uncomfortableness. Things like the feeling of being in control or having lack of it I enjoy. I also enjoy inflicting pain and having it inflicted on me. 

I just don't feel like i really fit in anywhere. I have sex, but i don't enjoy it like other sexual people do. 

I don't have sexual attraction. 

When I am with a sexual person, I end up having periods where I have no desire at all and it drives them crazy.

yet, when i'm having some sort of physical contact, it still raises my sex drive and i have to do something to get rid of it or it creates anxiety. Usually this can be best relieved with my hand, but most sexual people will be insulted if you masturbate in front of them instead of involve them.

A little reassurance or advice would be nice.,throwawayhamcheese,11,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/xheqj/confused_a_little_reassurance_or_advice_would_be/,"Hello there! I have a bit of a problem (as I see it) and I was wondering if any of you wonderful people could give me some insight on the matter. Thanks in advance. :)


To start, I'm 21 yrs old and a female. I'm not physically attracted to either sex and I also have no desire to satisfy any physical ""urges"" on my own. I've checked out some porn and erotica, none of that stuff turns me on either. What I'm trying to say is, it seems I lack even the ability to be physically aroused. (Which isn't entirely accurate, but it's very difficult &amp; a rare occurrence to the point of being non-existent). Of course, despite this I still have a mental desire to sleep with people (in the context of a meaningful relationship!) and enjoy it. It appears that I am asexual, but I don't want to be! I feel like I am missing out on some awesome part of life because my biology hates me. :( 


I don't know though. Sometimes it feels like I am jumping the gun when I try to label myself. I don't have a lot of dating experience, I've never kissed anyone or anything like that. I did have one short-lived relationship with a girl. One time I shared the bed with her in a drunken sleepover. The thought of sexytimes or kissing her did kind of turn me on, and that was a first for me. Sort of an, ""Ohh, so this is what it feels like!"" moment. And it was a nice feeling, one that I want more of, haha.


I've heard the term demisexual thrown around and maybe that applies to me? I'm a pretty big introvert and have a lot of social anxiety. The thought of kissing a person I didn't feel in love with, or at least really like seems quite wrong to me. Maybe some of you will say I just need to get out there more and date people, and I'm going to try to!! I'm finally transferring to a large university next year, so I think there will be a lot more opportunities. I'm only interested in dating other girls, which my community college is not exactly full of. 


To end, this whole not being sure of myself has really been a mess for me. A lot of my siblings suspect that I'm gay, and I don't really want to come out (and I feel I shouldn't) when I'm totally confused! I am so tired of keeping this giant secret, and yet ironically I'm not really sure what the heck it is that I'm hiding! I'm also scared of the prospect of trying to date girls and not even being confident in my identity and what I'm doing. I feel like a small, pathetic child. Plus I don't really think it's fair to put somebody else through all of my confusion like some experiment. Ughhh. 

Sorry this is so long. I'm just so frustrated with myself. Most of you guys seem pretty happy with being aces. I'm not even really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for, I think maybe I just needed to vent since I can't really talk about this irl. Anyone else been in a similar position? Any words of wisdom?

I met a girl who enjoyed such a thing and we cuddled, kissed and shackled me among some others things.

I've read about asexual relationships before, including asexual/heterosexual relationships, but never really come across many people talking about being a ""biromantic homosexual"". 

Since realising my homosexuality about 3 years ago I've only once had strong romantic feelings for a female, naturally I feel sad when I think that a relationship could never form between us due to sex almost being a requirement in most modern day relationships.
So my question for you guys is are any of you in asexual/homosexual or asexual/heterosexual relationships and if so how do both partners cope with the lack of sexuality?

I identified as so because I had/have no interest in sex while all my guy friends seem to fiend on it. This past month I've been feeling more sexual and it's kind of creeping me out. 

I mean, I actually have the urge to masturbate, like everyday. And if I don't, then I can't focus on what I need to get done. It is really irritating, actually. In the past I was able to go weeks without masturbating, so I don't know what the heck happened. 

The idea of sex isn't very exciting still, but I haven't tried to have sex in a few years, so I wouldn't know how my body would react with my new libido. That, and I don't even know if this new libido is here to stay or what is up. 

The only changes I've made in my life is that I'm not stressing out over school (on break) and I've recently added more cardio to my workout. 

I don't feel like I'm full on sexual, because I don't sexualize everyday people like I imagine some people do, but I looked at some nude photos lately and I did find them sexually attractive. I would have felt indifferent about nude or pornography in the past. 

I don't even know if I'm explaining myself very well right now either. It's confusing, but not really upsetting, more surprising than anything. And I am not worried about what to label myself now, I don't really care, I just want to know if anyone has experienced something similar happen to them?

And does masturbation == I would enjoy sex now? Or does sexualizing an image == I would enjoy sex now? 

I think I'm going to not identify as asexual for a little while and see how that goes. Being asexual has kind of hindered the possibility of relationships, so I wouldn't mind being sexual for a change.

A few days ago we sat down and had a chat about sexuality - what homosexuality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality are, and how some people don't like to label themselves as any, and no one can know except for him which he is, etc.

I'd love also to explain to him the concept of asexuality, but I'm not sure how I'd go about explaining the difference between romantic and sexual attraction, since thus far I've simply explained it as ""gay people fall in love with people of the same gender"", without mentioning sex much. 

While neither I nor his parents believe in censoring that from children, I don't think he'd be able to grasp the nuance of how someone could be asexual, but not aromantic, and I wouldn't like to give him the impression that asexuals can't fall in love.

Is there a way I could explain this in terms a child would understand, or would it be better to leave it until he's a tad older - 10 or 11, say?

I need help with giving advice to my younger sister. My sister and I are extremely close. I am three years older than her. I am going to be a junior in college and she is in high school. We were together for only one year in high school, but that was an awesome experience for both of us. We have very similar interests and personalities. Our parents are pretty conservative, so they are of no help during any situation that is not 100% pure in nature. So my sister and I were always there for each other. Whenever she needed help I was there for her. With issues relating to friendships and school matters, I usually help her get through it. 

But this is where we get a problem. Her last year has been terrible, while I am having an awesome time at university 1000 miles away. My parents had been dropping hints that she was not doing well since a little after this spring semester started. I was like ""ok, high school is not the best."" But that was not it. She just called me a few days ago crying about everything that was happening in her life. She has some health issues that popped up this semester, so she was behind in school work and both of these things were stressing her to the point of depression.

School is not the only thing stressing her out. There is one other item on the list. Dating and boys. I am the only one she can turn to. Her closest friends ended up turning on her because of some stupid shit, so its up to big brother to pull her back to her feet. It is breaking my heart to write this, but I need advice.

She asks my help with how to deal with dating and I can't help her. She will call me and say that she wants to be in with some one and asks what she should do, but I have no response. I have given probably given her some terrible advice. It makes me feel useless to the person that I love most. I have never been in or felt the need to be in a ""serious"" relationship. My romantic side showed itself last year, but I did not purse a relationship because I knew that the girl wanted more than I was wanted to give.

So my sister calls me and asks for help about relationships and all I can say is ""I don't know"". My family does not know that I am asexual or that it even exists, so they want me to help my little sis. But I can't. While she started getting little crushes and BFs in JR high and more serious stuff in HS, I just blasted through and am well into college with no intention of having sexual relationships.

So how do you feel that I should handle helping my only sibling through a very rough patch in her life?

I'm a 16 year old male and I recently began identifying as asexual. I haven't told any of my close friends or family. I'm currently in a summer program and I have told a few people here.

I was struggling to understand my sexuality for a while, as I had never even heard of asexuality until a few months ago. I knew that I wasn't straight, so I assumed that that automatically made me gay.

I'm pretty sure that my close friends have some notion of my sexuality. I also think that my family is convinced that I was straight; they always ask me if I've met any cute girls, and I would normally just play along.

My biggest fear with coming out is that I've definitely led people to think I'm straight. My friends and family are very tolerant, but I'm not sure how to say, ""I've been lying to you for a few years.""

My family and I also never really talked about sex; I never had the talk with them. I learned at my school's sex education program. I think that might be why I'm having some difficulties.

So, here are my questions:

Is coming out to my friends and families a good idea?
If it is a good idea, how should I do it?
Is it odd that I told people I barely knew (and will probably never meet again) that I was asexual before I told my close friends/family?

I'm not sure what my exact label is - maybe you can help me.

I'm a woman attracted to men but without strong sexual overtones. I am also attracted to woman. I just think beautiful people are nice to look at. But I have no sexual drive or inspiration to take action. If one of these attractive people starts hitting on me (which has happened and is incredibly awkward) I'm immediately aware that sex is something I don't want and find a way to inch away.

I've only had 1 significant sexual relationship. It was with a man I was friends with for 1 year. He asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship and I was feeling lonely (kind of ashamed to admit it) so I thought why not. I found I could do the sex thing and I did feel drive when I got the gears going. But I wanted sex a lot less frequently than he did and when we broke up, I stopped all sexual activity and very quickly found I lost interest in it again.

I don't feel my lack of desire to have sex implies I love people any less than anyone else. I have very strong emotions and am picky about the types of people I like to have in my life. I am a social creature and do like people. But I feel guilty about making significant connections with men because I am worried that I can't satisfy them. I feel anxiety about having a conversation with anyone - male or female - about my sexual preferences. I just keep telling people I haven't found the right person yet. I feel terribly bad for any man who might begin to like me, because I feel like he won't get his needs met by knowing me. 

I did express my feelings about sex to one of my best friends (a man) two years ago. I told him I thought I could be completely healthy in my life without ever having sex again, and that the idea of it was ok with me. I told him that I hoped I one day would find someone to share my life with that had similar sexual preferences to me. He told me that I was probably repressed and that I would change my mind. He said I was probably just recovering from the breakup of my last relationship (it had already been 1 1/2 years by then) and I really wasn't. I read a book called ""Sex is not compulsory"" and that sealed the deal for me. But I felt that I could never freely express the conclusions I came to with the people close to me.

To be honest, I feel like I get off infinitely easier than people in the LGBT community but the hardest thing for me is that it feels like no one believes me or has sympathy for the types of problems I experience given who I feel I am and my choices. I feel like people start to feel extremely uncomfortable if I express I don't care for sex - as if I'm judging them and feel sex is immoral.

But when I start hearing people talk about asexuality and what it means I don't think it describes me. I don't know. I never really defined my sexuality until right after I graduated high school. I told a few people I was bi and then later that year came out as gay. 

When I was about 15 I joined some gay hook-up sites because I was curious. I hooked up with a few guys to try and figure out my sexuality. I've always felt different because I didn't want what everyone did. I wanted the boy that appears in every romantic comedy ever made. The guy that connects with you on a deeper level and understands you. You have fun together, you do stupid shit together, and you're always there for each other because you love each other. Sorry I'm getting a little off topic. 

I've had enough sex with guys to figure out that I was going through the motions because that's what everyone expected. When I got to college, I tried to connect to the gay people I had met but never really connected with them. I ended up crushing on a straight guy pretty hard. 2 years hard. I just wanted to cuddle up with him and just be with him. I wanted him to kiss me and tell me he loves me. And that's as far as it goes. I guess I've never really understood sex either. The idea of wanting to penetrate/be penetrated by someone was confusing. But everyone does it, right? 

Sorry this is kind of a stream of consciousness. I do that a lot. But I guess I'm just looking for some answers. How do you even begin to form romantic relationships when society says that there is sex in relationships? The part I'm confused about is that I still find guys sexually attractive in the sense that I find beards sexy, I love seeing (some) shirtless guys, penis's (peni, penisssss, whatever you know what i mean) sometimes are nice to see. But in my ideal world, my boyfriend/husband and I are connected on a very deep emotional level, we cuddle while watching movies, we occasionally kiss to show affection, and we cuddle falling asleep together.

Sex to me is like acting on a stage. You play the character how they are meant to be played even if it isn't you. I know how to make a guy think I'm very sexually attracted to him so we can have sex. I kinda cringe my teeth and take it because it's ""normal"". God I fucking hate that word. 

Once again I started ranting. Sorry. I don't know.

I don't even know what I want to get out of this post. I say I'm looking for answers but I kinda just want someone to understand. People have never really seen the ""real"" me because, to most of society, I'm pretty weird. Not just sexually but some of the thoughts I have. I think ""would a normal person have that thought?"". It just makes me feel really alone. I want to be able to talk about anything without people judging. Just listening and contributing to the conversation.

Example: I've been through a suicidal phase in my life and I think it has expanded my mind. Knowing what it feels like to be in so much pain that you cut, that you stand on the edges of tall buildings, that you would rather be dead. I like to talk about it. I find it fascinating how strong some emotions can be. How they can control you if you don't keep them in check. But if I start talking about how interesting it was to be in a suicidal mindset, people become really scared for me and wonder if something is still wrong. No, I'm not suicidal anymore but it was a part of my life and therefore a part of me. I feel the same way about my sexuality. People won't understand how I don't want to suck anyone's dick or fuck anyone. I just want that romantic relationship. And then people become concerned. 

Ranting again. I think this post is finally ending though. Again, I don't know what I wanted to get out of this post but it has kinda helped just typing through some of the things in my head. 
Please ask questions. I'm pretty sure there are questions I have never thought of before that might be helpful into figuring out who I am.

I've never really developed a sex drive or understood why everyone else devoted so much time and effort to sex. For a while I just assumed I was slow to develop sexually, but as I am now 24M I doubt that's it.

Sometimes I wonder if I would be sexual if I tried it, that maybe once I had sex it would be so unbelievably amazing that all this energy others focus on it would make sense.

I certainly am hetro-romantic. I like girls, I want to be close and have an emotional connection with them but I don't see that sex would add anything to a relationship.

I had one long term relationship with a girl, lasting 5 years, we never progressed beyond hand holding, cuddling, and light kissing. Our relationship was wired because we did fight about sex.
I never tried to make her have it or wanted it immediately, but being in a long term relationship I started thinking about wanting a family and kids some day.
I figured trying sex would be the easiest way to do this, but am fully open to adopting an infant as well. She was not just against sex, which would have been fine, but was against kids from any source.

Despite this we continued dating, eventually breaking up while I was suffering from a severe depressive episode and was planning to kill myself… that's a story for another time.

Anyway I had been trying to find if my low sex desire is shared by other people and started to learn about asexuality. I think it fits me but I've never heard how asexuality and desire to have children fit together.

(crossposted from /r/LGBTeens),acecat,13,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1awl4r/an_introduction_i_just_wish_i_knew_what_i_am/,"Okay, um. Hi! I'm 19, cis female, college freshman studying in the US at a rather famously 'gay' university - originally from Asia, raised in a...not conservative per se, but very traditional (Chinese), homophobic family. My country has laws against homosexuality and even talking about LGBTQ stuff is pretty taboo, only for the bravest of souls. 

Saying hi here because I haven't made friends on the internet for a while now but I miss having a supportive online community to turn to. 

Here's the second bit of my post, a slight rant/advice request about being questioning(??) - /r/lgbt is a bit too intimidating so I thought I'd ask here instead:

**(tl;dr = how do I find out what I am if I'm ace and rarely, rarely get crushes or like people ~that way~)**

My answer to 'what do you identify as' has been 'something' for a while now, because I just don't know and I have no idea how to find out. It would be lovely to know how to categorize myself, but my circumstances and personal preferences just seem to be set on thwarting that. ('Questioning' doesn't seem to fit either, because I am pretty damn sure I'm not straight nor completely sexual, I just don't know what variety.)

Here's what I do know (girl/guy here used to refer to sex not gender):

* I've liked someone romantically, but I only knew (and dated) them online. So I don't know how things would be IRL. I seem to be aromantic IRL - I've had only three hearts-on-notebook crushes ever, but they were hormonally-driven (I had no actual interest in the targets and frankly found two of them highly off-putting) and I don't think of them as being romantic (I had no desire to be romantically with the targets - quite the opposite really).

* All those crushes were on boys. They were all IRL too. Ages of occurrence: 11, 14, 17.

* I feel always very conscious of, often threatened by and sometimes nervous about the possibility of a boy liking me romantically - this must mean that it could happen, right...? So I like boys? Otherwise why would I feel that kind of tension?

* I am drawn to/notice particularly girls with short hair. Especially blondes. Very especially androgynous-looking blondes. But I don't know if this is just because I'm being reminded of my ex (blonde androgyne), because it definitely had never happened before I saw what my ex looked like.

* Yeah, I don't think I'm over my ex either. It's been almost a year (three month relationship). I hate myself for not being over it yet.

* I am really attracted to this (straight) girl, but not romantically. Not even platonically. Aesthetically, I think. I just love being around her and being able to see her/hear her talk/watch her movements.

* I recently met a (questioning, leaning towards lesbian) girl who I was (and am) quite drawn to as well, and with her it's mostly a desire to cuddle and hug and nuzzle (the last rather intimately - between neck and shoulder). But I don't know if it's my ex-filter clouding things again, because she's blonde and has very short hair. And I feel guilty about that too, because if it's actually happening then I'm only liking her because she reminds me of someone I like.

* I like looking at female bodies more than I like looking at male ones. By a good margin.

* I think I'm demisexual, but I'm not very sure. I know that I have zero interest in sex. I thought a bit about touching my ex in a intimate/sexual way when we were together, but I have a feeling I was more interested in the intimacy and making each other feel good than the actual sexytimes. But I never met my ex, so I don't know if I'm *really* a/sexual or not.

So yep. I don't know where this puts me, and I don't know how to find out. Rereading the list makes me think I'm probably attracted to female bodies, but that really only started after meeting my ex. But maybe I was just repressed before, who knows.

The asexual(ish) bit makes it difficult to find out, because I can't just grab a guy or a girl, try having sex with/kissing them, and see if I feel anything. The low frequency at which I get crushes doesn't help too...

I know I shouldn't care because these are just labels, and I feel kind of guilty for caring, but just...especially at my uni, the LGBTQ community is very fierce, fabulous and...very non-questioning - very certain of their individual identities. (And quite sexual. And mostly gay, I think.) Against that backdrop, it's annoying to not know what I am.

I can remember when I was a teenager, all I wanted was a boyfriend. I thought that would solve what I was feeling inside. I just could never connect with men easily, as I was very shy. I don't want to sound conceded, but having guys approach me or letting me know they were into me was not the problem. I've always been told how pretty I am, but that did little at the time because I still felt abnormal. I thought that was my problem…if I could get over my shyness, I would find a guy and I would be fine. Ok…so eventually became less shy and opened up a bit. Finally I found someone that I wanted to be with, but to my dismay, this opened up a whole new door. I loved the connection emotionally we had, and I lost my virginity to this guy. Well the first time…..nothing. Not only did I feel nothing, I didn't like it. I brushed it off thinking it would get better. WELL it didn't haha the entire relationship I was having sex with him, not because I wanted to, but because I felt like that was what you where supposed to do. Maybe he just wasn't good in bed? maybe my anxiety was getting in the way? Well that relationship ended….and…I was ready to experiment. So I slept with a few guys, and still I got nothing. No orgasm…NOTHING. I've had another relationship since them and it was the same thing. I can orgasm on my own, but when I'm having sex all I can think about is when its going to end. I don't enjoy it. SO….the past year or so I've learned a lot about myself. I was dead set on believing something was wrong with me, but I don't think that way anymore. I've realized that its okay, and I'm not fighting the fact that I do in most cases like being on my own. I think a lot of people do things because they feel like that what your ""supposed"" to do. I have realized that I'm perfectly okay being on my own, and really like it. 

BUT…..I still do enjoy the idea of love. Being so closely connected and caring for someone to me is still appealing. Sex is just not something I'm interested in. In my dream world I would find someone that I could spend my life with on a emotional level, where sex didn't interfere. Where do you find this though? That would be in a ideal world for me, but if it comes between being alone (which I know I would also enjoy) and being with someone where I would have to have sex with….I would rather be alone. Do a lot of you accept that spending your life alone might be only option? because lets face it…there are not that many people out there that would enter a romantic relationship with no sex.

I don't know where to go from here. I am a 23 year old girl. I am definitely aesthetically attracted to men. I don't know if I've ever experienced ""proper"" sexual attraction. On occasion (like, maybe a dozen times in my life) I have had thoughts that sound like, ""I want to touch his butt,"" or ""I want to lick his neck,"" or ""I would be interested in learning more about his genitals."" But like I said, these thoughts are rare, and when I hear other people talk about feeling sexually attracted to someone, it just doesn't sound very relatable to me.

I've known about asexuality for a long time, but never thought I might be asexual until a year or so ago. I had assumed that the reason I had never enjoyed any of the sexual experiences I've had was because they were mostly one-offs with people I didn't care about. But when I started to really think about what it might be like to have sex with someone that I love, I hit a major wall.

It makes me want to run away. It makes me want to be sick. It makes me want to hide. I hate everything about myself, and the thought of subjecting someone else to the horrors of having to be near me makes me want to die. I would never want to do that to someone I care about. I would never want them to see me naked. And I don't think I could really respect anyone who liked what they saw. 

I know my self-loathing is frequently irrational. I have been in treatment for depression and anxiety for a couple of years, and while I'm doing much, much better than I used to, I feel more hopeless than ever regarding the possibility of a love life. No doctor I have spoken to has taken these concerns seriously. They seem to think it will all go away once I find the right guy. But every time I meet someone who I consider attractive, all I can think about is how I don't want him to see how ugly I am. I think about how horrible it would be to be naked in front of someone else, to have him really see me. I think it sounds terrifying and awful. I think I would rather die. 

I don't know if I'm asexual or demisexual or just held down by my own self-loathing. I do know that as more of my friends start to settle down into long-term relationships, I am getting very, very lonely. I want, more than anything, to have a significant other. But the thought of ME being in an intimate relationship with another person makes me want to crawl into a hole. Even a celibate relationship.

Lately, I have been feeling a lot of stress about my relationships and my ability to be open about myself with my friends. I have a very conservative and non-LGBT-supporting family (I love them and all, but in this area they are still stuck in the 1950s) so I would prefer never to have to speak about my asexuality with them. They probably don't even believe that asexuality is a thing.

However, my friends have recently begun to speak to me more openly about relationships and this is causing me some stress. Within the past year, I have had two female friends ask if I was gay (which I denied) and have had one female friend joking that I might as well be asexual (to which I gave some noncommittal answer). Additionally, I have noticed that my male friends have been much more vocal this year about seeking relationships and talking about how attractive different girls are, and I continually play along even though I don't really want to do so, simply because I don't want to go to the trouble of explaining that I am asexual and don't really know what else to do in that situation.

I would prefer to just let things be and avoid labeling myself, but if people keep asking me about my relationships I am eventually probably just going to come out about it. Unfortunately, I have a fair number of friends who are much more conservative than I am. In particular, one girl with whom I am extremely close told me that she thinks bisexual people are in denial about their sexuality. I can't see that she would feel any differently about asexuality. I would also be horrified if anything ever came back to my parents and I was forced to have that conversation with them.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Tired of lying to your friends but not sure how to go about telling them that you are asexual, especially since most (all?) of them are more conservative than you? Any advice and support would be appreciated.

Would it be a good idea to suggest that we pursue a purely romantic relationship with no sex, while I continue my purely sexual relationship on the side, or would that be offensive?

I'm pretty sure they think this is some kind of ""phase"" and I'm just trying to be comfortable with being lonely.

The one friend I did try to explain it to (super hetero male) totally missed the point.  I wouldn't have tried to bridge this subject with him, but I was sick of him dragging me to bars to meet chicks where I'd have a shitty time.  All and all this has led me to not really want to try and explain my asexuality to others.

Now two of my closest friends, who are a couple, are trying to get me together with a friend of theirs.  She's a great girl and I enjoy hanging out with her, but like most twenty-three year old girls she's pretty sexually driven. I've kind of put off making a decision one way or the other for about a month now.  The problem is we're at the shit or get off the pot point.  My two friends, the couple, think I don't like her or something because I wont invite her to my house to have sex.  She seems to feel the same way from hints I've gotten from our mutual friends.  I try to tell all parties involved that I think shes a rad chick, but they think I'm full of shit because I don't ""make any moves"".  I don't know what to do.

I'm socially anxious in general, throw the amount of pressure I feel right now on top and I become a blithering idiot.  If you have any suggestions on how to bridge the subject and talk to her/the rest of the people in my life about this, please share. 

I know I should just man up and give her the info, but it's tough for me to even fathom being that forthcoming with someone.  So if this is your advice I'd appreciate a little encouragement with it to get me pumped, so that it's easier to do.

-I'm a male, and intend to stay that way.

-I've been kissed by many girls before, but never kissed a girl, and thats because I've never wanted to. Same thing with guys. Many gay guys have full-on kissed me, but I've never kissed a guy before either because I never wanted to.

-I have never been ""horny"", as in I've never had an erection while I was awake. I've had ""morning wood"", but it goes away after awhile since I wake up.

-I feel more comfortable around girls than guys.

-I have a few female friends, and no male friends

-I'm not attracted to men, but I don't mind looking at a fit man with his shirt off, but only if he isn't ugly.

-I don't like seeing another guy's penis.

-I like looking at boobs and butts.

-I can only compare the feeling of looking at nude girls and guys as the feeling of reading a fantastic, long book.

-I'm not attracted to women, but I don't mind looking at ""hot"" girls in bikinis or cute outfits and such.

-When I hug someone, I feel tingling in my penis, but it doesn't get ""hard"" like my morning wood. It's purely the sensation of hugging i think, and has nothing to do with whom I hug. Children, Adults, Old People, Black, White, Asian, Girl, Boy, Fat, Skinny, you name it. It still happens.

-When I hold hands with someone, each finger in between the other's fingers, I get the same feeling. Shaking hands does nothing.

-Also when I cuddle/spoon with someone, I begin to get ""funny"" feelings, but no erection. Same thing with animals, like dogs or cats. Cuddling and petting give me funny feelings, but its very mild compared to when it's a person.

-The last thing is girls in heels. Whenever I see a girl in high heels and a short skirt, and her legs look amazing, I can't not stare! Pictures of girls in heels don't do anything to me, but in person they sort of freak me out. I get so nervous and catch myself just staring. The other ""normal"" things that are supposed to arouse me , like boobs and butts, just sort of pass me by. But if you ever walk by me in a short skirt and high heels, you better expect my eyes to be glued to your legs until you're out of sight.

**So my lesbian friend has been taking me to parties lately with a ton of drunk, ""hot"" girls seeing if she can get me ""laid"". But I never wanted to be ""intimate"" with any of the girls, who were very friendly and touchy. I liked a lot of them very much, but I didn't want to have sex with any of them. Maybe cuddle or something, but not sex.**

When I first found out about the existence of asexuals, my heart jumped (after some light reading.) 


I am attracted to the shapes mostly like the penis, or the belly. I've always been. The first time I saw a penis, I got an erection. So I believed I was gay for the longest time. Flash forward to many years later, to about 7 months ago, I have sex for the third time in my life. At first I sex him, and it feels quite nice. But, I remember looking down at this person, and the thought ""I don't want to be here,"" first crossed my mind. And I realized hours later that I've always had a reluctance to have sex. Always. I used to think it was just simple anxiety about my performance or something, as I am a guy who is reluctant to do A LOT for that very reason. But as I looked back on my sexual history, I began to realize that every time I've had sex I've felt that I wasn't doing something right because I wouldn't make the right noises, or I'd be not thinking of sex while having sex, or I wouldn't match the enthusiasm of my partner. This one guy I dated, in fact the only guy I've had enough of an emotional connection to to feel inclined towards, was taken aback whenever he'd hear of my horrible, horrible pillow talk (once it was how I enjoyed the color of the room, and I'd often laugh at the ridiculous contortions we'd be making. ""Is it good?"" ""Why yes, the narrow fleshy passage I'm moving my penis in and out of would *naturally* feel good to anyone, so yes, right?"") Since then I'd always felt that my mind was in the wrong place during sex, or that I was somehow doing something wrong. I'd always be too clumsy, or not ""into it"" enough, and often I'd only want to really fuck for four minutes.


And this kinda stuck with me for a few years. I'd feel shame, or felt I'd been marred for life by this one guy, since after that encounter I stopped 'caring' about sex (admittedly terrible break-up, so there was an easy rationalization). I never realized that I'd just part-way reconciled with the fact that I don't need sex. The reason this was so hard to realize clearly is because everyone around me is always going on about sex, and I was aroused seeing men who had sex, so the 'ergo' seems pretty obvious. It didn't help that I wasn't having a lot of it, so I didn't really understand. Even before I had had ANY sex, I knew and told everyone I knew that cared to listen, that I wasn't the type of guy for one-night stands. I always said I needed to know a guy really well if I ever wanted to fuck him. This is combined with the fact that I wasn't 'good in bed.' 


So yeah, I think I've come to the fair conclusion that I am asexual. I have been claiming it for the past two weeks or so because it *feels so damn right*. Even everyone I know sees me as the least sexual person they know. I still masturbate all the time, although I've learned asexuals have libido too. It's just a new world to me, one in which I'm validated even though I don't think about sex, enjoy sex, or perform well at sex. I now ignore people when they go on about their encounters (in passing, not if we are having a one-on-one). Ah, anyways, thanks for reading. I have asexuality now to add to the list of things I've discovered about myself since puberty (it's getting kind of huge).

I have social anxiety disorder, which makes connecting to other people, particularly in person, incredibly difficult. Even so, I would have expected to experience some sort of romantic feelings to *someone* in high school at least. Most people by the time they graduate high school have had at least one crush, right? There were plenty of pretty nice guys in my high school and for that matter, there were lots of great girls too, and unlike middle school I wasn't picked on, so surely at some point if I was romantic I would have felt something for one of them, wouldn't I? Or is this just a misconception based on the view of romance in popular culture? Since high school I haven't really talked much to others in my classes and unlike high school I don't have a consistent group of the same 20ish people I'm always around in my classes so it's not like I'd have a chance to have any crushes on them since I have a very hard time talking to people I'm not familiar with. I have friends online, some of whom I care very deeply for, but I don't feel anything romantic for them and rather than jealous it makes me happy when they get into a good relationship because I like knowing they're happy.

Even before I identified as asexual or even really knew what that was I'd come to the conclusion that I really wouldn't mind not ever having a partner as long as I had some friends and family to keep me company and pets. People seem to interpret this as just having ""given up."" To be fair, I've never dated anyone or even been asked out. I don't find it distressing though from a point of view of *wanting* to date someone, although I have found it upsetting sometimes because it makes me feel more strongly that I'm antisocial and unlikeable and strange for never having a relationship despite being an adult. It plays into my insecurities of being someone who nobody would really want to love. Putting all that aside though, I've never felt any desire to be with someone romantically for the sake of having a relationship. I don't know if these feelings mean I'm aromantic though or if I'm simply inexperienced and don't know what a relationship feels like. It feels a little confusing to say I'm aromantic because it's not like I find the idea of relationships squicky the way I find the idea of having sex, but rather I don't care if I'm not in one.

I do still however desire physical intimacy as a whole quite a bit. My behaviors in this direction tend to be a little unconventional, so for the sake of an easy example I'll stick with hugs and cuddles, because I enjoy the hell out of those. 

So, romantic asexuals in relationships, does they play very much of a role in your relationship? I've had people suggest I stop trying to appeal to everyone and simply try to find an at least fairly nice asexual to just be with before, and to tell the truth it sounds a lot more appealing than having to constantly act on a partner's sexual desires just to keep my need to make people happy satisfied.

Anyway as it seems to really explain a big part of why I' e felt so isolated all my life, I've started 'coming out'

First I brought it up with my identical twin (who is certainly not asexual). He was generally accepting but wondered if it might be because I dated a girl who was asexual (also celibate for religious reasons too I guess), a d he speculated this lack of sex in my only previous relationship might be why I feel as I do. I explained I always have felt this way, before durring l, and after my relationship with this girl. Overall I was pretty satisfied with the way things went.

A few days ago I opened up to my long time therapist, who I see because of a long history of severe treatment resistant depression which has only finally been controlled about 2.5 months ago (probably why I'm trying to reasses who I am and why in regards to asexuality now).
Anyway he also was suggesting I probably was a late bloomer (I'm 25 so I highly doubt that) or that it could be caused by issues I have with social anxiety keeping my sexual urges repressed. I guess his points bothered me because while I don't feel they are the cause I can't prove they aren't. He also suggested I may grow out of it at some point, and I tried explaining I don't have any desire to grow out of it. I see my brothers and the rest of society devote a massive amount of time and emotional energy into sex, I've seen my brothers be crushed when sexual relationships have ended, and I know it's all because of a sexually released flood of oxytocin that makes them feel what they describe as love. I don't want it, I don't want the emotional turmoil, I don't want my romantic relationships to be propped up by sex hormones, I want an intileftual and emotional relationship based on trust, openness, and compatability, not sex.

Anyway, I'm not happy with his response and I want to address it with him but I don't know how. He's helped me a lot with my depression and I am not willing to throw our clinical relationship away over this.

The two options I've thought of are

1. Address it with him next time we meet in person, say his response hurt my feelings, and repeat the same points about not wanting to change or grow out of it

2. E-mail him, letting him know it hurt my feelings, give him a link to some resources (probably AVEN and a few papers from psychiatric journals), ask him to review them, and ask that we discuss it next time we meet.

What do you think would be the better way to address it, or do you have other suggestions.

Problem is, I have never connected with anyone romantically... I *think*. I've always had issues with how people describe falling in love. More than anything I've heard ""Oh you'll just know, it'll be clear,"" but that can't be true; you hear stories all the time of people realizing they were in love with someone long after they met them. I've never had a satisfactory answer, something to help an asexual figure out who is a close friend and who is closer than a friend.

Mostly this has been brought on by one of my close friends having drifted away, but I still think about her a lot, to the point of crying out of missing her and being jealous of her new friends and stuff (which I feel terrible about.) All I can think about is how that kind of superficially sounds like how some people react to breaking up, and I can't stop wondering if maybe she was my first ever potential romantic partner and somehow I missed it. I am kind of really scared of being aromantic, I've always wanted and desired to experience love and have a family, but I'm getting worried and I've had a lot of the same worries I did back when I was struggling with discovering my asexuality.

While I'm still a bit fuzzy on the definition of sexual attraction I feel comfortable identifying as ace. What I am more confused about is the definition or romantic attraction.

I found out I was asexual last summer and began identifying as heteroromantic. Then I realized I didn't really have any urge to go out and start a relationship with someone (I was not opposed to being in one though), so I changed to grey-romantic.

Now I'm wondering if I'm aromantic. A few months back, my brother got a girlfriend. I was homeschooled growing up and his is the first relationship I have been able to watch closely (hope that doesn't sound creepy), and... it isn't what I expected. He writes her cards, buys her presents, does everything that, I'm now finding out, a boyfriend is 'supposed' to do.

As a Christian I'll be expected to 'be the man' in any relationship I enter into, which would include performing the aforementioned boyfriendly duties. I find myself dreading having to do those things. My brother has no problem doing them and actually seems to enjoy it.

I still like the idea of being in a relationship and maybe getting married (but never having sex because it's icky), but now that I see what my brother has to do maybe all I *really* want is just to be friends or something with the girl I like. I've never felt any urge to even talk to her, though, so maybe I don't even really care to be friends with her... maybe I just think she's pretty and nice and that's the extent of my attraction.

Does that sound like aromantic? It seems like I feel some sort of romantic attraction but after seeing what my brother has to do in the name of romance maybe the attraction isn't romantic at all. Maybe I should just forget about labels and stop trying to get into boxes that don't fit... I'll be like a tumbleweed, going wherever life blows me.

I'm a 25 years old male who has been always interested in sex. I used to fantasize a lot about it, and although I wasn't super handsome I never had any problems flirting and being with girls. In fact I'm afraid I was overly promiscuous and that's what makes me even more confused now.

I broke up with my girlfriend 3 months ago, rather she broke up with me, because I had no more sexual desire. She thought it was her, even though I knew it wasn't. I still liked to hang out with her, talk, cuddle, but I couldn't feel aroused at all. We used to make love 2 or 3 times a day, 3 to 4 days a week. It was insane, but I was always very sexually active, even with other girlfriends.

At first I thought I was impotent or something, because I never had such problem, but lately I've been thinking and the fact is I'm no longer interested in flirting or sex. I find myself trying to run away from flirting or girls inviting me for a coffee or a night out. It's strange, before I would say yes in a heartbeat, but now I really can't. 

And it's not that I'm afraid of not performing (or maybe it is, I dunno), but I just can't find a hot girl attractive, it's like my lust deposit just ran out of lust. Seriously, a REALLY hot girl was just flirting with me last night and I had no interest. I know for a fact I would be down with it a year ago. It's really strange and is bothering me.

I like to think I'm not a shallow person, but being so promiscuous so early in my life makes me think maybe I was. It's really sad and leaves me depressed.

Can one really turn asexual overnight? Or am I just being paranoid? I haven't had sex for 3 months and since I've become sexually active this is by far the longest. Help me out!

1346685538.0,8,self.asexuality,za6r3,My last dating experience left me a little confused.,CannaJava,10,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/za6r3/my_last_dating_experience_left_me_a_little/,"Not gonna lie, its taking a lot for me to post this, primarily because I'm still not sure what to think in regards to the way everything played out.  I'm probably the bad guy in this situation and maybe that's why I feel lost/guilty(?).  Anyways, here it goes.  Apologies in advanced for the length.

To begin, I am not asexual, just a straight male.  My current occupation leaves little time to meet new people so I turned to the internet, OkCupid to be exact.  I sent a message to one girl after she had visited my profile.   The flawless dating algorithm for OKC gave us a 91% match.  And after talking with her a bit I felt we were pretty compatible.  I'm very attracted to artistic types, as well as people who are a little bit goofy.  She definitely fit the bill in our online chats.  After some correspondence I suggested we meet IRL.  She agreed. 

We met for coffee (or at least I had coffee, she didn't order anything), and things wen't really well.  Talked until we closed the place, which was a few hours after meeting.  From there we hung out at least once a week, sometimes more.  I'd say (at first) we hit it off.

I wouldn't say I fell head-over-heels, primarily because I'm a bit of a commitment-phobe.  But I genuinely enjoyed spending time with her and looked forward to receiving that next text message.  After a few meetings, it seemed that things were going somewhere.  Even met her family and had Easter with them (my family lives in another state, so it was nice to have people to spend it with).

Now for the reason why I'm turning to r/asexuality with my situation.  After a few dates I started to notice somethings.  I should first state I'm not a very aggressive guy when it comes to intimacy, if anything I'm slightly passive.  Most of the time woman make the first move on me.  Anyways, after feeling like things were going well I tried being a little bit more intimate.  For example, when walking I tried to getting a little closer to her when walking around or sitting down.  I also tried small touching gestures to show my interest (my hand over her hand across the table, playful/flirting pushes).

While she didn't spurn my advances, she didn't really seem to return the interest.  She didn't push me away when I walked closer to her, but she didn't move in closer either.  She didn't pull her hand away, but she didn't turn it to fit into mine or return the gesture.  Sometimes, she would sit next to me, other times away from me, no real consistency.  I think the situation that threw me for the biggest loop was when we were watching a movie and talking and I leaned against her legs slightly.  She didn't move away (a clear indication of not being interested in my opinion) but she didn't react to the gesture at all.

Things went on like this for a couple of months.  Suddenly she stopped texting me and we didn't hang out for about a month.  She messaged me out of the blue to get together.  We hung out once after that and resumed texting.  But, after awhile it seemed like she was no longer interested and things just sort of stopped.  No over dramatic fights, everything just stopped.  Last time she contacted me was about 2 months ago.

I guess this is what I'm wondering: Based on the above, would you say she was asexual? Did I offend her with my behavior/ was I attempting to move things to fast?  Am I over thinking things way more than I should (very common for me)?  I know dating isn't always crystal clear, but sometimes it felt like I was trying to look at a sunset through a concrete block.

I was spurred on by a post I just read about demisexuality to write one of my own. I hate to be that person who asks for clarification on orientation, but I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences to me.

I am a 22yo gay guy. I've had a lot of experiences with sex with guys, and some with girls. When I first started puberty, I was constantly horny and fantasising. I had a few friends throughout school who I fooled around with extensively, but I never wanted to climax during it. It was always about them, and often I'd have to really struggle to make myself cum. They could never make me do it.

When I went to college, I went on an SSRI antidepressant for a bit and my libido dropped hugely. Ever since, I've had practically no sexual attraction to anyone. I had two sexual relationships in college and numerous other sexual partners, but my sole interest throughout all of these was to make the other person cum. I really like doing that, but am not interested in cumming myself. I was not sexually attracted to any of these people, and only really did it for fear of missing out. 

I have been having a sexual relationship with a guy for a few years now. We were friends originally (still are just friends, with benefits ^^) and I believe I am in love with him. When it started, it was all about giving him pleasure, but slowly it became mutual, and now we have full on sex and it is really good. This is the only sex I've ever had that is good, and the only person I've really fantasised about since my late teens. I have long felt that the emotional aspect of the relationship is what makes the sex work.

With others, I cannot usually get an erection, and even while masturbating, it is sometimes a struggle to maintain. I've spoken to my doctor, who says it is probably psychological, however I am wondering if maybe I am somewhat of what I believe is called a 'demisexual'.

I am romantically attracted to guys, but I find the idea of sex with even the most gorgeous guys imaginable to be at best, daunting, and at worst, disgusting. I am terribly sorry for the long post, but any reflection, advice, or experiences any of you have had would be so helpful to me. Thank you all in advance, and take care :)

I'm a soon-to-be-17-year-old girl who's having problems identifying myself. My friends used to joke about me being asexual, but since then I've met an ace who posts about asexuality on tumblr quite a bit. I think it's safe to say my eyes have been opened.

Looking at AVEN's faq, I appear to fit the definition of an asexual. I've had crushes, but they are very rare (**years** pass between these) and very fleeting, with only one notable exception; the longest and hardest I ever crushed on someone was about 5 months. None of these ever became lustful. I fantasize about kissing and cuddling, and occasionally I think about what it would be like to have kids with someone, skipping over sex entirely. I've tried to think about people in a sexual light because it's perceived as ""normal"", but it was very difficult and awkward for me. I don't find sex repulsive (except for oral, the idea of it *disgusts* me, and I'm terrified of BDSM), but I'm certainly not very interested in it, and get timid when it's mentioned. When I'm attracted to someone, I'm mostly attracted to their face and their personality; whether or not they have a ""sexy body"" really doesn't matter. I've been aroused before, but I've never felt the need to masturbate. I'm also terrible at flirting and usually don't respond to it. Initially I thought this was because I might have been hitting puberty late, considering I'm less... developed than other girls my age, and I didn't have my first period until I was 15. However, it's becoming apparent that this is not the case.

My concern stems from this: I'm not sure I have any business trying to define my sexuality. I've never been kissed, much less been in a relationship or participated in sexual activity. I don't know if I'm qualified to label myself.

I've been through high school and college; I am male; I am right about 24 years old; I am asexual; I am aromantic.  So I've been through my fair share of friendships, even sexual relationships, and plenty (oh plenty!) of people wanting more from me than I can even conceive providing.  

So, I ask you lovely people:  How do you deal with others coming onto you?  How do you say ""Listen, I can tell you're attracted to me and want the sexy times, but...well, no.""  

I've been put in some tremendously awkward situations as of late, and could really use some good ways to just deal with these situations.  More or less, someone who works in the same building as me (but not for the same business), is very attracted to me.  I do my best to bring up my asexuality around her as often as possible, but she still hangs around a lot.  I'm curious how I can let her know she really is wasting her time and to move on without hurting feelings and causing even more awkwardness there.

I've only recently acknowledged that I might be labeled 'asexual' and thought I might find other asexuals and say hi. So, hi everyone.

For a long time I have noticed that I lack the drive to have sex. I do find some men good looking (sexy, handsome, cute etc.), but never thought *I want to have sex with him*. Also, I'm more interested in other kind of intimacy, like hugging, cuddling, kissing and so forth, but not sex. I do have sex fantasies to help with... er... *self-help*.

I do suffer from depression (but now it is under control) and I thought that my lack of sex drive would be because of the depression. Then again, in my teens (when I didn't have depression) I wasn't interested in sex either. Interested in intimacy yes, but sex no.

So, do I fit in? :)

I am sexually active and am dating a wonderful man whom I love very much. I do not necessarily enjoy sex, however. If I do feel pleasure, it is too much for me to handle and I want to stop- same concept as being tickled. I like the idea of having sex and do feel turned on quite often, but I do not like the idea of actually having sex. I have tried masturbation with no success. I find both women and men attractive (I would identify myself as straight), but more of through recognition of their beauty rather than for sexual reasons. I find my partner very attractive, though, but I believe it is due to the emotion connection. 

It is a long distance relationship, and the time we have together can be very short (1-4 days every 4 months or so... sometimes a year passes in between visits), so maybe I would just rather spend my time doing other things with him? When having sex with others, I don't even feel penetration, however.

I still want to continue having sex because it makes my partner happy, and I feel satisfied because of that.

I struggle with psychotic depression, but am no longer on medication. 

I am wondering if my problem sounds physiological or if it's just my sexual identity. Help?

So I might be asexual, but I really don't know. So here goes a vent and maybe a little too much information.

I know for certain I'm not a lesbian, I've never had sexual attraction to females. But males? I.. I don't know. I think they're attractive and I like looking at them? I have a boyfriend and I feel a strong emotional bond with him. I think he's attractive and I love kissing him. I even look forward to giving him blowjobs- I love turning him on. I get wet during makeout sessions and stuff. There's some sense of sexual arousal in that I can feel it in my clit (like a strong pulse centered there that I can feel through my body) and my breathing rate increases. I don't FEEL aroused, but my body says differently. I've never felt the ""desire"" to masturbate. I tried it and eh, it isn't really worth the time.

I've been on antidepressants for anxiety since I was about 9. I've heard they can dull libido and sexual desire down to essentially, for lack of a better term, an asexual level. I remember having a HUGE crush on a boy before going on antidepressants, but after that I've never had a ""crush"". Who knows what that means in terms of my sexuality. It was 3rd/4th grade, kids think they're ""in love"" in kindergarten.

I've never been old enough to experience sexual desire AND been off antidepressants. I think the medicine MAY be the cause of this seeing as I had that one crush. But it was a childhood crush, who knows what that means. 
What may be the case is that the antidepressants have dulled my sexual desire so low that it's essentially asexuality. BUT I've been on antidepressants since before puberty, so that's why I haven't felt desire. All I know is I don't have the feelings and desires my friends do.
Oh, another thing is that I don't really feel emotions too much? Like stress for example. I feel the physiological aspects of stress (increased heart rate, shallow breathing), but I don't feel the emotion. I feel fine and nonplussed. I've read that antidepressants can do that to you too (dull emotions). So maybe that's related?

So I'm thinking I might be asexual. And I'm very, very afraid of what that means. Like I had tears in my eyes when I started reading stuff on asexuality and started to think I might be one. It's different than what I've always pictured for myself. Will I be married? Will I have kids? Will I have that consuming, passionate love people dream of? Will my life be ""normal""? It's all so scary to me.

Is it the medicine? Am I asexual? If I am, what ""type""?
Any advice, guidance, or classification you guys could offer would be great. Also, if you use any terms like ""aromantic"", could you please define them? I'm very new to this and very, very uncertain.
Thanks so much

Then I had my son and everything changed. I love interacting with people and having fun and hanging out. I do not care much for dating/sex/any of that. At all. However, I thought it was just a phase due to my hormones from the pregnancy so I tried to shrug it off. I ended up marrying my son's father. Sex during our first year of marriage was horrible for me. I did it to make him happy but would cry in the bathroom afterward. When I got pregnant with our second child I used my whole pregnancy and after as an excuse to not have sex. I had our second back in November and since then we have had sex one time. I have been open about how I feel about sex and being close. I don't even like to be touched by most people. My family and my kids are the exception. But other people, and mostly my husband since every time he touches me I know it has an ulterior motive, I get a depressed feeling every time. He has told me how he thinks I should go to therapy to 'get fixed'. The thing is....I really love not having sex. I find my life so much happier without that burden. I love being a mother and focusing on my kids. My husband and I were apart for two and a half months and those were the best times of my life! I didn't felt any pressure and could just be who I wanted to be. But then he came back and my life is perfect except when I interact with him. He is like the opposite of me. He loves sex, lives for it, and needs it every day. And I even told him to go find it elsewhere and that I truly wouldn't mind as long as he didn't bring it home or around our kids. He told me he could never do that and he only wanted to be with me. A few days later I found through his phone that he lied and had started trying to hook up with many, many women. I confronted him and was pissed that he LIED about it but not that he had done anything. I wish he had been honest. 

I don't really know what this post is really about...maybe it's a mixture of introducing myself, sharing my story, and expressing relief that I am not the only person out there who feels this way. I have felt like a freak and 'broken' for two years because my husband says there is something wrong with me. 

Sadly, and not sadly, I don't feel like we are going to stay married. He deserves to be with someone who wants the same things as him. And I would be perfectly happy stepping aside to watch him reach that happiness with someone else and be a super best friend and have us be great co-parents to our kids. Both of us our miserable when it comes to each other right now. I haven't talked to him about this yet but will do so soon. I have a feeling he is going to be like 'no we need to stay together' etc. because I think he feels we HAVE to be married to each other....I don't see how we can be truly happy and stay married.

I had no idea why my sex drive was non-existent and why the very thought of sex was absolutely repulsive to me. For a while, people thought I was gay, and some probably still do... I sort of unofficially came out to my best friend a few months ago, to which she said ""well duh!"". I didn't think much of it and I did some brief research and kind of abandoned the idea.
It came back to haunt me not too long ago, as I was in an amazing relationship with a sexual guy, who was visibly sexually frustrated. I talked to my best friend about it once more, but this time, it was a different response. She seemed to completely misunderstand the entire thing. She couldn't believe that I had zero sexual desire and didn't want to believe me. As a result, I stopped bringing it up until recently due to my relationship issues. 
I've only ""come out"" to a few close friends and my sister. My sister was surprised and had no idea there was such a thing, but she seems to understand. Some of my friends accept it, while others don't believe in it; they tell me things that I'm sure we've all heard before: ""it's just a phase"", ""maybe you need to get drunk enough"". ""you haven't found the right person"", ""don't label yourself so soon, you're just a late bloomer"", etc...

We've talk and compromised and our relationship has never been stronger. That being said, I've recently become very close with one of my female friends. She's amazing. We have a lot in common and I haven't been this comfortable with someone in a very very long time. The two of us have talked about our feelings and she knows I'm asexual and we both are having a very hard time not kissing eachother. The only thing that has stopped us is my current relationship. 

Now the part that's causing me to be conflicted and confused. I love my girlfriend very much but I find myself thinking about my friend all the time. We miss eachother immensely within minutes of parting. When she strokes my hair or touches my face, I find myself being turned on. Does this make me more Demi? I'm seriously confused becaused while I am turned on by these actions I don't have any sexual thoughts about my friend. The only things that enter my mind is how much I want to kiss her and hold her hand when were out together. 

I'm rambling and what I've written is probably confusing to read but I'm having a hard time organizing my thoughts and this is how my brain has been going the past few weeks. It's like everything has been thrown into a tornado and is just being jumbled.

1366565080.0,9,self.asexuality,1ct3zj,Help! Childless and guiltfree?,dichternebel,11,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1ct3zj/help_childless_and_guiltfree/,"Hey everyone, 

although I only just registered, I've been reading this subreddit for a year now and you've helped me a great deal! 

I need to rant about something and would also be grateful for any advice, so please bear with me. 

First off, I'm asexual, agender and not even sure about my romantic orientation. I might like men, I might be aromantic. Yesterday, my older sister told me that she was pregnant. I'm very happy for her and her partner, they're doing this at the right point of their lives, they have a wonderful relationship and I know that they're going to make great parents. I'm also so excited to meet the baby and see my sister become a mother!

I'm not ""out"" to anyone but my best friend, and even she doesn't know about my gender. I represent as female and I feel comfortable doing so, most of the time. I also don't really want to be ""out"", I don't want to explain my sexual orientation to everyone and their uncle Joe, I don't feel the need to explain it to anyone in my circle because my best friends respect my partnerless lifestyle without questioning it and I don't care about the rest of the world. Part of me also doesn't feel ready to be ""out"", I had a really hard time accepting my asexuality and sometimes I still feel sad because I've always been ""different"" and got my fair share of mobbing for it when I was 11 or 12. I recognise that humans have a tendency to hate what they perceive to be different and it scares me sometimes. I think I would need to feel comfortable talking about it before entering a relationship though, the last few times I thought I was in love was linked to much anxiety about the expectations coming with a relationship (this was before I started realising I was asexual though).

So, right now I think I'm going to stay childless and probably without a romantic relationship for most of my life and I like the freedom that comes with it. I really want to work on an international level and it makes things so much easier if you don't have to compromise for anyone, I can up and leave within no time and I even do fairly often. Also, the thought of having a partner seems strange to me, the thought of ME having sex is somewhat repulsive and the thought of pregnancy is highly uncomfortable because it's such a feminine thing. I'd go nuts always having to look down on a babybelly, even my boobs jiggling makes me really uncomfortable most of the time.

I come from a country with a low rate of childbirth and my family shows this trend very well. Half of my aunts and uncles don't have children and I only have one cousin. My grandmother was always very sad about this. I also have an aunt who's very sweet and was successful on a professional level, but she's also alone, depressed, of poor health and absolutely passive about this state. She just complains about it a lot which gets on everyones nerves because she never DOES anything to change anything. A little bit of sports would help a great deal. Also, she sometimes hurts someone and never acknowledges it or apologises. We almost had a huge family fight because of that last summer. She loves to casually tell me that we are very much alike, when I was younger, I thought this was great, now that I'm older, I'm horrified. I do see certain parallels but I don't ever want to become like her! My sister and her partner like and support her, they even take her on vacations sometimes.

Upon learning that my sister was pregnant, I was happy for her and very excited (I still am), then I realised I was also relieved that I now have the burden of producing offspring somewhat taken off of me. My parents and the extended family will be very happy. Then I realised that I will always be the childless aunt that sometimes gets taken on vacations by her sister and family, out of pity probably. And I really don't want to become that person. I try to tell myself ""No, you're going to be the cool aunt that travels the world"" but I'm so so afraid that my aunt is right and I will become her. The odd one out that you visit and invite because you want to be a good person. Also, despite my parents being very supportive of everything I do, I feel that I'm going to be a bit of a disappointment because I'll never have my own family.

Thank you for reading this far and if you have any idea what I could do to feel better about this, please tell me.

I initially thought that I was demiromantic but I read that demiromanticism is defined as experiencing only secondary romantic attraction, whereas I experience only primary romantic attraction. I stop being romantically attracted to the person after I develop a close bond with them and then they begin to feel more like a friend and I almost completely stop wanting to have sex with them (when I do have sex with them it's because I feel the need to have that kind of emotional connection, I rarely get horny and when I do I prefer to deal with it by myself).

I find that I experience primary romantic attraction with like, one person a year and in those cases I generally have a strong desire to have a relationship with them where we can just kiss and hug and have intillectual conversations. I only want to have sex with them once I've found out that they are interested in me too, but yeah, the idea of sex isn't arousing or anything it's just something I feel I'd like to do with them.
I can relate to a lot of the threads in /r/demisexuality but then there's always that one little detail with the primary and secondary attractions.

25,F (Reproductive Female Intersex).

Basically I have been toying with the idea that I might be a Demi asexual for quite a while. I used to be a very horny and sexual teenager but slowly over the past 10 years my desire for sex is shrinking, I feel numb or repulsed by sexual touches and I much rather expressing intimacy with cuddling and hand holding. Even kissing feels innate.

I consider asexuality to be similar to a sexual oriantation, it's who you are, it's healthy and it's natural and you can't change it.

The problem is that I am not very well educated on exactly what constitutes human asexuality. How do I know if I am an asexual or if I am a sexual person who is experiencing a condition that is affecting my libido?

I used to be a very sexual person, Which makes me think that something might be medically/psychologically affecting my libido and desires. But then I also went through a lesbian phase so I can't see any reason why I'm not just adjusting to my real orientation and identity.

I would be quite happy to just formally close my vagina and say 'I'm asexual"" because that's how I feel and I think that would make me quite happy. But at the same time I think I will grief the old sexual me. I think It would deeply affect my relationship with my husband who is sexual.

I started developing a low libido following vulvodynia (genital pain) I still suffer it so sex/vaginal contact is painful and I have no desire to do it. Along with that, and this is the part of my sexuality I can't explain, Kissing, touching and all sorts of sexual intimacy has become innate or 'dirty' the sensation on my skin either causes no more pleasure than bumping into a wall or it makes me feel like I am being raped by my own father, I feel gross.

I have 'waves' of horniness that lead me to give oral or digital sex to my partner, I enjoy the sensation of an orgasm because it feels nice, But I don't like achieving one while being sexual. I prefer to have one while showering or fully clothed. I don't think of 'sexual' things to reach orgasm, I think of hugging my partner or snuggling. Anyway, this post is getting far too long, so I'll just stop before I vent too much. Thanks for reading.

Just recently started researching about asexuality and it all sounded kinda familiar to me, I know i'm different from other people, still I have some doubts wether or not I am asexual.

Sorry if it's a messy text, it's kinda weird to write about this!

I'm a virgin, haven't had many relationships but in my most recent one I've had chances to lose my virginity. The other person was very sexually active, we'd make out and cuddle (and I'd enjoy it), but when she started trying to take it to the next level I just couldn't keep up with her. She got upset and obviously it all didn't last for much longer after that (Overall = 1, maybe 2 months).
I just felt like I didn't know her well enough, that it would be all too casual for me. Also I didn't feel bad after the breakup at all, even being the sentimental person that I am.

I feel that I can get all my social needs from my group of friends, but I like the idea of intimacy (which I think it's very valuable) and having someone around to share stuff with. I'm pretty comfortable with my body, I masturbate, and I'm not religious at all, but I can't picture myself having sex with someone like that. When I try to imagine it, it just seems ridiculous, off-putting. A ""WTF am I thinking"" kind of thing.

**TL;DR:** I can create relationships but it takes me a long while to start liking the person enough for me to think about sex. I've always been the ""passive"" person regarding relationships and that's how I describe myself whenever people ask me about it. So, although I don't like labeling things, I'd feel better knowing that I fit in under one. Am I gray? Demisexual? Romantic?

I'm aware that there are many ""types"" of asexuality, and that the answers for my questions can vary greatly. I know some of them may sound like the ignorant/disrespectful questions posed by some when they find out you're asexual, regarding it as negative, but I promise you, my questions aren't loaded/judgemental ones. I'm genuinely curious. I don't view asexuality as something negative; rather, in some aspects, it's like a foreign language.

1. Is there a difference between asexuality and a low/lack of a sex drive? Something tells me that there's more to it, in the way one sees  and weights relationships in their life.
2. On this note, it's really hard to wrap my head around having a tight-knit inseparable relationship with someone without feeling strong desires for them. I'm consider myself good at understanding and appreciating differences in the way people see/think, but this isn't so easy. It's difficult to explain what I mean, because I'm not insinuating that sex is the cornerstone of love (nor do I feel that it is), and I'm not saying that you can only really love someone if you want to get into their pants. I'm not sure what I'm saying. I guess I want to know, for those of you who seek romantic relationships but want no part of sex in any form, do you feel this compromises the strength of the love you can have for another? The relationship seems to more resemble a friendship, which I'm not saying is weaker, but something deep inside of me is screaming that it is. Do you feel that your relationship is any different than one that does involve sex? 
3. How can you tell that asexuality is not a hormone imbalance? What sets them apart? (I am aware I may get flak for this question, but I do want an answer.)
4. Do you see sex as something disgusting? Or something you just couldn't care less about? Is it something that you don't desire but still get pleasure from?
5. Even more subjectively, do you get huge crushes on other people based on their appearance? Personally, while I don't think about getting into an attractive girl's pants on first sight (unlike many hormone-charged males), I still think that sexual desire plays a role in that strong infatuation. It's more simply just thinking, ""Oh, she really attractive.""—I do the same with males (I can see them as very attractive) yet I don't develop crushes on males. There is some sort of lust there (though not necessarily sexual)—do you experience it?

**EDIT:** I was just thinking about that last question and it seems kinda stupid now. I'm guessing the answer is an obvious yes, it is possible (for those who simply just don't want sex).

A little background: I have never felt any desire for or interest in sexual activity with another person. The idea that someone would desire such a thing, much less take actual action in pursuit of it, is baffling to me, and the idea of doing it myself repulses me.

At the same time, seeing women I think are good-looking does cause me to experience sexual arousal. I'm reluctant to use words like “attraction” or “desire,” since they imply I would like- or would have liked, if circumstances were otherwise- to actually act on those feelings, and I don't, nor can I imagine any set of circumstances where I would. This wasn't a conscious decision I came to. My disinterest in sex feels as natural and instinctive as the feelings of sexual arousal do, and always has, and feels even more integral to who I am. I can pretty easily imagine a version of me who's sexually aroused by men or by nothing but is still fundamentally the same person I am now, whereas a version of me who's actively heterosexual feels much more alien, much more like “someone else.”

Am I asexual? It seems like a weird word to apply to myself when I do feel sexual arousal and have sexual fantasies (albeit rather detached and abstract ones), but it seems to fit better than anything else. Calling myself “heterosexual” doesn't really make sense when I would never want to do anything sexual with anyone and have felt that way for as long as I've been aware of sex itself, and “celibate” implies a particular way of acting, a lifestyle, rather than an innate trait, and I didn't choose to have no interest in sexual activity with women, any more than I chose to feel no sexual arousal from looking at men.

So I'm confused. I'd be grateful to anyone who could offer some inight. ",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,False,,,True,t3_14j31q,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14j31q/is_this_asexuality/,

I have felt the most desire for him than I've ever felt in previous relationships, but I cannot seem to initiate or read his signals. Today there was a tiny spat over me wanting to wait to have sex until after the biscuits finished baking and he accused me of putting biscuits before sex.

This is the only issue with my relationship with him, and I really do want to be more sexual towards him.

My dad actually had this reputation of being a rake, a heartbreaker of some sort in his youth - and so do my male cousins. I think in a way or the other, they're expecting me to live up this ""legacy.""

In my 16th birthday, my dad took me to this motel where he had hired this hooker for me. She was pretty, yes. But (1) I really couldn't get it up and (2) there was no ""drive"" to fuck her, so to speak. Because my dad was very hands-on, he was waiting downstairs so I texted him that I was not aroused (pretty stupid, I know). Then, his hooker-girlfriend went up (not part of the plan, ew, i know). I now had two girls servicing me - and I still could not get it up.

Eventually, they gave up and we called it a night. We blamed it on the nerves and all. A week later, dad bought me again a hooker - the first one was better-looking though. She finally got me hard - but I dunno, fucking her felt perfunctory - there was no thrill(?), rush or even desire to fuck her. I ended up being deflated minutes later - not because I came but because I was not aroused.

I had told my dad that I had the best night of my life - blah blah, even though it really was nothing special.

I didn't really think much about my performance issues (but I don't have ED, too young for that - blah blah insert reasons here).

Eventually, I got a girlfriend - who I didn't really feel much for. Actually, I had no feelings for her - I was hoping that cuddling with her after sex would trigger oxytocin release and make me actually feel for her. But nope. It felt empty as well. We eventually ended on good terms. Don't get me wrong, I can feel emotional attachment to people (i.e. I'd be sad if they died; I protect people close to me; blah blah but not really in the sexual sense - then again, maybe it's because I crave their attention?)

I actually entertained the thought that I were gay. Last night (4 years after my first sexual encounter), I went to CL and went for a M4M casual encounter. The guy was tall, muscular, around 32 and not bad-looking (kind of good-looking actually). I gave him head (he seemed to like it, I didn't), he fucked me in the ass (he was thick and big) and he came on my chest. But throughout the night, I did not get hard.

The sex... was nothing special as well. He lasted long though and he seemed to enjoy it. I, on the other hand, felt nothing. (It) Actually reminded me of my previous sexual encounters.

Now, I'm worried/sad/attention-whoring about my predicament. I do want somebody to love (EW. Where did that come from?) and cherish but I don't know. I just can't feel (is that even an appropriate term?).

I am 21F, have been in a heterosexual relationship for almost two years now. I've realized recently that I have almost no sex drive, which is taking a toll on our relationship.

I didn't really know what it was supposed to feel like so I just kind of went along with it, up until about a year ago, when I finally had a self-realization that I get no pleasure from any kind of sex. 

Oral sex does not sound appealing to me at all, never has; doesn't feel like anything. Same thing goes with fingers. I went to the doctor not long ago to figure out what this was all about and she basically told me to suck it up and this is what sex is like for all women. I have a hard time believing that. We've (bf and I) tried EVERYTHING to get me to enjoy/desire sex. Yet, I still get no pleasure from it and my sex drive is just not there. 

Random things: I used to feel horny when I was a teenager, and then I went on birth control. Dunno if that has to do with it. After that I still felt like I was horny (or, curious) before/when we started having sex, and then I just lost interest.

I am looking for some help.

**TL;DR I might be stuck in a deep relationship with an asexual partner. Please help me figure things out, and make some wise decisions. Additional questions all the way at the end.**

I am a male in a wonderful relationship with a woman. We have been together for 10 years, and married for 5. I feel the need for sex 3-4 times a week. My wife feels the need for sex once every 2-3 months. My frustration has built up inside me for a very long time.

We met in my mid 20s, and her early 20s. She was a virgin, &amp; religious. So she wanted to wait until marriage (oral and finger too). We did kiss, and cuddle, and were romantic, cute, mushy, and sweet. Tons of our friends, and numerous strangers (including one super old lady in a nursing home) would talk about us as being such a wonderful match. We just clicked on a very deep level. I was not a virgin, but fell in love with her and happily waited. She started medical school and we got married 2nd year in, it was 5 years of a close monogamous relationship till marriage. 

We had an attempt at sex wedding night, she was tight (I do not have a large cock, but she is slim and smaller). Since I was experienced and she wasn't I allowed her to control when she wanted sex. We didn't have sex again almost a month. I had to bring it up in a quizzical manner. Then for the next 2 years while in med. school rotations and residency her common excuse was that she was tired from running around the hospital all day or emotionally drained, and lacked any desire to get into it. Over time, she consistently used numerous excuses to not have sex. About once a month she had a quick flash of desire for sex (ovulation as she was wetter). These 1-2 day forays would end up not happening if she was working those days. So there would be times of 2 months or more with no sex. If we did end up having sex they tended to be sporadic with her desire or ability for me to bring her to an orgasm. I would usually need to give her an orgasm (finger, oral, vibrator, massage, bath, etc) to loosen her up, get her into it, and get her wet enough. We ended up developing only 2 position that she is  interested in (her on her back where she doesn't move when I thrust, or her on top of me with my feet off the bed). She would not alter these positions for anything. She would not tweak them either. She isn't interested in trying a new ones. Also, if we were in the position where I had my feet off the bed and me on my back with her on top and her feet on the floor then I couldn't thrust up into her. Also, her game was that she would try to play with me before I inserted her to get me to a point where I was so heightened I'd cum in her in under 1-2 minutes (she is actually proud of this). This pattern continued for all 5 years of our marriage. The last few years she's been complaining how her old friends have multiple kids, and instead of asking to have sex now, she talk about trying to make a baby, again with it only being timed to her ovulation with nothing sexual happening other times. 

I want to clarify a bit about our relationship. We are extremely happy in our relationship. We have not had a major fight in 10 years. I mean this in all sincerity. We communicate about everything. We have gone through some extremely stressful life situations. The passing of my grandmother who was the closest person to me throughout my whole life, her dealing with all aspects of medical school and residency which were very traumatic for her, etc. We have great times together when we are sitting together or actively doing stuff. We have traveled the world together, we read almost each weekend when she is not working where we cuddle up on the couch (magazines, books, newspapers), we have community that we are part of and are active with. We have many similar tastes, from food to entertainment. We have family on each side that we love. In short our marriage is a happy ball of wax, with the exception of our utterly sexless life. 

She has not had any sort of sexual trauma to warrant this, so as I looked into things more this is one of the reason why I am considering the possibility of her being biologically asexual. Furthermore, I am actually very good at sex. I don't mean to say this in a haughty way. I do know what she really likes when we actually play. I have given her multiple (clit) orgasms and heavy g-spot orgasms. I can tell when her orgasm goes up to her head or down to her toes. But, I will add a few things about my past sexual tastes, it's not the issue and I am extremely attuned to my partners in bed. I have an insatiable sexual appetite. I need to masturbate close to 4 -5 times a week. Before her, I would have sex at least a few times a week, or more. I am pansexual (attracted to bi, gay, trans, and other sexual genders such as ftm's). I am kinky, have fetishes that range from vanilla to all sorts of levels of BDSM (I am a very good Dom as well as switch). I have had long sex escapades with the ability to give multiple orgasms to multiple partners or have had sex every day or multiple times a day. I believe that I understand how to push the mental buttons and physical buttons to ride up to an orgasm and I understand enough to hold onto it over time to maintain the bliss throughout sex. I am an incredible romantic as well. Cerebral and intellectual and use them to bring emotional comfort. I cater to her needs, and anticipate many of them before she asks. She has repeatedly told me that I seem to know her better than she knows herself. I cook, actually it's entirely my kitchen, unless we are cooking together something fun like cookies. We are adventurous foodies. I make and bring her cooked breakfast in bed at least 2-3 times a week. I make her lunches and have dinner hot when she comes home. I leave her all sorts of love notes, take baths with her, give her long and deep massages, etc. I do the laundry, and most of the errands, as well as clean the home. I write poetry, and paint. I have a job, a career, and an upper level degree. I have plenty of time to myself, with my family, or with my friends (i.e. she is not dominating or controlling over my life).   

I have made all sorts of attempts over time, in various ways to communicate with her about sex. I have been soft and empathetic, and hard and mopey, and straight up about my feelings want or being desired. I purchased all sorts of toys to let her choose one that might break the spell. Bought lingerie and let her dominate and control the bedroom games. No does not masturbate, No Porn. We went to the OBGYN (no short cervix or internal mush). I talked dirty to her and teased her for a few days to get her horny. Gave hints. Or remind her it's been a month since we had sex. Her responses rotate, but she always gets a bit agitated. I hate feeling like I am pushing her. 2-3 months may pass and no sex and then when an off week comes close I tell her in advance that we should have sex, as usual, I let her choose the times and then don't push her and not bring it up again as the week passes. She never makes a move or brings it up. She's not busy, general vacation stuff. Sometimes I let it go, other times I bring it up on the last day at what seems like an appropriate time. Usually she will get agitated or anxious, and the excuses are lame. No Sex. I let it slide. Sometimes I will deliberately show her I am not happy, and we leave it at that. She then says she loves me deeply, but still no sex. 

I have taken up hobbies to control my frustration. I started to paint and create. It is not used to separate us, but at times I paint my frustration onto the canvases and try to deal with it that way. I have been so close to fucking behind her back with any of the polysexual genders that interest me. I tried to use porn to stem my frustration. I  tried dirty pen pals over the internet. I tried to just have a night out to see if the 'chase' was enticing enough. Many of the genders I am interested in are very open about not caring about married men, and many are happy to have an extra fuck buddy (i.e. those on HRT have an increased libido, gay men can be more promiscuous, bi men, polyamorous couples, BDSM situations can be very open, etc). I have come very close to following through, but just can't seem to do it to my 10 year relationship. 

I considered polyamoury, but it may be way too emotionally complex. I considered cuckqueen situations to get something going with her too. I considered cheating. I considered she might have a gender issue. I considered she might have had a sexual trauma. I considered she might have a low libido from hormones. I considered her being biologically asexual.  

She genuinely works very hard. Some of her days and weeks are extremely brutal on her. But, over time I am confident that this is NOT really the issue. I know of a kink/BDSM couple who are both in medical school and they have tons of time to fuck, play in groups and go to dungeon parties.  

I love her too much to end our marriage. 

Please help me to clarify if this is a potential asexual situation. 
If so, how would you recommend I ease her into best understanding what she has so she can learn more about it in a positive manner. 
Is there any hope for me? i.e. are there ways to rectify my selfish sexual concerns with her? 
Is there something else entirely that this might be (just on my end, her biologics, or cosmic fairy dust)?

I have been in love, or at least I think, early high school was a weird time and I think I still have feelings for him, but it's mostly nostalgia, I think. I have been romantically interested in people before and then just as we start dating or whatever I realize ""oh yeah! I always hate this, why do I want this again?"" Anyway, I don't really feel aromantic, except for the one guy, and confusion before actually getting close to anyone. What do you guys make of this?

.

Also, I would really appreciate if someone could help me understand relationships. I don't understand why people get so stupid when they're in one, especially in high school. For instance, my best friend starting dating this guy about five months ago. Anyway, two months in, he's buying her stuff from Tiffany's and they're all crazy in love and shit. Why? WHY? They're completely incompatible, the only thing she's interested in is shopping and he's incredibly well-read and a total dork. Also, now she is completely ignoring me, which sucks because she was like my only friend. Why do teenagers do this? I have another close friend who is engaged and completely serious about this guy she dated for a year in high school! I just don't understand it...

The question I have for myself now, is if I am homosexual, or just homoromantic.  Complicating this issue, I have aspergers syndrome, and with few exceptions, I am physically uncomfortable with so much as a pat on the back, so obviously the thought of ""intimate"" activities is nor all that appealing.  I know many other aspies do end up in sexual relationships, but the thought makes me slightly ill.  I do not at all enjoy watching porn, erotic literature etc... But my understanding is that this is a mirror neuron thing associated with aspergers.  On the other hand, I occasionally feel that if I had been with someone for several years, and was extremely close and comfortable with them, I would not only be willing, but I would be eager.  So, for me, the problem is not the act, but the intimacy, which given my condition does not come easily, or quickly.  So, to you NT (nueotypical) aces my question is: do you feel similarly?  Is the act, or the intimacy the problem?  I understand that the only real difference is the label, but I am asking out of both curiosity, and because while labels are meaningless, I am trying to understand my place in a world where I feel rather marginalized.

I'm trying to figure out where I fit and if there are other people like me. I have read the AVEN wiki, and all of this is pretty new to me, but I was hoping to hear some input from other people.

I'm 30, and my long-term relationships have been few and far between. I never feel immediate romantic or sexual attraction for anyone. Without the help of alcohol (which usually doesn't even help that much), I would have probably never had a first kiss. In fact, first kisses freak me out to the point that I have refused them many times. Sex doesn't freak me out as much, but I find it really hard to be kissed by someone I don't know well, and it's a huge initial hurtle. I see that most people seem to feel this strong attraction in the early stages of dating, and I simply don't ever feel it or understand it. I go on dates occasionally, and I can see that someone is attractive and attracted to me, but I don't reciprocate those feelings. I almost never get crushes. I've always just assumed that I had big intimacy issues, although I had no idea where they stemmed from.

On the other hand, if i've known someone for a long time, I can begin to feel something romantic for them. And then after that, sexual attraction. I *love* sex, it's just rare that I actually want to have it with anyone else. The same goes for love and romance. I love these things and actually want them very much, but they happen so infrequently for me that I've become accustomed to a life without them. I feel like the people I date find this to be very frustrating. I've been called a tease before by guys. My friends also don't understand why dating is so difficult for me, because on the surface, there's nothing to indicate why it would be so hard. I find dating to be incredibly stressful and disheartening, and every time I go on a date and feel the way I do, I just become more discouraged. 

I feel like romantic relationships are kind of impossible for me, and lately it's been making me feel really sad. I would love to feel the connection that I want with someone someday, and to have a family.

OK. I'm verbally spewing here for a bit. Throughout this note, I'm being serious, but I may lighten up with a little humor now and then. Deal with it. (case in point) 

I'm really tired of all of the gay-hate going around. Yes. I am intolerant of intolerance. I know, that doesn't make sense, but neither does hating how someone lives their life when they are an adult and are capable of making their own decisions - which don't affect you directly (or 9,999,999 times out of 10,000,000). I'm probably going to lose friends for this, but I'm OK with that. I had people de-friend me after I simply changed my profile picture to show that I was a straight-ally. I expect no less now that I'm actually taking a real stand AND explaining WHY I take the position that I do on this issue. 

Why do I take such a strong position on, specifically, gay marriage? I could say that it's because of my friends who deserve the right to marry the person they love, regardless of their gender. I could say it's because I believe in equal protection under the law for ALL, and that as long as there are civil rights and benefits/considerations based upon marital status, that marital status should be available to all consenting adults regardless of gender or orientation. 

Some of the arguments I've heard are just ridiculous…""if homosexuality is a civil right, it does NOT logically follow that polygamy, pedophilia, and/or bestiality would one day also be declared a ""civil right.""  And, next thing you know, men (I only specify because that's how the argument has been presented to me, without fail) won't be able to marry ""little boys"" because 1) pedophilia is still illegal, and 2) even if by some strange turn of events, it wasn't, they would not be of an age of majority to enter into a legal contract. Therefore, that argument is invalid. 

However, there is another reason. A reason that is very personal. And, related to one of the other arguments I've had lobbed at me against gay marriage.  That argument is: ""Marriage is for heterosexual couples, for the purpose of procreation."" If that's the case, then take away my right to get married right here, right now. I've got at least two, maybe three strikes against me. 

STRIKE #1 - I am not heterosexual. Now, before you misinterpret that, let me clarify. I am what you would call hetero-romantic asexual. In laymen's terms, I like guys, I like cuddling and all that romantic, mushy stuff…but that's it. And I am OK with that. Let me explain it in a way some of you will understand: 

""For asexuals, sex is like… a donut. When we see a donut, we do not have the urge to eat the donut. This does not necessarily mean we hate the donut, or think the donut is disgusting— many of us even like donuts. But we never have any urge to walk over there and eat it. Demisexuals will have the urge to eat the donut only if it their absolute favorite kind of donut in the whole world, and greysexuals sometimes will have the urge to get the donut, and sometimes not. Celibates are on diets.""

For a long time, I thought I was weird because I wasn't interested in sex like so many of those around me were. I never told anyone because I was weird enough as it was, and (to my mind) I didn't want to give anyone another reason to not like me. As someone who identifies as asexual, I'm probably not having kids, because…well, certain activities are a pre-requisite to makin' babies. 

STRIKE #2 - Medically, because of some various issues that I won't get into (I mean, c'mon, I'm putting enough info out here as it is….), I probably cannot have kids.  Again, this is something that, thankfully, I am OK with. I have great respect for those who do wish to have kids, and do whatever they can to make it happen. I can't begin to imagine the emotional toll it can take to face your deepest desire and not be able to fulfill it. That being said, I don't really WANT to have kids because, 1) I just …. don't…. and 2) I have other things that I deal with that, in my case, it wouldn't be fair to put a kid through dealing with as they grow up.  

So….there it is…if marriage is for one man and one woman, for the purpose of procreation, then I hereby turn in my right-to-marry card right now.  If you want to de-friend me for my stance, the button is right there on my profile. If you want to have intelligent conversation about this, I'd be happy to…I'd welcome it, even. If you have questions about anything….ask. If I'm not comfortable answering in a comment, I'll message you.

Now I take a medication that helps me wake up and focus (helps with the ADHD, too) but it's never enough to make me feel like I did when I was like...I dunno, 12 or younger?

Well, I decided to drink an energy drink called AMP the other day. This particular drink was made with FOCUS in mind, which I desperately needed. The craziest thing happened; Instead of me getting hyper and flipping the fuck out, I began functioning normal again. I'm talking about some *LIMITLESS* kind of shit going on in my brain:

* I noticed things I'd never seen before (just little things that most people take for granted like EXIT signs, but for me it was like the first time I'd received  my glasses and I finally could see clear for the first time). 

* I began enunciating and pronouncing every word while carefully picking what to say in advance without sounding stupid (I slur my words like crazy and frequently use wrong words)

* I made very calculated and controlled moments, rarely making mistakes and only using enough energy to do whatever physical action I was doing. I never moved quickly, which is counter-intuitive for an energy drink.

* The cloudiness in my brain was lifted and I swear my IQ must have increased briefly because I was able to process things I never previously could. As a computer scientist, this was incredibly useful.

* I was able to talk to people with extremely high confidence and was able to pick up on social cues I previously would have missed. I was able to keep on topic and made sure not to interrupt people.

* I became overly enthusiastic about everything. Normally when this happens, I get really loud but this never happened.

With all of this came another odd side-effect... I became extremely horny and I very badly wanted to have sex with a woman. Now the fact that I was feeling ""normal"" again made me wonder if my tired state has always just been suppressing my sex drive this entire time and that the reality is I'm actually just a heterosexual male, but I DUNNO. AMP is a helluva drink, and I'm not sure if it's just the drink that was horny, or if it was really me.

1368506813.0,9,self.asexuality,1eaoqy,Is it possible to get too tied up worrying about labels and not just be yourself?,nzfeet90,11,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1eaoqy/is_it_possible_to_get_too_tied_up_worrying_about/,"I don't mean to denigrate anybody here, nor their views, so lets clear that up right off the bat. The reason I bring up the topic is expressly not to start yet-another-debate-about-terms, but rather because on this subreddit and others on similar subjects I see too many threads where nobody can decide what the OP's label should be.

Now, I'm a young man. I like other young men. I'm physically attracted to men insofar as I appreciate various features of a male body. I'm not c**k-hungry however nor interested in that feature's anatomical antipodean crevice. I have a foot fetish which I often joke has replaced my sex drive. I love and fantasise about activities involving guys' feet or guys and my own feet — hint from my username. I still don't want to have sex with them, nor am I bothered about their meat-'n-two-veg nor their Death Star's weak point.

I won't lie or hide any of the above, because it all comes toward the point I want to make.

The point is that I count myself as asexual because the term, at least connotatively (yet widespread enough and supported by research like that of Bogaert or Prowse &amp; Graham, all 2007) refers not only to those who experience no sexual attraction but also to those with at least a low sex drive or interest in sexual intercourse.

My rationale for this is that we GENERALLY (yes, not 100% conclusively but that isn't the point I'm trying to make here) know that a person is hetero-romantic, bi-romantic, or homo-romantic when they say that they are heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual. We aren't overly fussed if everyone is not (potentially obsessively) making sure their label is entirely accurate with regards to the complex mish-mash that is their sex and romantic lives.

To that extent, I'm not terribly interested in what any organisations who appropriate the term (whether they invented it or not) have to say on the matter. Personally, once it becomes an accepted part of the general language (particularly if its noun form is common rather than proper), it's out anybody's hands.

So when I say I'm asexual, I'm saying that I have a low-to-absent sex drive (a very physical phenomenon evidenced by the sudden loss of blood in the groin area when the notion of sex-related activities or the pertinent bodily regions even so much as crosses my mins) but still experience arousal based on my fetish and attraction based on the basic qualities of males being males and not females.

I'm not interested in calling myself homo-romantic with severe but not total Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. It's simply more convenient to describe myself as a gay asexual.

That is my personal view.

However, in coming to that conclusion, I realised I had to make as much justification for the use of the term 'asexual' in the way I use it as anybody else has to think carefully about the other terminology if they find it more appropriate.

I somewhat wonder if we grant ourselves enough time to worrying about being happy with who we are and the decisions we take about accepting that. For example, I've seen a lot if threads turning from helping a user come to terms with who they are into a word by word dissection of their original posts and people questioning the relatively obvious.

I'm not saying that's necessarily bad, because clarity on these things is important when giving meaningful advice and support.

So here's the deal: I'm a young guy and I masturbate to heterosexual porn frequently, but I don't really get aroused in the moment often. I know I'm capable of attraction to both sexes -- I might lean hetero-romantic and homosexual -- but I don't see anyone in school that I really lust after. I've had two girlfriends. Contact with the first gave me a raging boner one time, but normally I found her only aesthetically pleasing. The second I tried to fool around with, but I couldn't get up fully and then came prematurely. Anyway, both of these relationships were cut short by me not being able to connect with my own desires and express them. By the same token, I'm never really attracted to guys outside the realm of fantasy, and I've never even felt a touch of lust for avowed gays I've known. Imagining myself with another person has never been fully gratifying, be it a man or a woman.

I know it may be that I need to develop strong romantic relationships before I can get sexual; I have troubled getting attached to people at all. It may be that I repress homosexual feelings, but I don't think that's it, I wouldn't be afraid of it if it felt right. Or, I might just be asexual, but I find that disheartening. I want to please and be pleased by a lover. I want to feel love.

For the time being, I'll cut back on masturbation drastically and exercise and eat healthy ... I'll try to be friendly with everyone. Maybe something will come from that. But, if nothing does -- if I just end up imagining two other people together again and succumb to that -- should I consider myself asexual? Should I come out to the people who've tried to love me?

Some other notes: I'm mildly depressed most of the time because I have depersonalization disorder. In a sense, I feel out of it all the time. When I was much younger, I was very aroused by the nude female form. After that, I went into a homosexual phase, and when I realized how I felt, I had severe anxiety attacks. And after that, I considered myself bisexual for a long time. Still capable of being attracted to both sexes, but, given my inability to consummate these real forced feelings, I ask myself the question, 'Should I notch asexuality onto the ole belt?'

We never have kissed or had sex but do lots of hugging and touching above the belt. Usually initiated by him. 

He put his hand down the back of my shirt and messed with my bra. Having been in sexual relationships myself first thing I think he wants to take off my bra and mess with my boobs. But this made him yell out a horrified ""NO!"".

He is still a virgin. (27 years old) In my head I just think he is shy and uncomfortable about sex since he has never done it. But, that he wants to have sex at some point. I asked him if I could masturbate with him in the same bed thinking it would ease his insecurities. His response was ""why would you want to do that!?"". I let him know I hadn't gotten off since we moved in with each other. I was getting aroused by the way he was touching my neck. He got upset. Told me just to masturbate alone and he could wear headphones to not hear it going on.

I tried asking him why he wasn't interested in sex. This only infuriated him. He said he didn't want to be interrogated by me. For the first time he said we should probably just break up.

Some more history:

He has no desire to have children.

He would watch porn when he was young. But, didn't masturbate to it.

He never tried to get off until his early 20. He only tried to achieve an orgasm because I was miffed that he never had a desire to.

Myself and him blamed it on his sheltered religious upbringing.

The only reason he will give me why he doesn't want to have sex is because he has a low body image. He doesn't care if he is a virgin for the rest of his life because of it.

I first thought he just had a low testosterone level since he can't grow a beard. But, I think it's much deeper then that. I sought answers and found this reddit. I am just not 100% sure he is asexual because he does masturbate. He does look at porn. Particularly women getting massaged. And as I mentioned he likes lots of physical contact. Especially his back being scratched - for hours on end.

I don't think he is broken and want to fix him. If he was asexual it would bring me a great deal of comfort not having to think I just wasn't doing it for him and he was going to look for some one else.

I don't know how to bring this up with him with out upsetting him. Is it some thing we should even discuss since I am totally comfortable with it.

Then when you get to know her a bit, you see that she casually has men in her life. Never had a real relationship, but it's just been a slew of male friends that she casually hooks up and with hangs with, in her eyes they're FWBs. I've never seen her smitten by anyone, never comment on how any person is attractive, she just doesn't really notice or care. She does love to party, goof off, and have a good time though. I would say her closest relationship where she's been smitten by someone is me, however. We're just friends, we've never done anything sexual or romantic, nor have I ever hinted that I would want that. But I confide in her etc as best friends would. While most people, like guys she's hooking up with don't faze her much, I influence her a ton. I don't try to, but she is incredibly emotionally attached to me, and when we're hanging out as friends we almost seem couple-y, we're so close. She's what I'd call protective of me, my #1 fan, and no one else makes her happy as much as me being around does. For the longest time I relished in it, because she was my #1 closest friend too, and it felt great to have someone understand me so well and actually care about me. This entire time, I have also had flings with guys here and there. Most of the time they haven't really done it for me, she and I both knew I could do better, and she would always tell me this (I'm sorry if that sounds snobby, just how it was at the time). When we got drunk together, the usually casual, no-fucks-given best friend of mine would tell me how proud she was of me and that she'd miss me when we wouldn't be near each other. Of course in general I agree, it's fun hanging out, but I'm not torn up about it. You know, people do what they have to do, circumstances, etc, I still consider her my best friend and though we don't live near each other anymore, I don't think my closeness to her has changed.

Here's what's bugging me. As of late, I've been in a romantic relationship with a guy. I'm really happy, he's great, etc. When I tell her, she will say rationally she is happy that I'm happy, but she feels weird about it. She admits she's jealous of him, feels he's replacing her in my life, and sad we can't live together. In my mind, I'm like ""uhh...well sorry, what can I do, this is what I want."" 

Point is, she doesn't act sexual towards me or anyone, but she doesn't cling to anyone except me emotionally. Everyone else she's too cool for school for, but with me she'll do anything to help me as a friend. She'd drop everything to help me if I needed it, but I usually don't. I don't need her, I want to be her friend, but I don't need her in my life the way it seems she needs me emotionally. She doesn't support my relationship because it makes her sad. She thinks she'll lose me because of him. In reality, she wouldn't lose me because of him, but more because she's making things that aren't an issue in my mind, to be an issue. In my opinion based on gut-feeling, I think if I wanted to be romantic or more than friends with her, she would do it just because it's what I want. I don't think femininity or masculinity matters to her. I just don't know what to do because anytime I want to talk about these matters she gets weird, because rationally she gets my thinking, but she makes me feel bad for making the choices I have made in my life.

I want to come out to my friends and family, and let them know that I am a biromantic asexual for the following reason: I met up with some of my friends and their families recently, and some of them were gossiping about acquaintances from high school who had come out as gay. They weren't disapproving of that person's homosexuality, but there was a definite air of ""Oh my gosh, he's gay!?"" and a general, gossipy, uncomfortable (at least, to me) sense of inappropriate attention/interest. I think that if I came out properly, this would help my friends understand that not every person from sexual minority groups is ""that weird guy/girl from biology class"". There are definitely risks, and I know that I might end up losing a couple of friends over this. But I feel like it's important for me to speak up, as a member of the sexual minority in this community.

I've been shy about making my coming out a big deal (as in, a ""Guys, I have something important to tell you"" sort of thing), so I've been dropping hints to my friends. I'm not sure if they're subtle or glaringly obvious. The past three years, I've attended local LGBTQIA pride/allies gatherings, and have made my attendance to these events very obvious by posting on Facebook, inviting my friends along (though none of them actually came). When discussing dating and marriage, I've dropped lines like ""I'm not interested in sex at all"", and ""If I ever have a husband or a wife"".

My friends aren't idiots, and I think they at least think that I am bisexual or bi-curious. I'm not sure if they have picked up on the asexual part yet. (I feel like most of them wouldn't even know about asexuality.) My parents, on the other hand, are even less aware of LGBTQIA issues in general, and I get the feeling that they think this is a phrase. I've been quite frank with my mother and have told her how I feel about sex and about relationships quite plainly, without using words like ""biromantic"" or ""asexual"". My mother says that I just haven't met my ""prince charming"" yet.

I'm starting to get to the point where I feel like I do need to have a straight-up talk with both my friends and my parents, and clarify everything, instead of leaving clues and getting them to play detective.

How should I come out? Or have I come out already, and is this how it is? (Am I wrong in thinking that there should be some sort of ""climax"" in the form of acceptance or disapproval?) Could you possibly offer me some tips for preparing a ""coming out"" conversation with friends and/or family?

Now for the real reason for this topic.  How do you explain to someone that you are asexual majority of the time.  I do occasionally experience periods where I would enjoy endulgin' in sexual activities, but it is few and far between and I could go the rest of my life without ever havin' sex again.  I've met some really awesome guys recently, and as a guy I know that men can be really horny, especially gay men, but how do you explain to a gay guy ""I have no sexual interest"" and get them to understand.  I think I've told one of them specifically (the one I'm most interested in because our personalities are so close) that I flat out have no interest in sex, yet he keeps tryin' to convince me I'll come around.

I know the common answer will be ""Fuck him if he doesn't want to listen he doesn't deserve to be with you.""  But at the same time its hard to find someone that I get along with so well other than his over eagerness for sex.  (He's also a virgin and seemingly desperate, but unfortunately I would only be a let down for him on that aspect as well most likely because I have no sexual desire for him at all).

There is one person I consider myself to be in love with, but when I fantasize about him, I think about holding hands and cuddling, not sex.

I have never had a sex dream or a desire to masturbate, but I worry that's more social pressure than anything. I have zero romantic or sexual experience. Every time I've ever kissed anyone, it has been during truth or dare.

I don't think about sex unless it comes up. If someone says ""he's hot"" or something like that I will agree or disagree, but I won't come up with that out of the blue.

All signs so far probably point pretty strongly to asexuality, but I feel uncomfortable with that because of my lack of experience, somewhat like a petulant child saying he doesn't like sprouts before even trying them.

I’m guessing I’d actually be considered an ace. I’m comfortable with everything about sex but the act itself. I watch porn, I get off (sometimes with difficulty) due to boredom or horniness. My problem is that I really hate my lack of sexual attraction. I want to have sex and enjoy it and make it fun for all parties involved, but I just don’t. Can I grow out of it? Will I eventually hit an age (I am 20, by the way) where I *pop* and like it? Looking at other peoples’ and my own past experiences, it can be difficult to get a relationship going without sex happening. There are some people I’m pretty sure I want to be more than friends with, but the next stage would lead to sex/talks about sex that I’d much rather avoid. I have an intense desire to be like the majority of people and enjoy fucking, and have simpler deeper relationships with people.

Tl;dr Can I grow out of asexuality? How do I fix/come to terms with my aversion to sex?

The folks over at AVEN have been somewhat divided concerning their chatroom, since they feel like it scares away a lot of new people when things start getting crazy and off-topic.  However, they don't have the manpower to run a seperate chat for answering questions and stuff, especially not a chat where people wouldn't have to register (since registering can be potentially awkward, since then it's linked to your email account and someone could find out you're ace).

So, I had an idea.  What if [/r/asexuality](/r/asexuality) had an IRC channel to answer questions and whatnot?  It would be yet another reddit spinoff channel, but reddit gets a LOT more traffic than AVEN, and I can imagine people would look up ""asexuality"" here before they would go out and google and sign up for a new page.

Of course, it would need moderation to keep trolls at bay.  Since I'm often in #reddit, anyway, I could volunteer to help, though I can't make any promises about 24/7 moderation, since I also have class and a social life every once in a while.  But maybe influential members/moderators for this subreddit could mod the channel?

So I figured I'd ask anyway, and if anyone wants to just link me to their answer from another post, that's fine. Also, you are about to be inundated with text. Sorry.

Basically, I've only just become aware of my asexuality in the past year or so. I'm 21 years old, female, and up until recently I just thought I hadn't met the ""right person"" that would make me all tingly inside. I have dated both men and women, and ultimately I decided that I was a ""romantic asexual"" as the term seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong). I desire a close, romantic relationship with someone (gender nonwithstanding), and I adore cuddling and kissing, but when things fall below the waist I feel uncomfortable, turned off, and even on occasion disgusted.

Fast forward to the present. I still am looking for people to date, because I want to be close to someone. The past few relationships have all ended when we haven't been able to get over the hurdle of ""I just don't want sex"". I've never been able to come out and say what I've been thinking, so instead it always becomes this big elephant in the room and the relationship ends without me being able to express myself.

Right now I am dating a guy that is pretty amazing. We have so much in common, but at the same time we are introducing each other to new things all the time. We've only been going out for a month, and only just went ""Facebook official"". On our last date he finally put the moves on me. Since he already knew I am a virgin I managed to avoid the conversation by saying I ""wasn't ready"" and that I'd rather wait a little while longer into the relationship. Obviously both of these things are lies, which make me feel like crap about the whole thing.

So, I could really use some help, advice, links, or whatever you guys can provide. How do you start this conversation? Is it best to be candid, or is there some other subject that I can use to segue into my views. I think that I would be willing to go through with sex ultimately for someone that I loved, but I'm not at this point with him yet, and how do I tell him that without hurting his feelings, or worse, making him angry? On another point, it is super easy for me to talk about these things in text-form on the internet, but I suck at saying things out loud. How can I overcome my own insecurity to be open with him? I feel it is unfair to continue this relationship without telling him the whole story.

I also feel better about sharing this on reddit rather than on the AVEN forums simply because I know there is a smaller group on reddit. I feel uncomfortable even sharing this where a lot of people will see it, so that's why I'm not asking this same question there.

It seems like it would be a valuable thing to write because there hasn't been much written on it that goes beyond the standard ""Some asexuals masturbate"".  I know there are curious aces out there, but often they're afraid to ask about it and other sites that talk about those topics aren't the most ace-friendly places around.  And if someone works up the courage to ask, most people aren't comfortable answering anything more than ""Yes, I do"" or ""No, I don't"".

Before I begin, I’d like to find a bit about what you all think should be covered in such a series of posts.  Is there anything you think is important to mention?  Is there anything you’d like to know (or wish you’d known years ago)?

The last few days, I've been thinking about the possibility of being some form of grey-asexual, or(more likely) demisexual.   The really confusing part is whether I just have a low-libido these days, or am somewhere on the gray-a/demi scale.

I'm a trans woman(who has usually identified sexually as queer, since gender doesn't really govern who I'm attracted to), and while I was known to masturbate all the time before HRT(it was really sort of an addiction more than anything else; by the end it was a chore that I loathed doing, and my hand ached constantly &gt;.&lt; ), after HRT my libido finally plummeted.   I went through a few periods of simply not masturbating or really being sexual, and seem to have reached an equilibrium of ""once every few days.""   I'll still find people attractive sexually, definitely, but not at all in the same lustful way I used to; there's a hollowness to it for me these days(unless it's my BF).

It seems to me that-while I thought about it a lot as a teenager- my desire to actually do the deed is way lower than most people's seem to be.   I didn't give a shit in high school, and still don't.   Honest to God, it didn't matter to me if I had sex in high school, at all, and I could never understand why people made such a huge fuss over it.  It's always struck me more as a nice by-product of being in a relationship than anything else.

 What's really got me thinking about this, though, is that I seem to be some form of sex camel in relationships.  I've been in my first relationship for almost a year now, and my BF has numerous issues with sex and his body, so we don't really have sex much.  We've had sex of some sort(defining it as ""one of us has an orgasm"") plenty of times, but I can probably count the number of times that we've been completely naked together in a sexual way or touched each others genitals on both hands.   We've also had periods where we went without sex for weeks, maybe even a month.  And it honestly doesn't bother me in the slightest. Looking around the internet, and not just in the sex-crazy parts, that doesn't seem to be the norm.  I read about people leaving others because they don't 'fulfill them sexually. . .' I don't really get the idea of doing that, and can't imagine breaking up because of that.  I mean, I DO enjoy sex when it happens, but it's not a need for me at all nor do I feel it's important.   All that I really need is to to feel loved, cuddle with him, and maybe make out a bit, to be happy. 

So basically...yeah, I'm a bit confused where the line is drawn between ""grey-area asexuality""/demisexual, and just having a low-libido.  Like I said, I do masturbate, enjoy sex, and have sexual attraction(especially towards my partner) after all. But its not something I ever seek out, push for, or deem as 'important'.  Anyone mind explaining/expounding upon where the distinction lies between low-libido and demisexuality/grey-area asexuality?

**tl;dr** is that I do masturbate, and experience sexual attraction, and generally enjoy sex when it occurs to me; but I seem to be some form of magical sex camel since I don't need that in my relationship to be happy.

I don't really have any fun outside of ""oh, that feels good.""

What do you guys think?  I'd really like to have some discussion about it.  It would likely help me clarify the thoughts I'm trying to get out of my head and make some sense of them.  I feel like I'd be a lot happier with myself if I could understand where I stand.  Right now I just feel like I'm some oddity compared to everyone else around me.

EDIT:  To add to this, I've had sex twice and received oral once in the last 5 years or so.  While there is part of me that wants to have sex, I sometimes think it's just because I think I should want to have sex at this point.  Ultimately, while friends get almost freaked out at the idea of only having sex twice in 5 years...it doesn't seem all that big of a deal to me.

Also, I wasn't always like this.  While there has always been some division between what I found arousing in my mind and what I found arousing to do in real life, I used to be MUCH more active with sex and would do a larger variety of acts...and slowly over time, it changed to what I'm describing.",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,1371947357.0,,,True,t3_1gvtcn,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1gvtcn/i_think_im_greya/,

Help is much appreciated.,THROW868AWAY,7,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1gl9h4/advice_needed_concerning_my_girlfriend_help_is/,"First I'm going to explain the situation I am in with her and then ask some questions that I hope the community here can help me with. I need to apologize in advance if I mix up any lingo or say anything offensive.  I myself am not an asexual (and I'm not entirely sure my gf is) and I don't know how to avoid all the potential pitfalls of wording.  

I'll organize my information into three categories because I feel that's the best way to give you a sense of where we are. Also, note that she is in her early 20s:


Romantic:

- She loves cuddling, kissing, holding hands, and staring into each other's eyes.

- She tells me that she is in love with me (and that I'm the first guy she has felt this way about).

- She talks about getting married to me one day and being the mother to my children.


Sexual:

- She has no problems with me touching her anywhere I want.

- I perform oral sex on her which she tells me that she enjoys (but more on this later).

- She has told me that she masturbates. 


Non-sexual / Asexual

- She has only initiated kissing twice (both times were after I did something romantic). (Also, I don't terribly mind this; though I loved both times she started it).

- She doesn't know if she has ever orgasmed.  When I perform oral sex for her it seems more like she is tensing up / breathing harder / fighting it than enjoying it or moaning. However, again, she tells me that she likes it and seems to be excited when we are about to start. There are moments that seem to me like they might be orgasms, for instance I've felt her kegels contract involuntarily as well as muscles in her legs and pelvic region.  Still, when I ask she says she isn't sure that these are orgasms.  For me, as a man, orgasms are like a release - there is a definite point at which one occurs.  Of course this is not the situation for women so it's something I naturally have trouble understanding.  (I understand that this whole point may be better posed to a sex advice forum, but I feel that it is just one part of what I am trying to come to terms with).

- We haven't had sex yet.  She has told me that she is willing to have sex with me, but I am unwilling because of the issues below.

- She has only had sex with one previous boyfriend and she tells me that she disliked it every time because of pain from penetration.

- When I am performing oral for her I do penetrate with my fingers (this is, admittedly, a strategy on my part to get her to associate penetration and pleasure).  She says that this doesn't do much for her and any pleasure that she derives is primarily from stimulation of the clitoris. 

- She has used the word ""asexual"" when talking about herself once - it was when she was telling me about her past experience with sex.

- She tells me that she never really feels ""horny"" and doesn't experience sexual attraction towards anyone, including me. For instance she has never seen a good looking guy in public or in a movie and thought ""I would like to have sex with him"". 



That's all I can think of for now, but I can certainly answer any questions you may have.

Here are my questions:

I think she is incredibly sexy and I would like to have sex with her.  She says that she is willing.  However I know her past experiences and I don't want her to do something which we both believe she will not enjoy.  How do I deal with this situation?  Is it fair of me to have sex with her? 

Is she an asexual? (I know there's probably no way to know this absolutely for sure, but I'm interested in what people who are knowledgeable on the subject might have to say based on the information above).

I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life with this girl.  I love her more than I had ever imagined I could love anyone.  How do I cope with our differences in libido? If she truly doesn't enjoy sex but is willing to do it for me because she loves me, how do I handle that?

I know that sexuality is a changing thing and while I by no means want her to become something that she cannot be or change her if she doesn't want to change I also know that she would like to enjoy sex.  So are there any tips for what I can do to get her to enjoy it (mainly penetration)?

I was messing around on the internet and stumbled upon the HuffPo (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630) post about asexuality. I was reading through and ended up on the AVEN site, and found some stuff about grey asexuality, and immediately burst into tears. I'm pretty sure the definition fits me but it's really scary to realize that and I'm worried that I'm jumping into it too quickly.

I love relationships and I've pretty much been in one since puberty, and I've had sex in these relationships, and outside of them. It's always sort of been a ... well, that was fun because I like you and you had fun, or that was fun because I was spending intimate time with you, or, a lot of the time... that wasn't really fun but I know you like it and I want you to be happy. I can't tell if it's just me not knowing my body because I don't masturbate (and don't feel the need to ever, though my friends keep telling me to try it anyway), or if it's just me not really being into sex. It's about the same fun level as eating good food or watching a good TV show. 

I really want to be in relationships and cuddle and I don't mind having sex once I've spent a lot of time with the person and feel comfortable with them and they know my deal where I've never really had a great sexual experience and I don't really know my own body, but I don't know if that makes me grey asexual, or even if identifying as such is productive. 

Anyway, I'm just super new to all this and wanted to get some support and advice from you all, especially people who came to the realization that they were asexual/grey-A/demisexual, etc. after having been in sexual relationships. 

Also, I just got out of a relationship with a guy who identified as polyamorous, and I felt really uncomfortable not being exclusive, and got quite jealous when he would make out with others in front of me, so I'm not sure if that's another layer or what. I feel bad because I do want to have exclusivity with my partner, but I also don't really know what's going on with myself sexually, and I don't want to limit them. I really do want a partner though, someone who I can care deeply for and who will care about me, and who I can spend a ton of time with. 

Thank you for helping me out with this! I'm really not sure where else to turn.

I'm new here.  in the last few weeks I've started being around and having feelings for a guy who is asexual (I'm sexual) and just feel completely lost.  I came here hoping to talk to some people who are also asexual in order to try and understand more about his orientation.  I hope I'm not intruding on posting here, even though I am sexual myself.

I've told him how I feel and he tells me he has a crush on me too.  We've made out and fallen asleep holding hands every night the past week and he told me this means something to him.  When I realized I was falling in love fast I started to feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him due to a lack of understanding of asexuality.  I'm afraid of doing anything he is uncomfortable with and insecure about whether he wants me at all as well since I'm used to partners wanting me sexually as an indicator.

I cant figure out whether I am attracted to him because of or despite his asexuality.  What I want is an understanding that goes beyond sexual desire but I'm also used to having sex with people I like the way I like him.  I'm afraid of getting hurt because he's never tried a relationship (and consequentially never got hurt from one) and is sometimes abrasive.  He teases by saying sexual things and it just confuses me.

My SO and me have been together (and lived together) for almost 5 years now, we're mid 20s.

We rarely have sex, but on the other hand have the greatest relationship possible. We're romantic, intimate in many other ways - and often hear that people envy us.

But he doesn't have much of a sex-drive. Granted, we do have sex - but its more once every two months or so, and when it happens he's not very interested in the act. 

I've been worried about this - at first of course the typical (is he not attracted? But then again he seems to be eternally fascinated by my body and likes stroking, petting and such - just not leading to anything sexual) but also medical.

He's told me he's been this way for a long time, that he's never really been attracted to people the way others are. It didn't seem like a ""big deal"" for him as a teenager or now - and he was pegged for being gay due to his lack of interest in girls back then. He's only ever had one girlfriend before me, and apparently she complained a lot of the lack of sex. 

I do not want to be that kind person who pressures him to have sex. If he doesn't want to then I can handle myself, as long as I can snuggle up in his arms later I'm dandy.

Even as much as we respect each other it is difficult to bring this up. I just want what is best for him and me. I just want to understand what is going on, and not worry about it. I've tried bringing up the possibility of him being asexual, but he just gets quiet and withdrawn.

Any of you have this? I'm pretty sure I do. When I masturbate I feel only a little physical pleasure and none of this euphoria I read about. Come to think of it, I don't know that I've ever experienced euphoria ('a mental and emotional condition in which a person experiences intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy', according to Wikipedia)...

I don't see my condition as a problem though. I'm pretty happy with my life as it is. Literally the only reason I masturbate is for release but I'm trying to quit, because it takes up time I could use for other things. This is getting too personal...

I'm here over from the Gaymer community, because I figure y'all probably would have better insight to this issue.  I'm trying to understand whether this important boy in my life (for lack of better appellation) is asexual, and what that might mean for our relationship.  I'm not familiar with asexuality issues, so if I give offense, please let me know &lt;3  I'm really interested in the intersection between asexuality, libido, and sex negativity.

So, I'm a gay 22 year old male with a very high sex drive.  My boyfriend(?) (we're long distance right now, and unattached-it's complicated) and I were together for a long time, and had a significant level of intimacy emotionally, and physically.  Sex, however, was a consistent issue throughout the time we were (and sorta kinda are...) together.  He identifies as a gay male, and is very comfortable with that.  He also says he ""just doesn't have a high sex drive"".  

I've asked him before, and he doesn't really identify as asexual, but it's a bit confusing, and he:

-Enjoys sex, but admits that he doesn't think of it as anything really especially desirable.  It's 'nice', but like other nice things.  It's pleasurable and he gets off, but not mind-blowing like I find it.
-Is often on a totally different level of conversation than I am, and often doesn't understand innuendo.
-Finds discussions of sex, explicit flirting, etc. gross, or just unappealing.
-Usually doesn't get horny easily, and doesn't often understand when I get turned on by some intimacy like cuddling.
-Doesn't 'need' sex, and doesn't attach the same emotional importance to it that I do.
-He's REALLY REALLY hyper-aware of the social context of sex, and has difficulty opening up in an 'inappropriate' setting.
-His crushes and fantasies before he came out mostly consisted of wanting to cuddle, rather than have sex (though there was sexual feeling attached).


And as I understand it, those are pretty within the normal spectrum of asexuality.  But where does that intersect with just having a low sex drive?  Or, of being socialized to think of sexuality as 'bad' and attaching unhappy feelings to it.  For instance:

-He does get horny and turned on when sex happens, enjoys it greatly, and will occasionally initiate it.
-He grew up in an extremely conservative, repressive Asian family where any expression of sexuality was very inappropriate, and was raised with sexuality not really being a part of life.
-He's never really dated anybody before me, so all of his previous sexual explorations were emotionally meaningless and viewed as 'negative'.  As we began to date more, he opened up a lot.
-When we're completely alone, and he doesn't have to worry about the social context, he's more open to sex, and will often desire it.



So what I'm trying to understand it where all three fit in.  As inoffensively as I can frame it: where does socialized sex-negativity intersect with a lower libido, or when does it transcend to asexuality?  

Like, would what I have described be indicative of asexuality?  He's definitely said before that he likes sex, but that there's also other things that I likes as well (sort of like the 'cake' discussion).  But well...he does get horny, and turned on by people he's attracted to, just fairly less than average.  He's been in such a sex-negative culture his entire life, and it's hard for him to fully deal with that.  


So, any advice would be appreciated.  I understand how it'd be difficult to say for a single person, but what do you think?  I'm really attached, and deeply care for him, but sex is also a really important part of intimacy for me, and I'm worried about a long-term relationship.

I've never been on a date or had a boyfriend (I'm 25, f), but the reasons on why are all convoluted in my head. 

I've always been overweight and extremely shy, so I never figured a guy would be interested in me, and I was too afraid of people thinking of me as that pathetic fat girl. Therefore, I wonder if I mentally convinced myself that I wasn't interested at all, just to prevent myself from being left out when everyone else had boyfriends. I know I've never seen myself as desirable, or been able to conceive of someone seeing me as such. When I was in Jr. High and High school, I would occasionally have little crushes, but I haven't even had one of those in years. 

When I think about the concept of having sex, I'm curious, but I don't feel as though its some great thing I need to have, and I really have no idea what 'lust' would feel like. I've experimented with masturbating, but it doesn't feel like anything special to me. Sex scenes in books bore the hell out of me or squick me out. I'm not even sure if my liking for certain actors *coughNealPatrickHarriscough* is attraction, or aesthetic appreciation. I find being kissed on the lips gross.

Part of me would like to at least experiment with dating a guy (or a girl, I suppose) and having sex, but I don't think it would be fair to use another person just to find out if I'm asexual, or have instead mentally repressed myself.

Problem number 2 is that part of me doesn't want to enjoy it. I don't want to stop being Asexual, because in a way, it makes me feel better than other people.

So often, men are depicted as controlled by sex. Even the most intelligent, rational and controlled people will drop all that just to get some 'action', and because I am immune to that, I feel superior. I feel like I'm better than those people in that regard, because while they may spend lot of time thinking about other people's genitals, I'm thinking about something productive, or interesting.

I fear that if I became sexual (if it's even possible), then I'd be a lesser person, driven by hormones rather than thoughts. I'm completely in control of my sexual desires now, because I have none. I like it that way.

Oh boy, where do I start? I'm sorry if this doesn't make too much sense, it's 2:00 am here and I'm tired.

I am an 18 year old male and have never ever felt sexual attraction toward anyone in the real. I do find people (particularly women but also men) aesthetically pleasing but never feel the desire for sex. Seems obvious so far.

However, I masturbate almost daily starting when I was fourteen and usually to some kind of ""hentai"". (I put it in quotes because I usually don't look at depictions of sex; it usually seems to detract from my enjoyment.) Also when I masturbate I don't imagine having sex with the girl; it just makes the experience weird and less enjoyable. I have a certain fetish that I usually just look for pictures of. Also, I have found that masturbating to hentai is slower going than masturbating with no such stimulation; I have no idea whether or not that's normal.

A little more background: I have had exactly one crush... maybe. I was sixteen. Logic dictated that I should have wanted to bone her constantly or something. But no such urge existed. I just wanted to be with her. I hear all kinds of accounts of people having crushed on people when they were 10 or something and having lots of interests.

I know you probably get tired of these ""WHAT THE HELL AM I!???!11one!!/"" sort of posts, but I've been doing a lot of soul searching recently, and would genuinely appreciate your opinions.

First off, I'm a 20 year old male. I definitely know I'm not 'normal', by society's standards. I've never been interested in sex or relationships, or at least, I've never met another person who has inspired me in such a way as to make me want to pursue a relationship with them. 

I can definitely appreciate the attractiveness of other people, but it's never in a sexual way. I never think to myself: ""Oh, she/he's hot, I would very much like to have intercourse with her/him"". 

I can't recall any single incident in my life where I have been overcome by lust for another person. I can't even recall having a proper 'crush' on anyone (I don't seem to crave companionship, or form any strong emotional bonds with anyone, beyond a platonic friendship type relationship). There have been occasions where other women have made sexual advances on me, but I will feel generally creeped out by the whole situation and immediately make it clear that I am just a friend, and always will be.

Cool, I hear you say. You're asexual. 

I would agree with you, but the one thing that throws me every time I come to this decision is the fact that I can become aroused by, and masturbate to porn. Any porn; straight, gay, lesbian, whatever. If it's of a sexual nature, it'll probably turn me on and I'll enjoy watching it. In fact, I actively seek out porn when I masturbate, maybe once or twice a week. I seem to favour gay porn (m/m), but it doesn't really matter.

I know that a lot of asexuals masturbate and have fantasies, but I just can't shake the feeling that if I'm becoming aroused by watching two humans going at it, then surely I am sexually attracted to them in some way.

Alot's happened. And for a change of pace, I'm not going to talk about it, but something else entirely. Since I and a couple other people are making a new space, however, in light of what has gone on, many might see it as another splinter.

Actually, I'm just writing to let you, and people in every single related subreddit I can find (from the larger r/lgbt to the asexual community), about a new project on its way.

To keep it brief, we have the idea of forming a small Big Siblings program on this site. It would be intended to serve the mentoring needs of all people with non-normative sexualities or gender identities/presentations.

We're still coordinating, but there are a few things worth noting here that are already solid.

None of the moderators of this space will have any affiliation with any moderators of any other space, no crossover or overlap. The polarizing events across multiple boards make crossover inappropriate, especially given the sensitive challenge and special needs of those who would be seeking mentors in the forum.

It won't be a discussion forum. People will be gently encouraged into all the various subreddits available to them, with neither judgment nor preference on our part, to have public discussions as they wish. Our place will be only for collecting posts from those volunteering as mentors and those looking to be mentored.

Finally, mentors will be held to high standards of conduct and verification (though in no way are required to share any identifying information), and as such will never be drawn from those who have made their names by way of polarizing activities, on either side of any particular controversy.

We thought you all here might appreciate being aware of this coming service and space, and welcome questions. Further, if the moderators here deem this post inappropriate, deleting it won't result in any private message fussing or other harassment.

Thanks for your time &lt;3

I've taken part in some sexual activity (oral, mainly) because my ex was interested. I've masturbated (though with such a low libido, I rarely do and it's to just out of necessity if that makes any sense).

I feel no sexual attraction though, and I keep trying to explain that, but she says that it's only because I don't know better.

Also I didn't really feel like fit in with the asexual community.  Everyone always talks about their SO's and I can't relate.

I’ve had this idea bopping around in my head for a while to have a monthly ace community meeting to discuss important/relevant issues to our community, ideas we might want to explore, touching base on all sorts of issues, and holding a community space that isn’t necessarily AVEN. In a post-Pride call with David Jay, we talked about it and decided to try it out.

Therefore I’m pleased to announce the first of several upcoming Monthly Asexuality Town Hall Series meetings, open conversations for the ace community to talk about important issues. Next Saturday, I’ll be hosting a conversation called “Asexual Discrimination."" There’ll be about 30 minutes of information, about 30 minutes for Q&amp;A, and then an hour afterwards for free discussion among everyone who is there. We’ll do the whole thing online through Google hangout, so if you have a webcam and feel comfortable, you may be able to be on video, and if you don’t, you can still participate in chat.

**URL forthcoming — we’re setting up the logistics this weekend, but wanted everyone to be able to mark their calendars, too**

Join us next weekend, Saturday July 20th, and we’ll kick off with the theme “Asexual Discrimination."" We’ll talk about the survey that was published last year that says that intended bias against asexuals is as high or higher than the lesbian, gay, or bisexual communities, we’ll talk about the DSM V and the pathologization of asexuals, and we’ll talk about employment protections.

3pm Eastern Daylight Time 
8pm British Summer Time 
9pm Central European Summer Time

There are plenty of openly gay and lesbian people, and nobody has a problem with it. But to my knowledge, despite living in such a diverse neighborhood, I've never met someone who was asexual. So finding this subreddit I suppose didn't inform me of the existence of asexuality, but more made me realize how little I know about it. So if you guys wouldn't mind, I have some genuine questions. If any sound offensive, please know that I don't intend it. 

* How does one find out that they're asexual? Wouldn't it be much easier to assume that they had just never met anyone they were interested in? I mean, it seems society just doesn't shed light on the subject, and an absence of awareness would lead to a lot of denial.

* Do asexual people ever masturbate? I mean, even if there isn't something that specifically turns one on, doesn't it sort of inherently feel good? Or is that an ignorant assumption? 

* I've looked through the subreddit and seen a few references to the fact that asexual people sometimes fall in love and have romantic relationships. I've also seen people address the fact that asexual people can fall in love with no sexual interest in another person. If that's so, what is the difference between said relationship, and a friendship? I know it sounds ignorant, but I always sort of thought of relationships that way.

* Kind of piggybacking off of the last question, if an asexual person is in a relationship with a heterosexual person, or even a homosexual person, would that couple ever have sex? I mean, I would assume the asexual person wouldn't particularly enjoy it, but would they make that sacrifice for their partner? And if not, would they let their partner have sex with other people? 

* Also piggybacking off of the last question, does a sexual person in a relationship with an asexual person become sexually frustrated often? I mean, even if that couple did have sex, surely it wouldn't be very often. Wouldn't that bother the partner?

* Do asexual people have any preference in the gender of their romantic partner if they so chose to have one? Or does it very by person? 

*  What is sex like to an asexual person? Sort of vague, but I just really can't wrap my brain around it.

Thanks to anyone who can answer any of my question. Please note that while they might seem ignorant I sincerely mean each and every one. I know it might be that many of these questions were answered somewhere on this subreddit, but I'd like the opportunity to ask follow-up questions if possible as well.  

Edit: This is an alternative account if the username didn't give it away. Sorry that I haven't really checked up on the answers, but I really appreciate all of them. This has been great.

Edit 2: It's unlikely that anyone will see this, but I just thought of one more question. Hypothetically, if two asexual people were in a happy romantic relationship, what would be considered cheating? I mean it's not like either of them would have sex with someone else (right?). See that's what I found confusing about asexual relationships. I understand that it's common to want to cuddle or kiss, but would it be cheating if one of the people cuddled with someone else?

And vaginas are just gaping holes into oblivion. Also ew.

I can be physically attracted to people, if they have their clothes on or aren't exposing genitalia. That's a turn off, I guess.


I'm not interested in sex at all.
Not interested in relationships either, I've only had a crush once, when I was 12. I have had fleeting feelings for people, a girl I met for an hour who had schizophrenia.

So I realized a few months ago that I'm probably asexual or at least grey. I've had a few previous boyfriends but we never did anything physical and they ended alright. Anyways, despite what basic logic was telling me, I agree'd to go out with a close friend. He doesn't know I'm ""asexual"" but we've talked about similar things and he knows I'm uncomfortable with most sexual/touchy things. 

Anyways, it dawned on me a few days ago that I should be honest with him and just break it off. I also realized I'm not really ready for a relationship at all right now, and I might never be. We've been dating close to a month, so I figure it'd be best not to wait and just get it over with? (Sorry, I'm rambling)

My main question is, how should I go about breaking up with him and telling him this? I'm really, really nervous. Sorry if this was hard to read or anything.

So before I knew about asexuality, I was the kind of person that thought everyone didn't like sex (heck, I still think like that). So when my friends all started getting boyfriends, talking about - and having - sex, I started getting really lonely. One of my friends though didn't seem to be like that - but maybe that was just my optimistic view of it.   
Anyway, me and her really hit it off and became pretty close friends. Then we started uni. She got a boyfriend, which I didn't like - but I still thought she was like me. And it felt so good to not feel alone (as I'm sure a lot of you can understand). I ended up moving in with her for about 6 months. It was during the end of those six months that she got an UTI. Now I thought it was a completely innocent thing, like she'd wiped the wrong way or something. But now that I look back I feel stupid for not having seen the evidence... 
Anywho, I took her to the doctor and went in with her because she was so scared. The doctor asks 'are you sexually active.' My friend stalls for a bit, so I quickly said 'no' because I thought she was embarassed. But my friend shook her head and was like, 'no. I am sexually active.'   
So, as you can imagine. I completely freaked out. It felt like the world had just fallen away around me; I was an alien in some foreign world, not sure where I belong kinda thing.   
So anyway, I basically fell into a lonely slump and couldn't talk to my friend without being reminded that I was a freak who didn't belong in this world. So I moved out shortly after and didn't talk to her (or anyone) very much at all.   
After about 6 months I calmed down enough. I'd started writing a story about the perfect relationship (a romantic one), and it kinda gave me hope for the future. So I managed to become good friends with the afformentioned girl again.   
After I discovered sexuality, my feelings all made sense and I explained to her what had happened, and that I was really sorry for how I had acted. But like, I couldn't help it. So I thought she was cool with it.   
Then like a year after that, she randomly brings the incident back up in a really accusational way. And that really hurts. I feel so bad already for the way I acted, but then her saying that brings back all the feelings from that time.   
So yeah, at the moment I feel really angry and sad. And just needed to write it all down and tell people who can empathize with me. Maybe hear some similar stories from people and how they've dealt with it... 

tl;dr: I freaked out when I thought my similar-minded friend had sex. Stopped talking to her because I felt alone and sad. Got over it. Friends with her again. She keeps bringing it up accusationally, which is really upsetting because I couldn't help the way I was feeling and have expressed my apologies profusely ",,False,self,t5_2qv0q,1371293933.0,,,True,t3_1ge7aw,http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1ge7aw/just_a_rant_to_people_who_might_understand/,

I do get sexually aroused pretty easily, but thing is I have absolutely no interest in dating or having sex. I just ""take care of it"" and call it a night.

When I check out women on the street I mostly do it to critique their choice of clothing. The thought of getting close with a woman has become alien and rather displeasing, unless said woman is a family member. I feel there is something horribly wrong about this.

I am fairly attracted to the female body, that much I know. I've considered the possibility that I might be gay, but eventually concluded I'm definitely straight.

The closest analogy I can think of is being a *huge* fan of chocolate, but when you go out to eat some chocolate cake, you just don't feel like eating it. It turns you off to the point where you just walk out of the cake-shop.

I thought that if I dropped the candy bars, I might have appetite for the cake. And indeed, the times I tried that I actively reached out for the cake, but when it came down to sitting down and eating it, I never could.

I've gotten in trouble plenty of times already due to my lack of commitment in the relationships I successfully got myself into. While I was thrilled to pursue a relationship, the moment it's made official I feel like breaking up and running away. I eventually do at the first opportunity.

I thought maybe I needed some space. Try a little at a time. I played an MMO for a few months, I thought perhaps a long-distance relationship would be a good way to get over it. I did find a pretty cute girl whose company I very much enjoyed, but after a month or so I broke up with her and started flirting with every confirmed female I knew to forget. I never ended up dating online after that, I just felt disgusted with myself and disappeared.

I'm afraid to try again because I fear I might just end up hurting another innocent girl because of my problems. I might as well just label myself asexual.

Sex makes me anxious when it's over. I can get pleasure out of it while it's happening but afterwards the risks of failed protection or even just the ""how does this change my overall relationship with this person?"" taints the sexual acts and makes it undesirable to me. Those who I have gotten very close with and whom I have come to trust very much, understand this aspect about me and will tread carefully when the topic of sex is approached or when they desire it. 

I guess the question I need answered or advice area I need help with is: how do I approach this with potential new matches or partners?

It's just so hard to explain that I would rather be alone 95% of the time and wait for someone I connect with than have a meaningless relationship and sex with a person I kind of get along with. I am a hopeless romantic, but I am also slow and cautious about it, and being a Gray-A makes it even more difficult to find a mate.

Last night I was out and a girl I've know for some while was coming on to me hard.
She pops the inevitable question, so why don't you have a girlfriend? And because I actually value her I responded honestly, probably because I'm asexual (some, but very low sex drive). 
I swear it took less than 2 secs for her to lose all interest in me and she was on to the next guy. Man, I think I've never felt lower.

More of a rant than anything, I just felt like chatting a bit since none of my friends understand me.

Most of my friends, female and male, have this impression that I'm cruel towards girls, despite me not actually doing anything to them. 
But when they are coming on to me and I more or less ""stonewall"" them they think that I'm saying something cruel. I've had girls slap me and cry because I wasn't responding to their advances and it's gotten to the point where I actively try to avoid them, as to not spoil an otherwise good evening.

What do you guys/girls do to let them off without making a scene? Without shouting out I'M ASEXUAL, I live in a small town and the word spreads quickly, I'm afraid that they'll just label me gay, since it seems that if you're not into girls, you gotta be into guys.

My grandfather even joked about it all the time, saying stuff like ""so, you get any of them pretty girls at your school yet?"". I guess I never realized how literal that joke was until now...

My biggest issue is dealing with people telling me I'm making the choice to be celibate, and that I'm not actually asexual. Even an asexual told me this, and this is really frustrating me since it's the same thing my family has been telling me for years!

But I swear, when all the other kids went through ""that phase"", I felt left out because I was told ""one day, you'll like girls too"" but it never happened. I mean, I don't think they have cooties anymore (haha) but that attraction I was told I would get never came.

I'm 25 year old female, and have been romantic asexual my whole life. Of course, not having really experienced sexual attraction/drive, I wasn't *sure* that I was asexual since I had nothing to compare it to, until around the time I turned 25. 

I couldn't stop looking at r/gonewild, which was not really out of the ordinary, I figured it was just a phase - sometimes I really like looking at other sorts of pictures (boats, kittens, cities, etc) then I lose interest. Then the drive to have sex kicked in, and I couldn't say off craigslist/casual encounters. I almost went through with several nsa sex encounters, and did go all the way with one. 

I figured this was the new reality, once I got used to having these drives I'd had more control over them and would hopefully have a more stable sex partner, not some random stranger with no accountability. 

Then the drive went away. Over the course of a few months it was less and less, and now I'm back to my regular asexual self. The memory of being sexual, of caring about doing things to maintain ""sexyness"" seems so far away.  

Here's the thing:

I date men (no particular strong preference for men emotionally, just how things have turned out), but my (ex-)sex drive was 100% female-oriented. I worry that this will come back, and I'll have to break up with who I'm seeing, or have some sort of work-around.

*28/f, 11 years of consistent sexual experiences, I am beginning to identify as a ""grey-a""(?)*

As I posted in the title, I find that I am not your average bear but I do really enjoy some of the ""normal"" things of day to day life. I would love to have a life partner I could trust and adventure with as well as biologically have children with. My personal struggles/feelings about my sexually seem to run contrary to fulfilling this dream.

* I rarely feel physical attraction (twice in my life?) and I don't recall ever feeling ""horny"" for a person or desiring to have sex with someone. I find many people ""attractive"" in an admiring, aesthetically pleasing-to-the-eye sort of way. Like a beautiful artwork or a nice car.
* I have learned to associate romantically wanting for ""hornieness"" because typically if I want to ""be with"" someone there is sex involved.
* I have never really had a desire to engage in sex. I have had sex because, well, ""thats what you do when you are dating someone"". 
* I masterbate but it's more about the physical release than a fantasy about being with someone. (It can be stress relieving or self-soothing) It can range between masterbating a handful of times in a month to not touching myself for 3+ months and not even realizing it)
* I am super curious about sex in all of its forms. I love human beings and am absolutely fascinated by sexuality in all its forms and why it's such a huge deal. For example, I become almost giddy over voyerisim in s&amp;m, bondage, role-playing etc., but its because its so outside of my normal days experience and its just amazing what humans love, enjoy and what makes them feel fulfilled. But I don't want to actively participate in it. 
* Sex can physically feel good, I can orgasam, blah, blah, blah... but I could take it or leave it. Watch a movie? Eat a sandwich? Go for a walk? Have sex? I get way more excited about possibility of eating sandwich and going for a walk with my love.
* I understand that for many people sex is a very BIG part of their lives and its one major way some people feel loved and feel connected to their partner. I am open to engaging in sexual interactions for these reasons. I don't usually care if my partner and I ever have sex, the only time I do care is when I feel like my partner is unfulfilled and I want to reaffirm our intimate/emotional bond.
* I have not yet had the gift of a polyamourus relationship, but it is something that I am really open to and have offered to past partners so that they may seek out what they need, and are not getting from our relationship, in a healthy way. (I have always been turned down and it has led to my partners hurt feelings, feelings of not feeling loved and such when I felt like I was just trying to be generous and open to having everyone have their needs fulfilled)
* I also feel a bit trapped and overwhelmed by the concept of long term monogamy and I believe I could be a better partner to an open, healthy, trust/love/respect-filled, polyamorus/monogamish relationship.


*After all of those dynamics the reality is still that I want to find a life partner and I want to have biological children.*

**TL;DR - My question is, how do I go about finding the right partner(s) for me? What resources are there out there? (I have not yet found a poly/mono/asexual/grey-a dating web site.)

Yes, this is one of those ""not sure if asexual"" posts. Although admittedly I haven't gone too far back in your archives so I'm not sure if this is a common or obnoxious sort of post. But I am and have been quite confused over my sexuality -- or lack thereof -- for some time and after having thought it to death I've decided to ask the opinion of strangers on the Internet. Yes, that's my level of desperation.

So, first, the basics: 22 year old female, no severe psychological/physical problems that would cause low or absent sex drive. I'm capable of achieving orgasm and do masturbate occasionally. I've found the frequency depends on the hormone levels that come with my menstrual cycle.

All throughout my youth I didn't partake in the usual crushing, dating, flirting or dedications of true love to that boy whose last name you don't know in your homeroom. At the time I rationalized it away as that I had the rest of my life to worry about that sort of thing. I tried to keep an open mind, though; one of my closets friends through high school was gay, and he taught me that I might not be into dating simply because I wasn't into boys.

But high school came and went and not only was I not into boys, I didn't seem to be all that into girls, either. I was largely introverted and still am, but I'm perfectly capable of maintaining regular friendships. But I've never met someone and thought, *Gosh, that person is desirable. I want to have a relationship and/or have sex with them.*

I took a gap year before college (I was very young for my grade and wanted to catch up/earn some money for college), and met a boy named Steve at my job at a bookstore. We were quick friends, both into gaming and other nerdy hobbies. He asked me out, and I said yes.

He was a perfectly nice guy and we had a good enough time. We had Italian and saw *Beowulf*. I enjoyed myself, all things considered, and while he was clearly very into me, I couldn't manage to reciprocate. He asked me out a few more times, which I declined.

Skip forward a few years. I'm online and I meet a very nice guy called Tom. We get along marvelously, both into Warcraft, arguing about politics and the fine art of trolling. Our friendship goes on for several months, and one day we end up talking about our romantic lives. I tell him about Steve (since that's all there is to tell, really), and he tells me about some of his past girlfriends and sex life. Eventually he expresses interest in meeting, and perhaps establishing a romantic tryst.

Around this time I had heard about asexuality and was very nervous about how it almost perfectly described me. I thought that I couldn't be sure until I at least tried to start something resembling a relationship, so I find a free weekend and drive down to his place. We spend a few days together, he shows me around his town. He's obviously into me, invites me to sleep in his bed (""Nothing hinky,"" he swears). And even though I'm flattered at the proposition, it just isn't in me to say yes. He may be into me but I just wasn't into him.

So now here I am.

I'm perfectly capable of finding members of both sexes attractive objectively (I'm an avid member of r/ladyboners), and can appreciate physical beauty just fine. Likewise I can be attracted to people mentally; my mother is of the firm belief that the reason I'm still single is because ""No one can live up to Sherlock Holmes"", who I've arguably been in love with since I was 13.

But despite that, I feel no desire whatsoever to seek out a relationship with anyone. And even when others seek out relationships with me -- even when I could probably be in a worthwhile emotional romantic relationship with them -- I always feel it's stunted by a lack of physical attraction.

Maybe I just want to write this for the catharsis. But a real part of me wants to hear the opinions of people who've, presumably, been through something at least *similar* to this. I've read all the articles and have lurked in all the forums, but I still don't know what to think.
