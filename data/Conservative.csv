You've got folks like Bachman and Santorum running successful primary campaigns - even *winning* some primaries.  That's ridiculous and does **not** reflect well on the party.

Now you've got Akin, the primary winner in Missouri, talking about ""legitimate"" rape.  That's fucking Poly-Sci 101:  Don't apply adjectives to rape!

These ridiculous, out-of-the-mainstream statements made repeatedly by these lunatics do nothing but distract the party from focusing on budget cutting, tax reductions, reducing the size of government and getting the country moving in the right direction again.  We're now going to have a week - the week before the convention - where Romney and Ryan are going to have to field questions about what some dumbasss in Missouri said.  And after the convention, they'll likely be responding to something similar since they've foolishly given Santorum a speaking spot at the convention.

I know it won't happen, but I'd love to see Romney &amp; Ryan come out today and call ""bullshit"" on the social conservatives.  Clearly, this team is in the position they are in *because of their fiscal policies*.  As the leaders of the party, they should champion those fiscal policies and disassociate themselves, and the Party, from the social lunacy the emanates from the other wing of the Party.  They should go so far as to remove any anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-muslim, anti-anything from the official party platform for the convention.

Something Obama did nothing of last night and honestly put out one of the poorest debate performances I've ever seen. No facts, no knowledge, just garbage. Obama failed to debate what Romney was saying in the present. Who cares what his ""plans"" were in the past or what not, guess what, the man next to you happens to be incredibly prepared, knowledgeable, and ready to refute every one of your points and stop pretending that he isn't him. Cuz that's the man who showed up tonight and it's your job to debate that man, not the straw man that you had prepared for. 

So as a liberal who still will be voting for Obama, I'd like to say Romney did a fantastic job last night. He showed the Presidency the level of respect and preparation it deserves. Any of this ""Romney lied"", ""this is Obama's secret plan!"" is absolute cognitive dissonant bullshit. Obama got his ass kicked, some people are too stupid and blind to admit the truth.

This election was incredibly close in the popular vote. There are a lot of people on our side already. Beating an incumbent made it all the more difficult to win the Presidency. I don't think the answer lies in turning our values to whatever is popular at the moment.

Personally, I think we need to hit the streets, we need to have protests and rallies. We need to repeat things ad nauseum and demand answers. It works for liberals. 

We always try to take the high road, we forgive gaffes and hot mic mishaps, rather than beating them into the ground and then some. We LET r/politics run us out and tuck us away in the crannies of reddit. We have to be active in our conservatism, we need to push back instead of continuing to always be pushed.

Just my thoughts here, but you guys depress me when you start talking about changing who we are for the sake of a couple percentage points...points that could easily be gotten if we educated, fought hard, encourage conservatives to get out and vote, and put our ideas out there more.

1) Only in America could politicians talk about the greed of the rich at a $35,000 a plate campaign fund-raising event.

2) Only in America could people claim that the government still discriminates against black Americans when they have a black President, a black Attorney General, and roughly 18% of the federal workforce is black while only 12% of the population is black.

3) Only in America could they have had the two people most responsible for our tax code, Timothy Geithner, the head of the Treasury Department and Charles Rangel who once ran the Ways and Means Committee, BOTH turn out to be tax cheats who are in favor of higher taxes.

4) Only in America can they have terrorists kill people in the name of Allah and have the media primarily react by fretting that Muslims might be harmed by the backlash.

5) Only in America would they make people who want to legally become American citizens wait for years in their home countries and pay tens of thousands of dollars for the privilege while we discuss letting anyone who sneaks into the country illegally just 'magically' become American citizens.

6) Only in America could the people who believe in balancing the budget and sticking by the country's Constitution be thought of as ""extremists.""

7) Only in America could you need to present a driver's license to cash a check or buy alcohol, but not to vote.

8) Only in America could people demand the government investigate whether oil companies are gouging the public because the price of gas went up when the return on equity invested in a major U.S. oil company (Marathon Oil) is less than half of a company making tennis shoes (Nike).

9) Only in America could the government collect more tax dollars from the people than any nation in recorded history, still spend a trillion dollars more than it has per year for total spending of $7 million PER MINUTE, and complain that it doesn't have nearly enough money.

10) Only in America could the rich people who pay 86% of all income taxes be accused of not paying their ""fair share"" by people who don't pay any income taxes at all.

Full speech pasted from /r/politicaldiscussion:

""We’ve already made a trillion dollars’ worth of cuts. We can make some more cuts in programs that don’t work, and make government work more efficiently…We can make another trillion or trillion-two, and what we then do is ask for the wealthy to pay a little bit more …
There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me, because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t -look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something – there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.
If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. **Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.** The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.
The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.
So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the GI Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for president – because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together.”




There's plenty of emotional sentiment here. In his speech President Obama makes a heartfelt case with lots of emotions, pathos, rhetoric and examples of government programs. He tells us about the GI bill, about how the government created the internet so that ""the companies can make money off [it]."" (Not true, but never mind that.) And how we all had that special teacher somewhere in life. But what is he *really* saying? It could be a number of things. 

**A)** If we take his speech literally, it is a truism through and through. Presupposing equal responsibility for an outcome would mean everyone is responsible for everything, and at the same time no one is responsible, either, since everyone both is and isn't. (The Business owner didn't build it. Then who did? Everyone? But not the business owners, apparently.) Taking the literal approach makes no sense due to the ambiguity of the entire speech. 

**B)We are indebted to society insofar as infrastructure is concerned.** But again, this does not make much sense for a number of reasons. The most obvious being we do not need to raise taxes to continue maintaining our infrastructure. Of course, this argument still makes no sense when looked at closely. Suppose a man is looking to create a business. This means that the man has capital, to acquire capital means to pay taxes, therefore this man has been funding infrastructure. Now, either Obama wishes to have this man fully fund all infrastructure in the country or his community by his lonesome, or he is saying that this man has not been paying taxes. By rejecting the former and accepting the latter, this argument cannot work unless the President assumes no business owner has ever paid taxes in his life--he is an equal contributor and thus ""owes"" nothing to anyone. 

**C) Obama spoke stupidly, and used poor choices of wording.** This is a common defense, but not actually an argument. At all. Semantics and nomenclature have no bearing on anything, except diplomacy or succinctness. 

**D)** My personal favorite: Obama is lying and does not actually mean any of that at all.

These are the only four positions an Obama devotee can take. They are all terrible. Any objective reading of his speech will show that none of his statements are out of context, they all line up with each other, are consistent, and delivered with clarity. 

**What Obama Really Meant.**

I'm not going to psychoanalyze him, or say he's a post-colonialist or anything silly. *He's playing pure politics to lobby support for tax increases, as well as effectively pander to his base.* His statement was not only calculated, but carefully premeditated. By saying that the community is also responsible, and not the business owner, it gives unsuccessful people a sense of pride and accomplishment. Now, I'm not attacking the character of those less successful at all, I'm demonstrating why people would want to hear this. President Obama carefully sets the narrative by juxtaposing tax increases on the wealthy, with optimal government spending--the moon landing, the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate bridge. (I believe which was built by state funding, but never mind that.) By doing this he paints a picture of efficient and an industrial government, giving a sense that when the tax rates are this low, projects such as those are being denied to the American people. He's doing something else here on top of all of this. He is giving people who may be less fortunate in life a way to feel like they are contributing. He wants people to think ""Hey, I'm responsible for your businesses too!, you need to give your fair share back to us!"" By creating these social narratives, preying on people's desires of community, solidarity and well-being, he has been able to make Americans extremely receptive to tax increases and their impact towards his reelection.

I find myself having to upvote conservative comments that I strongly disagree with, just because assholes don't care to follow the reddiquette and have downvoted these comments to below the viewing threshold. So let's repeat one more time: 

DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH THEM. No matter how stupid you might think they are, that's not any kind of reason to downvote. When you vote this way, it's bad for the site.

Reddit is successful due in large part to this great voting system that it has. But what happens to downvoted comments? They become less visible, they get buried. When this happens to comments that don't deserve it, Reddit becomes homogenous, stale, a boring circlejerk, and these subs become far less fun to visit. I want to hear the controversial opinions, they're the interesting ones. Don't downvote them. If you really don't like what's being said, just leave the comment alone. Or you could upvote anything that makes the conversation better, regardless of if you agree with it. Karma does matter. Not for the individuals but for the conversation as a whole, it's very important.

I'm begging you, READ AND FOLLOW THE REDDIQUETTE, AND DOWNVOTE APPROPRIATELY. Please?

My boss recently sat down with our staff and explained our financial situation. We are just barely breaking even in this tough economy. If tax rates are increased any further there is a good chance I will lose my job. I will also LOSE my healthcare if Obamacare is put into place and be forced to go onto a shitty, watered down Obamaplan.


EDIT- I understand financial accounting, and realize that taxes are only paid on taxable income (after salaries and expenses). However, in order to maintain our line of credit from the bank, we need to keep a certain net income/revenue ratio. Increased taxes would put us below, cut our credit rating, requiring downsizing in order to prevent the business from failing.

I originally made the mistake of posting this in r/politics.

The company is forced to declare bankruptcy and liquidate its assets. As a result  ~20,000 people will be unemployed just before Thanksgiving.

The Reaction? All of a sudden liberals hate Twinkies and declare the company got what it deserved. They say “good riddance” and justify it because Hostess is a bakery and its products are unhealthy. They’ve convinced themselves this is a conspiracy and that somehow the investors and executives made out like bandits.

They believe anything to avoid realizing that the entitlement mentality will be the end of free enterprise. Their psyche’s self-defense mechanism prevents them from accepting facts that challenge their core beliefs. Such fanaticism of a central government and worship of their political leaders prevents reason from prevailing. 
But hey, we got a rock star president.

His parents (my grandparents) are huge libs (watch msnbc all day types). But they raised their kids to work hard at everything and to strive for success. They wanted them to be successful. 

Now they just had a small conversation about the 99% vs 1% thing and my grandfather was so upset at rich people for being greedy, money-hoarding, taking advantage of the poor, etc all that nonsense. My dad said, ""Dad, you raised us to strive for success and to work hard so that we can live good lives yet you attack the same people you wanted us to become. I've worked my tail off in my job and outside of it and have done a lot of good with the success I've earned."" My grandmother chimes in, ""Well what what good have you done with your money?""

Reposted with permission from Jman511115 nyfirearms.com :

Hey guys, I was speaking with a non gun owner the other day, and it struck me how she just didn't get why an assault weapons ban is such a big deal. Thought about it for a bit, and typed this up. Please tell me what you think, and feel free to spread it around if you think it will make a difference. Thanks.

Imagine that you’re a law abiding, sensible, responsible citizen (as I’m sure you are anyway). You own a nice car that you take care of, and have a significant amount of money invested in. You use your vehicle every day for lawful purposes, and you could not imagine life without it. You try to never break traffic laws, and you never drive while intoxicated. In fact, you’ve gone out of your way to ensure that if you’re going to be at a party or a bar where you may be drinking, you get a ride, carpool, or even take a cab ( at additional expense to yourself) to comply with the law. In every way you are a model citizen, and you have never made the mistake of drinking and getting behind the wheel.
One day, a man who is having marriage problems goes to a bar, drinks too much, and tries to drive himself home. On the way, he runs a red light and hits a minivan with a young family of five inside, on the way to their vacation home not too far away. No one survives the accident, including the drunk driver. The accident is highly publicized, with political leaders and the media calling for stricter laws to prevent this sort of thing in the future. The debate rages on for weeks, with each side becoming more and more vocal.
A few weeks later after you drive home from work, you turn on the news. The headline of the day is that the state legislature has passed a comprehensive new ban on drunk driving, even though it has already been banned for twenty years. The new law is much more restrictive, and according to the media, will save lives at only the cost of a few inconveniences.
The new law requires all cars manufactured to come with a built in blood alcohol content interlock, to ensure that the operator is sober before starting the car. In addition, all newly manufactured vehicles may not have fuel tanks over five gallons in size, and may not be capable of exceeding 55 miles per hour. This of course is to both reduce the severity of potential future incidents, and to reduce the ability of intoxicated drivers to flee from the police. The police and government of course do not have to abide by these arbitrary limits, and the politicians who passed this ban have specially licensed chauffeurs allowed to own performance vehicles with high capacity fuel tanks. The last portion of the ban on vehicles specifies a list of features that a vehicle may not have. These include traction control, spoilers, air scoops, dual exhausts, and eight cylinder engines.

“Well” you think, “This won’t affect me. I already own my vehicle, and I’m not planning on buying one for at least a couple of years.” You’re wrong. The lawmakers have thought of that too. All cars built before the law was enacted are required to have an interlock installed, at owner expense. The interlock must be inspected and registered with the state, and recertified every five years, with a fee each time. This applies to all vehicles, regardless of the owner’s driving history, and the fact that you’ve gone out of your way and spent extra money in the past to comply with the existing laws. Vehicles currently owned are also not allowed to be sold within the state. When you decide to dispose of your current vehicle, you must sell to an out of state buyer, or surrender it to state police to be destroyed, without compensation. You also may not give it to your child for their first vehicle. Your high capacity fuel tank is now banned. Even though the tank was the standard capacity when the vehicle was manufactured, if it now holds more than five gallons you must register it with the state. High capacity fuel tanks may no longer be filled with more than five gallons. If you are caught with more than five gallons of fuel in your tank, you face a misdemeanor charge. Fuel is also highly controlled under the new law. You no longer may go down to your local station and fill up anonymously. You now have to go to a government controlled fuel station, submit to a blood alcohol content test, and pay a fee every time you fuel your vehicle. In addition, every fuel sale is reported to the government. Any fuel purchases over five gallons are considered unusual, and may be investigated by the state government. Also, because this law went into effect today while you were at work, you were unknowingly in violation, because you had a full tank at the beginning of the day.
After you hear all this on the news, you think that they must have made a mistake. You, a responsible, taxpaying, law abiding driver, are being treated like a common criminal. You’ve gone out of your way to comply with the former DWI laws, but now they’re treating you as a scapegoat.

I sincerely hope that Mr. Romney wins the presidency, but I would also encourage you to focus on the House and Senate members and vote in solid conservatives. That's where the real power lies.

If I didn't think it was unethical to inject myself (other than in word) into another nation's politics, I would be donating money to support conservative candidates.

1344428821.0,130,self.Conservative,xvlzl,"Chick Fil A, One Week Later",,249,119,326,http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/xvlzl/chick_fil_a_one_week_later/,"What I learned from Chick Fil A Appreciation Day:

1. Yes it is about the First Amendment.  No, nobody wants to throw Dan Cathy in jail, we all agree on that.  But it is about shutting him up.  Gay activists have engaged in all sorts of thuggish tactics against those who disagree with them.  [Here is but one example](http://voices.yahoo.com/prop-8-maps-outs-supporters-proposition-8-2509057.html) - the effort to publicly disclose the names *and home addresses* of California Proposition 8 supporters, *after the election was already over*.  The message is clear - if you disagree with gay marriage then you will find your personal life spread all over the Internet, and possibly even crazies showing up at your door, disrupting your personal life (or possibly even worse).  There was a similar effort in Washington State.  The clear intent is to intimidate and silence the opposition, which is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the First Amendment, if not the letter.  A mere boycott against Chick Fil A isn't at the same level of intimidation as publicly revealing home addresses of Proposition 8 supporters, but it will escalate to that level if it isn't stopped now.  It is not inconceivable for activists to be jotting down license plate numbers at Chick Fil A restaurants and then publicly posting them online for the world to see.  Chilling?  You bet and that is the whole idea.  And don't tell me that gay rights activists are opposed to those tactics, because they aren't.  The gay marriage crowd needs to publicly repudiate such tactics.

2.  Yes it is about Christianity.  If you listen only to the gay marriage crowd, you'd think that the biggest threat to civil rights for gays was evangelical Christians.  However, in large portions of the world, being a homosexual doesn't mean discrimination, it means death.  Where are the outraged protests over Saudi Arabia's criminalization of sodomy?  Or the [persecution in the Palestinian Authority of gays](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Persecution_of_Homosexuals_%28Palestinian_Authority_area%29), who would rather flee to Israel and be under house arrest, than stay in Palestine?  No, instead, we have ""Queers for Palestine"" and ""Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism"".  Combine this double standard with the common leftist stereotype of evangelical Christians in the first place - either ignorant redneck hayseeds, or spiteful intolerant bigots - and the general tendency of leftists to favor atheism - and you begin to understand why Christians don't appreciate being lectured to about how supposedly intolerant they are when they are among the most tolerant people on the planet, and might come to the conclusion that protests in favor of gay marriage, or calls to boycott Chick Fil A (which - surprise surprise - is run by an evangelical Christian!) over the issue of gay marrage are really just proxies in a larger protest against evangelical Christianity itself.  Whether the issue is gay marriage or something else, you can be sure that the leftist protests and anger will ALWAYS be directed against the evangelical Christian community.  The gay marraige crowd needs to stop mocking evangelical Christians as backwards rubes.

3. The gay marriage supporters have much more in mind than just changing the definition of marriage.  They want to change the definition of ""good person"".  In their eyes it does not matter one bit how much other good works a person does - if that person doesn't support gay marriage, then that person is an evil h8r, end of story.  Look at what Dan Cathy's [WinShape Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinShape_Foundation) does.  Lots of worthwhile projects and charitable acts that have absolutely nothing to do with gays of any sort.  Look at evangelical Christians, who do more charitable acts and contribute more to charity than most other groups.  BUT NONE OF THIS MATTERS TO THE GAY MARRIAGE CROWD.  They seek to impose a litmus test on what constitutes a good person, based on adherence to leftist ideology.  This isn't really anything new, as leftists all the time are declaring that if you don't support tax increases that are *intended* to pay for wealth redistribution to the poor, that it means that you are a cruel selfish heartless bastard.  This is just one more data point that to the left, one's moral worth stems from one's political views, and not from one's faith or one's personal actions.  Who is the better person - the guy who votes in favor of gay marriage but spends every weekend playing video games, or the guy who votes against gay marriage but who spends his weekends building homes for the poor and volunteering at his local church food bank?  The gay marriage crowd needs to separate their political ideology from their concept of moral worth.  It is downright offensive to be told after a long day of helping out your fellow man that you're a h8r because of a political disagreement.",,False,self,t5_2qh6p,False,,,True,t3_xvlzl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/xvlzl/chick_fil_a_one_week_later/,

I am a mostly left leaning independent voter.  I come here to get some perspective and understand the other side of many debates.  I often don't agree with the conservative stance, but I feel that it is very important I check my opinions with the other side before coming to a conclusion.  

Most of the time I'm fairly quiet over here.  My opinion is that I'm a guest, so I should be respectful.  I will throw up an idea or opinion sometimes, but I keep it to the point and factual when I can.  I've noticed a huge increase in trolls lately.  I think that's a huge mistake.  Here is the one that set me off this morning:

&gt;Seems like this thread is full of people disputing the incorrect and inaccurate statements of the article. They are disputing the lies and errors with facts.
They are not trolls. Trolls don't care about facts. Neither do conservatives

The first part is valid.  The last sentence throws all credibility out the window.  I think it is important that everyone check their viewpoint.  Name calling doesn't help.  I really like that I can come here and read a different opinion.  Heck, sometimes there are really good points brought up that I wouldn't have otherwise considered.  I'm very grateful that this subreddit exists.  Please don't ruin it by pissing off the people who call it home.

**TLDR; Stop trolling, you're making me and other left leaning people look like assholes.**

However that changed this morning.  I dropped my son off at school and I was driving to my office when I heard that Mitt Romney was standing by this statement: 

*There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.  There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.*

When I heard he wasn't backing down I literally yelled ""FUCK YES!"" in my car, while pumping my fist.  

I was worried that Mitt Romney would back peddle on this and try to play nice, but when he stepped up and owned it I knew he was the right guy to be our next president.  Ron Paul people, get on board with this guy.  He gets it.  He can turn us around, just like he turned the olympics around.  I think we finally found our next Reagan.  

Edit:  I haven't voted in 14 years. Today I registered to vote solely because of what occurred today. Mitt will probably be the only person I vote for in November.

NOTE: I've done a lot of this by manual qualitative analysis taken from the steps below, but in a more precise experiment that dealt more on the quantitative, I would create an algorithm that measures:

1. From May 29th, 2012 (When Mitt Romney received more than enough delegates to clinch the 2012 Republican Presidential nomination) to November 6th, 2012 (Election Day). These are the dates that would have brought out the most bias in the media, therefore the most measurable effect. It's like the 4 year storm you've been waiting to surf. 

2. Compares total number of times a candidates name is used to measure selective or preferential reporting. 
Variables include an inflexion point for overly liberal or conservative media who use their opponents name more in stories while attacking them.

3. Measures use of candidates name paired with inflammatory or condescending key words and measures candidates names paired with key words of praise or encouragement. 

4. Takes author's political backgrounds and previous job experience associated with liberal or conservative (lowest weight in measurement since backgrounds don't always indicate reporting bias)

5. Collect information from recent studies about media bias that categorizes known biases for mass media. Also includes statements made by the media themselves about their viewpoint.

6. If any, analyze comments, viewers, audience reaction of articles and shows for a majority conservative or liberal bias. In keeping with premise that the majority of people hold a confirmation bias and loyally follow and comment on media that matches their beliefs.

(source: http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-july-25-2012/democalypse-2012---do-we-look-stupid--don-t-answer-that-edition---grammatical-gaffes)

It actually hit me today what bothered me so much about Stewart making this argument. My issue is not with counter interpretations, because I know different people will see it different ways. My issue is that Stewart shows, IMHO, the common mentality among liberals with Obama and that is he is infallible. 

Obama is the one who gave the speech. Obama is the one who tried to deliver the message. Obama is the one who decided to take on a hot topic. Obama is the one who fumbled it badly. But no, it's not Obama's fault for all the flak he's getting. It's us. Conservatives. It's our fault. It's Romney's fault. It's the fault of everyone except the person who said the very words and very speech he is getting flak for.

This same thing happened back in the campaign. When Obama said he wanted to spread the wealth around, who's fault was that? Obama's? No. It was Joe The Plumber. It was Fox News. It was Conservatives. Once again, from the perspective of the left the blame can't be rested on the man who said the very words he got flak for.

I guess it just is the way it is and I guess we on the right tend to do it as well, but from my position I have noticed those on the right give flak for our leaders when they utterly fumble an issue. I just never noticed it on the left. To me, the left might as well be Rome, because in Rome Caeser can simply do no wrong.",,False,self,t5_2qh6p,False,,,True,t3_x77x1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/x77x1/my_response_to_jon_stewart/,

Does this infuriate anyone else?  Today I learned that Reddit thinks personal responsibility is selfish.  That keeping money in productive circulation (instead of having it wasted by an incompetent bureaucracy) is selfish.  That telling your neighbors and community 'no, I don't need to take money from you, I'll live within my means' is selfish.  When you have a community that blames California's financial problems on low taxes, for gosh sake, instead of the liberals in the state government spending themselves into bankruptcy, that's a community that's utterly divorced from reality.  

Am I right to be upset by this?  Or is lowering taxes and cutting handouts (that we can't afford no matter how high the taxes get, and that just encourage people to stop working and depend on them) really a selfish and heartless ideology?

(Sure, the baby boomers were profoundly selfish.  They were the archetypical red diaper doper babies, the generation of free love hippies who quite literally dismantled the moral foundations of the United States with the battle cry of 'I have the right to do what I want, man'.

**ROMNEY:** ...But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I'm a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And **in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees,** but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd — they'd built up.

And fortunately...

(CROSSTALK)

**OBAMA:** Governor Romney, that's not what you said...

(CROSSTALK)

**OBAMA**: Governor Romney, you did not...

**ROMNEY**: You can take a look at the op-ed...

(CROSSTALK)

**OBAMA**: You did not say that you would provide government help.

(CROSSTALK)

**OBAMA**: Let's check the record.

---------------------------------------------

From the [""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"" opinion article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?_r=0)

 The American auto industry is vital to our national interest as an employer and as a hub for manufacturing. A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs. **The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing** and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk.

In a managed bankruptcy, the federal government would propel newly competitive and viable automakers, rather than seal their fate with a bailout check.

I was in the middle of a discussion with [go1lfish](http://www.reddit.com/user/go1dfish) when he was abruptly banned. This is going even further than what was announced. Am I to be banned now to even though I wish Ron Paul fans would tone it down a bit on submissions? What is this even about now anyways? Here's the message from go1dfish trying to continue the discussion we were having.

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/nmsj1/can_we_have_peace_between_the_paul_and_antipaul/c3afi3v
I would reply directly, but the moderators saw fit to ban me from the sub-reddit entirely for my support for Paul.
I chose the term ""War"" as the antonym of ""Peace"".
The sub-reddit was relatively peaceful and cordial before the mods decided to ban comments about politicians they don't like.
If you are still able to post, please help inform the sub-reddit that the moderators are not just banning posts, but users as well; for no other offense than supporting a Republican candidate for president.

[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleoconservative/comments/nnc54/rconservative_isnt_just_banning_posts_theyve/) is a thread in paleoconservative about this. I agree that go1dfish was a bit inflammatory but was a ban really justified in this case? We're conservatives. We don't like uncle sam telling us what to do - why should we like a mod doing so?

For the record I do agree that there are too many ron paul posts and very few places for conservatives who don't actively support Paul to go on reddit but damn. All of what he was posting appeared to me to be in the context of what was going on in the sub reddits.

**EDIT: http://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/ is now a public subreddit. Thanks ZachRB87!**


Fuck this shit. Let's make a new subreddit shall we? I propose /r/Conservativepolitics. I'll gladly pass mod rights to whoever is up to the task.
