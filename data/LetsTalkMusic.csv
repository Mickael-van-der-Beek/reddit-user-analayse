1374454861.0,162,self.LetsTalkMusic,1is634,"An analysis of Transmission, by Joy Division",Snowblinded,180,18,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1is634/an_analysis_of_transmission_by_joy_division/,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnWPGSQjFUc

The music of Joy Division, like the vast majority of their post-punk peers, weaves the disparate and seemingly irreconcilable threads of punk rock and Krautrock into a single sonic tapestry. If you examine the ancestry of influences in nearly any post-punk group, you will find the DNA of the German experimental pioneers somewhere in their sound.  The auditory chaos of Faust was enthusiastically studied and replicated by The Pop Group, This Heat, and all of the early industrial pioneers. Can took the controlled madness of The Velvet Underground's Sister Ray, an improvisation from hell that fused the rhythmic engine powering Rock'n'Roll with the untameable inventiveness of free jazz, and then extended The Velvet's explorations in a number of new directions. These innovations were in turn picked up by Public Image Ltd, The Fall, and many others. The machine worship of Kraftwerk, when fused with punk rock, spawned the proto-New Wave music of groups like The Talking Heads, and Killing Joke. Each of these groups, and many others, incorporated musical ideas created or refined by the Germans into the punk template. For the most part, however, they remained loyal to the intensity that characterized punk rock, using the abrasive Krautrock experiments as a compliment to the aggressive nature of their punk rock foundation.

Joy Division alone sought to push the primal energy of punk into new emotional territory. While they steered away from the avant-garde experiments that many post-punk groups found alluring, they instead found an entirely different way of incorporating Krautrock ideas into punk music; an approach that was the opposite of what their fellow post-punkers were doing. Instead of taking musical ideas from the Germans and applying them to the angry catharsis of punk, they infused the icy detachment that characterized many Krautrock groups with punk's emphasis on simplicity and emotional discharge.

At first glance, this seems like an oxymoron. How can groups that took great pains in being devoid of emotion be reconciled with a genre that put emotion at the forefront? While groups like Kraftwerk tried to strip the emotion out of rock music, they inadvertently created music that resonated with one particular state of mind: depression. Contrary to traditional wisdom, suffering from depression is not like living in a constant state of sadness or melancholy. People who suffer from depression live lives characterized more by vacancy than by sadness. It is a muted gray blanket that wraps itself around their lives and smothers the vitality most people take for granted, until existence becomes a dull blur of apathy. Thus, the icy calmness that can be heard in many Krautrock groups ironically ended up being more relatable to people like Ian Curtis then the youthful rage that oozed from every pore of The Sex Pistols.

This is not to say that the members of Joy Division found punk rock's off the chart levels of rage, angst, and bitterness to be disagreeable. I have a limited amount of knowledge about the personal lives of the band, but I think that they found a great deal of solace in punk's fiery discharge. This freedom and energy was a respite, however brief, from the maddening emptiness that robbed the world of Ian Curtis. If there wasn't a strong love for their influences guiding the band, then they would have had no trouble applying their somber, poetic, and utterly dark feelings to a James Tayler-esque pastiche of acoustic guitars and radio friendly melodies; following the path of countless other groups more interested in fast money and easy woman than in using music to express something deep within them that would have otherwise had no outlet. They would almost certainly have had more commercial success during their lifetime with such an approach. Instead, they embarked on a journey into unexplored territory. Guided by only their hearts, each other, and a love for the music that influenced them, they charted a course into the unknown. A journey that led them to some of the most powerful rock music ever created. Among their legendary catalog, one track stands out as an embodiment of the forces that drove them along their brief but extraordinary odyssey: ""Transmission"".

Starting from the beginning, the song opens with a very brief modulating synthesizer chord. The synth they use has a very dark quality to it, which sets the tone for the rest of the song. The slight modulations in pitch produce a sense of unease that would take a few moments to adjust to. However, before the listener can settle in, the bass guitar blasts them with the main riff while the volume of the synth quickly plummets. This gives the song a doubly jarring start. First the synthesizer's rapid microtonal modulation sets the listener in a state of unease. Then, after just two seconds, the bass riff thrusts in at full volume and the synth fades away. The combination of the bass entering and the synth leaving makes the bass seem like it is overpowering the synth and taking control of the track. This impression is no accident. As with the majority of Joy Division's music, and unlike just about any other rock band, Peter Hook's bass playing takes a dominant melodic role within the song, while the guitar functions as either a secondary melody that is picked up and dropped at crucial places or as a rhythmic aid closer to how a bass typically functions than the bass guitar itself.

The bass riff embodies the dichotomy between punk rock and Krautrock that I discussed earlier. On one hand, it is utterly simplistic. It is made up of only three notes: two long stretches of D and C notes respectively, each one punctuated by a single A note. While the riff undoubtedly possesses punk's trademark simplicity, it also calls bands like Kraftwerk to mind due to its steady, machine-like nature. The first D is a quarter note, and it is followed by thirteen more D's and an A in eighth notes. The pattern is then repeated with C's replacing the D's. The quarter note and fourteen eighth notes pattern gives the riff a super rhythmic quality. Since their are no notes that deviate from the rigidity of the beat, the riff comes off as almost inhuman, summoning images of the desolate factories and layers of smog that enshrouded Joy Division's native city of Manchester, rather than the hormonal energy that a typical punk riff evokes.

While the song is structured around a verse chorus progression, unlike most songs written in this form, Peter doesn't change the riff when the song progresses from verse to chorus or vice versa. This was done for a number of reasons. First, having the same riff for both the verse and chorus increases the bleak, oppressive feeling the band were trying to induce. Not altering the riff creates claustrophobic effect; a sensation of being trapped that mirrors the song's lyrical themes. Secondly,  the members of Joy Division were one of the first groups to realize that having a steady, continuous, rhythmic melody gives the music a strong sense of propulsion. This technique would be wholeheartedly embraced by electronic musicians in the coming decades, but the members of the band, during their time in both Joy Division and New Order, were among the first to realize the potential of such an approach. This is not to say that there aren't problems writing songs in this manner. Without a clear transition from verse to chorus, you run the risk of having the entire song seem like a unchanging blur. To solve this, the band introduced a slight change in the riff that only occurs during key moments, such as the transition from verse to chorus. This change happens on the fourth and final bar of the riff. During the rest of the song, this bar contains the second half of the C repetitions as well as the closing A note. Instead, Peter plays an E - F - E - F - G - G pattern. While this is not a tremendous difference, it is just enough variety to let the listener know that the song has progressed to it's next stage, while retaining enough monotony to maintain the sense of claustrophobia and propulsion I mentioned above.

As the bass finishes the second repetition of the riff, the drums are introduced. The drumming, like the bass guitar, is steady and machine-like. There is a reason Stephen Morris is called “The Human Drum Machine”. The hyper-steady rhythms he produced add to the icy solitude of the song. The pattern Stephen plays is two bars long. The first bar follows a ""One - Two - Three - and - Four"" pattern while the second bar goes ""One - Two - Three - and - Four - and"". Like the bass guitar, the drum pattern remains the same throughout the song, with two exceptions. First, there is a one off pattern he plays as he enters the track. Second, Stephen occasionaly adds an extra beat between the fourth beat of the first bar and the first beat of the second bar, creating a ""One - Two - Three - and - Four - and"" pattern, though using different drums than the ""One - Two - Three - and - Four - and"" pattern of the second bar. As with the bass riff, Morris' rhythmic rigidity connects the band to the robotic sound of Kraftwerk. However, instead of inhuman sterility, the drumming calls to mind abandonment and isolation. The world of Transmission has an Absurd quality to it. It calls up images of a world that was never meant to be occupied by humans, but is occupied all the same. Their world is a stark, barren place where life is fraught with desolation and despair. This contrasts the sound of Kraftwerk, who seek to strip the humanity entirely from their music.

Please upvote for visibility.] Some additions and clarifications to Let's Talk Music's rules,WhatWouldIWant_Sky,120,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1evs7z/meta_thread_please_upvote_for_visibility_some/,"So the other mods and I have noticed a few trends among comments and threads recently and have felt the need to establish a few new rules and clarify some already set rules.

**1: Be nice to each other.** 

Sometimes shit can get heated, and on the internet it is easy to be mean (I've done it myself here, check my post history), but that isn't cool here.  Remember that music and art are subjective and people may have very different opinions than you do.  Also, art is free to be analyzed and over-analyzed, there is no such thing as ""bullshit,"" so there is no need to insult people who make insightful threads.  Also please remember that downvoting is reserved only for comments and threads that break the subreddit rules and not for posts you disagree with.  (Downvoting is also allowed in the album club nomination threads. That shit is full contact.)

**2: New threads *must* have content.**  

A popular thread has been the artist/album/genre specific ones.  Those are totally cool *if you have something to say.*  A good version of one of these threads would be giving actual thoughts and analyses of whichever artist, album, or genre you are bringing up.  A bad version of one of these threads would be giving a short biography of a band, a description of an album, or a definition of a genre just because you have been listening to it recently and want to have other people talk about it.  Another bad example is saying ""I've never been able to get into X.""   As the discussion starter, you must have something to say, and must put forward a concrete opinionated thought about the band/album/genre that may be discussed. (Exception is for new albums. you can just go ahead and ask for other's thought on those). 

If your thread is a question, please offer your own opinion.  If your question can't answered with an opinion, this probably isn't the place to ask the question.

Remember: ""Try to engage in intriguing conversation. Trivial and uninteresting threads and comments might be deleted.""  This is judged on a case to case basis, so when you make your thread make sure it is something that will spark discussion and not simple answers.  As with any subreddit with a high quality standard, our moderation will continue to be strict.

**Now some nice things**

The above are just a few things that have slipped by.  For the most part, you guys are awesome with downvoting threads and comments that don't have substance or break the rules.  Thanks!  Now that we are part of the 10k-100k size range of sub, more watered down threads and comments will and have started to appear more often, but you guys are doing awesome at generating good new discussions and keeping out that boring stuff.  Let's keep a tight lock on it! (remember to report bad threads and comments as well as downvoting!)

It mentions that he failed to take off in America with black audiences, but it never really went into great depth about the reasons for this. It seems a strange paradox that the music and message he wanted to get across was in many ways aimed at blacks and their struggle through slavery and oppression. He always felt a very strong affinity to blacks, particularly those from Africa, and reached out to them with his music. He did a lot to unify Jamaica and with his Zimbabwe concert showed that he really wanted to connect with blacks. 

However, outside of Jamaica he was the darling of the white middle classes. His concerts were almost exclusively white. Why was this? Does anyone have any insight into how and why this interesting cultural anomaly existed?

When I was 16, I got into Streetlight Manifesto. I had already been listening to some punk and third-wave ska, but after listening to them, I got really into it. Gone were the days of listening to blink-182 and Reel Big Fish, I got into the more hardcore style. It made me appreciate bands like The Clash a lot more. 

I really loved how they were able to fit in so many instruments at such a high pace. I never heard something like this before, the way they combine punk with lots of other types of music. I don't think I ever heard a band that is similar to Streetlight Manifesto. Too bad they are overdoing their own sound now.

Streetlight Manifesto: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo76ijhUqjE

Then one day, I found out about a band named The Skints. I heard about them after going to a Streetlight Manifesto show, talking about ska with people. They are closer to the true Ska sound, unlike bands like Reel Big Fish. They mix their ska with dub, reggae and a bit of punk. It pulled me away from third wave ska and got me into Desmond Dekker and The Specials. They don't have much of their stuff on youtube, but their first album in my opinion, as a whole, is one of the best I've ever heard. Took me like 5 whole listens to appreciate it, but now that I do, I really love it. 

Give this band a shot if you like diversity in the songs, multiple good vocals, and just the feel of an album, and not 11 random songs put together on one CD.

The Skints: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRpfIsyLcBc (their first song on the first album, it flows right into the second on the album, too bad you miss that here).

After having listening to a lot of punk and ska, I had to listen to something new. I asked around a lot, on what people were listening to, but for some reason, dubstep, electronic music and metal don't suit me at all. And if you ask random people, they will most likely recommend that kind of music. But someone on a football forum of all places got me listening to a band called Alison's Halo. I fell in love with them instantly. 

The vocals were so soothing and the guitars were perfect together with the vocals. This got me into the shoegaze/dreampop stuff. My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Airiel, etc. 

Alison's Halo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W218HJXj8Fo 

My latest revolution in music taste came from Neutral Milk Hotel. A girl I had a crush on told me about this band, and a few months later, I gave it a real shot. Now In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is my most listened album (at this moment) and I am listening to bands like of Montreal, Elf Power, Beulah, The Apples In Stereo and even more punky folk stuff like Andrew Jackson Jihad, back to the punk stuff where it all kinda started for me. Also the reason why this video just gives me chills: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5CQYXdZDNY
If only I could have been there...

Bands like this make me appreciate various instruments apart from the guitar, bass and drums. A high school kid will tell you the trumpet or violin are gay. I love those instruments. You can make great music in almost any genre with those instruments. They should teach this at school (they don't in Holland). 

Neutral Milk Hotel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaFLztnL84

I'm curious as what I'll be listening to in 5 years. Maybe I'll get into more electronic music and dubstep. It's just amazing how much good music there is to be found. I never heard of Neutral Milk Hotel a year ago, yet they are a very big name in the music scene. It's sad to know that I will never get to enjoy all of it. 

Sorry for the long post, and if this invites ""list-like responses"". I hope you will post similar stories to mine, and mention why the bands revolutionized your tastes.

Source of my current rage: **Shoegaze**.

Though I am concerned that it feels like very little of the genre ventures beyond its late-80s/early-90s heyday, I'm mostly annoyed by how many of its current fan seem to try to usurp other bands into the genre despite them obviously fitting better under other genres. /r/shoegaze seems to think True Widow is Shoegaze, but they obviously sound closer to either Slowcore (think: Codeine or Low; the latter of whom also occasionally gets pegged as Shoegaze.) or Stoner Rock. Though it has ties to the early years genre (think: Spacemen 3, Loop, the Telescopes, etc.) , Neo-Psychedelia also seems to be frequently confused as shoegaze as well (i.e. Mazzy Star, Spiritualized, etc.). There also seem to be a tendency for the fans to associate bands who were once shoegaze but no longer (i.e. Catherine Wheel, Slowdive's move to Mojave 3, even Pygmalion-era Slowdive, etc.) are always part of the genre, even their obviously non-shoegaze years. I'm not saying a Shoegaze fan won't enjoy those bands or the non-shoegaze eras, but it increasingly feels like the people who like the genre are completely oblivious to other genres and think any music with a flanger and chorus pedal combo is Shoegaze.


and ffs, as great as the album is, stop recommending Loveless on every random music recommendation request. This is especially goofy if someone is looking for other shoegaze bands as they more than likely know of my Bloody Valentine if they know of the genre.

As a fan of both drone and American Primitivism, I figured this album would be right up my alley (it turns out it was).  Yet at first, the combination of very long, free-flowing ragas and folk instrumentation were turn-offs. It didn't make much sense, and was starting to feel like a waste of time. The big highlight of the album were the live, much more straight-forward folk songs that showcased the obvious artistry of the band (especially Jack Rose). I figured that guys this talented wouldn't be performing these pieces if they didn't have something to say - and it turns out, they did. I revisited *Ayahuasca* a few weeks ago, and the improvisation, length, and organic textures of the tracks became centerpieces.

**Early Country &amp; Western**

Country originally formed out of a combination of different strands of American Southern folk music, equal parts Appalachian folk and Southern blues. Gospel traditions and Western cowboy ballads fed into it. By the 1940s the term ""country &amp; western"" became the favored label for the genre (previously it had been know as ""hillbilly music""). Early country stars wrote simple songs that were open to endless variation, or solidified traditional gospel and folk songs into versions that would enter the American musical canon. By the 1940s, with the rise of the ""Grand Ole Opry"" radio program, country became big business and the Nashville country music industry began to dominate the genre.

Hank Williams - [""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WXYjm74WFI)

**Western Swing**

Drawing from jazz, R&amp;B, and traditional country sounds, Western swing is basically country dance music, mixing jazz improvisation with a string band twang. The style was jubilant and fast-paced and packed dance halls through Texas and the South.

Milton Brown - [""Four, Five or Six Times""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAAHXUo_-Dk)

**Bluegrass**

Drawing as much from English, Irish and Scottish influences as it did from Appalachian folk (along with some jazz improvisation thrown in), bluegrass was based on fast tempos, complex chord changes and dexterous musicianship.

Flatt &amp; Scruggs - [""Foggy Mountain Breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APl9fRFmdC0)

**Classic Female Vocalists**

There's this perception that women have it tougher in country music than in other genres, often regulated to the sidelines and forced into signing songs about family life and wayward husbands. I don't think this perception is necessarily accurate. Not because women had it better in country (they didn't) but because they haven't really had it better anywhere else (look at Berry Gordy's treatment of his female Motown stars or the near total dearth of female jazz musicians outside of vocalists). But as with all genres, women managed to carve a niche for themselves, and country can lay claim to some of the best female singers and songwriters in American music.

**Rockabilly**

Inspired by uptempo honky tonk jams and rhythm &amp; blues, rockabilly was an early version of what would soon morph into rock 'n' roll. Faster beats, drums and electric guitars made it a much rougher, more aggressive version of traditional country. It's influence would be felt through most of the early rock 'n' roll stars, who if they didn't come out of the genre, were likely listening to it or dabbling in it.

**Countrypolitian**

In the mid-1950s, country had become big business. In part this was due to the formalized sound of the music that softened its edges and focused on pop arrangements to make it palatable to a wider audience. In a way this separated country into ""soft"" (i.e. pop-oriented) and ""hard"" (traditional country) performers. The soft performers were often referred to as ""countrypolitian"" country due to the focus on string arrangements a slick productions. This is the time when Nashville became the dominate force in the industry. While this has been lamented by one group or another for decades, in essence it's no different than what Motown and other labels were doing with R&amp;B and soul music, creating an almost factory-like production of solid pop hits. And as with Motown, a lot of great music came out of it.

Sammi Smith - [""Help Me Make it Through the Night""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HonH-w7mGlQ)

**Outlaw Country**

A direct response to the slicker Nashville sound, ""outlaw"" country was a loose collection of singers and songwriters who bucked the orchestral strings and pop styling of popular country in favor of rougher edges, rock 'n' roll style bands and subject matter better suited to hard living and heavy drinking. While the style was never really formalized, and a lot of its stars would go on to crossover country success, it left an indelible mark on the genre.

**Early Country Rock**

Rock music drew a lot from country in its early days, but by the late 1960s it had evolved pretty far afield. But rock musicians were still interested in country. The Rolling Stones drew heavily from it, the Beatles cut a country track or two and the Byrds, during Gram Parson's tenure with the band, put out *Sweetheart of the Rodeo* and played the Grand Ole Opry. Country rock developed out of such crossovers and was a distinct style through the early 1970s. It would get picked up again by bands such as the Meat Puppets for awhile in the 1980s and later by alternative country acts from the 1990s to the present.

New Riders of the Purple Sage - [""Henry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNRsoBhnqM)

**Classic Singer/Songwriters**

At its heart, country is a fairly simple form, much like rock 'n' roll. But simplicity can be the foundation for incredibly creative flights. The best country songs, properly adapted, could just as easily be the best R&amp;B songs, the best pop songs or the best rock songs (and often have been).

Townes Van Zandt - [""Lungs""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rdm8LItAHs)

**New Traditionalists**

This is what most people think of when they think of ""modern country."" It begins with a group of artists in the 1980s who work country back to its roots, but add modern production values. It's basically traditional country at heart, but slicked up some for modern audiences. These days the rock and pop influence has been built up on that foundation and that's pretty much modern popular country. But the first wave of new traditionalists is worth a look, exhibiting some great musicianship and some sturdy songwriting.

Dwight Yoakam - [""Ain't That Lonely Yet""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4cPQ9mHYVo)

**Alternative Country**

Building out of 1980s indie-rock, alternative country is a loose term that covers a broad range of country-influenced acts that work outside of the Nashville mainstream. Drawing both from classic country, folk and rock music, the movement has a lot of sub-strands, keeping old country traditions alive but adapting them to modern themes.

How is it affecting yours?,GodBeard,66,10,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/zi84f/how_aging_has_affected_my_taste_in_music_how_is/,"Over the years I've been dismayed by the assumption we seem to be making as a society that older people are only interested in the music of their generation. Radio stations spring up overnight that cater to a very narrow-minded demographic, which means they must expect people to consume music that way, frozen in amber, blind to the changes taking place around them. Then that generation starts to die, and with them, stations which apparently would have no appeal to anyone but them.

For me, getting older has been just a little like that. But only a little. It has definitely changed my perspective on a lot of music. And there is a small group of bands and albums with which I still regard with the wide-eyed adoration of youth, and probably always will. But for me, it's more about noticing things I never saw when I was younger, and being more open to things that would have repelled me in the past. If anything, my scope seems larger, not smaller.

One thing I will admit is I am kinder to certain nostalgic favorites. Certain artists, like Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello, and Robyn Hitchcock, really can't do much wrong in my eyes anymore, because I have been on a strange long journey with each of them for decades. I can see their indulgences and their diversions in retrospect and have come to regard them as a friend who I've been missing when they come out with new music. They have something to say, and I listen. I don't *always* like it, but I find I'm a lot more charitable with their foibles now. Also, the decades have given me time to think about their words, and the songs will reveal new levels of meaning sometimes, or I will notice a particularly clever turn of phrase that deserves more praise. 

In a similar vein, I find myself more tolerant of ""mature"" works than I did before. As a twenty-something, I would lament a once-great artist hitting their fat middle age. ""No longer relevant,"" I would mutter. ""Embarassingly self-indulgent."" But I kinda get more of that now, even though I can't claim to really understand an artist that intimately, I can relate to the change in tempo, the choice of arrangment, the sentiment, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes world-weary, sometimes craving peace and simplicity. I get it, man, I really do.

I'm also open to more genres. I finally understand the stuff that made me passionate about music is not the end-all, be-all, and in fact it's provincial to think of it as the center of anything. In fact, I frequently find myself wanting to get out of my own head and not even be myself sometimes, and the music of a different culture really helps me do that. I was not a Punta or Gamelan or
Cumbian fan in my twenties, but I am now.

And I respect the negative space and silence you find in music now. The dark and the light. The chairoscuro of Brian Eno, or David Sylvian, or Explosions in the Sky. I've always had an interest in ambience and abstraction in music, but I feel much less impatience with it. I finally realize sometimes it's okay that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do but enjoy the moment, and that I really had trouble with as a young person. 

One thing aging has not done is kill my curiosity. I anticipate releases by young bands just like younger people do, and I like plenty of new music. Some of it, like all music before it, I will always keep with me. To me, there's nothing bad or diminished about music nowadays. It seems like I am constantly finding new artists I like. Sure, I will always have sentimental favorites. But that is not my primary focus, and I don't think it's any better than good music that just happens to not be my favorites.

We talked about Beethoven and Bach and their indisputable genius, but this caused me to think who would be considered a modern musical genius? And on top of that what criteria defines a musical genius in this modern age? My first thought was John Coltrane. Coltrane's playing and compositions are, in my opinion some of the finest work in, relatively, recent music. His playing and compositions reach a higher emotional and intelectual level than most music that I hear today.
   John Coltrane, especially with his late quartet, stretched the use of harmony and, in my opinion, created a new emotional height in improvisation. A Love Supreme was not only a religious masterwork, but it expanded the vocabulary of what Jazz was in that time.  On top of that, Coltrane was one of the most virtuosic saxophone players ever. 
   I was wondering what your opinions were. I, being a composer, would love to discover some new music that I have yet to hear, or to experience music I have heard from a different vantage point.

Personally, I don't believe that 'real' instruments are necessarily superior to synthetic instruments.  I do find that there is a certain warmth that live instrumentation lends to music (Metro Area's [unique  style of disco-house](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgpeZehATH4) certainly benefits greatly from this), but I also think that it's possible to achieve this with mostly synthetic instrumentation (Destroyer's album [Your Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQ1U_ZrqGU) comes to mind).  I think that synthetic instruments are only inferior to 'real' instruments when they are used in place of 'real' instruments, rather than as instruments in their own right.

The Brian Jonestown Massacre is the brainchild and band of Mr. Anton Newcombe, and boy does he have a slight ego. Understandably so, his band just might be a poor man's version of a modern Velvet Underground. If you haven't heard of these guys, then you should keep reading and look into them. If you have, it's probably because you heard of or saw the documentary *Dig!* which documents Newcombe as a psychopath megalomaniac, or maybe that you like the Dandy Warhols and you know the two bands were friends/rivals. 

In any case, BJM might be the most eclectic band in the history of rock and roll, in the sense that they have evolved so much since 1993, covering so many subgenres, and that their music is actually good. Anton may deserve a little vindication for his egomania--he may be about half as good as he thinks he is. 

Here is the nitty-gritty. The band was formed sometime in the early 90s/late 80s. They are from San Francisco originally, and in the early 90s they recorded and released a couple of tunes that eventually made it onto an odds and sods release called *Spacegirl &amp; Other Favourites*. I can;t speak much about these original recordings other than to say that Newcombe succeeded in creating a wall of sound effect with the simplest of layered guitar lines, and that he sings in a perfect English accent. 

Even in the early years, members of the band ran through like a perpetual revolving door. On their first official album, *Methodrone* (1995), eight musicians get credit, including three for drumming. In any case, *Methodrone* is about as shoegaze as a record could be, and everything seems so agreeable. It isn't fantastic in any sense, but it is good and worth checking out. In the discernable lyrics, you can hear the beginnings of a lyrical genius. 

1996 saw BJM release three full-length albums, *Take It From the Man*, *Their Satanic Majesty's Second Request*, and *Thank God For Mental Illness*. The band proved to be a near-mirror example or what 60s revivalist should be, showing a range of influence from the Stones, Beatles, Kinks, Byrds, VU, Dylan, Who, you name it. *Take It* is my favorite of their albums. Instead of sticking to one sound or theme, the album bounces between influences, and really sounds like it could be a TV compilation of the summer of love. In 1997, they release their ""commercial record"" in *Give It Back!*, and honestly, all four are as good as each other (*Take It* is my personal favorite), and are all great places to start with the band. 

In 1998 they released an okay record on TVT Records. It's forgettable compared to the previous stuff, and is the beginning of a decline for the band. Anton began pissing off the core of the band, and into the turn of the century, all his friends had left him (I mean, watch the film on them. I don't know if it is 100percent accurate as an unbiased documentary (and I doubt it is), but it sure as shit shows how mean of a drunk Anton is). In 2001 the band releases *Bravery, Repetition, and Noise*, which is a decent record that would have sounded canon during Joy Division/The Cure's time in a post-punk/new wave world. 

In 2004 they released a retrospective ""greatest hits"" that does a very competent job at covering their career. This corresponded with the release of the documentary. After that, I think the band begins to suck something hard. Anton may have fallen victim to the idea of his own genius, because after that his songwriting becomes pedantic, the musical influences (although interesting) reject mainstream rock and move towards a more slavic feel. Although it sounds like it would be cool, it's like a bad cross between Björk and elevator music. 

In any case, Anton stands by a DIY/indie/punk rock mentality--his music can be found for free on his websites and all over the internet (he loves the idea of pirating). He wears his influences on his sleeve, from the classic rock to the Cure/Spacemen 3, MBV, JMC, all of it.

Man's a genius and his music is awesome.

I thought this might fit better in this forum. This post was inspired by the fact that it seems that many music fans know little or nothing about disco (except that it sucks). I think that a moderate knowledge of disco is useful in providing context for quite a few genres of music. If you are skeptical that you can benefit by learning something about disco, I hope you read on for just a bit, and give me a chance to convince you otherwise.

I hope to address some questions such as:

*What is the origin of disco?

*Did disco suck?

*What was disco all about?

*Why did disco die?

*Why did/do some people hate disco so much?

**The origin of disco**

Disco evolved from soul music (not rock or funk or electronic).   How did the soul music of Motown, Okeh, and other soul and R&amp;B labels turn into disco?  It may have happened via northern England. Prior to the birth of the disco movement, soulies from northern England started developing an appetite for 24 hour dance parties that featured soul music with a fast tempo.  This soul music was not produced in England, but was produced in the US and found its way across the Atlantic by way of fans and collectors.  With the rise of the Beatles and the demise of soul/R&amp;B in the American pop charts (I am not saying these two events are linked) American soul artists who had a hard time selling concert tickets in the US, would travel to northern England to be greeted by thousands of obsessed fans.  Some of these soul artists (e.g. Major Lance) even moved to England for a time to enjoy the love that British soulies had for American soul music.  

I speculate here, but I believe that once soul musicians in the US became aware of the [Northern Soul]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_soul) movement, they began focusing more on danceable, up tempo, soul music. Maybe that had nothing to do with it, but the fact remains, following the demise of Motown, the soul community started to create a lot of up tempo soul songs that could be danced to.  A key player in this shift in soul music is the Philadelphia International record label. [MFSB]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFSB) was the house band of [Philly International Records] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_International_Records) and was [significantly larger than most rock bands](http://imgur.com/kmnBL8d) at the time.  MFSB featured people on guitar, bass, and keyboards, as well as several drummers, several string players (with classical backgrounds), and several people in their horn section.  The up tempo dance music created by Philly International was (as far as I know) the undisputed foundation upon which disco was created.  The music was rhythmically complex, and featured the integration of smooth strings with funky horns (not something that is always easy to do).  MFSB produced many instrumental tracks, and also served as the backing band for a string of soul vocalists at P.I. Records.  This was NOT synth music.  It wasn’t robotic, it wasn’t disposable, and it had soul.

Due to a disagreement with [Gamble and Huff] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamble_and_Huff) at P.I. Records, MFSB moved to [Salsoul Records]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsoul_Records) in 1974.  Because of this move, MSFB became the [Salsoul Orchestra]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsoul_Orchestra).  The [Salsoul Orchestra](http://imgur.com/XZX4234) created music similar to MFSB, but they featured a lot more Latin percussion.  Many of their tracks featured timbales, bongos, and congas in addition to a traditional rock drum kit.  The output of the Salsoul Orchestra was all (or at least mostly) disco.  Vocalists for Salsoul Records included Loleatta Holloway, Rochelle Fleming of [First Choice]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Choice_%28band%29), and Jocelyn Brown of [Inner Life]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Life). These women could sing the shit out of a song, and they brought undeniable soul to the proceedings. Other notable acts on the label included Skyy, Candido, Joe Bataan, &amp; Double Exposure.  The disco story isn’t only the story of Salsoul: other notable record labels included [West End]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Records), [Scepter]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scepter_Records), [Prelude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_Records_%28record_label%29), and [P&amp;P Records]( http://www.artandpopularculture.com/P%26P_Records).  [Casablanca Records] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_Records) had Donna Summer and the Village People on their roster.  Unlike the other disco labels, however, Casablanca was owned by major labels (Warner Bros. and then PolyGram) and it didn’t specialize in disco (e.g. Kiss and Cher were signed to Casablanca).

Celestial Light Beings by Desolate. I picked this album up on a whim and it blew me away. I think it's one of the best albums of the year, probably second only to Channel Orange. And yet, nobody else I know has heard of it. Even doing research online, I found only one or two poorly written amateur reviews of it. It didn't get attention from any major publication and showed up on no year in review lists. In my opinion, the thing is freaking amazing. It effortlessly blends techno and dubstep influences (here's looking at you, Burial) into a sound that is atmospheric, developed, and emotionally intriguing. I haven't been touched by an album so much since Untrue itself. Its greatest strength is probably the strings and orchestral arrangements, which are absolutely gorgeous and some of the best sounding strings I've ever heard (case in point: tracks like [Exclusion Of Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqu-N-3pMYI) or [Farewell #3 and #4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6RhfvAHKac).

The songs were recorded during his divorce and drip of sadness and resentment for his ex, the lyrics are some of the most personal I've ever heard and for some reason I feel myself relating with him more here than anything else in his repitoire. The song 'Is That Enough' is probably my favourite of his, it's a slow tempo funky soul piece where he directly confronts his wife, asking if a million dollars is enough and telling of her using their child against him. I don't think any other song has touched me as much, along with others on his masterpiece. 

Another I'm thinkin' of going through the pantheon of my favorite bands is Sabotage by Black Sabbath. This album was released during a quite tumultuous period of their career (after Sabbath Bloody Sabbath/before Technical Ecstacy). They were burnt out by the touring, drinking and coke and descending into madness quite frankly, it made for a equally mad album. The whole thing is just a beast in my opinion, the opening track Hole in the Sky starts the show in foot stomping fist pumping riffage then the juggernaut of Symptom of the Universe is unleashed with Iommi giving it hell with a devilish metal whipping. But for me its Meglomania, Thrill of It All and The Writ - the former being a 9 minute ascendance to the joys of heaven only to show signs of debilitating schizophrenia with a screaming Ozzy and the whirling guitar. Then Thrill of it All comes in its sludgy glory to rise up like a phoenix lashing out the wah wah guitars, the album could be likened to Be Here Now for its excess but I think they reign it in way better and this song and The Writ prove it.

I went to the gig having recently discovered the band through their early 1990s output. Then, the band played a sort of mixture of shoegaze and spacey psychedelia that pushed all the right buttons for me: they seemed like the shoegaze band I had dreamed of discovering, playing utterly beautiful delicate wisps of songs that had some of the [best vocal harmonies I had ever heard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui4TSmQRaH4) with a wonderfully [catchy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvqscpQmLc) sense of melody and an occasional penchant for [noisy freakouts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5fQO2vADqk). I loved what I heard and the moment I saw that they were playing a venue near where I lived (even if in a reunited form), I press-ganged a couple of friends who have similar tastes in music into coming to the gig with me. I even looked up live footage of the band and [shit looked pretty good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0nzk38zRJQ).

I hyped the band enormously to them, saying that they were one of the most beautiful bands I had ever heard (I still pretty much stand by this) and that they were in for an hour and a half of the most gorgeous shoegaze ever created, blah blah blah.

Instead, what we got was a noise show.

Not a noise-rock show, a **noise** show. The band consisted of four guitarists, who sat/kneeled onstage in a sea of pedals and tortured their instruments. One guy held a **naked flame** against his pickups for a few minutes. Another guy periodically screamed unintelligibly into a mic. At one point, one of the guys stood up for a bit. Everyone surged forward, assuming that perhaps the band was going to play an actual *song* and that everything up until now had been a warm-up. The guy swayed around a bit and then sat down again to carry on fiddling with his pedals.

About 50 minutes into the show, one of my friends tapped me on the shoulder to tell me that ~70% of the audience had either left or retreated to the back room to watch the football. Just before the show, the bar-room had been pretty much packed, and the excitement had been tangible, but even as my friend pointed out how the room had drained, we saw a couple of other people slope out, looking disappointed.

* Should they have been disappointed? Is this a valid reaction?

* The band played some ""regular"" shows last year. Was it a dick-move to do a noise show in front of a packed and stoked audience?

* Does it run against the point of art to ""expect"" or ""demand"" that artists do X or Y?

Of course, my example is just the tip of the iceberg - whenever an artist changes his/her sound, or does something out of the ordinary, or collaborates with a left-field choice, people inevitably get pissed off. Is there any validity to this?

Another good example is [Bradford Cox's famous ""My Sharona"" debacle](http://pitchfork.com/news/45658-watch-bradford-cox-terrifies-audience-in-minneapolis-covers-my-sharona-for-an-hour/): was this a dick-move? Does Bradford deserve to be criticised and vilified for this (he was)? Is it reasonable to show up and simply expect him to run through *Parallax*?

***

I should probably mention that my friends and I actually really enjoyed the Telescopes gig: partly because the [opening band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie5cHAjK1Z4) was awesome, but also because there was a point after which the noise stopped being off-putting and started being entrancing - we just stood there, swaying slightly, letting it wash over and through us, and it was kind of amazing. One of my friends is a huge experimental music nut and started going on about Xenakis and aleatory music and how interesting the techniques at work were.

(0-10) - mostly just listened to whatever my parents listened to. Unfortunately for me, this was mainly 80's music (no offense)

(11-13) - I listened to a lot of stuff my friends listened to which at the time was mainly rap and stuff on the 'popular' radio stations - eminem, 50 cent, green day

(13-16) - hate to admit it, but this was the time when all of that emo music was cool so I regrettably followed that trend. I listened to a lot of garbage, but one great thing that came out of this time period was my discovery of Underoath, who I still very much enjoy. Around the time I was 16 though I started to fade out of the whole emo/hardcore scene and started listening to indie music (The Format, Tegan and Sara, The Killers, Tokyo Police Club)

(17-19) - I discovered a ton of amazing artists like Animal Collective, MGMT, Crystal Castles, Fuck Buttons, Starfucker, Joanna Newsom, Gang Gang Dance. During this time I listened to a lot of neo-psychedeila, lo-fi, experimental electronic, freak folk and indie music

(20-present) I still listen to all of the artists I just mentioned above, and for the last year or so I have been very into noise music (Lucky Dragons, Black Dice, Flying Lotus, Oneohtrix Point Never) and world music/ethnic fusion as well as freak folk

Artists which are often put in the genre such as The Olivia Tremor Control, Animal Collective (and spin-offs like Panda Bear) and Tame Impala don't exactly sound alike to me.

So, does anyone wish to educate my pretty naive opinions on the genre? As I've said, I've never really explored psychedelic rock in depth though I do enjoy much of what I've heard. I'm most interested in the origins of the genre and it's development, so if anyone wants to give me a few 60s/70s bands I'd be delighted.

The theme was an album from 1996, and *If You're feeling sinister* by Belle &amp; Sebastian won.

Here's what /u/crookedsleet had to say about the album in his nomination:
&gt;The British indie pop album that was recorded only months after B&amp;S' debut record, Tigermilk, If You're Feeling Sinister is forty minutes of music that spends most of that time examining the lives of lonely, introspective teenagers and young adults. These characters include possibly lesbian track and field stars, a misanthropic Catholic who is broken beyond repair, and the narrators of many of these songs, who tend to paint themselves as lonely, misunderstood, or, for lack of a better word, friend-zoned. The album's delicate stories and catchy tunes transformed them from a collection of unknown musicians into what might be the most important cult band since The Smiths, at least for a certain group of listeners.

&gt;While it is now very well known, at least among indie circles, it still doesn't get the recognition it deserves here in the states. But I recommend this album for discussion mostly because it has had such a profound effect on my life, and I'd like to see if other listeners have had similar reactions to the record.

To try and give people something else to talk about too, I'll post the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4de-RHHLCBA) to a stellar documentary Pitchfork did on this album. Gives a ton of background info surrounding how the album was made, with interviews from people close to the band.

However, I'm wondering what everyone's opinion is on them. The names are used interchangeably within the scene, it seems, but both are such umbrella terms. Most bands have their own niche that makes them unique. I'll post some of my favorite bands in the genre, but I'd like to get some insight on other overlooked acts

[Carissa's Wierd - Ignorant Piece of Shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdl6V5otgoY). Songs About Leaving has made me cry more than any album I've listened to. Beautifully orchestrated chamber-sadcore. Jenn Ghetto is fucking brilliant, and her solo project, [S](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByefGtfYwZ0&amp;feature=related), is equally brilliant. In the same vein is [Arco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NnAvD3j_A), a highly underrated group.

[Duster - Unrecovery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIVRNP4e_cY&amp;feature=relmfu). Really lo-fi space-rock slowcore. I like them a lot because of their tying in of shoegaze elements whilst keeping that vocal restrain that slowcore is known for. If you're a fan of Spiritualized then you'll probably like these guys. It's what I imagine [Spiritualized](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-x2qzkS98) to have started off sounded like when they fucked around as a band for the first time.

[Codeine - Cave-In](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XQIT1_oKVY&amp;feature=related). Honestly, one of my favorite sadcore artists. I never fully appreciated this band until I bought Frigid Stars on vinyl; being forced to sit down and listen to this band that wrote some of the most hear-wrenching songs was an experience. The amount of restrain that they have is incredible; every drilled chord and drum hit sounds like it's about to lead into a catharsis but never does. The only band that I can think of that rivals such tension in structure is [Low](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrUoK_TvVa8&amp;feature=fvwrel) (another personal favorite), though they don't have the gritty terseness of Codeine.

[Bluetile Lounge - Wriding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3Qi2T90Ys&amp;feature=related). BL is from Perth, Australia and no one I talk to has heard of them. Up there as a personal favorite all time band, the only word I can think of that describes their music is brooding. The feelings evoked by the chord progression of every song is hopeful leading to hopelessness. I really would like to find more bands that sound like them.

So, I don't know, let's talk about these genres as I'd like to hear some feedback and some recommendations based upon what I posted!

He claimed that *Room on Fire* wasn't as solid an album as *Is This It* not because the actual songs weren't as strong, but because it didn't really break any new ground for them.  Now I agree that *Is This It* is definitely their best work, but I don't think that the fact that it didn't particularly expand their sound should take away from one's opinion of it.  So I ask this -

Should a critique of an album take into account if it breaks new ground?  And a different question with a similar focus, should albums be judged in a vacuum?

So often bands are dismissed with statements of ""sounds like ___, whatever"" or ""they're just copying ___"".  Obviously The Strokes were heavily praised for their debut even though it did sound like Television and a bunch of other post-punkers, but I think too many albums and bands are criticized too quickly for being derivative of something else.

Starting about six months ago, I decided to give them a chance based on some of their newer music, and realized albums were actually pretty solid. When you get past the radio singles, there's a lot of depth in the lyrics of their older work, along with quite a bit of instrument variation,  which made their first two album pretty refreshing to me.

It just kind of hit me that six or seven years ago I refused to listen to them because every other girl in my school seemed mystified by I Write Sins not Tragedies and other guys thought the band was stupid, and I kind of followed suit.

Nirvana, Neutral Milk Hotel, My Bloody Valentine (at least for now), Joy Division, and LCD Soundsystem are good examples of this. They all have at least one classic album in a relatively small discography. However, just when the band seems to be on top of the word, they break up for one reason or another. This leads many people wanting more from them and creates a legacy that they were a great band that broke up too soon.

Now lets look at when the opposite happens. Many artists release classic albums and then proceed to release many mediocre albums afterwards. This, I believe leads us to respect the album more then the artist. For example, lets take The Strokes with ""Is This Is."" Their debut album is deemed a classic while the albums that followed it were just alright. This leads us to refer the *album* as a classic rather then the band as great. Not many people say that the strokes are one of the greatest modern rock bands but everybody agrees that Is This it is a classic.

The artists I mentioned earlier, as well as others, quit while they were on top and before they had a chance to ruin their legacy. Also, I believe that the mere fact that they only have two or three albums adds simplicity to their name. When somebody looks up a band for the first time and sees that they have already released over six albums, it can be a little intimidating on which one to start with. However, when somebody looks up Joy Division for the first time and sees that they have only two albums it looks a lot simpler and easier to get into. 

Of course, there is a third section of artists who release great album after great album. The most obvious examples of this are the Beatles and Radiohead. This is very difficult as with every great album, the public's exceptions for the next album keep getting higher. The Beatles broke up before they released a bad album that ruined they're legacy. I guess my overall point is this: If you want to have a great legacy as a **band,** you must quit while you are on top. This may mean quitting after a classic album or it producing more more albums for a while if you believe that you can still produce great music.

All of it is teaching me things to appreciate in music and I'm loving all of it. That said i feel more and more like I've hit a dead end and need some new direction.

So lets pitch our favored genre and maybe a few good starting places. I'll start. 

Punk rock is all about intensity of emotion, it's about the moment when your emotion coalesces and forms a song. The best of the genre is quick, intense, and personal. Classics like the Buzzcocks and The Ramones are classic goto's but I'm going to list a few that stretch the limits of what the genre can be a bit, 

Bomb The Music Industry - Syke, Life is Awesome (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5Dypaw46fA)

These guys are great, I've heard them called indie rock for stupid people and it's fair. This song is relativity tame for them. 

The Ergs - Pray for Rain
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1feF-NX2jM)

The Ergs are probably the best straight forward pop punk band of the last decade, They've taken all of the elements that have been used in the genre over the years and executed on them perfectly. Dork Rock Cork Rod is a classic. 

One of the other big movents in the genre has been the birth of ""folk"" punk. Planit-X is pretty much the big label for the genre. 

Andrew Jackson Jihad - People II: The Reckoning
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyY7Yvx2PYA)

Probably the best of the genre. In my opinon these guys get the closest to Neutral Milk Hotel out of anything I've ever heard. 

Anyways, I'm kinda drunk and rambling.

When I was in 5th grade our english teacher gave us an assignment to make a poster of our favorite band. I don't even remember what I made but this girl I liked made a poster of The Offspring. This is around the time when Americana came out and I suddenly stopped listening to everything else and just listened to The Offspring. Until 8th grade I was mainly listening to a lot of popular punk bands and MTV. Then someone introduced me to Metallica, and I was completely obsessed with them and other trash metal for about 2 years. I slowly transitioned into prog rock. Nothing too fancy, mostly Dream Theater. Came 10th grade and I finally started drawing influence from my dad and started getting into softer, more melodic classic rock like Dire Straits and Jethro Tull. By the time I graduated I thought I was the biggest Pink Floyd fan the world has ever seen.

College was all about new music for me so I dropped my classic rock obsession and started to see live shows. I was ready to accept everything Indie had to offer from The Olivia Tremor Control to Four Tet. I was living in Vancouver at the time so I was listening to a lot of Canadian indie-famous bands like Broken Social Scene and Arcade Fire and Metric... Making my way through any genre I was exposed to by friends and the city, towards the end of college I finally settled on 2 main genres: folk/pop/rock with a psychedlic feel and downtemo electronic/chillout. I still listen to everything with the exception of hip hip and metal, but on a regular day this is an example of a playlist I will mong out to:

MGMT - I Found a Whistle

Elliott Smith - Christian Brothers

Chad VanGaalen - Willow Tree

Arcade Fire - Vampire/Forest Fire

Radiohead - Life in a Glasshouse

And most of the time it's negative, but I don't mean it to be negative. What I want to talk about here is albums in which the band A) Sold more records than previous albums and B) The band (maybe even slightly) changed their style to do-so.

When someone says sellout album to me, I think of 4 specific albums:

*Muse - Black Holes and Revelations*

This album was less heavy than previous works. It was around the release of this album that compassion between Muse and Queen became common. I couldn't find exact numbers, but it was their highest selling album at the time.

*Metallica - Metallica (Black Album)*

I'm sure no one needs an explanation as to why I feel like this is a Sellout album. Metallica abandoned their melodic, harmony-filled style in favor of a more simplistic, slower, catchier, style. This album went 16x platinum.

*Modest Mouse - Good News for People Who Love Bad News*

We see a lot of changes in this album. While not every song on previous albums were long, this album only has one single song over five minutes long. The songs are more hook based, and there is significantly less use of the whammy bar on the guitars, which was a staple of their sound up to this point. It sold 1.5 million copies, their highest selling album to date.

~~*Bob Dylan - Bringing It All Back Home*~~

~~This was Dylan's first electric album. It really pissed off a lot of people. Dylan went on to continue to play electric for the rest of his 40+ year career.~~

Edit: Fair enough, I suppose Dylan was in fact, NOT selling out.

*I'm not by any means saying these are the only Sellout albums, or even the best 4 examples. These are just personally what comes to mind for me.

The interesting thing about these albums, is that even though each of them represent a point in the artist's career when they changed their sound for the mainstream, I think they are all very good albums. (Maybe with the exception of Metallica) I listen to all of these on a regular basis. In the case of Muse and Metallica, most people would argue that the quality of their work decreased after the release of these albums. Modest Mouse and Bob Dylan, on the other hand, have released quality material even after a dramatic shift in their sound.

What are your thoughts on Sellout albums?

Artists often bristle at the idea of being pigeonholed into a genre, often because they simply don't like being associated with the name.  This might be due to the negative connotations of the term itself, or it might be because they consider their style and influences more diverse than a single term can describe. 

For example, Kurt Cobain was widely known to hate the term ""grunge"" (along with just about every band that was considered grunge). Mogwai have expressed that they dislike the term post-rock.  

Some of them sound silly and pretentious like IDM (Intelligent Dance Music). Some of them make a lot of assumptions--does post-punk necessitate that punk must be dead? Do you have to like marijuana to listen to ""Stoner Rock""?   Some of them are simply misunderstood due to their diversity and long history: What does the term ""ska"" conjure up in your head?

My parents are immigrants so I did not have a huge amount of American musical influence in my life from my family growing up.  I mostly bought pop music cassettes of artists i would hear on Z100, the popular radio station in the NYC area at the time.  Then 1987 hit.  My whole musical perspective was about to be turned upside down.  

I was 12 years old, living contently in my pop radio world.  My older sister had started listening to non-pop music and i borrowed a cassette from her.  New Order - Substance.  I turned it on and was blown away.  It was unlike anything I had ever heard on the radio.  It had these electronic beats and sounds.  I felt like I was listening to the future.  Bernard Sumner's voice was not as polished or refined as most music I had listened to, but it had raw emotion and character to it.  From the gothic background voices from [""Everything's Gone Green""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJNOkQ-jqCE), to the hypnotizing drum rhythm of [""Blue Monday""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk).  From the Soothing synthesizer of the wordless [""Thieves Like Us""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1ldXDJicY) to the pure unadulterated joy of [""Bizarre Love Triangle""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS7tFKNlyXc), this was music that released something inside of me I didn't know existed.  Peter Hook's signature basslines, Bernard Sumner's guitar riffs, Stephen Morris' textured rhythms, Gillian Gilbert's often sugarcoated syth melodies all came together to form a euphoric blend to my ears.  I must have listened to that album multiple times every day for at least 3 months.

Eventually New Order opened the door to more syth styled music like Depeche Mode, The Pet Shop Boys, and Yazoo.  Those bands in turn led me to bands like The Replacements, The Jesus and Mary Chain, R.E.M., Joy Division, and the Stone Roses.  Soon i started watching ""Post Modern MTV"" and ""120 Minutes"" on MTV late at night.  (Yes, sadly MTV used to actually play mostly music once upon a time.)  These 2 shows with their heavily British influenced playlists of non mainstream music would become the catalyst for my journey into real music.  My ears and mind would open up and come to appreciate so much more.  My musical tastes are now extremely varied.  From Punk, to Soul, from Synthpop to Jazz, I love most genres of music.  

But deep in my heart, til the day I die, New Order's Substance will be my first love.  You never forget the one that popped your cherry.  I still listen to this album quite frequently 25 years later, and i don't think I will ever stop.

It just seems eerie that we now have the ability to, figuratively speaking, bring musicians back from the dead in order to preform in a place and time they never would've known. 

I'm kinda just going with my gut here, because watching the show on youtube seemed not only tacky, but almost immoral. Exploitation, even in the most subtle form, just rubs me the wrong way and I was definitely feeling that when watching Snoop and Dre's set. 

Who knows, maybe 2Pac would be fine with appearing in concert from beyond the grave. In addition, I'm just some far away observer, who wasn't caught up in the excitement of the show. It probably was fucking badass to see this happen in person, but watching this performance miles away from Indio, California just leaves me feeling dirty and slightly ashamed for Dre and Snoop.

""It's barely yours on loan

What you think you own

The place that you call home

The ideas in your bones""


I feel like here, and throughout the album, martsch is coming to terms with the fact that life is fleeting and nothing is permanent. Everything that belongs to you and you feel that matters will all be gone in a very short period of time, a time trap we;re all stuck in where life might not even be worth living.


I found this cynicism to be pretty prevalent throughout the album which seemed like such a big departure from the songs of ""There's Nothing Wrong With Love"", my favorite album of theirs. Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe I'm still interpenetrating these songs  incorrectly.

I refused to give up on the record.  Except for the quick hits of ""Lullaby"" and ""Lovesong,"" this is not a record of instant gratification, not in the pop sense. Each song is an emotional movement. 

""Pictures of You"" in it's original seven minutes is a dull sense of longing that aches like a bruise. 

The riff in ""Last Dance"" that explodes through the ocean like synths just aches. 

The title track has the absolute best bass hook in music.

Mine would have to be King Crimson. For starter's, they basically invented prog with the release of ""In the Court of the Crimson King"", which is probably one of the best debut albums by any band ever. Their music drew from sources that were unconventional in rock music, making them groundbreaking at the time. They blended together the heaviness of rock, improvisation of jazz and even some classical, to create a sound that was wholly unique. Take for instance, the opening track of ITCOTCK: [21st Century Schizoid Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujIbpt-CCTY).

They were also ever evolving. Consider [70's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukvu-CS822Y) Crimson and then [80's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8tqEas6mjY) Crimson and then [90's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLknXJ9iLEA) Crimson. They went through multiple lineups, but have always had virtuosic musicians at the helm(Fripp, Bruford, Whetton, Lake, Belew, Levin, etc...).

Personally I think if the core fans move away from a band/artist once they gain mass popularity it has less to do the ""hipster"" mentality, or anything of that manner, but that the popularity over saturates the music. I turned on XM the other day, and was surprised to see Macklamore's name pop up on one of the pop stations, and then I flipped the next station and sure enough Thrift Shop had just started playing on that station. I feel this the biggest push back for the core fans, as the songs they had loved, and listen to a lot, is now being forced, and they know that they will now hear this song all the time, whereas before they only heard it when they wanted to. It wasn't on the radio, or in ads, it was in a playlist or on a youtube video, so what was something they could pull up and relisten to, is nothing something they will hear every time they turn on XM or FM, or on a commercial, or on a TV talk show. And they also feel that the general public won't really get past the popular songs, and to the ""better"" part of the album, and so to keep those fans around the artist might release another album with more easy to eat style so as to appease to new fans.

I don't know if this is really true or not, or if people really go think like this. I personally don't. I judge artist by an album to album release, and not by what their standings on Billboard is. So if they release a crappy record to appease to fans, then I won't like it, not because it is popular, but because it is not good, to my standards anyways.

So what do you all think, do you think there is a real backlash from core fans when a group/artist becomes popular, and if so, why? Or do you think it more that the artist just can't produce to the standard core fans believe in, and the backlash comes from it? Or do you believe that there won't ever really be a huge backlash, and just like, say, Weezer and Radiohead, fans will stick through with them, no matter the fame?",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_17b8u7,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/17b8u7/lets_talk_bands_that_get_popular/,

I know that with the advent of the internet, a lot of music has crossed former barriers and styles have started to change, but I can't help feel there's still something to the individuality of local music.For instance, in my local rock scene [Detroit], artists are hugely influenced by the classical scene of Detroit - the garage movement in the 60's, proto-punk, and the burgeoning punk movement in the 70's. 

What this means for local rock here in the D is that, yes, you get a lot of White Stripes rip offs and a lot of people trying to be like [The Gories](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mztdluGsXZE), but you also get a lot of cool music that you wouldn't get elsewhere, because of the musical history of the place. 

For instance, the correlation of Detroit with punk and garage music means that a lot of artists like those genres and related ones - pyscho-pop for instance. I don't think you would get bands with the exact make up of [Deadbeat Beat](http://deadbeatbeat.bandcamp.com/) or [The Vonneguts](http://www.reverbnation.com/thevonneguts) ([more examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKR04s6e08E) from [my favorite band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zENNPtS0yLI)) without that extremely local local influence. The Von Bondies are another band that I don't think could necessarily be reproduced in another city. 

I think this also means a lot for the lyrical content of the song, as location really elicits emotion. Again using Detroit (because that's what I know): the song [Hotel Yorba](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc10iqX0DuY) means more if you're familiar with the actual [Hotel Yorba](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Detroit_Hotel_Yorba_2008.jpg).

This got me thinking a little bit about album art. A lot of album covers (like [*The Dark Side of the Moon*](http://i.imgur.com/OAJV7Wm.jpg), or [*Abbey Road*](http://i.imgur.com/ZcZw60v.jpg), [*London Calling*](http://i.imgur.com/GfRsO9x.jpg), or [*Nevermind*](http://i.imgur.com/CPTPydx.jpg)) seem to be cultural icons in rock as much as the music on the albums themselves. Even today, album covers like [*In the Aeroplane Over the Sea*](http://i.imgur.com/e7sfH3S.jpg) or [*The Money Store*](http://i.imgur.com/GPrHMHy.jpg) have attained a memetic status over the Internet, especially over image-centric forums like reddit or 4chan. However, the *New Yorker* article I linked suggests that the importance of album art is declining with the rise of CD and digital formats. And I've heard a lot of people saying that album art has gotten worse lately - the covers for the newest releases by [My Bloody Valentine](http://i.imgur.com/QWdbLs4.jpg), [The Knife](http://i.imgur.com/YgDfQbt.jpg), [David Bowie](http://i.imgur.com/9Q7L5M5.jpg), and [Justin Timberlake](http://i.imgur.com/wX1vHyL.jpg) have been criticized on these grounds, for example.

So here are a few questions in convenient list format:

1. Does album art matter to you? Does good album art make you appreciate an album more? Does bad album art turn you off from listening to album?
2. Is the digital age killing album art as physical formats decline? Or is it opening up new possibilities?
3. What about aspects of album art other than album covers? Think packaging (like Godspeed You! Black Emperor including a crushed penny with every copy of *F♯A♯∞*) or non-visual art (like the novel that accompanies the self-titled Giles Corey album or the short stories that accompany Tori Amos' *Strange Little Girls*)

I have listened to every Red Hot Chili Peppers album that has come out--except for their newest one, *I'm With You*--most of them multiple times, and, despite them being hailed as one of the greatest modern bands, despite basically everyone I know being at least something of a fan, and despite being the perfect audience for them (based on a lot of my favorites,) for some reason I *can't stand them!*

This doesn't make sense. I love other funky alternative-rock bands that got big in the 90s, like Primus, Rage Against the Machine, etc., and I really like a lot of the old school funk that they get off on, i.e. Sly, P-Funk, James Brown, etc., and I've got a deep love for punk music, in particular old school hardcore and post-punk. Beyond that, my musical tastes are all over the board--today alone I've listened to Nine Inch Nails, Del tha Funkee Homosapien, King Crimson, Dry Kill Logic, Pestilence and Rush, all bands which I love (and say what you will about Dry Kill Logic or nu-metal in general, I think they're a creative, talented and interesting band.) So...I should love RHCP, right?

Nope.

No matter how hard I try, I just can't get into them.

I find their songs boring, their performance styles extremely derivative, their lyrical content annoying, and their attitude fucking unbearable.

This wouldn't be as big of a deal with a different act. But I've *lost friends* over this, because RHCP fans are fucking devoted. I've been told that my taste in music is shit, all because I don't like this one band.

This is one fucking band. And I think they're fucking awful. And I'm apparently the only person in the world who thinks this.

Can we have a serious discussion about them? Tell me why I'm wrong, agree with me, open my mind, whatever. I just want to be able to bring this up *once* without getting a death threat for not liking this band.

EDIT: I do just want to say that I don't hate *everything* about them. As far as individual musicians go, I'm willing to be the first to admit that they're all quite talented. I like a little bit of John Frusciante's solo material--again, not a huge fan, but I've liked what I've heard well enough. I really do have strong negative feelings about RHCP, though. I guess I just don't ""get"" it.

* What qualifies as ""unknown""?  Following in a similar pattern as r/under10k, let's say that one of their most recent songs (within 6 months) must have less than 10,000 views, their Facebook page has less than 1,000 likes, or (since internet isn't everything) you haven't come across any other person who has heard of them in your musical discourse (just going to have to take your word for it).  The group/artist only needs to meet ONE of the criteria.  Therefore if a recent song has 5,000 views on YouTube but the artist has 3,400 likes on Facebook, it's fair game.

* What do you mean by ""up-and-coming""?  The band must have been created within the past 5 years.

* What do you mean by ""progress""?  This question is probably obvious, but just to clarify I simply mean for you to discuss which band are you most excited about.  List bands that you expect will be big, list bands that are small but seem to be going through some exciting stylistic changes, list some bands that are just about to release new albums or singles.  Another way to view this aspect of the question could be: What is your secret, hidden band that you are pumped to grow with and continue to follow?

* Just so we don't have dozens of aimless entries, there is a **maximum of 2 bands** that you're allowed to introduce us to.  So show us your best!

* If you could, just give a slight description on *why*.  It doesn't have to be long, but just a few sentences so we have an idea of what you're thinking.

1344052926.0,35,self.LetsTalkMusic,xnnp3,Lets talk about concept albums,nkoontz93,44,9,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/xnnp3/lets_talk_about_concept_albums/,"I've always found concept albums to be very interesting in the way that they flow. Many times, it seems; this flow places more emphasis on the album and less on a song. I hope to begin a discussion on what makes a concept album work well, what makes it not work, and what kind of concept is interesting without being alienating to the listener. Also, where would you draw the line when discerning what is and isn't a concept album?

One thing that I have noticed is that the concept generally does not interfere greatly with the songs, but gives them an overarching theme. For instance, In ""Sgt. Pepper's..."" by The Beatles, the beginning and near ending feature an audience and addressing the audience as though it were a live show. However, most of their songs did not feature any nods to the concept, but were simply played in a similar style. 

Another good example is ""Songs For The Deaf"" by Queens of the Stone Age. The concept is that the listener is listening to the radio as it goes in and out of radio stations while exiting Las Angeles (headed towards Las Vegas). The radio goes out conveniently after a song is played so that the listener can skip the excess audio. Again this does not interfere with the songs until they are over.

As a change of pace, I now want to look at more subjective concepts. My example will be the album ""Wish You Were Here"" by Pink Floyd. This does not feature a concept like the previous two titles mentioned, but features songs that flow together and semi-tell a story. It is considered a concept album by most, but I don't understand how it is and if it is where to draw the line with other albums. I hate to draw this comparison because of how different the two are, but I feel as though it is a good example: ""Songs about Jane"" by Maroon 5. It has flow to it and features a story-esque feature in which the singer describes his relationships and feelings. I do not see how we can say that it is not just as much of a concept album as a Pink Floyd album is. I don't think the depth of the writing can be the discerning factor (Sgt Pepper's wasn't all that deep), nor the long flowing instrumental parts (that would restrict concept albums to few genres). Likewise, every Explosions in the Sky album could, in my opinion; be considered concept albums as the songs all seem to tell a story with similar style.

So, how do we determine what is just the same style of music and what is a concept album? Would you agree that good concept albums generally give structure to the album without breaking up the individual songs into pieces? What type of concept album would you like to see, and how could you pull it off? Edit: How do you think concept albums will change with changes in music culture and purchase methods, will the new tradition of buying songs and not albums cause concept albums to disappear or emerge to stimulate album purchases?

Please feel free to use examples, but remember to use them as reference and support. Simply pasting your favorite album and saying you liked it or stating the concept for it does not contribute to the conversation. Further more, if you would like to pose your own questions and opinions, go for it. I'm looking not only to discuss these questions posed, but to discuss concept albums as a whole.

This month we will review [Halcyon Digest by Deerhunter](http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/LTM+Album+Club+number+1+Deerhunter+Halcyon+Digest/67350791). Thought we'd start off this tradition with an indie-famous album, with critical acclaim as well as some controversy.

------

Thoroughly [weird](http://blog.iso50.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-53-450x535.png) and always genuine frontman and driver Bradford Cox is steering Deerhunter away from noise a little bit more with every release. Halcyon Digest is not an exception to this trend, and believe it or not there is not a trace of a disappointed tone in that statement. Besides that, the abundant presence of the Deerhunter sound on Halcyon Digest is comforting. The simpler and softer the songs are getting, the more I can appreciate the minimalist, psychedelic, detail oriented music Bradford has always been about.

Much of the lyrics and riffs Deerhunter writes are a product of automatic writing. Knowing this not only makes the listener forgive the album's subjective flaws but also makes the high points that much more impressive for me.

I want to talk a little bit about my favorite, as Kevin Barnes says **holy fuck** moment. 4th song, *Sailing* is this beautiful, haunting, slow, and clean tune and the chorus ""only here... can make you feel lonely out here..."" gives me chills. I also especially like *Helicopter* and *He Would Have Laughed*, which is supposedly about/dedicated to Jay Reatard.

All in all, it's not the most psychedelic thing rock has to offer, but the experimental yet immediate sound is just fantastic and if you are into any kind of mellow and bright music, you should give this album a listen, then come here and tell us what you think!

I'd give it around 8.2941.

1- **Anvil** (an early 80s thrash metal band). I watched the documentary ""Anvil! The Story of Anvil"" on netflix, which is basically about how back in the early 80s, they were playing large festivals alongside the likes of Bon Jovi, but since then, due to bad management, bad producers and probably just general ineptitude for the business-side of music, they never got the big break that their initial success seemed to deserve and even though to this day, they still try to write and record a hit album that'll get them noticed, they play gigs that barely net more than 50-100 people. 

2-**MGMT** This was probably more due to record labels trying to cast them as a pop-band when if anything they were actually more of a indie-rock band. Even so, they tried to make the transition toward artistic/creative control way too quickly with their second album (""Congratulations"") and I think ultimately lost a huge amount of their previous following (many of whom only knew them for ""Kids"" and ""Time To Pretend""). I heard somewhere that their next album is going to be much more tightly controlled by their label (due to the mediocre success of ""Congratulations""), so maybe they'll pick up steam again.

EDIT: Yes, I'm mainly referring to commercial failure, ""Congratulations"" was by no means a bad album, I thoroughly enjoyed it. BUT for the majority of their audience who was expecting more pop rock releases,  ""Congratulations"" pushed MGMT back into obscurity for the time being.

Some questions include: *is the music industry systematic in the way that it approaches skin color* and *does the music industry mirror society or does it influence society?* In order to get things going, let me offer a few examples of what I am talking about.

1)	Stew (a black male) decided to form a rock band in the 1990s and tried to get his band signed to a label.  Because he was lead vocalist, the record labels only wanted to sign his band if they could promote them to urban or r&amp;b radio.  Stew knew that his music was as rock-n-roll as the Beatles or the Fifth Dimension [example]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c38MHj0_itg) [example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eFm55-Qhh8) [example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qLv3erjTRsz0) 
Stew’s solution: stay on a minor label and call his band “The Negro Problem” (because the music industry seemed to think that blacks do hip-hop and r&amp;b while whites do rock, and therefore Stew’s band was essentially a negro problem). Note: this is the story I read in the liner notes of one of his albums and I don’t have confirmation of it.


2)	Rick Astley (a white male) was a soul vocalist, but I think a lot of Americans think of Astley as being and 80s pop phenomenon rather than an 80s soul phenomenon.  Although Rick’s videos sometimes featured dark skinned actors, the style of [his videos] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA) was more A-Ha or Wham than it was Chaka Khan.  Thus the creative choices regarding his videos may have helped people perceive him as a pop artist rather than a soul artist.


3)	Red Hot Chili Peppers released a song [Give it away] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8) in 1991 that was awarded a Grammy for best hard rock song. While the Chili Peppers are white guys (who normally dominate hard rock) the song itself appears to be an example of funk with something akin to rapping used in the vocals.  


4)	MTV initially had a rock music only policy in regards to airing videos.  The video for Blondie’s [Rapture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g) (a rap track by a white group) was aired by MTV because it was rock, while music from Michael Jackson and Prince could not be aired on MTV because it wasn’t rock.  That makes sense right? While MTV never admitted that their rock-only policy was really a white-only policy, they did give in to pressure (both popular and financial), and in 1983 Michael Jackson videos began airing on MTV.


5)	 Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust won an American Music Award for Favorite Rock Single and also got a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance.  Clearly the song was categorized as rock by the music industry.  The song was performed by white artists (who generally are known for rock, not funk) but musically, the song was a pretty good example of funk (not rock). 


Another look at possible avenues of discussion: 


How strong is the tendency to focus on skin color and ignore the music when pigeonholing musicians?   We all know that the music industry will allow some black musicians who make rock to be perceived of, and marketed as, rock musicians (e.g. Lenny Kravitz) so skin color doesn’t always trump musical content. 


Did the music industry set trends by their actions, or were they merely passive and responsive to cultural trends that already existed?  For instance, were Americans comfortable with Rapture as a rock song but Billie Jean as an r&amp;b song or did MTV impress these labels upon the culture?

What attracted my attention when I came upon Scaruffi was that he gave a very different perspective to music compared to most music critics, and shed light to some of the more obscure records of the 60's and 70's. On the other hand, he is also rather critical to some generally
[acclaimed](http://i.imgur.com/0X7Hhh8.png) records. I'm still rather critical towards most of his reviews though, as there is an obvious bias towards older 'influential' records. 

Do you think people like Scaruffi have a place in modern music criticism? Are his reviews unbiased truths or pretentious ramblings of an old man? Do you think that other critics in the industry should take note of what he's doing? Your personal opinion of him?",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1g9b3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1g9b3u/lets_talk_piero_scaruffi/,

What do you think? I have to say I still miss the dreamier elements of Cryptograms and Microcastle but Deerhunter seems to have long since moved on. I'm a bigger fan of this abrasiveness than I was most things on Halcyon Digest, but there's not a lot separating this album from most garage rock since its revival in the 90's. Hell, the title track sounds almost like an outtake from Room on Fire until the shift about midway through. Back to the Middle is the standout to me right now, big fan of the little keyboard lines they've been sprinkling through their songs lately.

Also, what's Bradford Cox's deal lately? check out [this interview](http://news.radio.com/2013/04/04/deerhunters-bradford-cox-hates-morrissey-he-makes-me-want-to-wear-fur//) and how pretty much any time Cox was asked a question he'd tie it back to how much Morrissey sucks. Is hating on Morrissey his *monomania*cal obsession? Just weird. Cox has taken on an alter ego ""Connie Lungpin,"" which was on full display for Deerhunter's Fallon performance in early April (can't find a link; worth watching), which is interesting. I always thought Cox was enough of a character already. Is there a resurgence in the cross-dressing rock alter ego thing?

* **8-11:** Moved to new neighborhood and hung out with hoodrats who listened to hip hop/rap. Really into Domino, Warren G, Snoop, Dre, that stuff. On my own I was really liking Nirvana and Sublime, the very first album I remember personally purchasing was Nevermind around 8. When I was 11 for 6th grade air guitar I did Smells Like Teen Spirit. I wanted to do Milk It or Aneurysm but the one kid at the school who would do it with me would only do Smells like Teen Spirit. 

* **12-13:** Started to get into more punk stuff, started with clash, pistols, ramones, nofx, lagwagon, pennywise but never really got into it, wanted something harder and not so whiny/blink 182 sounding so moved on to dead kennedys, Crass, OpIvy and fell in love.

* **14-17:** Super into punk, hardcore, crust, thrash, all 'crazy' music like that. Some favorites in that era were Aus-Rotten, Crass, Rudimentary Peni, Filth, Blatz, Mankind, Submission Hold, Locust, Melt-Banana, Charles Bronson, Dystopia, Nausea, Sex on the beach, Anal Cunt, Plutocracy, DooM, etc.

* **18-20:** Start getting bored with punk and getting more into indie rock, living in socal there was a really good scene going on back then. Stuff I loved were Black Heart Procession, GoGoGo Airheart, Holy Molar, Get Hustle,  Gang Gang Dance, Rapture, Animal Collective.

* **20-23:** Start getting bored with all the music I was listening to and start looking in the past. Fall in LOVE with the Kinks (went about a year straight somewhere in there ONLY listening to the fucking Kinks), Beatles (again), Small Faces, Silver Apples, Os Mutantes, Talking Heads (also went a few months in there listening only to TH and Os mutantes), Hawkwind, Monks, Devo, Troggs, 13th Floor Elevators, Love, The Seeds. Some newer music includes Fiery Furnaces, Silentist, Witch Hunt, 3 mile pilot, Godspeed!, Bad Plus.

* **24 and on:** The things that have stuck is everything from 14 and on as well as Nirvana, Crass, and Op Ivy. Lately though I have been on a HUGE Kinks kick, listening to other things sparingly, their album Percy is so beautiful yet under-rated I think, it has me playing it on repeat these days.

I'll just recap from what I've read from interviews and wikipedia:

When GBV released *Propeller* in 1992, Robert Pollard was a 34-year-old elementary school teacher. It was supposed to be his ""farewell"" album before giving up on the dream forever. Luckily, people started paying attention and instead of staying in his hometown teaching 4th grade, Pollard became one of the greatest songwriters of our time (in my opinion).

This makes the beginning of [Over The Neptune/Mesh Gear Fox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSd-80X-GEo) especially awesome. That's not an actual crowd chanting ""GBV!"", the band did that in the studio. They had never played in front of a big crowd, so this was more of a ""what would it be like"" fantasy scenario. If *Propeller* hadn't gotten big, it would have been touching, but ultimately heartbreaking.

I saw them at Sasquatch last year, and they opened with that song. When the crowd started chanting before they played, that was a great moment. [Here's a video, minus the chanting unfortunately](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4pBc1pIwq0) (fun fact: I'm the one with the greenish shirt on the bottom-right)

It was a great show and their energy is still amazing.

Can you think of any other ""Kid A"" scenarios, in which an internationally famous and acclaimed band released an album marking such a huge change in sound and creative direction? Did these bands continue to make such significant chages with their sound from album to album?

In terms of sales and critical acclaim, were there any albums that could have been ""Kid As"", but maybe luck or timing wasn't on their side or the world just wasn't ready for it?

I've lurked here enough to be led to believe that at good amount of you would endearingly consider yourselves ""music snobs"", so with that as context I would like to hear your thoughts on the concept of ""guilty pleasures"". 

Specifically:

a) Do you reject the entire notion of a ""guilty pleasure"" because all taste in music is inherently subjective?

b) If you do buy into the notion of a guilty pleasure, by what personal metric or criteria do you go about determining whether something you enjoy should be enjoyed ""guiltily""? Is this process the antithesis of your barometer for determining what is ""good""?

c) Is ""guilty"" pleasure simply determined by a contrast between your tastes and what the common critical/popular consensus is about a certain artist?

d) What are some examples of your guilty pleasures? Show me how the way you evaluate music leads you to categorizing certain artists as ""guilty pleasures"".

For me a guilty pleasure is an artist whose music I'm able to enjoy, but whose actions during the creation or reflected in their music lie in stark contrast to my personal morals. For example I always feel a little bad when I listen to [Crystal Castles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR3XB-982Bg) because I learned that much of their early work used direct copy-pasting of a bunch of un-acknowledged chiptune artists. A less obvious example is the song [""Smack My B*tch Up"" by the Prodigy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzxd9d41Hhc) Even though the message of the song isn't a direct endorsement of violence against women the song still liberally employs a word that at least in the context of the western world still holds a lot of misogynistic connotations.

I'm also unsure of where I draw the line when artists act like assholes outside of their medium. For example I consider early [Burzum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXu8M6q6v84&amp;feature=related) to be a pretty big guilty pleasures because *holy shit Varg is such a horrendous human being*, but I have no qualms with listening to Kanye because although he's an asshole he's at least [ultra self-aware](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6CJQ_hnm24) and doesn't fucking kill people.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,1350429688.0,,,True,t3_11lhif,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/11lhif/lets_talk_guilty_pleasures_and_the_concept_of_a/,

* Steven Stills recorded 19 songs after he left Buffalo Springfield in 1968.  The tapes were left at the studio until 1978 when the studio was closing.  A musician named Joe Colasurdo saw Still's name on some boxes and the owner gave the boxes to Colasurdo.

I think that a good soundtrack needs to stand up on its own as a good compilation as well.

What comes to mind immediately is the *Cruel Intentions* soundtrack, which from the title sequence, to the only other Marcy Playground song I can name, to the Counting Crows, to the Verve at the end, fits together not only as a very strong representation of alternative music in the late 90s, but fits the overall, underlying sinister and cynical tone of the film itself. I would say that that is an amazing soundtrack. 

Another soundtrack that does the same is the *Donnie Darko* soundtrack, which is very 80s, and from Echo, to the Church, Joy Division, and ""Mad World"", the tone of that film is aptly represented by the music. 

One soundtrack I do not like is the *Singles* soundtrack. Now, as a compilation, it holds together well as an amazing sampling of 90s music, but doesn't really fit the plot of the film, which itself feels like a very contrived movie. I don't like the *I Am Sam* soundtrack either, because it seems like a forced gimmick to have a bunch of Beatles covers to compliment such a contrived, over-emotional garbage bag, and the covers (for the most part) blow ass.

In this circle of friends, I have always been the music fanatic. I consume music at a more alarming rate than my other two friends, and the scope of what I listen to is also much more dramatic than theirs.

At one point in the conversation I insinuated that taste can be good and bad. In the sense that your tastes can be developed or undeveloped, they are much like a muscle that can be small or big. Personally I do not enjoy modern RnB, that is an opinion, but I know my taste in modern RnB is very undeveloped. 

This angered my friends as they assumed I was telling them that their tastes were 'wrong.' When I really meant that maybe their taste in (insert genre) was not as developed as their taste in (insert different genre). And that taste and opinion do not necessarily have to co-relate. I can have an undeveloped taste in classical but still just think Brahms is a smelly fart.

This led them to state that their opinion has a right to exist no matter what, and in any way they could state one opinion is as valuable as another. Now at face value I agree whole-heartily, to tell another person their opinion is less valuable than someone else's seems awful and wrong, but there is something deep down inside of me that thinks that if your opinion is uninformed then it really has no right to exist or stand equally to others.

Maybe I am just a condescending prick. I am not sure if this is even the right sort of debate topic for this sub-reddit.

Is it really exempt from that critique? Why? 

We critique film all the time. Many people criticize, for instance, the Transformers movies for being shallow and a blatant mess of CGI. Are pop songs more resistant because of the nature of music itself? Or should we be more open to critiques of music, even music we enjoy?

Doesn't it seem a bit cheap to simply wave away one's gripe with the music by claiming that as long as people enjoy it, it's fine?

1347691675.0,32,self.LetsTalkMusic,zx1hb,Why release an album instead of a single or EP?  What does each of the three release types do well?  Where do they fail?,Bears_in_Bowlers,37,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/zx1hb/why_release_an_album_instead_of_a_single_or_ep/,"I recently came across a conversation in my Twitter feed between the artists Madeon and Sebastian Ingrosso.  Madeon tweeted that he was excited about his new single and was getting ready to work on a full length album to which Sebastian Ingrosso replied, “Don't say album.  It makes me nervous.”  Madeon replied with, “There are some ideas you can only get across in an album.”  This got me thinking.  What is the point of releasing an album?  What are the ideas that you can only express in an album and what are the pros and cons of each type of release?

I think that an album is good to get across these big ideas but I'm not exactly sure what the big ideas might be.  Two great albums immediately come to mind.  The Mars Volta's “De-Loused in the Comatorium” and Pink Floyd's “Dark Side of the Moon.”  Each album has individual songs that I enjoy listening to but listening to the album as a whole offers a much better experience.  I think the album is great when it really nails that holistic experience.  At-the-Drive-In's “Relationship of Command” is an album that I really like but I don't feel it offers the holistic experience of the previously mentioned albums.  Relationship of Command centers around a common sound but I don't feel it offers one overarching theme throughout.  Most times when I listen to it I only listen to my favorite songs.  The question I have with these types of albums is not, why would an artist release an album like this, but why do they feel like they need to release an album as opposed to an EP or a series of singles?  When I think of the album that Madeon is most likely going to put out I feel like it is going to be 10 or so songs with no holistic experience put out under the album moniker.  

Why do artists feel they need to put out an album ever if it won't deliver an enclosed experience?  I think for rock musicians it comes down to how the music is preformed.  Rock musicians primarily preform only their own music.  Performing an albums worth of material while constantly incorporating singles might get stale after a while and the excitement for the tour would dwindle.  I also think that an album is easier to market.  This includes the tour that comes with it.  I already know that the new Deadmau5 album is coming out some time in October and the hype for the album is growing with the labels marketing strategy, which will hopefully result in mega sales for the artist and label.  I don't think you can build the same hype for a single.  If I found out that Deadmau5' new single was coming out in a few months I'd wonder why it hadn't been released already.  I think it's easier to anticipate a release with more material.  It's something worth waiting and building expectations for.

I think that albums move creative progress more slowly than singles or EP's, but I think that an album can have a bigger impact on what's cool or popular than one single can.  I say creative progress moves slower because there usually is a large turnaround time until an artist releases another album.  If you're trying to chase what's cool or cutting edge (I don't mean this with any negative connotations) the large lag time might mean that the cutting edge sound you were going for in your release has past by the time your album comes out.  This is why I think bands generally try to do their own thing.  I think the Mumford and Sons album is a good example.  Sigh No More had a huge impact on the musical landscape.  Even though other artists were making folky sounds, that album seemed to make the entire genre instantly cool.  I think bands get pigeon holed in this way.  Each album has a big impact, if not on the popular scene then with the hardcore fans.  I can't imagine Mumford and Sons doing anything else outside of folk inspired music.  If they change their sound fans will be in an uproar.  If they don't they'll become irrelevant when the next big thing comes along.  This goes for less popular genres too.  If you change your sound fans hate you, if you don't a cool new offshoot of that genre will spring up and you'll be irrelevant.

I think EP's are a great way to bring a change in sound to fans.  I think the Arctic Monkeys do this very well.  After each album they release an EP or two with a slightly different sound that generally reflects what will come on their next album.  I also think EP's can be marketed with a hybrid album or single strategy.

I think singles are a great way to stay on the cutting edge.  You can try out new ideas with little risk.  If you release one single and it's not very good you can move on very quickly with your next.  Fans will also be open when you try new genres or incorporate different sounds for the same reason.  If the fans don't like a new single the next one will be along quickly.  This also makes the music to progress very quickly.  No one single changes the landscape of a genre but a genre feeding off each other will move forward in little increments very quickly.  You are always exploring what is popular in your genre and cross pollinating sounds while still having the opportunity to take artistic risks and challenge yourself.

Dance music lends itself well to single and EP releases due to the way it's played.  The focus is on a continuous ever changing mix of different artists music.  I feel it's the DJ's job to find new, exiting music to incorporate into their sets (this is changing however with artists like Deadmau5 and Avicii playing pretty much their own music and remixes of their music).  A traditional DJ isn't going to want to play an entire Madeon album straight through so why is Madeon going to release an album instead of a series of EP's and singles (because he'll play primarily his own musis)?  I feel that this is one of the failings of the single.  The idea that it presents needs to be self contained because it is going to be presented in a song by song basis.

Where the marketing strategy of big albums fail for singles, I think it can excel in the internet/social media age.  You don't need to spend a lot of money on releasing the new Madeon single.  Maybe just one push to kick it off from the label then it's going to get radio play.  I can see that Madeon tweeted a link to his Sound Cloud for the new single.  He has how many thousands of followers who are going to retweet it to their followers.  I can share the link on Facebook.  When I'm hungry for new music I check out the music blogs and they're talking about Madeon and have a review of his new single.

I am a big fan, he has put out a lot of good music between Spencer Davis Group, Blind Faith, Traffic, and solo. But that's the thing, it's been a lot of simply *good* music. This guy seemed to have all the talent in the world, skilled at all instruments, a good voice, part of big name acts and produced hits. Yet when Dave Mason (Traffic) and Eric Clapton (Blind Faith) weren't around, his music was consistently lacking what it takes to be unique, special, or legendary. I always feel like Winwood could have become a true legend like Clapton, but managed to fall short somewhere along the way.

Music critic Robert Christgau always seemed to pour on the hate for Winwood. Sometimes I feel like he might have a point when he states ""What can you expect of a man who could have sung like Ray Charles and chose instead to follow in the voiceprints of Jack Bruce?""

Reading music news sometimes provides funny insights in how a specific music journalist feels about certain bands (see Tiny Mix Tapes) and reading album reviews can provide very interesting viewpoints of the artist/album in question. However, sometimes it's cool to read something a bit... less restricted, I guess? Columns, editorials, articles pondering a certain genre's upbringing. In-depth, analytical, satirical, humorous, whatever you think is nice. Things like that. Do you have any sites/writers/articles you like specifically and why?

A few examples of what I mean:

----
[**Maximal Nation**](http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/)

*Electronic music's evolution towards the thrilling excess of digital maximalism (by Simon Reynolds)*

-----

A curious look at the emergence of more ""maximal"" (as opposed to the minimal trend) artists in electronic music. I liked the thoughts about how it could be at part attributed to the ""internet culture"", with information flow coming from every direction and so on. Samples from all around the places from YouTube to old vinyl records, sounds from all over the place (due to the massive selection of virtual synths etc) and maybe even a change in mindset in the current generation. Interesting stuff!

-----
[**Vaporwave and the Pop-Art of the Virtual Plaza**](http://dummymag.com/features/2012/07/12/adam-harper-vaporwave/)

*(by Adam Harper)*

-----
You know vaporwave? The genre with the pitched-down Diana Ross samples and slowed-down loops of 80's AOR ballads? As far as I gather this was the article that kind of started it. A bit pretentious and a whole lot more ""in-depth"" than what I think the artists originally intended, but it  conjures cool ideas of what ""vaporwave"" could represent. Besides, the conversation of ""microgenres"" that has stemmed from the vaporwave moniker is intriguing too - do we really need that many genres? Are they beneficial and if not, is there any harm in having so many?

------
[**Pitchfork Gives Music 6.8**](http://www.theonion.com/articles/pitchfork-gives-music-68,2278/)

*(by The Onion)*

-----
This is a bit of a tongue-in-cheek example. Pitchfork gets a lot of flack for various reasons and even though I think it is one of the most informative / enjoyable music websites there is, sometimes funny satire is funny satire and The Onion is certainly in the top tier in this category.

----
[**The Digital Music Industry is Inept**](http://www.bennjordan.com/blog/?p=499)

*(by Benn Jordan)*

-----


In this blog post, Benn Jordan (better known as The Flashbulb) laments on the absurdities of the copyright system. How he gets DMCA takedown notices on his own music, yet a blatant distribution of a song of his (by a different person) goes almost unnoticed in the digital music marketplaces, eg. iTunes and such. An interesting look at the system from a viewpoint that's not the typical music journalist's.

I'm a bit scarce on these examples, so I hope you'd have something to contribute too! The articles don't have to be *very* long (even though some of the examples I gave are kinda long!), but hopefully they're longer than news articles anyways.

On his album ""Lonely Avenue"", he wasn't responsible for a single word. Instead, British author Nick Hornby (fantastic novelist, btw) wrote each lyric and emailed what was essentially a poem to Ben. He put the music to the words and its one of my absolute favorite albums to date. [Levi Johnston's Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZbUOCqdSu) sounds like it was written as a single expression, but it was two different people with minimal contact.

It's something that's hard to define, measure, or agree on in music, yet in my opinion, it's one of the most important factors in making an artist's sound memorable or immersive.

Whether it's the effects or production that the music goes through, the instrumentation, lyrics, or raw emotion audible in the songs, atmosphere comes in many shapes and flavours. 

*My questions to you:*

* How much do you value atmosphere in the music that you listen to?

* How do you judge whether an artist/album *has* atmosphere?

* What are your favourite albums/artists in terms of atmosphere?

Most of the reviews and discussion of these albums mentions that they were unheard at the time and then later grew to acclaim often decades later, but what I'm wondering is exactly how and when these bands became acclaimed? Was it simply word of mouth? For example I know David Bowie was a fan of the Velvet Underground, but was him namedropping them in interviews enough to propel them into the fame that they have today?

If you could list specific decades or even years that would be awesome, and it'd be nice to know about some of the specific bands as well as underground music as a whole, but any information is welcome.

Why did these songs have that impact on you?  Note, these songs may not necessarily be your favorite song(anymore), but they made you realize that there's still music out there that will surprise you.


First, [**""Lucky"" by Supercar**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFLuZubqizI)
*note: cheesy intro*

This is the first song that came to my mind when I asked myself this question, they're a great shoegaze band from Japan. It's the first song that introduced me to shoegaze back in high school. 

When I first heard this song, I'm pretty sure that my eyes quite literally widened, my mouth opened, and I was thinking, ""this is perfect."" I can't exactly place the reason for my reaction, it was my first time having such a positive/emotional reaction to such a...non-emotional song/performance? Saying that is incorrect, I know, but I'm not sure how to word it. However, I believe that's the goal in shoegaze. But to be completely honest, I don't get near the same feeling anymore from it. I still really enjoy it, but it probably wouldn't make into a top ten. If I go a long enough time without listening to it, and come back to it, like I did today, it comes close. The first listen though, that was a feeling of awe.


Second, [**""E"" by Spangle Call Lilli Line**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e6C8gEUzQ4)

This is from a similar Japanese shoegaze band called Spangle Call Lilli Line. I never expected to get the same feeling as I did from Lucky, from another song within the same genre. That's also part of the reason why I find I like it more than Lucky. The ""this is perfect"" feeling hit me at the 2:00 minute mark and onward. The song, like Lucky, gives me my moment of zen, I guess. The difference is, I can always come back to this, and...it just does it for me. Like for a lot of people, nostalgia is a moderately weighty emotion, and this song gives me a good dose of it while also allowing me to look out the window and just enjoy the moment. Like, ""the past was great, but take a look around and realize that the present has just as much to offer"". The sad thing, I have no idea what the song is actually about. That's not important to me though, as much as that may make a forehead vein bulge for some of you. ha

I could easily post more and branch into other genres, but let's keep it at two. Besides, I'm tired of typing.

I guess I'll answer it before it's asked. If not obvious by my previous statement, I don't know Japanese at all, and I find that I enjoy songs more if I don't understand the language. It's something I realized not too long ago. I used to ask people, ""how the hell do you remember entire songs?"" Then the, ""duh"" moment...they actually listen to the lyrics. I don't know, I don't listen to them, and I rarely find myself caring to. Of course, all the time, I'll get catchy choruses stuck in my head and sing them all day. But more often than not, I hear the vocals as just another instrument. There is one exception, ""Swing Life Away"" from Rise Against, I can probably recite 95% of that song because it's the song I used to learn, miserably, how to play the guitar.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1dny3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1dny3e/what_songs_have_given_you_the_this_is_the_sound_i/,

So below are a variety of metal albums from /r/metal 's bestof 2012 list for you to peruse and listen to. There is a diverse group of bands who are doing exciting things in the genre. 

I only chose albums from 2012 because metal has such a broad history and background that I would end up killing myself trying to find just a handful of examples to represent the incredibly diverse scenes throughout time. Hopefully this list is broad enough to catch all interests and gives a good look into metal at the moment. 


[Carach Angren - Where the Corpses Sink Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uGGuiN1Hnw) Incredibly theatric and shockingly accessible, this symphonic black metal band tones down the ""throw as much orchestration as possible"" motif of many of their peers and replaces it with well structured songs, a fascinating story line (from a vocalist anyone can understand even during screams) and truly inventive and engaging lyrics about WWII  

[Pseudogod - Deathwomb Catechesis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su0buCsrE9A) If death metal is meant to be scary, this band succeeds with flying colors. A very natural sounding amalgamation of death and black, Pseudogod made an album that feels at home in almost any extreme metal fan's library. *This is a tough record for non-metal fans so be warned.*

[Beyond Terror Beyond Grace - Nadir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_EX9Qb1MxA) Part of the emerging Atmospheric Death Metal scene, with lots of tremolo picking and a fucked up mix between black/death and grindcore vocals. a must listen for those looking for interesting and diverse vocals with  emotional and powerful riffs. 

[Black Breath - Sentenced to Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_HRhZOQ9WI) D-Beat's resurgence in the metal world can be traced, in part, to the popularity of Nails but no one makes it quite as enjoyable as Black Breath. A blast from start to finish, Black Breath is able to make FUN metal records without coming across as cheesy or light

[High on Fire - De Vermis Mysteriis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6-A0t3sghc) Matt Pike, former member of doom legends Sleep has finally released a record that can compete with his old band's catalog. This record is strong, heavy and completely no frills. This is sludge at it's most distilled form and will take an axe to your head if you aren't careful. 

[Panopticon - Kentucky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAUtCa13V38) Bluegrass mixed with black metal. I wrote another post in this sub and I'll link to it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10toax/lets_talk_about_landmark_groundbreaking_or/c6gj1ot). I think this is the best album of the year, but that's just my opinion.

[Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJfHuyGpsI) Grandiose without sacrificing song structure (or length), Pallbearer is fast becoming one of the most respected name in Doom. *Clean Vocals and Very Accessible*

[Dodecahedron - Dodechedron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9GtKDhKz3Q) Dangerous and frightening in their sound, Dodecahedron brings an almost Converge like energy to their unique brand of black metal. *A difficult listen for non-metal heads but incredibly rewarding. *

[Jumalation - The March of Jumalation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ueNPpngrvY) Baby this is some straight up thrash metal. None of that new-wave-thrash-revival stuff here. If you told me this came out in 1986 I wouldn't question it for a second. A blast of a record and great example of the genre.  

[Pig Destroyer - Book Burner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6liRVCaonME) What more can be said about these Baltimore heavy weights. Simultaneously making some of the most frightening and impressive music of the genre, Pig Destroyer's ability to craft excellent songs with memorable riffs will not only help people get into the genre of extreme metal and punk but remain a favorite band for years to come. 

[Midnight - Complete and Total Fucking Midnight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5-O5K1QGcM&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLA06E6ADBE101B609) The ultimate 80's speed throwback, Midnight is one of the rare bands that not only makes a great throwback band, but outclasses the bands it worships. A must listen if you like your metal sleazy, cheezy and lucifery.

Obviously, exceptions exist, but creating quality new music seems to get harder as artists age.

I have a lot of these, but Scott Weiland's *12 bar blues* is a good one because it wasn't just dismissed by critics, it also didn't sell very well and has completely fallen into the margins of history at this point. especially given that you occasionally have to remind people [who Scott Weiland is.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht672-wYelc) *spin* and *rolling stone* hated it (I think David Fricke called it confused and indulgent), and stone temple pilots fans rejected it on principle for not sounding like STP. but the record remains outrageously interesting even just for being a weird hybrid of grungy glam, lounge, and extremely aggressive electronics a la layers of heavily distorted theremin. these production decisions are really what keeps the album together, constantly jumping between being so prominent as to virtually throttle the rest of the music and being barely audible. and, as if that wasn't enough, this all happens on top a revolving door of songs that sound kinda like tom waits teamed up with slade to cover *hunky dory.* there's also this guy named [Victor Indrizzo](http://www.victorindrizzo.com/) who has credits all over the record; I have a suspicion that he had a lot to do with the adventures in sound contained thereon, particularly because Scott's second solo album sounds [nothing like this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrXyzGvpuxA)

",,41,11,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/129lm5/what_is_punk_for_you/,"&gt;Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels.

So what are your thoughts on this? Is ""punk"" more of a mindset than music? Can you be part of a punk subculture without listening to the music? Does punk mean rejecting the mainstream, and if so, what does it mean to you? Do you believe punk is dead? If so, do you believe in a revival, or is it strictly rooted in a defined era? 

For me, punk music doesn't equal a rebellious teen who is violent and who rejects society. If you sport a mohawk, a leather jacket and scream ""fuck the system"" every now and then because you think that's what punks do, then you're doing the complete opposite of what ""punk"" is. Because by doing that, you're trying to fit in a social circle, whereas punk isn't a social circle, it's doing whatever the hell you want.

For me, punk is a mindset, it embraces a DIY persona and you do whatever you want, no matter how well you play. In my opinion, punk isn't dead and it never will die. Saying punk is dead is like saying being a teenager is dead. The ethics change over time, but the overall mindset never shifts.

My favorite album of all time is Converge - Jane Doe, a hardcore punk album which puts out aggression up to eleven, along with non-stop screaming vocals; I enjoy it due to the way it presents itself as an emotional burst of rage, accompanied by (what I find) as enjoyable music. I am a fan of unconventional genres like noise rock, no wave, grindcore, industrial, and drone. So really, I should find the sound and presentation of noise music bearable. 

However, the concept of [noise as music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music) is just incomprehensible to me. It doesn't follow any concept of rhythm or any musical pattern. Artistically, there's very little value too; if it represents anything, it's going over my head, because all I can see is people just producing talentless waves and waves of noise. Great experimental musicians, for instance, create atmosphere, emotions, journeys, concepts with their sound instead of going for musical pleasantness. Industrial music, which has a strong relation with noise music, is a great music genre because it actually succeeds in the way its art is presented; Throbbing Gristle's ""[Slug Bait, Live In London ICA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl0mnmZzY9s)"" isn't going to be popular on my iPod play count, but it's a chilling, disturbing piece of work that's genius in my opinion. Same with Suicide's infamous ""[Frankie Teardrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5wJQkvSoOQ)"". With noise, however? I've read by many fans and musicians that noise represents disorder and chaos, but that just sounds like a flimsy excuse for what seems to be a lack of talent. 

The most popular noise musicians include Japanese artists like [Merzbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_aiuMIC1Hg) and [Masonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH5EAUCzHfA), and then more experimential noise musicians like [Whitehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGNKgah948s), [Kevin Drumm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmmTem43WI), etc. I try going through them but yet I can't see any point in this kind of music. Is there any explanations into why there's such an active noise music community and fanbase? What am I supposed to ""get"", and how do people see this type of music?

-----

for the longest time, I thought that ""pay what you want, $0 minimum"" was the *best* way to price albums online.

download and listen before you buy, and then spend however much money you felt was right once you decided that the album in question deserved money. only have 1 dollar but still want to support the artist? go for it!

that was also the weakness of higher-priced albums. ""I like this album enough to spend $4 but the minimum price is $10"" ...and so, the artist gets $0.

-----

and then I opened my own shop. (bandcamp. shop. same thing, ish.)

I entertained the idea of making it a sort of dollar shop: with each album being pay what you want, $1 minimum. but in the end, I decided ""screw it, MAKE EVERYTHING $0 MINIMUM""

and hey, I found people that liked my music enough to toss a dollar my way sometimes! everything's great!! ...right?

well here's the drawback: more people download for $0 than $any. (duh) But bandcamp limits the number of free downloads you can have per month. (oh shit)

I have run out of free download credits many a time, even with ""click here to download from an external server for free"" links. 

that didn't affect my train of thought on album pricing.

-----

but then I read this: [bandcamp's blog entry about fan collections](http://blog.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/)

the important (tl;dr) part: **if you're willing to spend money on something just to show it off, you probably like it**

I don't think I've ever agreed so hard to something so quickly. 

this also couples with something I've been aware of for quite some time: you'll feel better/more confident about your choice of a product (or album or whatever) *after* you purchase it, because you purchased it (vs whatever other options you had)

-----

so, suddenly, adding a minimum price to my albums seems like a good idea, but *what should it be*?

that was a lot of text to post so feel free to attack a specific section.

-----

also here's my system right now, for the record:

* album goes out with pay what you want, minimum price of $0
* add free download link to save download credits
* one week later, or so, set price to $1 to $5 depending on the number of songs, quality of album, etc
* replace free download link with link to google / the pirate bay / whatever

(though only one of my albums is on a public tracker last I checked, lol whoops)

I think it works nicely, since it's free for those who want it, rewards anyone who follows my work, and is still fairly inexpensive for anyone who finds my albums after they're no longer free.

Moreover, we as listeners actively brand ourselves by the music we listen to as we filter through this baggage and define our own tastes.

It is no surprise then that some music often gets a bad rap despite its associations. I'd like to hear from others about a stigma - either real or perceived - surrounding a band/album/genre, and why they respect or admire said band/album/genre in spite of the stigma. I'll start:

Randy Newman - Despite a prolific and fruitful career as a brilliant songwriter capable of chillingly beautiful songwriting, a masterful and idiosyncratic style of playing and orchestrating, and trenchant social commentary through song, Randy Newman will always be known as the deaf sounding guy who wrote the Toy Story song. Regardless of this stigma, I consider him to be one of our best American songwriters.

Bluegrass - despite its dangerous proximity to what passes for 'country' music in today's public consciousness, and in spite of being widely known as twangy novelty 'hillbilly music,' bluegrass can be a springboard for unparalleled talent and carefully channelled virtuosity, as well as an apt emotional pallet for golden songs both dark and euphoric. Some of my favorite bands and musicians wouldn't exist if not for their being steeped in the tradition of bluegrass, old-time country, and American roots music. Yeehaw.

The Grateful Dead - I really hate jam bands, but the progenitor of all jam-bands - the Grateful Dead - had (and has) something to offer musically if you can cut through the wasteland of endless noodling that defined their live shows (and thus their legacy). I hold American Beauty in very high regard and, despite the headier-than-though clan of modern hippie nonsense that the jam band scene has breeded, there will always be a spot in my heart for the kind of band that the Dead originally aimed to be.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,1344406593.0,,,True,t3_xv9nw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/xv9nw/lets_talk_about_stigmatized_music_with_redemptive/,

1342201394.0,27,self.LetsTalkMusic,wic2j,Let's talk metal.,CaesarOrgasmus,33,6,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/wic2j/lets_talk_metal/,"It doesn't look like metal's really been covered here before, so I'll go for a general discussion rather than address any one topic. What do you guys think of it? Sorry in advance for the slightly rambling stream of consciousness.

It's probably one of the least accessible of all genres and the ultimate in acquired tastes. I've been listening to it for about six or seven years now and only started getting into some of the (relatively) heavier forms within the last six months or so. That's not to say that more accessible metal doesn't exist, though. [Here's a playlist](http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/Metal/75266632) of some of the stuff that helped me start to get into metal before I could stand anything too heavy.

It seems like the vocals are one of the biggest turnoffs for those who don't like metal. Most of the time the topic comes up, whoever I'm talking to says something like, ""I don't like all the screaming."" I would address this in a few ways:

As you can tell from the above playlist, screaming/harsh vocals are not ubiquitous in metal. There are plenty of bands that almost exclusively utilize clean vocals, and many with fairly gifted vocalists, the most highly regarded of whom tend to be Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, and Ronnie James Dio of Dio and Black Sabbath. I thought [this article](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2010/07/ask-a-real-musician-5-classic-male-metal-singers/), about an opera vocalist hearing some metal singers for the first time, was an interesting perspective on some classic metal vocalists. Basically what I'm saying is that many people don't realize how much metal isn't all about yelling, and it's worth looking into those bands.

Of course, there are plenty of bands that do utilize harsh vocals, or at least angrier ones. These kinds of vocals first became prominent in thrash, which includes bands like Metallica and Slayer and was one of the earliest types of metal that I would say was truly heavy and angry. They spread and developed from there, and are now the staple of the heavier subgenres like black and death metal. I think the reason many people are turned off by these vocals is that they're used to vocal-centric music in which the vocals are the focal point and the instrumentals are secondary, or at least less prominent. This is reversed to a point in metal; rather than carry the music, the vocals serve more as another instrument or layer of the music. They're meant to contribute to the overall aesthetic, not take it over. I can't speak for all metalheads, but I think many would agree that the tone of the vocals is more important than the lyrics or any other aspect of them. So with that in mind, it makes perfect sense that metal vocals are harsher than any other genre's. That's how they best fit into the music. The clean, catchy vocals many people prefer wouldn't work for the overwhelming majority of metal.

Of course, that's just a different way of looking at the music, not the secret to liking it. I wouldn't expect to change anyone's opinion just like that, especially knowing how long it took me to start to appreciate it. Ultimately, metal is still angry, inaccessible and esoteric, all of which would make for kind of a niche genre. However, I appreciate the role that metal fills in music; along with certain types of punk, it's one of the few types of music willing to address the darker parts of people and, on a larger scale, society. There's a lot of social commentary and exposition, and many metal bands revel in topics that few other genres would even touch, e.g. Slayer's numerous songs about serial killers or WWII, or Exodus's Nanking, about the Rape of Nanking in 1937, which I appreciate as someone interested in history.

There's also a lot to be said for the level of musicianship in metal. Many bands are impressively proficcient musicians, like [Megadeth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXpjtWZn_vU) and [In Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrdGYVir6DU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=137s). While technicality doesn't necessarily translate to good music, in metal's case, I think it contributes a lot.

But ultimately what it boils down to is a bunch of sounds that I like and that a lot of people don't. Nothing I've talked about made me like metal, they're just things I learned to appreciate about it.

1375510052.0,28,self.LetsTalkMusic,1jm4gw,Lets dissect some genres,Snowblinded,37,9,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1jm4gw/lets_dissect_some_genres/,"So I was rewatching [The Universal Mind of Bill Evans](http://www.openculture.com/2012/04/the_universal_mind_of_bill_evans_advice_on_learning_to_play_jazz.html), and I was struck by something he said regarding the genre of jazz:
&gt;Jazz as we tend to look at it is a style, but I feel that jazz is not so much a style as a process of making music. It’s the process of making one minute’s music in one minute’s time, whereas when you compose, you can make one minute’s music and take three months to compose one minute’s music. 

&gt;It so happens that because of historical circumstances, we think of jazz as a stylistic medium now, which in a way it is, but we must remember in an absolute sense, jazz is more of a certain creative process of spontaneity than a style. Therefore, you might say that Chopin or Bach or Mozart or whoever that improvised music, that was able to make music of the moment, was in a sense playing jazz.

To take what he says and re-interpret it slightly. what we call Jazz music is really multiple things. It is:

1) A combination of certain instruments, such as saxophones and pianos, and the associated timbres, pitch ranges, and physical characteristics of said instruments.

2) A set of techniques and approaches that are employed by musicians in a similar way. This can mean:

-A) In the broadest sense, we can apply this to the idea that ""jazz is more of a certain creative process of spontaneity than a style"" that Bill discusses in the quote. Jazz music as a genre can be defined by the improvisation that forms the core of the music. The improvisational core is, according to Bill, the essential thing that separates Jazz as a genre from other forms of music.

-B) Jazz music, while certainly improvisational, also has a number of other technical elements that separate it from other forms of improvisation. The heavy emphasis on melodically complex chords, in particular 7th chords. The various structures, such as the theme, improvisation, theme pattern used in bebop and its children, or the patterns that give modal jazz its name, or even the difficult to describe but very real structures that guide free jazz. The way a single lead musician will function as either the sole melodic entity, or as the dominant contributor to the melody, The way that the improvisation uses the melody of its theme as a foundation. All of these things and many others, when combined, give the music it's jazz sound.

When a person refers to jazz music, they can be referring to any of these definitions, or a combination of them. Most people who listen to a lot of jazz will use definition 2 as their benchmark for what is and isn't jazz. People who define jazz using definition 1 are usually regarded as less knowledgeable (like people who go on /r/jazz and post about some indie groups new ""jazz album"" due to its occasional use of a saxophone). People who define jazz using all of the definitions are what we would typically call purists. They are the ones who dismiss anything that either uses non-traditional instruments or new and innovative techniques as ""not real jazz"".

This got me thinking. When we refer to particular genres of music, we are often unconsciously referring to a broad palette of different things. At one point or another, without realizing it, most of us have called up a pastiche of half baked notion that we cannot consciously identify when we think about a certain genres of music.  When I think about music in genres I have a strong understanding of, I have the ability to examine the music in terms of how it conforms and deviates from the different components of said genre. This allows me to better understand the individual groups/musicians, better understand the genre itself, and it allows me to create, hold, and defend my own viewpoints of the genre and its musicians. However, when I listen to genres I am less familiar with, these kinds of analysis are off limits to me. I decided it would be beneficial for both myselfs and all of you if we were to pool our resources and analyze different genres in this manner. To kick things off, I will throw in an analysis of another genre that I have a detailed understanding of: metal.

1) A combination of instruments assembled in a particular manner. The guitar, bass, drums, and vocals are the primary componants. Other instruments, such as keyboards, folk instruments, or industrial samples are employed less frequently, and are often what separates different sub genres of metal (folk metal is metal that incorporates the traditional folk instruments of a particular country, normally Scandinavian). These instruments also need to be assembled in certain ways for the music to be considered metal. The guitars need a lot of distortion. The vocals can be done in a number of ways, but there are certain vocal styles that are particularly associated with metal, high pitched falsettos and the death growl and it's relatives.

2) A set of lyrical themes. There are a variety of these themes, but the one thing they have in common is a dark quality. Black Sabbath took the optimism and idealism of the hippy movement and inverted it. Instead of singing about the joy of peace, they sang about the horror of war. Instead of singing about people coming together, they howled warnings of the consequences of staying apart. This darkened tone spread to a number of different themes: satan and the occult, murder and violence, Norse mythology, anti-Christianity, political horror, and much more. Christian Metal is an example of a genre defined by its lyrics.

3) A combination of musical techniques. For guitar, there is tremolo picking, power chords, high speed and slow speed, solos (often technically demanding), palm muting, gallops, breakdowns, an emphasis on riffs, and rapid changes in the riff are what I can pull off the top of my head. For drums, there is either an fast, aggressive style of playing, often using two kick drums playing a rapid, fast, and constant pattern called a blast beat, or there is a sombre, trudging style. Both styles use large, powerful drums in a very propulsive manner. Most metal genres are defined, at least in part, using this definition. Doom Metal uses slow guitar riffs, often power chords and standard scale based patterns with notes held for extended periods, funereal drumming, and it is one of the few metal genres that not only uses singing, but also has bands employing a wide variety of different singing styles. Black Metal and Death Metal are both defined by the high speed, tremolo picking, growled vocals, and rapid drumming, among other things. They differ in that Death Metal uses a more melody oriented sound, while Black Metal is more atmospheric. For example, both genres employ tremolo picking. With black metal it is employed in a steady, unvarying manner, staying at the same speed and number of notes per bar throughout the riff. The changes between the tremolo picked notes are usually done either every bar or halfway through the bar. Death Metal riffs on the other hand, are designed to be listened to as a melody rather than as a source of atmosphere. This means that when tremolo picking is employed, it is either only used for part of a riff, or it is used for a riff that changes notes in a more complex way than once or twice evenly along a bar.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1jm4gw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1jm4gw/lets_dissect_some_genres/,

I've been kinda bummed out that the ""new album"" and ""album with &lt;10k listeners"" weeks have been unpopular.  The problem is that most people are just discussing the albums they already know instead of listening to new stuff.  So I'm gonna try some new things before giving up and switching to new categories:

1) Listen to new albums!  Listen to the week's album all week write up your thoughts at the end of the week!  Don't just stick the album's you've already heard!

2)to encourage listening to new stuff, **every nomination must include a sample and a description**.  This way people can hear what they are voting for and wanna go listen to it.

____________________

**How it works:**
You nominate an album or albums in however many categories you want, and meanwhile scroll through the thread and vote on others.

**Rules:**

One album nomination per post.  You can nominate as many albums as you want in as many categories as you want, but only with one album per comment.

Before nominating anything: look at the other nominations and listen to their samples.  Every month at least one person nominates an album that is already in that exact thread.  I don't want that shit goin down this time, cause you should check out what other people are nominating!  Also, search the subreddit for the name of the album to make sure there hasn't been a thread about it before.

The other side is trying to convince people that it doesn't matter if people pirate music, usually based on arguments that claim this is a justified rebellion against labels, or trying to discuss the meaning of 'stealing' in the digital realm. I'm convinced that although those points have some merit, it's usually just after-the-fact rationalization for a basic hedonistic desire to listen to lots of music, without any real care for the larger implications.

The pay versus pirate thing is a failed paradigm. Neither side is going to last, in their current forms, I think. Habits are changing, and things change based on the people's desires, not some sort of static music consumption morality. CDs and vinyl are niches for nostalgic/materialist collectors. Storing files on your hard drive/s will end up being costly if you digitally 'keep' or 'own' a lot of music, and in that scenario it's a real inconvenience knowing you could listen to almost everything online, with your own library in the cloud. With people listening to a larger amount and variety of music, thanks to the internet, it's far from appealing to think that every album we come across must be paid for.

Many people are deciding they don't want to pay anymore. This is okay. And frankly, if you see music as art, expression, spiritual, and so on - then why are we making it something that must be bought? You don't see people on deviantART complaining that they're not rich, or people on Flickr whining that everyone can see all their photos for free. YouTube is full of people who put out content for free, and, if anything, might get some cash from non-disruptive ad revenue. Webcomics exist for the pure joy of the it. Donations and merchandise are optional. 

Maybe it's a different story with big-budget movies and games that are more openly commercial, but for music, something we attach a great aura of purity and personal intimacy to, well, I find some dissonance regarding the idea of -selling- your -art-.

I make music and I plan on giving it all for free. But I certainly won't stop anyone from donating if they would like to.

A counter-argument could be that, hey, for a band that is blatantly commercial and exists only for entertainment value, and outright defines their music as a product, would it be wrong to pirate it? Perhaps, in a sense. It would certainly be impolite, but this isn't the guy growing fruits and vegetables for the villagers. It really doesn't matter. Most people don't listen to music that exists outside of 'the industry', and I believe we have been conned into defending it. 

You are hindering a person, or group of people, who are trying to make a living, and possibly become wealthy and/or famous, by appealing to your capacity for spiritual expression, entertaining sounds, and imagery, and then seducing you into a transaction, so that they may live merrily, pursuing their favorite activity and having the time of their life, while you toil away in college and get into debt for the sake of a restricting 9-5 job in a questionable economy.

Think about that. Professional musicians use people.

I would personally love to 'escape', and I hope I impress enough people that they will donate to me, or that I could get ad revenue via YouTube, or something, but I am not selling a product, I am not selling an essential service. What I create also exists for its own sake and does not need the support of purchases in order to exist. I have no right to make money off of music, and those who claim they do are exaggerating their own importance. But, feel free to donate to us if you like. What it is is a voluntary gesture of respect.""

-------------------------------------------------

For some background - I'm a 19-year-old musician working/procrastinating on a debut album. The past year I've been getting my head deep into the indie world, and the 'recognized music world' at large, which IMO unfortunately seems to mean the same thing as 'the music industry'. While thinking of how to present my music to people on a large scale, and anticipating a scenario in which that happened, I'm trying to think of what I want, and what I value.

I personally hope to challenge the idea that one must be on one side or the other of this piracy argument. I want to challenge the idea that music is a product to be paid for. I want to challenge the idea that what we know as music largely consists of manufactured celebrities approved by the label-obsessed press, and that if you send one song and a mysterious photo to some blogs, a whole bunch of labels may offer you a career, and that this is how you communicate with the world at large.

I could go on. But I'd like to think that the music aspect of our world would be a bit healthier if we reconsidered the way we 'get music', the way we perceive it as a 'thing', and the way we perceive the people themselves that make it.

People like to criticize the group for being all built on hype, but I don't think that is a bad thing.  First off, Exmilitary was self released with little hype and still got them popular (on the internet).  After that is when they started putting tons of effort into doing really creative, DIY hype stuff that fit their aesthetic and fit the character of MC Ride: the low quality videos, the first ARG, releasing their album early and getting kicked off the label.  Yeah, their music benefits from the hype, but they are the ones who create it, and there is nothing wrong for enjoying something more due to its context.

Their first three albums seem to complete an arc for the character Stefan becomes as MC Ride, devolving from ""I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP,"" to ""It's all suicide"" and ""artificial death in the west"" and other themes of suicide on *NLDW*.  It seems strange, now, that there is more stuff to come from them, but it makes sense due to the artistic virtuosity they have shown in the past.

I could aimlessly rant on for a while but I won't.

I really enjoy their music, and it is because of them that I now know and appreciate shoegaze as a genre (it's listed as one of their genres on Wikipedia, which peaked my curiosity). But I feel like they themselves are only shoegaze in a very vague sense of the word.

They're a metal band, you can't dispute that. But it's almost like they're so post-black metal that they accidentally wandered into an entirely different genre. In their latest record, there's really only very few instances of anything distinctly metal (a growl, a blastbeat).

I think the really unique thing about them is that their riffs and melodies have a very ""metal"" style and feel to them, in terms of mixing, tone and even the general feel of their distortion, but they don't actually sound *that* metal.

I love the vocals. It has a very drone quality to it, but at the same time, is it obvious that Neige is clearly a hugely talented singer.

I don't know. I don't really have a ton to say in terms of conversation starters, I'm just curious what all you guys think about them. I'll throw some links below in case you're aren't familiar with their work.

I'd like to invite a discussion of examples, hopefully some that are less obvious. 

Let me start and maybe other people can throw some examples out there:

David Bowie. Americans have this cultural perception of all things English as being polite and gentlemanly, so for people in the U.S., anything Bowie does is going to be filtered through that lens - even if he does something that is extremely distasteful. We see an air of intentionality, thoughtfulness, or genius, but I wonder how much of that perception is attributable to something as simple as his accent. Do the English see the same thing in Bowie that an American does?

Note: For the record, I'm not knocking on Bowie or discounting his prolific and highly influential body of work. Just trying to spark some discussion. (P.S.

Although my first reaction, like many others, was ""This is fantastic, however they have done this before"", I now don't think that is a particularly bad thing. Unlike previous efforts this is their first purely ballad based album, vs. their typical mix of anthematic rock and ballads. Although the move was quite obvious, especially going from Alligator to Boxer, I am not disappointed by it, as I was with Boxer upon my first listen.

On the first few listens, this album affects me much more differently. Unlike High Violet and Boxer, which were both heart breaking, Trouble Will Find Me is tragic, but more in a heart broken and continuing on with one's life. In many ways this reminds me of Take Care by Explosions in The Sky, where there previous efforts sounds like music to go into a battle, Take Care sounds like a soundtrack to the aftermath. Trouble Will Find Me (imho) has that same atmosphere to it: It is the calm after depression, the eye of a hurricane in many ways. You can't feel positive afterwards, but you also are not rattled like their previous efforts. 

On a completely separate note, the mastering on this album is leagues ahead of High Violet, which was one of the reasons I could never get into it. It is very clean, with some muddled effects, but nothing to the extent of HV, which felt very fake and off putting.

Throughout these discussions the topic of authenticity constantly comes up, though what exactly makes music authentic? I think that authenticity is one of the most crucial components of music since it's arguably the determining factor in whether or not a listener identifies with the music.

Also I don't want to constrain this discussion to solely these pop bands and their authenticity (or lack thereof) but I'd like to discuss it in a much broader sense. I'll expand on my own thoughts in the discussion, but what do y'all think makes an artist's music authentic? How do you define authenticity? What artists do you think make authentic or inauthentic music and why?

I too used to sort of write them off as an overrated band with so-so pop songs, but the more I heard people discussing them there seemed to be sort of a cultural component to the hate for them as well.  For those who don't know, they are four guys who started a band in their dorm rooms at Columbia University in New York in 2006. In 2007 they gained a lot of buzz for their single [""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ksJ7TN2xA) and in 2008 released their eponymous debut which went on to general acclaim and album sales of over 500,000.  However they also got a lot of flack for their perceived image of preppy, spoiled, (mostly) white rich kids with ivy league degrees (some even criticized their drawing of inspiration from afropop music for a variety of reasons, primarily that they had no relation or understanding to that music's cultural significance).  Pitchfork media writer Scott Plagenhoef said about their lyrics: ""...detail-heavy, expressive; too bad they're images of wealth instead of poverty, otherwise they'd be critical manna.""  for a more in depth examination of the sort of criticism they received, here is a [village voice article on them from 2008](http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-01-22/music/please-ignore-this-band/) around the time of the release of their first album.  

  In 2010 they released Contra, an album that amplified their signifiers such as hyper literate lyrics, and ""stealing"" sounds from a wide range of styles (no longer just afropop), but also provided more of a narrative arc to discuss the place that class has in our relation to art (particularly punk and rock and roll), how much the upperclass should take their own fortunate circumstances into consideration when faced with day to day life and comparatively small ""first world problems"", and a variety of other things.  Contra for me is what got me to start liking them more, because it was incredibly smart, catchy, and was, in my opinion, the perfect response to all their critics. It reflects a lot on why we separate ourselves into groups based on stuff like class and what, if anything, those tags really mean.  Their new album, Modern Vampires of the City, is out May 13th/14th and lead singer Ezra Koenig has said it's the finale to a trilogy of sorts, their debut and Contra being the other two albums included.   

 What are your guys' thoughts on Vampire Weekend? 

 How much should their image play a role in our perception of what they have to say? 

 They've sold over a million albums, which feeds into the question of can privileged people ever be considered a victim when their positives outweigh the negative? Rock and Roll has historically been tied to rebellion and overcoming struggle-- is there a place in rock and roll for artists who not only come from privileged backgrounds, but where that background at times is directly tied into/evident in their music?

Did Vampire Weekend indeed pillage and cheapen a unique cultural sound, or was their inspiration by it just as legitimate as any other artists?  

Are they actually a culturally important band, or are their critics right in writing them off?


  Hopefully this was coherent, I've only really started exploring them as a band in depth these last few days and was wondering what other people's thoughts were.  Obviously, some people simply don't like their music for reasons totally beyond their image or lyrics which is fine, obviously, but I think they seem to be very divisive amongst listeners and make for great discussion because of that.  Also, sorry that this was really sort of rant-y. I'm not sure if it is all that coherent, so I may go back to edit and make it more succinct and such if the need arises.  

  Some of their songs:  

[Oxford Comma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g): A song that actually criticizes elitism through grammar/language snobbery, but was/is often misinterpreted as them being grammar/language snobs themselves.  

  [Taxi Cab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHljPP-4Z4g): a song from Contra that deals with whether or not the guilt that comes with privilege is similar to a distrust/dislike for the privileged (""you're not a victim/ but neither am I""), and if any of it is justified at all (""But I know that I was never fair/ You were always fine"").  

  [Horchata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7ueRrKRmo): one of their more ""pop"" songs that some critics used to argue against them based on sound/composition and lyrics.

  And the two singles from their new album, [Diane Young](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX46e4GtlXM), which i think is a good example of them broadening their sound while still trying to make intelligent pop music, and [Step](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mDxcDjg9P4), which I think includes some of the best lyrics Koenig has written.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,1364764958.0,,,True,t3_1bdnbb,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bdnbb/lets_talk_vampire_weekend/,

What I am not referring to is Christian Rock, but instead of religious songs or albums by artists. A good example (and what got me thinking about the topic) is Sufjan Steven's Songs for Christmas and Seven Swans. I think both albums are gorgeous and the references/religious overtones contribute to a nostalgic and even tragic feeling within the album. 

In many cases, the addition of religion is a great way for the author to show weakness and a feeling of helplessness, getting to the point of praying for help, since they have no other place to go. An existence so painful, they have no where else to turn but God/FSM/etc. I think about songs like [""The Transfiguration""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnGEPoH-HyM), [""Oh God, Where are You Now""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-E3a6kW6LI), [""It's Christmas, Let's Be Glad""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXnkyx0PLcE). Beyond Sufjan Stevens, songs like Velvet Underground's [""Jesus""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJj0z0u_9qQ), River City Extension's [""Standing Outside a Southern Riot""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Ro5DfAAo8), or even Foxygen questioning their religious affiliation in [""Make It Known""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwK32IuseGM).  Even arguably ""Losing My Religion"" is a good example of this.

Understandably, not every religious song has the feeling of helplessness, but even in some cases, it gives a more personal look at the artist, their beliefs, and their history, and the extent of their love. Think about songs like [""My Sweet Lord""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMgCpb1nli4) and [""Hear Me Lord""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK3zcleL-4U)

To be honest, I think John Lennon said it the best (in regards to music): ""God is a concept in which we measure our pain"". With that in mind, do you feel that this quote is true, and if so, does the concept of religion and God add to music?

Now a little bit about me to give perspective: I am not religious, and was born Jewish. Christmas music does not give me a feeling of nostalgia, because it was not something that my family listened to during the holiday season. To be honest, I dislike most of it, no because it is Christmas music, but rather because I do not particularly enjoy the 50's crooner style of music. With that in mind, I find a lot of beauty in some religious songs, even if it is not the religion I was born into, since I can relate to the concept: The feeling of weakness, the losing of my religious beliefs, and even nostalgic feelings of family being around during the holidays.

So, I just started a new job at a law office where my co-workers like to keep country radio on in the background.  It's been quite a while since I've listened to contemporary country, and I have to admit, I don't hate it nearly as much as I did a handful of years ago.  

I think there's a lowest-common-denominator approach that it takes which isn't always awful, and sometimes can be quite interesting.  It really makes me think about what music is about, and what the real difference is between pop music and art.  

I find that production-wise, a lot has change since the 1990's, which itself was a huge deviation from the more classic forms of country which preceded the big radio boom.  Songs still revolve around musically simple hooks that get recycled quite a bit, but the instrumentation seems to be diversifying.  I'm hearing a lot of dirtier guitar tones and spacier keyboard backing, that sort of thing, along with more classic approaches that mix in the slide guitar and banjo.  It's such a weird amalgamation, if you stop and think about it.  They basically borrow from whatever has proved itself successful in pop music, and adapt it to their mass appeal sensibilities.  Can you really even continue to call this country music?

Lyrically, contemp country continues to rehash the same stories and themes that epitomize American middle-class life.  It's easy to criticize this sort of songwriting as a cop-out for accessibility, but at the same time I've listened to a lot of bad indie music that tries to be inaccessible just for the sake of distinguishing themselves from the herd.  Both seem like opposing polar opposites of genuine artistic expression.  I think thematically and lyrically, contemp country is more acceptable if you try to think of it as a sort of American middle-class zeitgeist rather than an expression of an individual artist.  After all, many country stars don't write their own songs.  It's music that is generated by pure demand of large demographic of people.

[The TvTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfRockAndMetalHardness) defines the boundaries and categories in *exhaustive* detail, so I won't repeat them here.       

Rather than hashing out what separates one hardness level from another, I'm more interested in discussing the more ""meta"" aspects of rock hardness: how it evolves over time (a 6 now was a 10 in the late sixties), the artistic purpose behind a song's chosen hardness level, and the relationship between a song's (or band's) ""hardness"" and its popular appeal.       

For me, the most noticeable aspect of hardness is how sharply mass appeal plummets as it goes up. The *vast* majority of all rock music ever written lies at 6 or below, and on average the ""popular"" rock from any era tends to orbit around a 3 or so. It's a very small fraction who are compressing the scale at the top.        

Counter-intuitively, the songs used as examples on the page would imply the opposite trend: the low numbers have only a few examples apiece, while the 8, 9, and 10 categories are all bloated with endless lists. Yet the ""low"" examples are iconic and immediately recognizable while the ""high"" ones are extremely niche, their titles saturated with symbols of blasphemy, violence and filth. (Of course, metalheads wouldn't have it any other way!) The implication is clear: only a tiny subculture regularly listens to anything at the top of the scale, but they are extremely devoted to and invested in exploring it.        

Still, I can't help but wonder if this isn't stultifying in some way. Fully half the scale is monopolized by variations of ""angry,"" and the associated subcultures become sharply more disaffected, narrow, and exclusive the higher up you go.

1348526345.0,24,self.LetsTalkMusic,10f0mh,"Often ignored, rarely discussed. I'd like to hear people's opinions on modern punk rock.",,30,6,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10f0mh/often_ignored_rarely_discussed_id_like_to_hear/,"Aside from critical darlings like [Jay Reatard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAv1olf6KuI), [Fucked Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syg6XGbdUkM), and [Bomb The Music Industry!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ass-JUyWFfs) I rarely see the modern punk scene being brought up in discussions involving music. I mean, I totally get that the music isn't for everyone, but it seems to be largely ignored for the most part. It's been almost twenty years since punk's last big break in to the mainstream culture and a lot has happened in the underground scenes since then. It seems for the most part that critics seem to ignore the genre usually calling it's heavy hitters Green Day ripoffs and the like.

Maybe part of the problem is that when people bring up punk it almost always becomes a discussion of ""well, what's punk?"" From there the conversation tends to fall apart into a back and forth about the politics of it all. For once, let's not talk about how unpunk Green Day is because they were signed to a major label or how you can't respect the ethos of a genre where musicians can use name brand equipment while trying to be counterculture. For the sake of this conversation, I simply want to talk about the genre. Music that involves distorted guitar and power chords being played at quick tempos with minimal musical structure.

Here's what I always liked about punk. I liked the way that minimalist rock and roll could be made into an art form and how almost anybody could write a good punk song. The ferocity is a big part of it, but a [punk song can be fast without being abrasive](http://tightbros.bandcamp.com/track/particles). Certainly speed is critical to the genre, in my opinion. Many bands have become watered down versions of themselves over the years as they grow up and get less angry. Most critics like the call this ""maturing"". The biggest example in my mind comes from a band like Against Me!, where [their first album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atPgNwFP10) is one of the most aggressive angry records with beautiful musicianship (well, you know, for punk). Though opinions vary after ""Reinventing Axl Rose"" the band eventually became something akin to [those generic rock bands that you'd hear on car commercials.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzJ21OpFnZ0) Not that their later output's quality can really all be attributed to the slowed down nature of the new songs, but it certainly didn't help.

And here's what I understand puts people off. They don't like that it sounds the same. They don't like that there's no variation in the music. It can be repetitive. I take especial umbrage with the ""it all sounds the same"" comment. Punk is as diverse a sub-genre as almost any other. Maybe not as much as metal, but come on, who can really compete? As for the no variation comment, that's a point I'd actually really like to discuss. I'm a fan of a band who can make an album that sounds consistent, but there is a limit. There should be songs that sound like ""the standard"", the songs that conform the formula the band has been perfecting for years. When I anticipate a new album from a band, I want to know relatively what to expect based on their previous output. I like a surprise as much as the next guy, but there's a reason why I keep coming back album after album, keep at it. I do honestly believe if a band wouldn't be caught dead playing songs off their first few albums anymore that they should change their name and just be a new band already.

So, r/letstalkmusic, what are you thoughts on modern punk rock? Is it too samey? Too unispired? Just right and not respected enough? I'm eager to hear your opinions. Let's try to keep the discussion in the last decade or so. 

For anybody interest, here are a few of the more interesting punk rock acts in the last few years, according to me, DoctorStatic, amateur punk rock critic:

* [The Bananas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTadTz84AoY)

Jangly pop punk with diverse song structures and dual vocals almost all the time.

* [The Brokedowns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3aZZ64nWNw)

Heavy hitting metal inspired hardcore (think Black Flag if they kept a steady beat and without the jazz influence).

* [Diarrhea Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP2HBAsKktU)

Four guitarists playing pop punk inspired anthemic jams. 

* [Dillinger Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4YtTxV7UAo)

Gods of modern gritty pop punk, smart lyrics with strange audio clips is the name of their game.

* [The Ergs!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1feF-NX2jM)

This is what happens when a bunch of music dorks who like the best of mainstream rock and jazz start a pop punk band. [Alternative but less indicative song for reference.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGdusK8oDzs)

* [The Marked Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzlSn4LEkk)

Incredibly tight musicianship from guys who just wanted to play power pop at lightning fast speeds. Most of this band's charm comes from the tiny intricacies of their songs that are easily glossed over at the first listen. All of their albums were recorded in one of the guitarist's back yard.

* [Night Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwVpn38_u8)

Surf influence hardcore. Sounds like Agent Orange meets Negative Approach.

* [Off With Their Heads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fI17_xnxTk)

Gruff as fuck pop punk. Remember Screeching Weasel? Kind of like that but even more angry and depressed, but less sarcastic.

* [The Spits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U10Cb_IQKOg)

The weirdest punk band currently playing as far as I'm concerned. Singer sounds like a robot, all of their songs just sort of stop instead of end. Thing Devo meets Ramones in a post-apocalyptic 1950s sci-fi movie.

* [Summer Vacation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2H7PR0gMl4)

Inspired by emo and Weezer, but the songs come out sounding pretty diverse. They have slower numbers, but this one is the album opener and a killer track. 

* [Toys That Kill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzMLr-laYrs)

Pop punk with a surrealist lyricist. Has never quite sounded like any other band I've ever heard.

* [Unfun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN5poiEUtwk)

1349935828.0,24,self.LetsTalkMusic,11aq26,Let's Talk Objectivity vs. Subjectivity. Can we really be objective when it comes to music?,thatsumoguy07,28,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/11aq26/lets_talk_objectivity_vs_subjectivity_can_we/,"I like to think that I look at music as objectively as possible. That I try to take into account certain markers of good artistry when thinking about whether an artist is good or not. For me there are certain criteria that an artist has to meet for them to be considered good by me, these are:

*  Lyrically intelligent/thought provoking. This is not something that is huge. I find some good bands don't have the greatest lyrics, but I feel that the one genre where this is a huge issue for me is rap. In rap music the artist is not playing an instrument, and the talent in an artist (for me) comes in whether their lyrics have an substance. Which is why I have lost faith in Lil' Wayne, Drake, and the slew of massively popular rap artists who just write and rap witty one liners, without making a coherent point through out the whole song. There are some left who (luckily) still adhere to treating a song as a story way of doing things, but they are nowhere near as big as those who don't.

* Composition of a song. I can like an genre of music, and I can even like artists who might not have any lyric prowess, if they can write good music. I tend to find myself hooked on just a small section of a song, where they do something different, or one note that just fits perfectly. I can listen to an artist who I would otherwise despise just because they can hit these perfect moments. But if they don't then they have to have a good composition. The music has to be flowing, without falling into generic. It has to have a good beat without being bland. It's not an easy road to walk, but that's why I feel if you can do it, then you are a good artist.

* Raw musically talent. If you cannot get up there and excel at your instrument or art, then you are not a good artist. Anyone with 3 weeks of guitar lessons can do a G-C-D progression, and change tempos. You have to be willing to flex your musical prowess muscles, and do something that I know I can't do. If I wanted to listen to someone sing or play an overtly simplistic song, I can record myself and listen to it. Now this can be taken as subjective ""Well they are just playing to your level, I can't do that"" but for me the objective part is, I know I am not very good at this instrument, and I am at a level that anyone who I am paying money to listen should not be at.

* Willing to cross lines. Any artist that is willing to step over a line in musical genre and lyrical depth is someone that no matter their sound is good at what they do. It is not easy to bend the rules of a genre, and to play something that is so different that no one has even heard of before. And this is not something where lyrically you can just hop a bunch of ""fucks"" and ""shits"" in a line, and then say something controversial and be stepping over a line. For me you have to push the ideas that may rattle a few bones, and not in shock value. Or you have to be willing to be metaphoric, and lead your listeners on a trail to find the deeper meaning of your songs. (Although we then tend to try to do this with songs that there was no effort to make it metaphoric, and this usually leads to a misunderstanding of a song, but for me, a good song can be up to each person's interpretations. If you are lyrical profound enough to be able to have someone see something you didn't, you're doing it right).

But even though I have this list, and I know where everything fits in it, can I truly use this list and make objective decisions? Can we as a whole, who tend to look at music from a philosophical point rather than just something on the radio, really be true to an objective form? Take for instance Mumford and Sons. I like them, they are a style I like, but there tends to be a lot of people (especially on /r/music and /mu/) who despise them. They call their lyrics simplistic, and their style too generic. For me though they compose a good song, and they are willing to cross a few lines in the style of folk, so I am willing to call them good. But am I being objective here or subjective because I like folk and I love the sound of a banjo (although it's a banjar, I know)? So I ask you, can we objectively look at our musical understanding and be willing to accept that we may not be looking at everything objectively, and that we instead apply subjectivity into our listening, and won't be able to see the talent through the pop trees?

However, I like skits. They're a nice breath of fresh air between songs. See, the way I see it, hip hop is a very heavy genre. It's basically a guy spitting bars after bars non stop. So every once in a while a skit is nice. Sometimes these skits can be even be funny, like on Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle.

We seem to have missed the boat regarding July's album club - we had a suggestions thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/wbkxx/rletstalkmusic_album_club_july_suggestions_thread/) but unfortunately no follow-up thread was initiated so nothing ever happened there. We don't want the short-lived album club tradition to die, so let's try and get this going again.

The suggestion that got the most approval in the July suggestions thread seems to be Television's *Marquee Moon*, a classic by anyone's standards, so we could easily enough do that this month.

Alternatively, feel free to suggest your own ideas in the comments. The selection process functions as before. Voting will close (and a decision will be made) on 1 August.

***

On the topic of the album club more generally, it was suggested in the July suggestions thread that it would be good to discuss some albums outside of the rock/indie sphere. As such, I'd like to suggest (and I'm open to this idea being ruthlessly shot down) that we set out a provisional schedule of album clubs for the rest of the year, with each month taking on a different genre.

So, provisionally, we could do something like this:

September: a jazz album

October: a hip-hop/rap album

November: a metal album

December: an experimental/avant-garde album

...and so on. Thoughts?

***

Finally, it will have come to your attention that our creator and chief mod /u/JackIsidore is no longer with us. We don't know what happened to him. He literally just disappeared one day. If anyone can shed any light on his disappearance, it would be great to hear from you (it's not a matter of serious importance, just a strange thing that it would be nice to know the answer to).

this year has been fairly disappointing so far; though I think that has more to do with the glut of great albums that came out towards the end of last year spoiling me. But first the positive:

**Surprises**:

* **[Lilacs &amp; Champagne - Danish &amp; Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeJj7FCRYCg)** 

I mostly just wanted a new Grails album, but this album seems much more organic than their previous album. It also doesn't seem too far off from the previous Black Tar Prophecy EP, so even if it's not a full-fledge Grails album, it's more than just a placeholder.

* [**Boris - Praparat**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5qDtmCnR80)

after a string of disappointing releases the last few years, I wasn't expecting much from this, but this seems to have taken the (previously segregated) variety of Boris' last few releases and mixed them into a more coherent form. Overall, it kind of feels like Boris' take on post-rock.

* [**No Joy - Wait to Pleasure**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBSeEF6UJqc)

there seems to be a lot more Shoegaze records being released, but it seems like a bulk of them are rather faceless rehashing of the same dozen bands or so from the late 80s/early 90s. No Joy isn't exactly original (though I can't think of any Shoegaze bands doing [odd Hip Hop-esque tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk585bNnYyk) ), but they seem to have a bit more personality than others and with a more spacious mix.

* [**Primal Scream - More Light**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPu5FQgFIU)

I don't think it's quite the comeback some of the reviews make it out to be as it could be whittled down a bit (Invisible City (which sounds like the James Brown track from Rocky IV) and Goodbye Johnny could be easily dropped), but it's easily their best album in years. 

this isn't all of my favorite releases, just ones that have exceeded expectations.


**Disappointments**:

* [**Flaming Lips - The Terror**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6J8O8Ououk)

I've posted about this before, but essentially: the Flaming Lips finally make a boring album. Remove all the surrounding drama on the album (wayne's divorce and Steve's relapse) and it's nothing but a bleak album that doesn't really offer anything memorable apart from the opening track. It's especially disappointing in light of, in my opinion, a lot of fucking around (extreme song lengths, pointless cover albums, etc.)

* [**Black Angels - Indigo Meadow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812r_yzUJ_s)

it's a fairly logical follow-up to Phosphene Dream... it's just not really that interesting and kind of toothless. They've mostly traded their darker psychedelia for fairly tame standard psychedelia.  It's not unenjoyable to listen to, but mostly forgettable once the record stops.

* [**The Knife - Shaking the Habitual**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEiwhP7j6JM)

I heard a lot of good things about this album, but I'm honestly not convinced anyone genuinely likes it as it seems to be one whose reputation rests solely on ones ability to sit through the fucking thing. Now it's not a bad album mind you; every track generally starts off good/interesting, but with the exception of the above linked Raging Lung, every track way overstays its welcome. Overall, it just sounds like an album full of underdeveloped tracks all just kind of thrown together because they didn't really know what to do with them. Easily the most pretentious release of the year.

there's other disappointments (Wolf People's Fain, Low's Invisible Way, etc.), but they're not bad albums so much as they are just a rather noticeable step down from previous albums.

Since this was in like 2004, i despised what was considered the ""popular music"" of that era, which amounted to emo, pop-punk, nu-metal, metalcore, and things like that. I'm well aware now that emo started out as a DC area offshoot of hardcore punk, but i always had the MTV stereotype in my head when i thought about the genre: Skinny white kids with fringe haircuts singing about their breakups over glitzy instrumentation, a la Hawthorne Heights, Fall Out Boy, MCR, etc. I was the typical ""classic rock kid"" that many of us are familiar with: Someone who reduced rock music to a caricature, content to fetishize the nostalgic aspects of classic rock culture despite never having been born in that era myself. Keep in mind, i was born in 1993; by the time i was old enough to pay any close attention to music, it was already the 2000s era. 

However, ever since high school where i've started delving into the indie genre, i've ended up listening to a lot of classic emo acts like Sunny Day Real Estate, The Get Up Kids, American Football, Cursive, The Rites Of Spring, as well as third-wave stuff like Brand New and Taking Back Sunday and have found out that most of this ranges from not bad to absolutely excellent. 

If you ask me now what my favorite band is, i'd probably say Brand New. I'm assuming that anyone who has spent any time in /r/music knows who they are, but here's their Wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_New_(band) as well as [a](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB6ESvoBwxI) [few](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjPyvoLXPs4) [songs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP_b7-_PkoM) [by](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LllchE03xRk) [them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKZkkBFCceY). While it's somewhat difficult to pinpoint what it is i love about them, i would say that creative yet catchy instrumentation and intelligent but relatable lyrics were initial characterists that drew me towards them.

Now, even though Brand New's sound has changed pretty radically over the years (from a pop-punk band to an indie/post-hardcore band) they have always had a pretty consistent influence from emo sound. From heart-on-their-sleeves lyrics to gentle instrumentation, the influence was always pretty undeniable. However, it's not like that was the ONLY thing they sound like: their singer Jesse Lacey has stated a love for bands like The Smiths, Modest Mouse, Archers of Loaf, and Neutral Milk Hotel.

Even though the 11 year old me never would have thought it, i now listen to a crapload of music that i probably would've despised back in 2004. Thanks to my love for Brand New, i've been listening to bands such as [La Dispute](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l5156x8bmo) and [Defeater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cynnKMpuY-Y) (post-hardcore) as well as [The Wonder Years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiCit3G4YRU) and [The Story So Far.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVB_CIplD14) (pop-punk)

Recorded music already allows listeners to hear works ""out of time,"" but the availability of recordings has always been much more of a barrier than now, where practically any sort of music can be found on places like YouTube. Instead of label catalogs, genre groupings, or an older sibling's collection creating paths for our music discovery, there are computer-generated recommendations, playlists, etc. I know that the availability of music online has made it far easier for me to find new things and discover types of music I might never have heard otherwise, but I'm old enough that I didn't grow up using them. I'm curious about younger listeners-- does having so much music available mean that they're making amazing new connections between disparate genres and artists, or are they being sewn into little self-directed reflective boxes of recommendations and ""you might like"" echoes? Stepping back a bit-- how will new music discovery affect future music? We'll always have new artists who grew up around a blues bar, or a rock club, etc... but what about new musicians who grew up hanging out in YouTube or LastFM?

Somehow, that seemed like it was a part of the music itself, but I could never really explain why. I've been telling people for years now that I doubted there would even *be* a next release, but more so that the next release wouldn't be particularly good. I had some pompous statements to back it up, but at the bottom of it all I still just didn't know why I didn't think or want a new album, I just knew I didn't.

So I gave the album a good listen today and I figured it out; figured out why I don't want another xx album. It all goes back to what the album is about. The first album is about love. I know people say it's all about sex, and they're right, but it's not *about* fucking, it's about love, and fucking is a huge part of that. The first album is about a very young (remember, some memebers were 19 at the release), very real, very passionate *first* love. It brimms with excitement, curiosity, thirst and in the midst of all that still has the blues and is very, very much in love. 

In short, I think that album was an example of good timing: you had a few really good musicians who hadn't really had a chance to develop, but you caught them at the most emotional, most artistic points in their lives. Not that it somehow discredits the album, just that's what it is. You met them when they decided to make a first album because their lives were at that moment so full of firsts that it made sense.

Clearly, the xx have all gotten older. They're 22, 24 now. I'm 22, and I feel like a completely different man than the person I was at 14, and I certainly don't feel the same way about love. I've had my firsts and things have started to cool down.

I'm worried that the xx is going through the same thing (not on a personal level, I want them to develop) and their music will suffer, or to put it better, it won't play into my tastes anymore. I'm worried that the luster and the curiosity that made that album so much more will be lost, replaced with a light jadedness.

Remember how everyone felt right before the Bon Iver album dropped? That's how I feel right now: a litte curious, but cautious at the same time. ",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_yb5fj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/yb5fj/why_im_worried_about_the_new_xx_release/,

Specifically I'm thinking about ""Meat Puppets II"" by the Meat Puppets and ""The Idiot"" by Iggy Pop.

**Meat Puppets II** is an impressive blend of psychedelia, country rock, and hardcore. It's a huge maturation from their debut and contains a solid rock center that none of their later material (that I've heard) seems to maintain.

[Meat Puppets II - Full album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IenJY0QWIJE)

[Up On the Sun - Full album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6pzaRulgg0) for comparison

Many owe the gravity of **The Idiot** to David Bowie because of his role as producer and the direction his career took with Low. There's an introspective and sparse element to the album that feels far removed from the raw power Iggy conjured with The Stooges and his later career.

What I'm asking is whether music is inherently more valuable for being original, or if there is value to popularizing and perfecting a style of music.

For example, Radiohead is influenced by tons of bands, and while to a certain extent they do new things the majority of their music is a reworking and recombination of older bands. Their influences obviously include major bands like The Beatles, but they also are clearly influenced by more experimental and less popular music such as progressive rock and ambient.

Many of those obscure bands (at least obscure relative to Radiohead) are difficult to listen to, and often they were recording on shitty equipment with low budgets. This is especially true for early electronic bands, because whatever else their merits the quality of synthesizers has gone up exponentially. An amateur could make something with the same production value as an expert pioneer in the early 70s. On top of that, when bands experiment and create new sounds they often also produce a lot of crap, so later bands who take up those sounds have more time to perfect them.

So are those earlier bands therefore not worth listening to, since their music has been improved upon by later bands? I come down on the side that says yes, the older bands are better because they are more original.

Where do we go from here?,TerraLucet,25,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10eba0/how_do_you_think_the_computer_generated_music_era/,"While I was doing some digging through related tracks in youtube, I ran across an interesting comment. ""*... if Macbook﻿ isn't an instrument, neither is a synthesizer nor an electric guitar. It's all about wave forms and you can be sure that now-a-days there's only a few that still produce a music without touching a computer...*"" (n3skk - for the video [Parov Stelar - The Mojo Radio Gang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BsAl6HVZ-Y)) This made me start thinking more about it. 

Can we really consider a piece of composition software an instrument? I've always considered it as a part of post-production, or even just as an arranging tool. I've never really seen someone 'play' a laptop (but I have seen someone play an antique sampler as a keytar before. That was pretty hilarious and B.A. at the same time). Personally, I probably wouldn't consider a laptop an instrument myself, because I don't really consider a mute for trumpet or trombone an instrument; nor do I consider an effects pedal for guitar an instrument. I guess, I would have to consider a computer at best an emulator; not like a synth emulator, because that had it's own characteristic sound. Rather, I'd consider it just a sound reproducer. Like a Melotron of sorts. Ah, but the Melotron was considered an instrument. So really, I don't know where I stand.

The quote in question was following a line of Skrillex bashing, but, I'm not super familiar with Skrillex's (or most Dubstep DJs, for that matter) production style, or what it requires; and more over what their live gig consists of. Personally, I'm a little slanted against going to an electronic performance, simply because not enough people want to be [expert knob twiddlers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ercHzfvT6qY); I've even seen it be so bad as to the writter/composer/producer just threw the track on, and save for some minor level adjusting/EQing (which could just be handled by the venue sound man.) didn't really do much, save for some fancy posturing.
My experience seeing live performances of this kind of music tends to be that the performance quality is cheesy or bad; but I'm someone who loves electronic music and the frontier it presents. Although there is a bitter taste in my mouth, I'm willing to change my mind.

The quote also brought to mind the introduction of the synth and how it changed music forever. I imagine once the Polyphonic and Modular synths hit the streets, it was considered infinite in utility when paired with a recording device/post-processing. But I think of how... incredibly varied and versatile a computer is, as a sound generator, processor, and recorder; and I just can't imagine we could go much further. 

**So here's the real meat**; I want to know what ***YOU*** think: 

* What effects do you think purely generated music has had on the culture as a whole? Good? Bad? Different?

* What experience do you have with live electronic performance? Good performers? Bad performers? Seen anyone playing their laptop?

* Or would you consider them primarily/purely composers?

* Computers have a near infinite possibility frontier. What do you think would change the face of music, when confronted with this idea?

* **The big one:** Do you think a computer is an instrument? Or a production tool?

Futhermore, they forced me to look into other grunge bands, and I can say this:

&gt;-Pearl Jam's first three albums are fantastic, especially *VS*. 

&gt;-Soundgarden has the voice and the image. *Superunknown* is a great record. 

&gt;-Green River, Malfunkshun, and the Melvins allegedly started the whole movement, but they (for the most part) suck because they are all over the place (too eclectic).  

&gt;-Mother Love Bone was not as good as Pearl Jam's first record. 

&gt;-Alice in Chains might be overrated, but every time I listen to *Dirt* or *Jar of Flies* I reconsider that. 

&gt;-I'd rather listen to the worst of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden than listen to the best of Temple of the Dog.

* I think that the one who is moshing should be responsible for being aware of their surroundings

If you saw an artist, would you start to tell if all of their songs were in the same key? Would it seem boring, either consciously or unconsciously? Is the change in keys (to me, essentially 'moving the I') essential between songs? I love it when it changes strong and intentionally, but if two or three songs go by in the same key, do you think it loses some impact? Or does it not even matter, as long as you're grooving, it's all good? I feel like a lot of (simpler) electronic music doesn't pay heed to these things and sticks to the bare minimum, and people love it. At the same time, idk how much I respect those artists.

the **weekly** LTM album discussion club!

wooooooo!

Thanks to [that one thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1as6ih/what_do_you_want_to_see_for_themes_in_the_album/) we've got ideas (your ideas) to keep this thing going for a while and hopefully make it more interesting.  

Here's the deal:

we're gonna rotate through 4 themes.  We're gonna keep doing a different genre every month (this time: **post-punk**), and a album from this year.  The new things we are gonna add are: ANY album you choose from a band that has *less* than 10,000 listeners on last.fm (nominations will require a sales pitch) and any album from a given year (gonna work backwards, starting this month with **1999**).  I'm hoping this gives a good mix of albums that are known and loved by most, and albums that are new to most people.
________________

This month's categories:

 * A **post-punk** album
 * An album by a band that has **less than 10,000** last.fm listeners
 * An album released in **1999**
 * An album released in **2013**

**READ THIS BEFORE NOMINATING ANYTHING**

To nominate, name *one album* per post.  So if you want to nominate an album for all four categories, make four separate posts with one album in each. If you want to nominate 2 albums for one category, make two separate posts.  Any post with more than one album in it will NOT be picked.

Format: 
___________________
**Category**

Band - *Album*

[Optional sales pitch goes here.  This is /r/lets**talk**music, so content is always more appreciated here.  If the category you are nominated shit for is the under 10k last.fm listener one, a sales pitch is required!]
__________________

Nominations that don't follow the format will be removed and I'm totally not lying about that this time.  


PS contest mode again.  Your upvotes won't show up till I end the voting period, and all the comments will be ordered randomly, so hopefully voting will be fairer.

Now I may be wrong on this, but these are just my personal impressions. 

So where do you see hip hop music going in ten years' time? Do you think the genre will evolve? And if so, in what ways?

Personally, I hope hip hop music will not become just ""black music"" as it is portrayed by the media, but I hope it becomes ""friendlier"" and more accessible, but without losing so much artistic integrity. In the future, I believe that hip hop music will have happier overtones. 

Also, I hope that more thought will be put into the combination of rhymes and instrumentals, something that many rap songs lack. Most rap songs feel like the rapper spit a capella and an instrumental was just tacked in. I hope that in the future, rappers would take advantage of the synchronicity. 

So what are your thoughts? Do you think artists like MF DOOM, Pharaohe Monch will become more mainstream? Do you think the sound will become more like Shabazz Palaces' Black Up (all hip hop aficionados MUST listen to this album if it isn't the case yet)?

This is a band that's taken a lot of risks. They threw everything against the wall with *American Idiot* 8 years ago and it somehow worked. They took 5 years to release a follow-up, *21st Century Breakdown* which was a disappointment overall. Now they're back, taking chances again by releasing 3 albums within a couple of months of each other.

What do you think the response by the public will be? Do you think that people will actually go out and buy 3 Green Day albums within 6 months? Is this just a gimmick by the band to gain attention and then to get more money?

And perhaps, more importantly, do you think the albums will be good? Any early predictions?

I am feeling horribly empty. The reverb, the echoes, the static of the TV, the distant hazy voices, the sheer desperation... this is a devastating album, but epic in a microcosmic sense. Universal, yet subjective. Everyone has their own mothers and walls. 

Disc 1 chronicles the bricks, the slow descent of sanity and ascent of the wall. I was listening to [""Mother""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmmKzEKYvdM) when I realized Pink just wants someone to hold his hand. He's retreating and keeps trying to return to her. 

Disc 2 starts off with a deeply ominous tone. Aeroplanes, the lack of control, the death of innocence. And in [""Empty Spaces"",](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARXKvVeVtXg) Pink is trying to fill those empty spaces with emptiness. And then he's so bitter and angry and loud, which escalates further and further until it all blends together into incoherent droning broken by... that single, final slam. Pink angrily destroys his house in [""One of My Turns"",](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqEytMfQCLI) but that final ""Why are you running away?"" sounds full of despair and desolation. His cutoff ""goodby-"" as the wall is completed in [""Goodbye Cruel World""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-R7KsE3-Y) was particularly striking. 

The next disc is full of all this fuzzy noise: the sound of an empty room. ""Divided we fall, fall, fall, fall"" and falling. Then again with the layering on ""Is there anybody OUT THERE!""

And finally, we get to the end. He becomes a dictator. The Judge in his mind commands to tear down this wall. And the album ends on a lukewarm note. Loneliness is still there. And the ending! ""Isn't this where we come in?"" This reminds me of a [Hopper](http://foxpudding.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/hopper2auto.jpg) [painting,](http://www.artchive.com/artchive/h/hopper/nighthwk.jpg) or of Caldwell's [*Tobacco Road.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Road_(novel\)) It continues this never ending cycle, or maze rather, of isolation. 

My friend and I were trying to match this up with Campbell's [monomyth,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth) if anyone here's familiar with that. My friend thinks that the album as a whole focuses on the Initiation (into a person), which I definitely agree with. Women and the Mother also match up. I think some version of a ""Confrontation with the Father"" occurs during ""The Trial"" and that Pink is narrating from outside the wall, where he has experienced both worlds to some extent. I'm not sure he ever achieves the final step of accepting mortality and living though. 

Anyways, I've talked for long enough. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this album! I'm writing this right off of my first listen-through, so please add anything I've missed.

Some bands start off strong and then proceed to make crap albums long past their prime (see: Weezer), others start off weak and eventually make classics (see: My Bloody Valentine). But some bands start off strong and stay that way until the very end. The only rules I would suggest that would fit the above description:

* band needs at least 2 albums.

* If you would rate any of a band's albums below a 7 out of 10, count them out.

* Band can't be currently active, even if they've disbanded and reformed, but have yet to release another album. (i.e. I want to include Godspeed You Black Emperor!, but their current tour(s) disqualify them) You may include reformed bands if they've since disbanded again.


my nominees:

* **Galaxie 500** One of the more acrimonious break-ups, but they released 3 solid albums before calling it quits.

* **Loop** a handful of single, a drastic line-up change, and 3 solid albums before Robert disbanded them to move onto something different with Main.

* **Velvet Underground** Some slight rule bending here as even Doug Yule would say ""Squeeze"" wasn't an official VU album. Even then, the first 3 albums are a virtual crystal ball of where Rock would go for the next 40 years. I think ""Loaded"" is easily their weakest album, but it's not too bad overall.

* **Bark Psychosis** Helped set the template for Post-Rock. released a handful of singles (""Independency"") and ""hex"" before breaking up. Graham resurrected the moniker to release ""Codename: Dustsucker"", which is easily Hex's equal. as far as I know, no plans for a 3rd album.

* **This Heat** essential post-rockpunk. Basically reformed as Camberwell Now after some members left.

* **Joy Division** Yeah, it was probably a good idea to change the name after Ian Curtis committed suicide. But both of their albums and singles are essential to the post-punk period.


Any others? I kind of want to add Led Zeppelin as they at least had the good idea of quitting after Bonham died, but I don't like post-PG Led Zeppelin much. Though I do think Led Zeppelin in the 80s would be filled with keytars and gated reverb. (Think: Van Halen's 1984 but done by Spinal Tap-levels of seriousness)

&gt;Queens Of The Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf. (Of course, this may be intentional — the entire album is supposed to sound like it's being listened to on a car stereo.)

... a lot of the people bitching about the Loudness War seem to be missing the point as this is entirely the desired effect. Listening to bands like [Boris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WkaeBZ1kGU), [High Rise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7kK5nYGRXc), or [The Psychic Paramount](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSgPvSY1uDA), all of whom have unnaturally compressed mixes, it makes the music feel ungodly loud and overwhelming... which is the exact desired effect.


Now I'll fully admit that that kind of mastering would sound like shit on a Bob Dylan record, though I'm also not convinced smooth, clean mastering would save a new Red Hot Chili Peppers or Metallica album. I liken this trend to drum machines: they can either be used as a cheap substitute for a live drummer and likely sound like absolute shit,  or they can have their own unique sound that accentuates a performer's music in ways a real drummer cannot.

**tl;dr:** shitty pop music is just being shitty, but there's some legitimate uses for those levels of compression.

I've been somewhat militant in only listening to complete albums (or EPs), ignoring singles and compilation albums and all that jazz.

I love the idea of it being a complete work of art.  Like its own novel or movie or painting.  But as I've gotten into dance music, particularly 2 step/garage/dubstep, I've started to see that maybe an album isn't required.  I haven't fully opened to the idea yet.

My thoughts on this are sparked anew with the announcement of the new Burial single, and I wonder: how does he feel satisfied putting out a series of singles, and not just buckling down and finishing a whole album?  But I need to step back and ask myself why is my idea of an album the ultimate thing that could be made?  

Also, the definitions of these things are so blurry:  Street Halo, Kindred, and this new thing are all pretty long as ""singles.""  I'd call this new one and Kindred EPs.  I've even seen an album defined as any release longer than 25 minutes.

What do you all think about bands releasing multiple versions of an album?  Having heard a lot of your arguments as to an album not needing to be completely cohesive...this still annoys me.  I, or some primal desire within, NEED to have the ""real"" version of an album...but what does that mean?

I can switch around the tracks to hear the original version of *Greed*, but the missing track from *Holy Money* means I can't listen to the original--how the band initially intended the music to be heard--so I just can't do it!  Also, Wolves In The Throne Room's *Two Hunters* vinyl release not only had a 16 min. extra track, but an extra 5 minutes at the beginning of Cleansing.  Which version of the album is the ""real"" one...the shorter one (is it cut down, edited version the band reluctantly trimmed, or is it the more concise, better version the band really wanted), or the longer (the FULL version exclusive to record listeners, or the one with the extra bits that weren't good enough for digital)?

These are high school students in a pop-music history class.  They learn about copyright and the music business before we delve into actual music history, so my hope is that they will spend a week wheeling and dealing in a simulated version of the dirty cut-throat music business to get a sense of how commerce influences pop music (and vice versa).

The way I want the game to be structured: 

* You decide to be a musician (or form a band with your friends?), a major label, or an indie label
* If you're a label, your resource to earn and spend is $$.  If you're a musician or indie label, your resources are time and $$.
* I'll post weekly ""sales"" reports that track the income and popularity of certain genres.  These genres will rise and fall in popularity, become outdated, etc.  Major labels will try to ride these trends, and musicians on major labels will try to ride these trends, to make the big $$.  Indie labels and musicians will make less $$, and constantly have to choose between their art or their income.
* If your expenses outweigh your profit, you ""lose.""  (And you can start over with a new 'character').
* Students will also carefully craft their 'image' (something I touched on in previous classes, but we never fully explored) to appeal to their fanbase

I'm trying to keep it fairly simple.  (Though in typing this up I realize I'll need a fairly accurate list of record label expenses to offset the musicians' and labels' income)

Thus, I need musical trends and political events FFRROOOMM  TTHHEE FUUUTTTUUURREE.  Like, the next 15 years or so, nothing too crazy.  Thoughts that are guiding my ideas:

* What political events could influence music?  (for example, during the Great Depression, carefree swing music became very popular.).  What political events in the next 15 years could influence music?
* How do genres split off into subgenres/influence future genres?  In what ways could this occur in the next 15 years?
* How do the ""rough edges"" of an underground genre get polished for  mainstream consumption (recently I heard a Selene Gomez song on the radio that had a wubwub bassline)

What genres could emerge?  What political events could occur?  What are some ways these could interact?  What do you think?

Edit: And I'm sure no one is still reading at this point, but I'm looking for music developments linked to previous genres, political/economic events, or racial/ethnic interactions, since that's what my class studies.

My wife is an artist, and she's taught me a lot about modern art movement, which I had previously dismissed as just messy and lazy.  When I looked at something like Pollock's spatter paintings and compared them to something like a Rembrandt...I mean, there was no contest in my mind as to which one deserved respect as a real ""artist.""  But she taught me that the idea behind art like Pollock's wasn't to showcase talent or to depit anything real; it was more a reaction to the history of art, a distillation of the very act of painting to its mere mechanics: putting paint on a canvas.  

Ok, so now for the dubstep part of this little argument (and to be clear, when I say dubstep I mean stuff like Skrillex...I know there's some ontroversy over what is and isn't dubstep, but this is the stuff I'm talking about): I think one can draw parallels between dubstep and abstract expressionist paintings like Pollock's.  When you listen to this kind of dubstep, a large part of it is created by noise.  There's high-pitched squeals, that grindy wub-wub bass; synthesized beeps and boops...essentially noise.  It's not trying to imitate any kind of ""real"" instrument, it's not trying to sound like a human performance.  Like pollock stripping down painting to its most basic elements of paint and canvas, these dubstep artists are reducing music to its basic elements of frequency and rhythm.  

To take the analogy further...can any meaningful difference be defined between any two splatter paintings or any two of these kind of dubstep songs?  Sure, the melodies and rhythms are different, and so are the shapes and colors of the splatters.  But at the end of the day the difference between any two examples are superficial, and any preference that a person might have for one over another comes down to that person's subjective opinion.  

Thoughts?  Am I totally off my rocker for drawing these parallels?  Am I even making sense?  Like I said, I probably have no idea what I'm talking about...I'm not a modern art connoisseur and I have no particular fondness for dubstep (or electronic music in general).  It's just something that popped into my mind and I thought it might be a good discussion prompt.

I often look up some of my favorite artists on Wikipedia and i find some of my most beloved artists were quite popular in the UK but did poorly in America. Sure, you will have crap on both charts, but i find it more so in American charts then UK ones.

I am a big fan of bands and artists from the UK in general but there are plenty of American bands that did well over there but did not gain the same following here in America.

Then there are so many spectacular UK artists that are staples of the UK music heritage that are all but unheard of in America.
Do people from the UK just have much better taste in music? Of course one can make the argument that America is a much larger and diverse country and so there is much more dilution in the music tastes. But i think there is more to it than just that. I find the mass majority of the U.S. music charts to be pretty horrible. The UK charts are much more tolerable generally. This is all subjective so there is no right or wrong of course, but I'm interested in peoples opinions from both sides of the pond.

Here are some prime examples. All the bands/artists listed below have had some modicum of critical success and cult followings but failed to have much commercial success in America. They also happen to have produced some of my most beloved music.

American bands that charted very well in the UK but did not do so well in America include......

Hüsker Dü and Sugar, both of Bob Mould fame both had some chart success in the UK but failed to make any headway commercially in the U.S.

The Pixies had 3 top 10 albums in the UK. The highest any of their albums reached in the U.S. charts was #70. The Breeders had a similar experience on the charts between the 2 nations.

Dinosaur Jr. charted substantially higher in most of their albums in the UK.

More recently The Drums have charted in the UK but have failed to make a dent in U.S. charts.

The Eels albums have charted very well with 7 top 20 albums in the UK. #43 is the highest they have reached in the U.S. charts.

Flaming Lips have 10 singles that have charted in the UK compared to just 2 in America.

The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain had 6 top 20 albums in the UK. #98 was the best they ever did in the U.S.

Pavement had 3 top 20 albums in the UK. Never had an album chart higher then 70 in America.

There are a ton of UK artists that have charted very well in their homeland but never made much of a dent in U.S. charts, or there was a great disparity in their commercial success. Many of these bands are mainstays of UK music culture and history and some of my favorite all time artists.

New Order has 7 top 10 studio albums including 2 #1 albums. Zero top 10 albums in the U.S.

The Smiths only had 4 studio albums. All 4 of them charted either #1 or #2 in the UK. In comparison they charted #150, #110, #70, and #55 in the U.S.

Rammstein-- ""Buck Dich"" \(NSFW\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcBnYKdmC04&amp;feature=related): The sheer absurdity of this performance coupled with the over-the-top antics that Rammstein is known for make this video both disturbing and hilarious.

Beatles -- They gave rise to the rock tradition, to modern music.  Anything that you hear today stems from The Beatles in one way or another.

Sonic Youth --They remind me of post-post-modern artists who use old, rubber tires and other junkyard objects to create art, in that they use guitar distortions and noise to create, in its ugliness, beauty. And isn't that what art is all about?

New York Dolls -- They gave rise to the whole Glam rock movement. Though glam rock sucks, these are a talented bunch of rock stars that know what they're doing (unlike their successors). Their entire discography is A+ stuff. While both of their studio albums rock, they also are filled with quality content.

Gram Parsons -- If not Johnny Cash, he is the king of country. Blending the popular hippie movement with a relaxed country sound, he creates some of the best music to smoke to.

Neil Young -- Unlike Dylan (which is also one of my favorites), his lyrics are more abstract, but nevertheless poignant.

I'm using the term alternative very loosely here since modern indie culture has in some ways merged with mainstream, I really mean music that isn't Nickelback-like. 

But why is this? There's so much 90's admiration going on these days. Whether it be a celebration of the music, television, and politics; it seems that the 90's are becoming the new 60's in levels of cultural admiration. Keep in mind that this is me completely generalizing, but the 90's seemed to have an attitude or quality to it that has completely vanished in recent years.  [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDgpQBaziy0) for me sums up this 90's attitude pretty well for me personally. It seems that te 90's represented a movement that was pro-normal people. This is evident in the rise of the DIY attitude, 90's ""slacker"" culture, and the anti-extravagance of grunge and indie rock. Anyone could theoretically be a rock star in the 90's alternative rock scene. Music and attitude was all that mattered. You didn't have to have hollywood looks or traditional music talent to make it in the music industry. As long as you were creating something inventive and different, you could be a 90's alternative hero.  

I feel like many people, myself included, find this attitude very comforting. And many people look to recapture that feeling of acceptance and normality. While pop music celebrates larger than life celebrities (and egos), 90's alternative celebrates the average and unpolished. I understand that these values have always existed through modern music and culture, but this movement seemed to culminate in the 90's when bands like Nirvana were present in the mainstream. This is another reason why Nirvana's legacy will probably outlive it's actual musical output. Kurt Cobain was somewhat of a martyr for this 90's set of values. For once there was someone present in the mainstream that was very vocal and very honest about a lot of the bullshit that goes on in pop-culture. Much like John Lennon, Cobain's death is still an open sore that will take much longer to heal than most other celebrity deaths. 

So am I full of shit? I really think this is the underlining appeal to 90's culture. For once there was a somewhat mainstream movement that looked at normal people endearingly, and the 2000's seemed to completely wipe this attitude away. I'm not sure how 2000's culture will be remembered, but I think we can safely say that it was a radical departure from the 1990's.

* It happens when the music has really touched me in some way. (obviously)  
* It usually happens on first or second listen.  
* It usually happens when the music conveys a unique emotion i haven't felt before.  
* It usually happens in powerful sections of songs. Be it powerful in band dynamics or powerful in a laid-back/controlled sense. But powerful nonetheless.  
* It only happens with music that is clearly *authentic* and/or from the heart, rarely works with copycat music or business music.
* The size of the crowd often increases the likelihood of it happening. Something to do with everybody connected to the same vibe.

Maybe theres more written and known about this, but for now all I have are mental ramblings I try to make sense off. For classical music I think this is not that obscure; I remember reading about it in a textbook, how different styles of pieces were for different settings. And different settings could accommodate different instruments, the sonic qualities of the space, and the audience. Chambre pieces were fewer instruments, big outdoor symphonies loaded their trumpets. The location also shaped the character and mood of the piece of well.

Now, we arent restricted by location, we listen to anything anywhere. We have cheap memory and cheap reproduction. Besides that I think location makes an impact that crosses over genres and can be broken up into three categories: the stadium, the dance floor, and home(edit: or the car/radio). Each of these three areas shape how the music is composed. A genre can start in one and cross over. This is pretty much what happened to House and Dubstep that, not so much got worse, but changed from club music to stadium music and I think thats a big reason for the sonic differences. Burial would be taking dance floor music for an at home setting, etc...Thinking of it this way, disco music will always be disco music(that means house/techno, etc is the evolution of disco music and I think that should be more recognized).

Anybody have any thoughts on this?

Let me preface things but saying I absolutely love slacker rock, and I'm just curious to hear what other people have to say about the genre. If anyone isn't initiated with slacker rock, I'll try to give a brief overview. 

Basically, slacker rock is a particular style of lo-fi indie rock that was popularized back in the early 90's. It consisted of bands who purposely played sort of sloppily, with slightly out of tune guitars being strummed loosely and lyrics being sung by singers who often didn't have the best pitch control. The music, to me at least, has a sort of irresistible lo-fi charm to it, and I think I find it easier to relate to and enjoy music recorded in this fashion. Possibly the best and most popular example of slacker rock was [Pavement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMjlhIWxfFI), who actually achieved a little mainstream success with their second album *Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain*. [Guided By Voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN9x6zckn18) and [Sebadoh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFniGEsV3Qs) are a few more of my favorite acts, and I'd be happy to post more examples if anyone's interested.

What prompted this post was seeing [Speedy Ortiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V3hM-YDsOk), a band that draws inspiration heavily from these 90's bands, get labeled p4k's new buzz band for the month of July.

So what do you guys think? Love the genre or hate it? I just want to have a discussion on slacker rock as a whole, and possibly if anyone sees a sort of comeback of this style of playing in popular indie rock music in the near future.

This album's got a bad rap. The conventional story is, with John Cale long gone and Lou Reed out, Doug Yule abuses the band name to put out a mediocre solo-album that is in no way worthy of even being associated with the groundbreaking releases that are *The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico* or *White Light/White Heat"".

Critics scorn it. Fans overlook it. It gets put on lists of ""Worst albums of all time"". It's the redheaded stepchild of their discography.

And I don't think it deserves to be.

Now let me be clear: it is nowhere good as those albums mentioned above. Where they're experimental, it's conventional. Where they're mercurial and vigourous, it's tempered and cautious. Where they deservedly inspired a thousand followers, it deservedly inspired none.

But as a follow-on from *Loaded*, with *Loaded* a follow on from *Velvet Underground*, it's actually really quite a good listen.

The first track, ""Little Jack"" - alongside a few other cuts like ""Mean Old Man""; ""She'll Make You Cry""; ""Send Me No Letter"" - if they had just a little more verve in the vocals, more passion in the drums, would all have been fine additions to Loaded's pop sound. More than anything they sound like something John Fogerty could've written: bright swaggering rock songs with tight pop sensibilities and an irresistibly brash simplicity.

""Wordless"" has a cool honky-tonk darkness to it - just a bit of filth in its toes and it could fit right in among any cut off *Exile On Main Street*; a bit more strangeness and Tom Waits'd lay claim to it.

""Friends"" is, no qualifications, a masterpiece. If there were one song I'd ask to speak for this album, this'd be it. The arpeggio'd chords are a simple rip-off of Reed's style sure, but the mood and songwriting are as good as any such song he's written.

""Crash"" is a throwaway song, an odd choice for inclusion at all, let alone track two, but very similar to the kind of thing Lou Reed did in ""I'm Sticking With You"" or ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"". ""Jack &amp; Jane"" sounds like Reed as well, and if he'd had this for his solo work it'd surely be well-regarded.

And the closer, ""Louise"", is a fascinating tune, an attempt at the sort of prog-pop that McCartney realised so well on *Abbey Road*. It doesn't quite get there, not entirely, but it's definitely worth a listen.

It's obvious that Squeeze is heavily indebted to Lou Reed. It's also obviously very much a clean'n'simple pop/rock affair held back by the limitations of execution - but beneath the hood it's actually really quite cool, and given the direction *Loaded* took the band, and the direction Lou Reed took going solo, would a Reed-led *Squeeze* really have been much better? (I mean yes, but not as dramatically as the critics'd have you think.)

The album is flawed. Its songs beg for a raucous attitude that Yule just can't quite deliver; his style leans more toward perfectionist care. And placed beside *White Light/White Heat* it definitely seems an embarrassing little thing.

But it *is* a natural evolution for the band, and it is by and large a solid record in its own right, with a sound of its own and some damn good pop/rock songs to offer.

Give it a listen, you might see what I mean.

And closing note: why does it get such critical scorn? I think partly because of obscurity. Not many people have listened to it. A conversation between two who have is *very* rare indeed. That being the case, there's going to be a lot of hyperbole surrounding it - it'll either be the lost classic, the forgotten gem. Or it'll be the worst piece of shit ever recorded.

And since calling it a lost classic would upend the whole story of Velvet Underground, and since no-one could think it's all that amazing anyway...",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1iwcdy,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1iwcdy/a_reappraisal_of_velvet_underground_squeeze/,

One year ago, I stumbleupon [AcclaimedMusic](http://acclaimedmusic.net/), a website done by a Swedish statistician who compiled all the critics' lists about top albums (and songs).

Even if the website looks quite old, it is still updated, with the top of albums each year, and a twice-a-month megacritic charts, sort of metacritic score but with more critics from all around the world.

&gt;What is this about? This wiki is a catalog of the tricks of the trade for writing fiction.

&gt;Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations. On the whole, tropes are not clichés. The word clichéd means ""stereotyped and trite."" In other words, dull and uninteresting. We are not looking for dull and uninteresting entries. We are here to recognize tropes and play with them, not to make fun of them.

&gt;The wiki is called ""TV Tropes"" because TV is where we started. Over the course of a few years, our scope has crept out to include other media. Tropes transcend television. They reflect life. Since a lot of art, especially the popular arts, do their best to reflect life, tropes are likely to show up everywhere. 

Check out the entry for [blur](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur).  A few excerpts:

&gt;AcCENT Upon the Wrong SylLABle: For instance, Song 2's refrain (it has more lyrics than WOO-HOO) goes ""When I feel heavy meTAL / And I'm pins and needLES"".
&gt;Affectionate Parody: The song ""Song 2"" parodies Grunge.  It was intended to be an affectionate parody of Graham Coxon's favorite band at the time, Pavement. The lyrics might be, the music certainly isn't.
&gt;Call-and-Response Song: ""Parklife"", with the spoken lines done by Phil Daniels.
&gt;Lyrical Dissonance: ""Country House"" is a bright, shiny pop tune about a horribly depressed rich man dealing with the emptiness of his existence.  Many, if not most of their songs have Lyrical Dissonance to some degree. They epitomize the very Britpop tendency of marrying rather melancholy lyrics to bouncy, bubbly pop songs.

**4**) No spamming/domineering the thread by being every single other poster.

**5**) You must rate and review a song for every song you post.

In fact, they often used a lot of the same techniques (i.e. influences from non-European cultures).

They have a very unique, melodic sound. Casey Crescenzo came from The Receiving End of Sirens, which was a post hardcore band. He then broke off and started the Dear Hunter. He pens most of the songs, both musically and lyrically. His melody and harmonies blow my mind, almost Beatlesque, with a unique take on them. He also is very progressive, having a few amount of conceptual albums. My favorite being Act 2: The meaning of, and all things regarding Ms. Leading. Each song has a fair amount production on it, by himself I believe. They are loaded with depth, the first two concept albums dabbled into a theme which is almost like call girls in the 1910s or so, very interesting, I can't quite put my finger on it though, but when you listen you will understand (hopefully!) His lyrics are top notch in my opinion. He has a nice way with words, you can see the influence of Shakespear. I can't be bothered with good formatting right now, as I am quite in the clouds, but I will do my best to chronologically list my top 2 songs of album. 

**ACT 1** 
[the Inquiry of Ms. terri](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1eyqshJlRs)

[City Escape](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1eyqshJlRs)

**ACT 2** - note: this album is a goldmind, the choices are quite tough. He sticks with the same theme, but you can hear the evolution of his song writing becoming more sharp and clean. 

[The Procession](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Boh5vbZyA)

[Blood of the Rose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSQUqLBLpEE)

[Oracles on the Delphi Express](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yABRtv_Qtbg)

[Red Hands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRsQ5_FvZCM) (probably the most popular song of theirs) 

that is just the tip of the iceberg for that album, you can hear the experimenting in those few songs. But the whole album varies in styles, again beatlesque. He tries to touch base in every genre. 

**ACT 3** I must be honest, I was a bit disappointed by this album. But I haven't listened to it in its entirety since it first came out, so this may be an unfair assessment. 

[Mustard Gas - acoustic version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ_dA6xh7Xo) 

[What It Means to be Alone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAtvzImzGY)

again, I am biased towards this one and I deserve to give it my full attention... soon. 

**The Color Spectrum** Sort of self explanatory for the concept, put songs to colors. Some very great songs in here, you can, again, hear them developing into even better musicians. 

[Crow and Cackle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJfLRNK0b0)

[Curse of Cynicism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geV6OkIURoE)

[Shes Always Singing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMjgPTM3KlM)

This album is loaded. So many awesome songs. Yet again, tip of the iceberg here, but you get an idea of it. 

**Migrant** to be released april 2nd!


Thanks for reading if you did, hopefully this will turn you onto these guys, they could use the support. I think they are so unknown because the group the marketed towards when the first were a band, just wouldn't follow them on their path from post-hardcore to progressive. Oh well, hope you enjoy!

This band seems like the perfect band for discussion in this sub-reddit: starting in the Norwegian Black Metal scene, *Ulver* (Norwegian for *Wolves*) started their career on a high note with the release of **Bergtatt – Et eeventyr i 5 capitler**, and followed it up with two releases that drew on co-existing influences from said album, **Kveldssanger** on the folky side and **Nattens madrigal** on the black metal side.

What came next was one of the most profound shifts in musical direction you'll find anywhere; they released and album re-telling all of William Blake's A Marriage of Heaven &amp; Hell, which completely eschewed their original black metal sound in favour of avantgarde and electronic stylings. After this would come, quite possibly, their best known album **Perdition City**, expanding on the style seen on AMOHAH.

Ulver have not only restricted themselves to conventional albums, also being called upon by Norwegian movie writers to write some movie scores and doing an excellent job of doing so. **Lyckantropen Themes** and **Svidd neger** are both great pieces of work.

They have quite the extensive back catalogue which I will not fully get to in the introduction. If you are curious, please do yourself a favour and check the band out. Most of their albums can be found in full on YouTube, and you can check out their entire discography [here](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Ulver/1208).

Much of what I wrote here might be relevant to other Metal genres as well (Black Metal comes to mind), but I'm only familiar with Power Metal well enough to articulate what bugs me about it.  
  
If I tried to apply the limited knowledge I have of Metal culture and map Metal genres according to their connection to outside culture, the outer shell would be populated by Progressive Metal, Post Metal, Rap Metal and several other hybrid genres. A little deeper we'd have classic Heavy Metal as well as Trash, Goth and Glam variations. Power Metal, the genre that my friends consider the gateway into Metal culture, would be situated pretty damn close to the center.  
  
This is the thing that bothers me the most about the genre - the self imposed ghetto in which it has resided ever since Nirvana banished ""True Metal"" from the face of mainstream. Most Power Metal bands seem to be only influenced by previous Power Metal bands, even if they fill their lists of influences with Hard Rock bands and classical composers. This musical incest has resulted in two or three decades in which the scene kept loyal to a small pool of available tools - two or three drum patterns at variable speeds, minor key scales, chord progressions that always start on the tonic chord, europoppy melodies, strings/pads on the keyboards, guitars that only play either power chords or shred solos and dramatic cliche-laden lyrics that avoid sounding too modern. I can think of many musical ideas that could breath fresh air into the genre (mostly revolving around importing methods of creating an ""epic"" atmosphere from other genres, from Rock to Baroque), but as it seems, very few Power Metal bands even consider straying away from the formula, and those who do often fall into a different one.  
  
The lack of communication goes from the other side as well. I don't think I have ever seen a major (not Metal-centered) music publication even acknowledging the existence of Power Metal, much less review it. Even alternative publications that are supposed to be eclectic are shunning it. More importantly, I've never heard of a non-Metal artist being influenced by it. In a world where Rock stars collaborate with rappers, singer-songwriters dabble in EDM and Hip-hop producers sample every genre from early Jazz to video game soundtracks it sure is weird to see a scene that maintains no direct connection with the outside world.  
  
I know that there are many Power Metal fans with eclectic tastes in music; why isn't there eclecticism in Power Metal as well? I understand that Black Metal is isolationist because it has a radical world view behind it. Does Power Metal have an underlying idea as well? Has purging Heavy Metal of all traces of Blues created some modern form of European folk music?",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_10olhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10olhj/whats_the_deal_with_power_metal/,

I've ascertained that this is a popular view amongst musicians.


One band I know that has reacted the strongest in responses to pigeonholing, Liars (one of my favourite bands right now). In 2001, their debut was received well among critics and fans as a pretty nice dance-punk album. This pissed them off so much, they fired their bassist, retired to the woods in New Jersey and wrote one strange, undefinable, dark, murky conceptual noise experiment about witch burning in Salem, which didn't go down well with some people. Here's a difference in their sound from their debut in [2001](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pza75oWGB2c) to the sophomore in [2004](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZs3jsQ7alk). And they continued to completely change their sound with every album, to a point where the only accurate way to describe their music is experimental rock. ([2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAJSlyqnp4), [2007](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hykWss_92iM), [2010](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04domJ7F0oY) and [2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL9jtjJ3zv0)).


And of course, there are bands that don't do that much about it. Bands such as [Mogwai](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3uIwEY27DQ) and [EITS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmO460fy3r8), who've both rejected the term 'post-rock' but continue to put out music that fits that label almost perfectly.


I personally disagree with this whole ""labels are bad"" thing, I think there's nothing wrong with them. So, my questions for you are, do you think that labeling bands as certain genres is stupid/useless/wrong? At what point does it get too far, e.g. using genres such as chillwave, witchhouse, post-trip-hop, etc. I'd love to know what you think.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_zt654,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/zt654/lets_talk_pigeonholing_and_labeling_bands/,

It's getting to the point of ridiculousness.

Let's first look at other genres.  Any one who's read an interview with a band or musician knows that they almost universally hate being pigeon holed into one genre.  That pigeon holing is for the critics.  A musician or artist is all about making the music that they feel they need to make.  I highly doubt any band is worried about staying in the most popular tempo or key of their genre.  If they need to express an idea outside the mainstream opinion I would suggest they do it because that's how music progresses forward.  I doubt dubstep is any different.  A genre where all the artists are making music within the preconceived notions of what that genre is is in my opinion a dead, uninteresting genre.

I think a lot of this criticism is coming from people who don't even listen to the music.  *Oh, dude, this is brostep.  Right now it's so cool and hip to hate on this genre, we should join in.*  I'm not deep into the dubstep scene but I like Skrillex and I like Skream.  I feel that over the years my musical maturity has grow to where I'll listen to a band or genre without all the baggage that people want to throw onto them.

I've been working or volunteering at radio stations for the better part of the last decade.

So, what did he realize that made him break up with her? It sounds not as if he found something wrong with her, but in the whole concept of love itself. Something world shattering enough to end a pretty long solid relationship.

While the lyrics of their early songs are all dealing with love and that can get very repetitive, they accomplish a lot musically. As you get further into The Beatles career the band starts to split apart (they sort of start sounding like they will in their solo careers). In their early days you get to see them as a tight unit with a gift for rhythm, melody and harmony. This is a time when Lennon and McCartney actually did collaborate a lot rather than just their names appearing together in the songwriting credits. I generally prefer mid-period psychedelic Beatles but I have found myself appreciating those early albums (if only because I haven't overplayed those to death). Also it is pretty experimental (for pop music at the time) just in more subtle ways. So I implore people to give early Beatles (and early rock n' roll) another chance. Not everything needs to be concept albums and weird time signatures! The most lauded pop group of all time needs more praise.

Some great songs from the early days:

[What You're Doing] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-75xwiT99Q) This song is amazing!! It has that awesome 12-string guitar riff that The Byrds would end up practically defining their early sound around.

[Any Time at All] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD95QaVTH1U) The intro to this song is fierce. The middle 8 is a bunch noise and piano chords. Great stuff.

[I Feel Fine] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_BjqTrGf2g) Some great guitar playing and harmonizing on this song. Also first instance of recorded feedback. 

[Tell Me Why] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmtaw0fr0xI) I love how loose this song sounds. Also amazing harmonies.

[There's a Place] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHED4QKyqgQ) The harmonica sounds amazing on this track. Also Paul and John sing their hearts out.

Essentially, this essay has its origins in his desire to expound upon [an earlier claim he made](http://starling.rinet.ru/music/creed.htm):

&gt;*Originality* in modern rock is something practically unheard of.

At the risk of being *that* pretentious asshole who scoffs in the general direction of modern music, I'll mention that his claim/essay sort of *tangentially* relates to [an earlier thread I submitted](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1j8pky/perfect_example_of_the_increasing_homogenization/): namely, that popular music becoming less original and more homogenized.

I did find it interesting that Starosin incorporated the historical aspect of ""music revolutions"" happening and then dying out by the gradual reduction of their artistic potentials (i.e. classical music sort of died out as all its possible branches of innovation were exhausted). So, I'd say that I agree with him on a good many points, though not necessarily in a concrete or absolute way.

Our opinions diverge, I think, once Starosin claims that 

&gt;Punk offered nothing new and never wanted to offer anything new - on the other hand, its battlecry was - 'let us get back into the past!' So what's the conclusion? If you think that punk was a liberation movement, don't fool yourselves. The 'punk revolution' was in fact a conservative, throwback counter-revolution - an intentional try to drive the music back, not just to its roots, but to its primitive roots. The claim that 'art needs rejuvenation by returning to its roots' is ridiculous in this context. Punk wasn't a rejuvenation of rock music, it was its archaization

and similar statements about electronic music. Starosin is undoubtedly more fond of and respects prog rock far more as a genre than punk rock. So, naturally, I'll offer a quote by Tommy Ramone in...well, not exactly rebuttal, but something of that nature:

&gt;In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock ‘n’ roll.-Tommy Ramone

So I guess the reason I posted this was to ask a few questions while referencing one of the most knowledgeable people I've come across on the internet when it comes to popular music (or at least probe the music-respecting consciousness of anyone who visits this page):

1. Is Starosin right when he says ""Rock is dead""?
2. Are punk and electronica, as Starosin says, horrible and invalid examples of innovation in popular music?
3. If you can, make an argument for any post-New Wave band that was incredibly inventive, original, etc. (so not *derivative*)
4. Finally, the most frightening question of them all, I think. Is Starosin right when he says at the end that the next ""Beatles"" (""Beatles"" by his definition and understanding of them) will come around and invent something entirely new, possibly not dependent on any bit of popular music since the revolution of the 60s? Will someone come along and be so original that they **blow our minds** with that originality and contribution to music, art, and our livelihood?

To repeat the cliched expression, let's talk music.

&gt;Because unlike a lot of the bigger prog albums (barring the really experimental fare) in the same time frame Effloresce is not simply a nostalgic celebration of King Crimson and Pink Floyd. For once, it merges not only elements from classic prog but also from 90s indie rock (I personally hear quite some Built to Spill in them), post rock and arguably even some metal here and there. There's a certain roughness to it, both in the sound and in the compositions which lack the usual technical show-off aspect while still remaining impressive, detailed and interesting and not afraid of building things up slowly. And it's rather easily accessible while still being layered and complex enough to not become boring quickly. It's basically the album I'd recommend to everyone who (thinks he) doesn't like prog - and to those who do too, of course.

**Summary**

Characterised by their mix of folk rock, sunshine pop, and psychedelia, the Lovin' Spoonful formed in Greenwich Village in 1965, which, at the time, played host to many musicians such as the Mamas and the Papas, the Velvet Underground, Simon and Garfunkel, and Bob Dylan. 

Achieving nine top 20 singles in the US (of those, 7 top 10s, including Summer In The City, which went to no.1 in August 1966) and two top 10 UK singles, the Lovin' Spoonful were at the forefront of the American folk music revival of the mid-1960s with bands like the Mamas and Papas, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and the Byrds. 

However, they were not heavily based in the lyrics of Bob Dylan, as many acts at the time were. Instead, they portrayed a kind of imagery that the Beach Boys were known for using: innocent, child-like, and romantic, differing from the social commentary that Dylan inspired. 

Led by John Sebastian, who wrote most of their songs, the band dissolved after he left in 1968, partly due to a drugs bust that had damaged the band earlier. They can be compared to the Kinks in a way - although they had several hits their time, they were mostly overshadowed by bands like the Byrds, and were never really that popular in the UK. 

Yet they were a catalyst for the segue from folk to psychedelic rock in the US, and were an inspiration for sunshine pop and psychedelic charm in the 1960s.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,1366657970.0,,,True,t3_1cvhet,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1cvhet/lets_talk_the_lovin_spoonful/,

First impression on 3-4 listens: very impressed.  This album has more of a synth rock feel than any of their other releases, which I think works beautifully.  It is musically different enough from their previous albums to be interesting, but they keep enough of their old sound to make the album feel familiar.  

The first few tracks are very upbeat and synth driven, while the last few are more subdued and have more of a melancholy feel about them (while remaining catchy as hell).  

I haven't listened enough to even being to get a grasp on the lyrics (it takes me a long to get the lyrics of songs down), so I can't speak for or against any cheesiness or nonsensical lines. 

I honestly did not have high hopes for this release, especially after hearing the single ""All the time"", which in my opinion is the worst track on the album.

Don't get me wrong, I don't only listen to punk, I like other genres also, but it seems like, say, metal, has had more longevity than punk.

 
Maybe longevity isn't the right word. I mean a lot of youth today still listen to Metallica, but not as many listen to Black Flag. It seems to me that hardcore may have transformed into Warped Tour pop punk metal-core bands which kind of makes me sad. Most of the kids my age who play this kind of music cite bands such as A Day To Remember, Sleeping with Sirens (Sorry if I got the name wrong) and the like. These bands however, don't really have a punk ideology. It seems to be more about ""being cool"" and making money than rebellion. Hell, ADTR even had a music video where they were playing baseball and there were a bunch of ""attractive"" women fawning over them. That video does not seem punk rock in the least, and I highly doubt they were being ironic.

Now there are great punk bands around today like White Lung, Iceage, Titus Andronicus, Basement etc., and punk has had an influence on everything from Slint to My Bloody Valentine (I know these bands aren't recent. just using them as an example)

So I guess my question is, since the hardcore ""scene"" isn't flourishing like it once was, where do you think the spirit and influence went?

After 8 or 9 listens over the past week, I think it's safe to say I'm a little disappointed. Maybe that has more to do with my expectations for it than it does with the actual music, seeing as I was pretty much ready to declare it AOTY before I even heard it, but I still think it's a step backward from *Cosmogramma* and *LA*.

I think the biggest problem for me is that too much of the album seems sort of formless. Throughout the first five or six tracks in particular, I feel like I'm always waiting for something to happen. It seems like a big part of making the type of music Flying Lotus makes is not committing yourself to being either ""just"" a beatmaker or ""just"" a jazz composer. *Cosmogramma* was great because it had the best of both worlds: a lot of really beautiful melodies and a lot of really engaging beats. On the other hand, some of *UtQC* doesn't seem to have either; just a bunch of jazz chords mashed together over beats that don't really go anywhere.

I also don't really like the track sequencing. Songs like ""Sultan's Request"" and ""Putty Boy Strut"" sound really out of place after the relatively reserved first six songs, and ""The Nightcaller"" and ""Only If You Wanna"" sound awkward as well. I just don't feel like the whole album flows very well front-to-back.

Having said that, though, it's still a pretty good album. I really do like that he went for a quieter, more reserved sound, and when it works it's absolutely beautiful. The Erykah Badu and Thom Yorke features were both excellent, and I really love hearing Thundercat play bass. Favorites are probably ""Putty Boy Strut"", the See Thru to U/Until the Quiet Comes/DMT trilogy, and ""me Yesterday//Corded"".

And what factors in causing albums to be considered 'classic' are most important to you?,TheAdoringFan,23,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/sxadx/is_an_albums_long_standing_relevance_or_influence/,"There are many factors in the immortalisation of albums, and chief among these (or at least what a lot of music publications fall back on to use as justification) is relevance - how the album stands up today, in regards to the subject matter and attitudes within, or how fresh sounding they come off as even today. Often cited examples include [The Specials s/t (1980)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials_(album) and [The Clash's London Calling (1979)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_calling#Music). To me these aren't great reasons to decide whether an album is great, as it mainly focuses on the lyrics rather than the music for the most part, and of course the environment/time the album was recorded in. Albums that aren't as remembered as the ones I've previously mentioned are largely forgotten due to the fact that they may not have had any pressing issues to address or speak out against in their music. (I personally think this is most evident in how a great many punk albums are revered more just for being the genre they happen to be than most other albums)

Influence on other artists is a big deal too. Is it okay to take for granted that many artists are influenced by others and that you aren't obligated to listen to or at all enjoy these older artists/albums? Is it for example ridiculous to say Sgt. Pepper's is your all time favourite album and have never heard Pet Sounds or been aware of its influence on Paul McCartney at that time? I think this argument is used too much, in the same way people might argue over 'which is better - British or American music?' you'll have the comparisons between each countries classics, but someone will inevitably make the argument along the lines of 'Your thinking The Rolling Stones are the GOAT is stupid since they wouldn't exist without old American black music'. Some would say this is fair enough and some would say it's irrelevant since The Rolling Stones are better than their original influences; what do you think? In this example I'd be for The Rolling Stones - it should be the quality of the music being judged, not how it came about.

What I'm ultimately getting at here is that I'm in favour of music being judged for what it is, it's actual quality and how enjoyable it is to listen to. (though of course 'quality' is completely subjective) I believe that a lot of what people judge albums on is just echoing what music journalism sites/magazines use as reasoning: how 'important' an album is. (however you could obviously say that they talk about influence and importance since it's their job to take into account all music and its history as a whole) Without having reviewers and journalists tell us what makes an album great, would we make the same arguments? Or would all music be just down to how it sounds and your taste? Do you think music journalism is evil - brainwashing people everywhere? Did Robert Johnson sell his soul to Satan at that crossroad? Is Thom Yorke's hair getting too long? Do you even care?

What I enjoy is that Aesop Rock's lyricism really comes to the fore, whereas I have found that on his previous albums his skill in wordplay can be hidden behind the lush, heavy hip-hop production. Paired with mostly simple guitar, though, I can see new elements to both artists which I wouldn't normally have noticed.

Firstly, I think we should define 'critic' as simply an observer and 'artist' as a creator
Oscar Wilde wrote an essay called 'The Critic as Artist' where he champions the contemplative life to the life of action, defining the critic as the true artist. I, for one, am inclined to agree with him.

Thinking on our relationship with a piece of art, we are effectively the critic. By that definition, anyone that perceives art is a critic, including the artist himself. So, if you create a piece of art, you are more important to it as an observer than a creator.

Additionally, this means that an artist's intention when making an album or song doesn't matter as it is the critic that decides the worth of the art.

In conclusion to my aimless and perhaps pointless musings I would like to ask you guys a few questions:

* Is the critic the true artist, or is it the artist?
* Does, or should, an artist's view of his own art affect the way you perceive art yourself?

I was thinking about what’s in regular rotation on pop radio in my area and Imagine Dragons came to mind; their debut single was “It’s Time”, a mostly handclapped percussion song with a driving mandolin, vocal harmonies and a fair amount of piano. Their follow-up single, “Radioactive” almost sounds like an entirely different band. In fact, if you listen to their record they have a few tracks that borderline on a “world” music sound. It’s a little all over the map.

In a thread about Pulp Fiction fan fiction or something the other day, a spontaneous discussion about country music came up. I was asked to name some new country artists that don't suck. So I put this brief list together, and I'd thought I'd post it here!

These guys are classified as ""folk"" or ""Americana"", but as a southerner who grew up on country, these guys are 100% Outlaw Country. And I am sick of not hearing them on the radio! Anyway, here is the post. Thanks for reading!

""Sure thing! Even if no one else reads, hopefully I can turn you on to some of these younger guys that are bringing back that outlaw sound!

Well, the most obviously place to start is with [Ryan Bingham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bingham). He cut his chops in the southwest, from Texas to Arizona and New Mexico. His writing and singing style are very reminiscent of Steve Earle. Bingham is incredibly country, but with a large mix of southern rock and a dash of Mexican as well. 2009 was a big year for Ryan, as his soundtrack for the film ""Crazy Heart"" was a huge hit, and his single [The Weary Kind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwwkqABItLA) won an Oscar, Grammy, Golden Globe, Las Vegas Film Critic Award, and the World Soundtrack award. The film/songs success, combined with his outstanding sophomore effort on ""Roadhouse Sun"" which also came out in 2009, the Americana Music Association awarded him their ""Artist of the Year"" Award. Ryan's newest album dropped this year, and is fairly heavier than his previous three albums. His single [""Guess Who's Knocking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH6sOJwwAgY) premiered on RollingStone.com this year. Here's a couple links to get you acquainted with him. 

[Southside of Heaven - 2007](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHnSj9Ls6pU) 
[Bread and Water - 2008](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoFwQnHFeYM)
[Country Roads - 2009](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbsBg_0lgmI)

Next on the list would be [Hayes Carll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_Carll). Texan born but now an Expat living in Arkansas(AKA God's Country), Hayes cut his chops all over the mid-south, in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. (Side Note: Apparently Garrett Hedlund covered one of Hayes' songs in ""Country Strong"", which I never saw. I just looked that shit up. Oh God. Awful.) Anyway, Hayes takes his influences directly from the likes of Bob Dylan or Willie Nelson. Vocals are not his strong points. His writing and delivery is where he shines. Funny when he wants to be, and depressing the rest of the time, Hayes' sophomore album ""KMAG YOYO"" was included on ""American Songwriter"", ""Spin"", and ""Rolling Stone"" top 50 albums of the year, and his single [Another Like You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnt-drXsiU) won the Americana Music Association song of the year. It's also one of the funniest damn songs I've ever heard. It's a story of a liberal good-ol-boy and a sandy-vag'd GOP hard nose getting drunk, talking shit, and hooking up. The title track, ""KMAG YOYO"" is a military acronym meaning ""Kiss my ass guys, you're on your own"" and is the story of a confused young patriot who joins the military for the wrong reasons and his life goes to shit. Hayes only has two official videos, but I'll link some of my favorite youtube clips.

[One Bed, Two Girls, Three Bottles of Wine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXS9WGYptM0)

Another great band to dive into would be the Drive By Truckers. Comprised of guys from Alabama/Florida, they have been pretty eclectic in their sound. It's hard to label them as anything other than ""Alternative Country"".

Yo La Tengo's [I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Hear_the_Heart_Beating_as_One) is a perfect album in my opinion.

I asked him what he thought of Hans Zimmer, and this is what he had to say (I apologize for the blockiness, but I wanted to post it as he did in the original):

""I'll preface my answer thus. Musicians tend to have very strong feelings either extolling or decrying the abilities/work/effort/etc of film music composers, and there's a long history of these polemics - including from the Old Guard of film composing (Herrmann, North, Copland, even) who weren't impressed with the younger generations. Often these discussions or accusations (take your pick) revolved around which film composer pilfered from whom, which film composer has no technical fluency on their own, and a trying to disentangle and define and/or justify spate of highly subjective measures (what exactly makes a string section's swell at the acme of a romance flick ""sappy""?) What a lot of these arguments focus on, of course, is the music qua music, music qua art - not necessarily music as a functional element in film (which many hard-edged musicians, myself included, are loathe to accept that our art form can be relegated to a tier of less importance). To that end, anymore when people ask me about film composers, I have to approach my answers ecumenically and holistically.

Zimmer is a master at capitalizing upon the function of music within a film. (Not always, obviously, but we collectively love Beethoven 5 more than Beethoven 8.) What I mean by that is that there is filmic-sonic (or audio-visual) relationship in the abstract that always seems to work, and this is for two very different reasons. The first reason is because he has built upon generations of film composers who (again, North, Herrmann, Bernstein (both of them), Rota, and others) established the common filmic-sonic tropes: the eruption of dramatic/pyschological/​sexual tension should be (as it already is in common-practice and some contemporary music) a vast growth with a moment of high resolution and finality, a primal yawp born out of a crescendo of primal grunts; or fear and terror should be exhibited by strange orchestrations or effects the average listener won't recognize or understand. (Look at it this way - find a recording of a Lydian mode on the internet, and then think about any kids' movie or comedy and/or sunshine/dogs/youth/​puppies/energy - those pitches are always used, it seems) In a sense, the Western ear/eye has become accustomed to these techniques and tropes (think of the Psycho ""Shower Scene"") and consciously or not the average viewer has a clear idea of what is supposed to happen when in the realm of the senses. Zimmer is very well tapped into this tradition, for good or ill, and this leads the second reason - his techniques. He doesn't have a very rich vocabulary, musically - but for what he's doing, and how he's connected with the visual, he doesn't have to have an extensive palette, despite my intellectual problems with him not having one. Inception, for instance, is a very ""vertical"" film - there is a lot of harsh angularity in the visual, and the film is very ""dark"" (in both levels of meaning to an average audience: content as well as color scheme); so, we have the Big Chords that float over the top of a chord progression, typically all minor keys and very few major chords. A standard rhetorical technique of Zimmer's is to evade a functional dominant chord - implication that there is no resolution, despite returning to the same home key over and over in these chord progressions. ""Thin Red Line"" was an expansive film, and the score needed to function in this constrained expansiveness, and the same sorts of techniques were used in two very different films. The jury is still out (and may never reconvene) on whether a film composer should have a personal voice or whether they should treat each film anew, but in Zimmer's case, we still get his imprint. Thin Red Line and Inception are two very, very different films, yet we can boil him down to two, maybe three, standard techniques: 1) the slowly-building crescendo, adding in layers of texture and color before the Holy Moment, which then recedes just as slowly or just disappears; 2) closely-spaced chords in strings, which creates a blend and richness that quickly suggests stasis, which easily allows Zimmer to put anything on top of it ""shock"" (i.e., from my perspective, very lazy orchestration); maybe-3) rhythmic regularity to the point of being thankful when there's some sort of change, which also emphasizes the textural/orchestrational/​dynamic growth (instead of complementing it).

Again, consider the film as an always-visual-first experience. Music is there to assist; it is functional, perhaps ritualistic since we can't get away from it in film and keep repeating these same tropes and approaches. But there are already plenty of conscious and semi-conscious streams of information in film that extradiegetic (or nondiegetic) music - the stuff the orchestra is playing that actually isn't IN the movie (i.e., nothing from radios or persons or machines in the actual frame) - is at a disadvantage and cannot compete (there are exceptions where it becomes the central narrator, though) because the audience will revolt. John Williams writes anthemic scores, memorable scores, but they're always subservient to everything else. And even he has only two or three tricks he uses consistently.

What Zimmer does is continue to use these techniques in very proper ways - but he has found the ability to balance between the intangibles. 

This all said, his music could not, in my view, hold up under scrutiny from either an academic or a lay audience member if it were performed in a concert hall. The music on its own does not convey enough maturity or growth or complexity to warrant maintaining someone's attention. Yes, his music is not ""designed"" with that in mind, but this would be the case if the score for Inception were to be performed live at Carnegie Hall. People would revolt and walk out, because they're bored. The cognoscenti would point toward pieces by Penderecki (Anaklasis and De Natura Sonoris I/II)* when the giant, relatively-discordant chords sounded; they would point toward Barber's ""Music for a Scene from Shelley"" and Gorecki's Third Symphony (First movement) whenever Zimmer pulls out the slow-build guns. And, yes, there are archetypes in music, as there are in literature and visual arts, but there's enough artifice in good works of art to put intellectual distance between the artwork and the observer, to maintain our attention; a good composer will develop and rework and find many points of departure for new material in their work; film music, almost by definition for its functional nature, cannot do this. Imagine a straightforward rom-com with Wagner's Lohengrin underneath it, or a family comedy using Ligeti's Requiem (I suggest you look up all these pieces). It can't work, it won't work. Zimmer's music belongs in films; I've never heard anything of his for the concert stage, and I can't presume to know what it would be like, but if his imprints in technique remain from film to film, I can't imagine they wouldn't transfer to his other work.

A last note, and this one is about minimalism: it's difficult for me to reconcile the principle goals of minimalism (slow evolution and change in the music; subtle shifts in patter; slow growth - see Glass: Akhnaten; Glass: Glassworks; Riley: In C) with that of what Zimmer does in film music. Intellectually and aesthetically, the premise is the same, but the execution in minimalist composers is so vastly different... For instance, Philip Glass composed the scores for Kundun, The Truman Show, and The Hours, and his music works very well in film - but his concert music is different enough in purely technical ways that I rarely find it boring.

*Parenthesis/footnote: the entire 1950s/1960s avant-garde became a feeding frenzy for composers from about 1980 onward. Early works of Kancheli, Denisov, Schnittke, Penderecki, Lutoslawski, Ligeti, and many an Eastern European were freely scavenged for technical things by later-generation film composers. For a concise quasi-history of the ""romantic"" and rhapsodic and dramatic in films, Frederick Delius, Ralph Vaughan-Williams, and Gustav Holst come to mind for ""inspiration"" for many a film scorer.

Wild Honey doesn't sound like a typical Beach Boys album: It was recorded and released a little after their psychedelic famous period, but it really is one of their best, (Robert Christgau calls it ""perfect and full of pleasure; it does what it sets out to do almost without a bad second""). The overall tone of the album is light and whimsy: All the way through, the lyrics are undeep and unliterary, and this helps the Beach Boys put across a deliberate carefree feeling in the music.

Aren't you Glad epitomizes the carefreeness and whimsicality in the album. The beach boys have deliberately used many musical devices to achieve this, so here's a list of them.

* The rhythms are simple: The piano plays chords repetetively on every beat through the verses, and when the piano cuts out in the choruses, the bass plays on every beat instead. This lends to the deliberate, simple sound of the song

* Also, Simple drumming: The drums themselves play the backbeat and nothing else. There is a rhythmic fill between the verses and the choruses, but these are done with handclaps and fingerclicks, which again lends to the light feel

* The fills between the chorus and the second verse is vocal

* There's very little 'filler' sound. The more active songs on the album have maraccas and tambourines and organs and strummed guitars for adding sound without adding too much extra rhythm. Aren't you Glad has almost none, 

* The singing is light and soft, but its volume is high -- the vocals sound just as loud as in the tracks before and after it in the album, but they were sung much quieter. The result of this is that the singing throug the verses sounds very personal, and also sincere. Soft singing as a method for achieving sincerity contrasts very strongly and successfully with the karaoke-histrionics idea of 'If I shout it louder then I mean it more' taken by songs like My Heart Will Go on by Celine Dion and Whitney Houston's recording of I Will ALways Love you.

* There's not much harmony singing.The verses are sung in solo, which again leads to a feeling of sincerity 

* Similarly, the choruses don't build all that much: There is a definite jump up in activity, and some brass appears and the voices get louder, but it's not a huge departure from the tone of the verses.

* The choruses are also quite short, which gives the softer verses more prominence.

* There are a few parts which directly lend to the whimsy nature of the song (and the whole album). My favourite is that when the vocals sing ""I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you"", the drums actually beat out a heartbeat. I sort of imagine it as if the singer removes his heart from his chest and holds it out, still beating, because he's so so innocent that he might actually do that

* The song is very short, which as well as being an easy way to make sure the song doesn't get stale,  also helps make it sound much lighter",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1ka4yc,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1ka4yc/picking_out_the_musical_devices_in_a_song_arent/,

Younger listeners and older listeners who have been listening to contemporary music over the ages are used to that distorted guitar sound and can make sense out of it (I had a difficult time trying to learn Chop Suey by ear). For some reason, today I thought that the sound of a distorted guitar by itself, when heard for the first time, can be a very cacophonous noise. 

I play the guitar myself, so I got used to how a guitar sounds so I think I got used to the distorted sound that way. I started from acoustic, then my tutor transitioned me to electric without any effects, then he showed me each effect one-by-one. That's how I learned what that distorted sound should be in terms of clean acoustic-guitar pitch. But even then, the rapid successions of downstrokes of a drop-D or lower power chord were hard to make sense of, and it required a lot of listening and playing along to really ""hear"" what notes were being played.

Now I find beauty in that distorted noise. Yesterday while I was driving home I blasted some Nirvana (In Utero's anniversary edition coming soon), Between The Buried And Me, and Deafheaven. Then I thought *man, I can't even imagining listening to this with my parents.* If you currently enjoy distorted guitar sounds, how did you get into that thick and dirty roars of a mean guitar?",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1js035,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1js035/lets_talk_how_did_you_get_into_distorted_guitar/,

With Japan being one of the largest, if not the, music audiences in the world, and with the up and down trends of interest in Japan in the West, I think J-Pop is something that's interesting to look at. While no particular artist has achieved the worldwide popularity of PSY in K-Pop, J-Pop in general has been something that I've noticed having a larger presence in the West.

In particular, artists such as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu have definitely been reaching considerable fan bases. For those who may be more versed in J-Pop, what are your thoughts of J-Pop as a regional musical phenomenon?

Another interesting consideration that has come to mind is the audience of J-Pop in the West. While exposure to most people have been limited to anime fans who listen to anime openings, I've noticed the audience of J-Pop in general to range from the extremes of teenage females to older males. I myself notice there to be an interesting crossover between fans of metal and heavier music genres and J-Pop, myself included.

I am still at a bit of a 'greatest hits' stage of it though, just listening to the most famous bits of Bach/Mozart etc. I often feel as if for classical music to get to me, it has to stir those same rock n roll instincts of mine that are touched by guitar music. i.e it has to be hard and loud, or it has to have psychedelic, trippy elements that appeal to me when I am stoned.

I recently wrote a post on my music blog about the music in ""Johnny Suede"" (http://www.hotwaxbeats.com/2012/11/cool-headed-greasers.html), and in particular I commented on two songs from the movie: ""Hotel loneliness"" by Link Wray, and Nick Cave's performance of ""Mama's Boy.""

I personally find a lot of The Smith's music to be quite enjoyable, particularly their last two albums. They do incorporate good melody with interesting lyrics, and Morrissey's voice really suits the music that they produce. But I also feel that they do lack some of the versatility of other acts (Even when they tried to get a little bombastic in Strangeways, it was all very similar to their usual brooding), and some songs like Frankly Mr. Shankly can seem a bit cliched after looking at the indie community that followed it",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_10nn5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/10nn5f/lets_talk_the_smiths/,

I'm usually at being able to tell what genre music belongs after I've had a fair amount of exposure to bands in that category but I've never really been able to peg down what makes a band 'space rock'.  
  
Maybe the problem is that I just haven't had a large enough sample size? Bands that I have heard referred to as space rock include:  

[Hawkwind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFKhj5UUfJs) (Don't know much about them, supposedly helped define the genre)
[Spacemen 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2CK48l4GM) (Probably the archetypal space rock band)  
[Spiritualized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddptzaMXKgc) (Formed by Jason Pierce after Spacemen 3)  
[Hum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfbn3ieVUYU) (Hard to categorize, it would probably fall under the broad category of 'alternative rock' and maybe post-hardcore, but I have also heard the term space rock)  
[The Verve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtS_KMsSoDo) (Mostly just their first album)  
and some other really random ones like 30 Seconds to Mars and Angels and Airwaves.  
  
I just can't figure out how to tie all these bands together. Some of them seem to kind of straddle that space between psychedelic rock and post-rock, but then the earlier ones are a lot closer to prog rock more than anything else and then there's the last two examples I gave. It doesn't really seem like a band can be 'just space rock' (well, you know, as much as any band can be just one genre). Most of the time it seems like an afterthought that critics have like, 'oh, yeah and I guess you could call this space rock if you wanted to'. So, what does it take to be called space rock? Do you just need to reference space-related things in your songs and that's it?

You can judge a piece of music objectively. You can judge it based on the skill, the originality and such. You might like some songs more than others, like I won't tell you a song by Andrew Jackson Jihad is better than a song by Dream Theater, but I still prefer it. 

In my opinion, if a band manages to do something new, and are all able to play their instruments, I find the music objectively good. Streetlight Manifesto for example. I don't think you can deny that the music is good. You might not like, but you should at least appreciate it. 

How do you feel about this?

EDIT: I've come to realize that whether a song is objectively better than another does not matter at all. There is no point in being objectively better (unless that is something you subjectively care about, like having a really complex song, because you want to write and because you like complex music). 

And I definitely do think there are a few objective criteria in music.

Originality: Has it been done before? I think this one might be the only one that actually matters...

Complexity of the song: How it all fits together. This one isn't really relevant. You either like it or you don't, so you're giving an subjective opinion about it. 

Skill of playing the instrument: Even here there's room for debate whether something is actually harder to play, because for some people playing a simple ska rhytm is a lot harder than playing tone ladders (both on guitar). 

And even then, which one matters more is entirely subjective.

I guess there is more room for discussion in this topic, but I don't think much more can be said. 

EDIT 2: My question has worded quite poorly. It would leave out all subjective opinion. So as soon as you start talking about subjectivity, it wouldn't answer the question anymore. It merely asks whether there objective criteria in music. I have given 3 examples of criteria that I find objective. We could discuss whether they are actually objective or not. 

Such as originality. Can you say this does not make a song objectively better? Let's say there is a song that is really original. Never been done before. You can't say it's subjectively bad because it's all a matter of taste, but you could say, it's better objectively, as this has never been done, unlike *insert unoriginal song*.

what say you? I agree to some extent: I think a lot of Flaming Lips' post-Embryonic work has largely been of the ""just fucking around"" type that holds no interest to me. The Dark Side of the Moon remake was just kind of pointless, I didn't bother with the 6 or 24-hour long songs, and some of Heady Fwends just kind of feels like it exists solely as an Idea (i.e. ""Flaming Lips team-up with Crappy musicians like Ke$ha. That's the joke."") rather than an actual collaborative effort.

That said, I disagree with the author's view on a couple things:

* I think Embryonic is a transitional album, but an otherwise consistently interesting one that surprisingly works fairly well for its length. 

* Outside of the Ke$ha collaboration, I think Heady Fwends works a lot better than I would've thought; with the Erykha Badu tracks being one of the highlights (to the point where the 2 tracks after her track are pretty unremarkable. Though the digital version has a different track at the end.) I'm also pretty sure that most of the songs were written before any of the guests added their contributions.

* I can understand being let down by the spectacle of the Flaming Lips live shows, especially since they've been doing a fairly identical schtick for going on a decade now, but I enjoyed them when I saw them back in 2009. I think the only thing I disliked was that it contained some of the most obnoxious concert-goers.

So though I'm ambivalent about some of their fucking around, I'm still looking forward to whatever new album comes out.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_v6bo7,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/v6bo7/falling_out_of_love_with_the_flaming_lips/,

MUSIC CONSUMPTION QUESTIONNAIRE

1. Age         Gender      Nationality 		  Occupation



2. What town or city do you reside in?



3. How do you usually acquire music:  legal download
                                                     Illegal download
                                                     Online purchase
					             Retail outlet


4. Do you think owning music physically (i.e CD, Vinyl, Tape) is more satisfying than a digital music collection?



5. Do you buy vinyl and, if so, would you say for how long and why you buy vinyl?



6. Do you think the easy access of digital downloads has affected or changed your relationship with the artists producing the music? 



7. I am interested in exploring the idea that the ease of digital downloads has driven the recent resurgence in vinyl sales as fans and listeners desire a more authentic connection and identification with the artists they are listening to. Do you have any thoughts or ideas on this topic?  Would you take the time to outline your thoughts/ideas below? Thank you.

Atoms For Peace is the group that formed after Thom Yorke's solo tour for The Eraser. Thom, Flea, Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker, and Mauro Refosco. I've only ever seen videos of them preform on youtube and heard [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxWBd840E9g) single, but it all seems so promising. The energy between Flea and Thom live is definitely very interesting because that kind of musical communication doesn't really happen with Radiohead. Radiohead is more deliberate and planned out and it seems like 5 musicians playing what they've worked hard to achieve. While Flea's playing in AfP is absolutely more deliberate than his playing in the Chili Peppers, he always brings that vibe of spontaneity to the stage and watching Thom interact with that with his guitar is very interesting and while Default doesn't quite bring that relationship to life it's probably the thing I'm looking forward to the most in listening to that album. Also, hey, new Thom Yorke related material.

Bosnian Rainbows is the other release I'm mega pumped about. Most haven't heard of the band by name because it would be their first release, but I'm sure you've all heard of the band leader and key songwriter - Omar Rodriguez Lopez. The Mars Volta seems to kind of be dissolving and Cedric is doing his own solo album and Omar has been given time to sort of do what he does. His previous solo albums featured a bunch of dudes from the Volta family but the projects were - in his words - a ""dictatorship"" as all of the songs were written by him exclusively. This new group, featuring TMV drummer Deantoni Parks and Le Butcherettes singer Teri Gender Bender as well as synth player Nicci Kasper, is Omar's primary project at the moment and is employing a more ""democratic"" system. Omar has never really had a creative partner that he wrote with excluding Cedric and even then Cedric only wrote vocal melodies and lyrics, so this is really exciting for long time fans like me. I recently had the fortune of seeing Bosnian Rainbows live, as they are currently touring their material before recording the album and releasing it early 2013, and the songs were noticeably different than solo ORL songs.

Literally, it is just a temporal distinction. It would be just as accurate to say post-big-band or post-classical in describing what it comes after. So, that can't be it.

The rock in post-rock has to be indicative. Is this supposed to be a descendent of rock at the same time as being not rock?

Maybe if I listen to half a dozen more songs I'll start to figure it out. The first one I listened to... I could hear a lot of influences in it. It sounded like a blend of the lyrical and pop sensibilities of the 80s mixed with the sounds and build of latter-day rock artists like Tool.

Unwittingly, I probably made this as easy as possible since I've been backing all my CDs up as MP3s since 2004. So that much was easy, but nowadays there's a lot of music that never finds its way to physical media.

As I've eased into it I've found that it can be nice actually. I've started buying digital rather than importing obscure albums from Europe from bands I love. Quicker and cheaper! And of course there's the obvious added bonuses of it being easy to sample music now.

But here's the thing that kills me. As open and accessible as music is theoretically, I'm amazed how often it's not. Today I reminded myself there was an album that came out a few months ago from a band I liked, but I hadn't heard a lick of it. Their last album was a change in sound, and I was a bit skeptical, but their old stuff was great so maybe that was a diversion. Then I remembered why: album available on iTunes.

I hate iTunes. I don't like their use of non-standard formats. I don't like Apple, I don't like the bloated iTunes software. When I ditched my iphone ~2 years ago (I actually thought the iPhone was pretty nice, but Android was more flexible) I couldn't wait to uninstall that program from my computer.

You may not share my opinion, but the core of what bothers me here is lack of options. Selling exclusively on iTunes is akin to only releasing your album at Best Buy and not even checking with your local record stores. Furthermore, iTunes (and Spotify for that matter) requires software/service to access the music. Why sell your music behind a software wall? I realize that as the largest music marketplace it seems necessary or could help with exposure, but I thought the idea of free music these days was the simplicity of access? Now there's one more step and it's further removed from the general web where we do everything.

To me the ideal is simple merchant service. I love Bandcamp personally. I love its simplicity and its plethora of format options when I buy music. And recently they've been rolling out a beta ""social"" feature that lets me keep up with bands I purchased. But even that feature is so simple, and I could still use Bandcamp as I used to without it. CDBaby is another simple merchant: see the page, buy the music, download the music. Amazon is close, but you do have to install their downloader. And of course, if a band can self-release their digital content, I think that's great. They could likely stand to even drop a buck from the total album price since nobody else is taking a cut, making their own solution more competative while remaining lucrative.

Does this bother anyone else? I realize there's some comfort into consolidating into one service for the sake of backup (a big reason to use Steam for games). Is there a better solution? I realize this may boil down to a ""DAE thread"" (I hope not) but it's a complaint I rarely see.",,False,self,t5_2t4it,False,,,True,t3_1504iz,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1504iz/digital_distribution/,

I have been moderating this sub quite strictly insofar as deleting any posts that are obviously going to lead to one line answers as opposed to actual discussions. 

A post that had escaped my notice, meanwhile, has had a very popular response and is exactly the kind of thing I am inclined to delete. 

The opportunity to draw up lists of stuff and name your favourite band and song exists all over Reddit so I don't think this is needed here. 

My idea is to keep pruning so that we encourage posts that create discussions. 

However, is the will of the people against LTM's raison d'etre? 

Please consider the following: 

1. Should I remove the covers post despite it being very popular with yer masses? 

2. Should I let it stay and then, for the sake of fairness, stop removing these sorts of posts in the future?

3. Should I allow the covers post to remain but continue with strict moderation in the future (I might be interested in an additional mod or two since the others don't seem to be doing much)? 

4. Should I stop moderating altogether and allow LTM to go to the dogs?

1) Stop leaks before the album is released. Tighter security in the studio, at manufacturing plants, all the way through to retail. This may help to increase both digital and physical sales of an album.

2) Promote physical CD sales by making them cheaper than iTunes. A lot of people still buy music legally in MP3 form. If it's cheaper to own the physical CD, more people will step away from their computers to go out and purchase it for less.

3) On the same note as #2, offer bonus tracks (exclusives) only on the physical CDs. This was done for a little while, but has more or less faded. Now what I'm seeing in record stores is a ten track album for $12.99, and a ten track album with 3 or 4 bonus tracks for $9.99. You do the math.

These tips may all be fruitless because of the rampage of broadband internet and downloading copyrighted music illegally. What do you guys think? And if there are no tips to save the music industry as is, what is their next step for the future? How do they adapt?

Edit: Perhaps music industry is a little broad. Record is a better word. Also, I'd like to note that singles sales do not make the record labels as much money as physical album sales, and while they do get a good portion of the $1.29 per new single on iTunes, they're still struggling.

But I've never really sat down and thought about or discussed his music with people - mainly because most people my age either don't know who he is or just outright refuse to listen to him. I have no idea what his merits are as an actual musician. And though I relate to and respond emotionally to a lot of his lyrics, I do not have the background in poetry or lyrics to truly analyze his work in any capacity outside of understanding the symbolism and intended message.

Alice In Chains is a hard rock/metal band that sounds closer to Iron Maiden than Nirvana. Lots of vocal harmonizing, more guitar solos, and palm muting! Can you imagine Kurt Cobain palm muting?!

Soundgarden is somewhere in between. Incredible paint peeling singing, more long songs, great guitar playing.

What do these bands have at all in common with Nirvana's sound? Nevermind is a brilliant album of noise, emotion, screaming, tight emotive drums, and simple song structures and playing. Like punk with a better rhythm section. Closer to the Clash or Sex Pistols than their aforementioned Pacific hailing brethren. It kicked the music industry in the gut and was something *fresh*. However I don't think the other ""grunge"" bands of this period had anything musically in common with them except that they were also from Seattle.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I forgot to make the point that in my opinion without Butch Vig producing and Dave Grohl on drums, Nirvana would've been just another rock/punk band.

So I pick...

Elvis. He wasn't the first but he was the first Rock Star. His hips turned teens away from their parents. He was one of the first to take black music and add country music to add that sound we all know as rock. He is also the first rock star to make a come back tour. He is the King.

Chuck Berry. If Elvis is the king, Mr. Berry is the wizard. Chuck's fast, stinging guitar riffs gave birth to guitar legends like Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Angus Young, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, John Frusciante and every Metal, Punk, Post-Punk, and so many more guitarist that came after him. He laid down the riffs that are still being played today. His showmanship is what all ax men crave to be. He is the master of the masters. 

Bob Dylan. If Shakespeare is the bard of the English language, then Dylan is the bard of Folk/Rock music. His words has brought thought to Rock-n-Roll. It's was no longer I'm nothing but a hound dog or a car, cute girl but something like real news blowing in the wind. He added meaning to what parents thought of bubble gum sound.

I want to talk about something that's been on my mind lately. In probably every city there is a local music 'scene' of sorts, which inclues any number of genres but all made by people who live in the city. Often I'll hear people saying 'Support local music!' 'Support the scene!' and honestly, it's stuff like this I can't stand. 

With the rise of the internet I think that statements like these are completely phony. From what I've observed, people who say these things are often people who just want more people to come out and spend money at the door so the promoter and his buddies can get more cash to buy booze or whatever. Why should I support an artist/DJ based solely on the fact that we live in the same city? Maybe perhaps in hopes that they will support me back, but really I feel like that is useless support. To me, it's like government funding. I think it's counter-productive, at least in terms of great music.

I feel that attitudes like this are small minded... it blows my mind to think how many people are making this very second and anything I think of is probably unoriginal makes me even less sympathetic to these views.

I support music based on if it's good or not. When I play out, I don't want my friends to come to my shows just because they're my friends, I want them to actually like the music.

I like the LTM community and want to hear what you guys have to offer. Post a track, along with a link and maybe a little spiel about why it makes you feel good.

My contribution to the thread on r/music was [Sugarcube by Yo La Tengo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mri0HppCRH8), a song that puts me in such a good mood ever since I started listening to it contantly a few weeks ago. It never fails to put a smile on my face. I think the song is about commitment in a relationship and he's just singing about how he's willing to give whatever it takes to makes to make his partner happy. He sings so earnestly and his enthusiasm and optimism is so infectious. Plus the pleasant noisy guitar and keyboard just make the song for me.

Another song I couldn't not upvote is [Len - Steal My Sunshine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1fzJ_AYajA). I just love hearing that song so much. I was at a great party the other night and it came on while everyone was dancing like mad and put such a smile on my face.

Stephin Merritt composes very simple melodies and writes really stripped down, to the point lyrics and yet the musical outcome is so emotional and more importantly it doesn't get old.
[The Magnetic Fields - All My Little Words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8vW_0H_Kg)

It more and more seems to me like bands that choose the polar opposite approach to rock music, despite their intentions to be memorable and unique, fall short in timelessness.

[The Mars Volta - Roulette Dares](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKUl_bO4QA)

These types of songs are no doubt very impressive and perhaps even more emotional than simple folk songs, but it's lack of an objective meaning, lack of compositional restraint, lack of minimalism just doesn't do it for me.

It's like if I had to choose between an overcooked but ambitious **bone-marrow coated poached duck liver over some pig-blood thai noodles** and a **perfectly fried chicken with corn salsa**. Sure I'd go for the duck liver with amusement once in a while, but every other day I'd go for the chicken and lick that plate dry.

Which could bring us to another point of the handful of bands that have achieved a perfect balance, like Pink Floyd - I mean, who doesn't like Pink Floyd? This may sound like an ignorant comment at first, but seriously, think about it, who doesn't like Pink Floyd? I think they are so great because they are incredible musicians who know every second of sound matters, who know less could be more, and more could also be more, both in moderation.

I originally started this as a complaint about how laughably easy it was to remix a pop country song so that it was transformed into a pop R&amp;B song, but now the conversation has backtracked into a more fundamental one; that being scrutinizing recent popular music as a whole.

Catchy, formulated, and now completely ambiguous as far as genre is concerned. On one hand, I commend Florida Georgia Line for being able to create a country song that is two instrument changes away from being pop R&amp;B, but it's still kind of ridiculous.

EDIT: Thought [this article](http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120726/srep00521/full/srep00521.html) would be relevant as well. Talks about trends in music loudness, harmonic variety, etc. Just kind of an add-on.

EDIT #2: /u/Capn_Mission has asked that I give a tl;dr for the article (I will admit that it is very mathematically involving). I do not have the attention span or mathematical/scientific prowess to confirm the following summary as all-encompassing for the article, but I think it provides the gist of what the article was trying to say.

&gt;By exploiting tools and concepts from statistical physics and complex networks, we unveil a number of statistical patterns and metrics characterizing the general usage of pitch, timbre, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics remain consistently stable for a period of more than 50 years, which points towards a great degree of conventionalism in the creation and production of this type of music. Yet, we find three important trends in the evolution of musical discourse: the restriction of pitch sequences (with metrics showing less variety in pitch progressions), the homogenization of the timbral palette (with frequent timbres becoming more frequent), and growing average loudness levels (threatening a dynamic richness that has been conserved until today).

So, the ""homogenization"" has three parts being studied:

1. Less variety in pitch progressions. That means more simple G-C-Em-D-G-C-Em-D progressions and so on. Less variety in chord structure, and chords that are more or less simple triads. And yes, I realize a lot of older, great tunes did not have a whole lot of variety in the chords at the foundation of the music (hell, [""Heroin""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffr0opfm6I4) only has ~2~ chords), but this study does not only count pure chords, but the chords created by *every single instrument in the entire arrangement*. Try notating John Cale's excursions on the electric viola in ""Heroin"" if you dare...

2. As /u/Capn_Mission said, electronic music/synths/etc have opened up the music palette. That being said, people getting a hold of these (digital) synths have also closed it in a way. The second part of this study refers to the *timbre* of sounds being studied. What makes the same *single* note on an oboe and clarinet sound different from each other is *timbre*. Music is made up of different *overtones* on top of the foundational pitch (the one we recognize as the ""true"" pitch by hearing it or using a tuner or whatever to figure out the ""pitch"" of the note) that *color* the sound and make it distinguishable from one instrument/voice/synthesized sound to the next. What this study argues is that timbres that are *frequently* used are becoming **more frequent**, and novel timbres are being used less and less in favor of ""Generic electric drum pad #1"" or ""Generic space/dance noise #2"" etc.

3. Lastly, this article investigates with data (that once again, I'll admit, I don't entirely understand) the [*loudness war*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war) that much ink/keystrokes have been devoted to debating. Essentially, the article argues that because the (all things made equal) loudness of a mixed song is gradually increasing (industry technique to make music more ""exciting), we have less of a potential for dynamic range in music. So, if a song at any specific point can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (played out of the same CD player, speakers, headphones, whatever floats your boat, as long as the input is *the same* comparing different songs), then the trend has shifted to where the *lowest* possible volume of these newer songs is a 7, say, as opposed to a 3. And if 10 is the highest we will ever go (there is a limit, believe it or not), then the new song will only ever attain a dynamic range of 3 (10-7) rather than the old, which if it reached 10 at some point, would have a dynamic range of 7 (10-3). 

I think we can all agree that popular music has always been somewhat ""formulated"" and crafted as a response by record companies and artists to make the most money off of the ""lowest common denominator"" of music that will be accepted by everyone. And if I called everything before 2000 or some arbitrary year ""groundbreaking"" or whatever before it ""all went downhill"", then I would be lying. Even the Beatles, who are virtually unparalleled in influencing modern popular music, had a few compositions lacking in complex chord structure and lyrical depth.

**That being said**, it is my humble opinion (and I possibly have not been familiarized with enough underground music to defend this opinion) that the *modern popular music* of today (sentence continued later; sorry) (""popular music defined from Wikipedia): 
&gt;Popular music belongs to any of a number of musical genres ""having wide appeal"" and is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional music, which are typically disseminated academically or orally to smaller, local audiences. The original application of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. **Although popular music sometimes is known as ""pop music,"" the two terms are not interchangeable**. Popular music is a generic term for music of all ages that appeals to popular tastes, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre

has become less diverse and original than it was *before* (having always been controlled by the least common denominator and record companies) because of a combination of a few things: larger record companies with more control and less competition, a shifting of focus even further away from art and more towards industry than ever before, and a public that is too ill-informed to appreciate and desire something with more *substance* (yes, I know this is a **very** subjective term).",,False,self,t5_2t4it,1375118194.0,,,True,t3_1j8pky,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1j8pky/perfect_example_of_the_increasing_homogenization/,

I have a ton of respect for Static if this really is the case (for example, Timbaland makes a couple of songs, Aaliyah chooses the ones she likes best, says to Static what the song makes her feel or what she wants to say on that song, and he comes up with a lyric)

Sometimes I did not truly understand the feeling until I was older, other times it is the first time I took time to think about the lyric.

Some notable examples would be songs like Heart Shaped Box by Nirvana, which is about Courtney Love's vagina. I first heard the song when I was 9 or 10, and never really thought about the lyrics until a few years ago, and I heard the song on the radio, and I hear the lyric  ""Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back"", and suddenly everything just clicks. 

Other cases are things like the double meaning of October Leaves by The Good Year, where the song is about a relationship coming to a close within October. Although I always understood the song was about the end of a relationship, for some reason the double meaning of leaves did not occur to me until recently.

The one case that got me to write this was Bright Eyes - First Day of My Life. In the song, Conor Oberst says ""I’d rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery"", and it was not until yesterday that the meaning of that line hit me. As I grow older, I accepted that there is no magical woman who will be perfect for me, that relationships need work and patience. Although I always ""knew"" that, it was not until recently that meaning of the line truly hit me.

I have used it off and on since then, but never got around to filling it once and for all. I've decided that now is the time to do so. I'm a music fanatic, and I have more than enough albums in practically any genre to fill it, but my opinion is that jukeboxes are a special medium, and I'm also wanting to do this process ONCE, and get it right. I don't want to forget some perfect song, and then be kicking myself over it later.

So here's my request-- help me think up individual songs that need to be on this jukebox. I want songs that have (or will) stand the test of time. No current BS that I'm going to regret in a month. You can draw from any genre or style of music, and submit as many suggestions as you want, though positive mental brownie points are given for individual suggestions backed up by interesting/convincing reasons.

As with any format, the jukebox has its own unique qualities that I’ve been discovering along the way. First off my family and I will be the primary audience, so in that regard, it’s something like an iPod. On the other hand, I’ve settled the jukebox near my kitchen, and it’s over 300 pounds… so it’s not nearly as mobile. That means anytime I’m listening, I’ll most likely be in the kitchen– similar to how an ordinary stereo system stays in one spot.

Of course, it’s not a stereo system. Unlike a normal stereo, the jukebox is only designed to play one track at a time. Up to 99 tracks can be queued, but must be entered individually. Because of this, no benefit is bestowed upon albums in the way they are played in a typical stereo, where a listener might just let an album play on through the intended track.

The jukebox is quite cold in this regard– only the individual tracks matter. Jukeboxes are from another time, long before the so-called “album” was ever thought up. 78′s (and eventually 45′s) were best-suited for an era of doo-wop, blues sides, dance numbers, rock singles, and pop music… and that’s got to be the sort of thing that jukeboxes handle best as well. In a way, it makes my machine seem like some sort of unwieldly, impossible monster– saddled with the body of the compact disc, but the heart of a 45 record.

So there you have it-- you mission, should you decide to accept it. Help stock my jukebox! I'm looking forward to your suggestions.

Carl Wilson's book really addresses musical taste and preference in an enlightening and compelling read. 

The series 33 1/3 offers authors the ability to utilize classic or high-selling albums as a jumping off point to develop a story or study a philosophical question. 

[Here's an Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Celine-Dions-Lets-Talk-About/dp/082642788X)

The author, Carl Wilson, is a music critic from Quebec, Canada who's written for quite a few publications. As a Canadian resident, he himself has grown up hating ""Let's Talk About Love"" and anything Celine Dion related. But in this book, Wilson attempts to critique himself and music criticism in general. 

A lot of the things Wilson talks about are the ideas of Bourdieu (who posits a sort of evolutionary stance on why people like what they do) and of personal bias. 

**How often do you hear a band and neglect them immediately?** For instance, if I hear the name Creed or Miley Cyrus, my brain shuts down immediately. But how fair is that to the music itself? It's possible, and Carl Wilson tries this himself, to find things you really love in music your really hate.

But the whole book isn't based around telling you to love everything you hate. Instead, Wilson also offers the concepts of trying to connect with people who love what you hate. It may be hard to believe but there are diehard Jewel fans or people who adore Kenny G. Wilson tries to address understanding where they come from and how it is to talk to someone with different tastes.

If you made it this far down the post, I appreciate you reading about this. I read this book for a class on World Music, which happened to be my favorite class despite my initial conception that ""World music"" study is a sisyphean or at least herculean task. This book and my class on Buddhism helped me realize how much judgement I tend to pass on people for their tastes in music/art as well as what they study or what they know.

This doesn't mean that I worship his every opinion, or listen to albums that he approves of. Rather, if there's an artist or band that I'm interested in in even the slightest, I'll look it up on his website. I'll read the reviews and articles, and think about it for a bit in comparison to my own opinions. There have been entire all-night sessions spent looking up musicians on his website in this fashion. I contribute this addictive quality to the fact that, outside of his musical taste, he is genuinely entertaining and often gives me a good chuckle.

Now, I present to you two reviews for two albums, one of which is by The Strokes:

&gt;Is This It [RCA, 2001]

&gt;Great **groove** band, end of story--I wish. True **grooves** extend toward infinity, for one thing; here the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity. Their **grooves** carry melody, too--and not all of it, not hardly...(continues on)

and a review for Jack White's solo album:

&gt;Blunderbuss [Third Man/Columbia, 2012]

&gt; ...His respect for tune notwithstanding, however, its most fetching song by far is Rudy Toombs's ""I'm Shakin',"" covered in a version that resembles the Blasters' rocker far more than Little Willie John's shiftier original. I blame this shortfall on White's disregard for a roots-rock essential called **groove**. Carla Azar does have more **jam** than Meg White, but not enough. With hip-hop ever beyond him, maybe he should give Cindy Blackman a call.

So, what exactly are groove and jam in music? They may be subjective concepts, but for lingo that's so widespread, there must be at least a very general definition that most people can agree on. Are they a quality of rhythm? Or is Mr. Christgau just pulling words out of his ass? (Like I suspect he sometimes does.) On a similar vein, how do you define the flow of a rapper? 

I'm asking out of genuine curiosity about these definitions, so it'd be awesome if someone could explain/discuss these concepts in the clearest manner possible. (ELI5, anyone?)

For some background info, in the late 70s when the Sex Pistols, Ramones, New York Dolls, and the Clash were getting famous (or at least garnering notoriety), it inspired angry teenagers to start bands regardless of their musical abilities. What came was the hardcore and indie underground scene of the 80s that later progressed into 90s alternative. 

Key players in the movement were Black Flag, Hüsker Dü, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, The Germs, and the Minutemen. For the most part, the music of these bands was simple, aggressive, fast paced, self-produced/recorded/distributed/advertized and inspiring. 

Now, I love hardcore punk, but I think the idea of the scene sometimes clouds people's perception of the actual music--that it's pretty bad. the movement, and punk in general, is about attitude, not music, and in turn, a lot of the music (albeit fun and sometimes catchy) is awful but put on a pedestal. 

What I want to discuss is this: I think bands that left the punk scene were better off as a whole. Bands that started off hardcore who evolved ended up much better than they were, and as a whole are better than one-dimensional hardcore acts. 

The Replacements started as a hardcore band, but quickly changed into a more alternative act, and released two phenomenal albums in the mid-eighties (*Let It Be* and *Tim*). 

Dinosaur Jr started off as a hardcore band called Deep Wound. Deep Wound sucks, whereas DinoJ's first three records are kickass and bring back the idea of the guitar solo to indie rock. 

The Flaming Lips started as a hardcore band and they were awful. Their 80s music is horrendous whereas their 90s material is incredible. 

The early Seattle scene was Green River, Malfunkshun, and the Melvins. The early grunge is so bad (fuck it, Nirvana's *Bleach* does not stack up to their later releases). when Green River and Malfunkshun broke up and later became Mudhoney and Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam, they were SOO much better. 

I guess what I am rambling about is that I think bands who really stand out are the ones who don't necessarily ""sell out,"" but rather play to their own vision and comfort instead of to the vision of the scene. Maybe even succumbing to the scene over personal vision is more of a sell out move than changing your sound is. I don't know.

Personally, I think that tUnE-yArDs is aggressively original, both musically and visually.  This is of course not to say that Merrill Garbus is without influence.  I think there's a pretty well-documented criticism that goes something like ""Just another white person ripping off black [in this case African] music,"" but I don't buy that.  The combination of musical ingredients that make up her songs (acoustic drum loops, vocal loops, distorted uke, two saxophones, bass, her bizarre voice) is one I've never seen before, and the personality of her music is comparably distinctive.

On top of this, she has a personalized stage presence (crossing her drumsticks over her head and whatnot), a consistent aesthetic to her music videos (children in face-paint), and even her own style of song-titling (""Bizzness,"" ""Gansta,"" ""Powa"").

I started thinking about the song-writing of some of the bands I enjoy and wondered what about them was good (and what wasn't).

The first band that springs to my mind is *Calexico*. Each of their songs tells a story and the lyrics make heavy use of metaphor -- particularly imagery in which the state of nature reflects the state of emotion of the ""protagonist"". Here, I think the quality of the song-writing stems directly from the quality of the *story*-writing. \(examples: [Crystal Frontier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLsQ_8PwwDs), [Si Tu Disais](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3_Xtqd4wk), [Woven Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ3B3IuIoGA)\)

At the other end of the spectrum, the lyrics of bands like *The Mars Volta* appear to have no story to them (or indeed any logical coherence whatsoever). I'm not sure you can really call these lyrics song-writing. But they are still emotive and seem to achieve this solely because of the sounds the words make as they are sung. [Televators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4RjFr5Pr2U) is probably my favourite example of this.

There are some bands I enjoy listening to, but which I don't think have particularly extraordinary lyrics. *Chevelle*'s lyrics don't seem to stray far from the usual rock-music fare, \(example: [Face to the Floor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfD6V8b1zco&amp;ob=av2e)\); I wouldn't say they were bad, necessarily, but the writing isn't really memorable for me. With *Mastodon*, the lyrics are clearly not the central focus of the music (although their latest album has, in my opinion, changed this in an interesting way). In most cases they are just a bundle of shouted thematic phrases awkwardly tossed together; the album Blood Mountain feels like their worst offender in this regard. But frequently that's precisely all that's needed to accompany the actual meat of the music \(example: [Hearts Alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs2ZsxPMdL4) *lyrics start at 2:50*\)

So I am undecided about what makes good song-writing good. Does it just need to fit in with the rest of the music or should it be able to stand alone? A good story clearly helps but also doesn't seem to be at all necessary. Genre is probably the deciding factor here.

People, ideas, etc., and we get to music. I just want my reasoning to be as valid as can be to myself and others. Also interested in discovering new interests...new sounds I've never heard before, or a great band with meaningful lyrics, etc. 

EDIT: The more I mull on about this the more I realize the 2nd question should be the focus on this discussion.  


The topic revolves around disliking certain pieces of music for reasons that never include actually listening to the songs themselves.

For example, I may dislike a genre because I dislike the fans, or the styles (shouting, screaming, etc from metal), or even the album covers without actually giving these songs a listen. 

So I later go back and do just that, and discover there's some meaning behind the styles, that even though some fans are displeasing - the artist/group is not so, the lyrics have the kind of substance that appeals to me, the way the song is sung and/or played also appeals to me as well - and so on.

**Question:**

How can one find the ""staple bands"" that DO outline their genres, so that if one listens to that band as much as possible, they will then get a fair sense about that genre, and thus be able to form a reasonable opinion about it? 

I just became interested in going back to these songs that I've never listened to - but the problem lies in what I should listen to, in order to get a good sense of the genre before moving on to other interests. 

For example, dubstep. There's that popular ""debate"" going on about whether or not one artist (artist A) is dubstep or not. The problem gets worse when I take these suggestions and then see there's yet another group that opposes this other artist (artist B) and makes the same claims above. As one who's not deeply invested in this genre, I am unable to tell the difference. 

How could one who is interested in finding more about this genre truly get a good sense of what it is about?


This one seems like it makes the task more doable, but the hard part is finding such groups that can flat-out generally represent the entire genre/subgenre.

I'm a lifetime fanatic who's never quite given up on the band - even during the decades I wasn't particularly a fan of the music. Because even when Van Halen was at their Cherone-est, they were doing what they do best - making a glorious, gigantic mess of everything in their path for no good goddamn reason. Unintentionally, of course, which makes it all the more endearing.



Many people are upset by the fact that Michael Anthony, unduly maligned bassist and trademark back up vocalist, has been replaced (uncerimoniously) by Ed's son Wolfgang. A lot of die hard CVH (the c is for ""classic”) fans want nothing to do with this abomination of the Van Halen name. 


They're missing the point. This sort of missed opportunity/colossal fuck up is exactly what makes Van Halen the band they are. This is a band that has existed for 35 years and climbed the absolute highest heights of rock and roll fame without appearing to have a fucking clue what they were doing.  They are dysfunction personified. Sammy Hagar speaks of his years with the band in retrospect as if he survived some unspeakable natural disaster that unfolded in slow motion over the course of a decade. And this is a guy who appears to like anyone who'll drink with him. 
 
Everything this band has done has been baffling and frustrating and yet it wouldn't be the same if all they did was put out consistent records and go out on tour like clockwork. The unavoidable mess their  collective careers has been - a collision of ego, addiction, insecurity and empowerment - is part of the band's lasting appeal to me. They never seemed like an act. There was no one pulling the strings. Just a bunch of guys who started out as a little cover band from Pasadena and got real big real fast and never quite got the hang of how to deal with any of it or what they were supposed to do. 


To summarize, I use a single song off their still indispensible first album as example of what their entire head slapping career means to me... The track is called I'M THE ONE. It opens with a blistering riff that literally sounds like Eddie's pick bouncing off the strings because it doesn't have time to actually pluck them. Al's drums kick in like a kid jamming in his bedroom without any concern for what anyone else is doing. In a good way. Mike Anthony delivers a pounding bass line that propels the song as much as any element. The descending vocal/chords of the bridge ""You know your message from above..."" sound like they may come off the proverbial tracks at any moment. The solos have no backing guitar track, naked in all their fucking rock glory - and then the song stops....





And there's a fucking a capella barbershop quartet style do-wop section. 



Right there in the middle of the song. 



There is no precursor to this on the rest of the album. The only moment of ""humor"" on the whole thing is the cover of Ice Cream Man a few tracks later. Who the fuck would think it was a good idea to stop the amazing momentum of that badass song for a bap-bada-shooby-do-waa four part harmony? Didn't they have any idea how WRONG it was to do that? Or how horribly awry things could have gone? 

Nope.  


That song is my first memory of Van Halen and I'm The One is my #2 of all time song by them.  So yes, as I've said before they're like the drunken uncle who shames himself every time he goes out in public. But for all the idiocy and embarrassment and aggravation, there's always the chance that he's going to do something cool again because he doesn't know any better. 


I intend to be there, just in case.

Nirvana is straight, simple garage rock while Pearl Jam is more technical  arena hard rock reminiscent of The Who or Led Zeppelin.  Alice in Chains leans towards metal while a lot of Soundgarden is progressive alternative metal. 

It seems that these bands were just lumped into the same subgenre because they came from the same place at the same time.  If Pearl Jam hailed from Boston instead of Seattle would they still be grunge? Or would they just be hard rock? For instance, Monster Magnet is a band from that time period that makes music similar sounding to Alice in Chains, but on the wiki page they are listed as stoner metal and psychedelic rock, but not grunge.  They are from New Jersey.  If they were from Seattle would they be considered grunge?

Take Midnight Special by CCR.  That was originally a Leadbelly song and it probably goes further back than Leadbelly.  I don't hear anyone crying about CCR ripping off ol' bluesman (I don't follow CCR that much so maybe they do)!

They quickly became one of my favorite bands and they've been in constant rotation in my playlist ever since. I think Menos el Oso is one of my all-time favorite albums, with the Beer Commercials EP being a close contender. To this day, Erin Tate is still one of my favorite drummers and I always warm up to MTB albums before shows. 

I've seen them live 6 times so far, with the first being at some pool hall in Tallahassee, FL. Every time has been a face-melting, fantastic show. One of the most intense moments was watching Dave Knudson for the very first time. As far as guitarists go, that mother fucker has some top notch showmanship. However, the last time they were in town I just couldn't bring myself to go even though it was a 10 minute drive. 


So, my question is...what the hell happened? Did their music get as shitty as I think it did with OMNI and Infinity Overhead? Planet of Ice was alright but the only real standouts in my opinion were Knights, Double Vision Quest and a song that never even made it to the final cut, Broken China. I can listen to Menos and Pirates front to back without skipping a song and I can barely even bring myself to listen to one track off of their last two albums. I understand that a decade is a long time to develop different musical tastes, and as an artist, your own personal work will reflect that, But why are they making music for soccer moms and teenage girls now? Am I just an elitist son of a bitch or what?

I was driving home, listening to the radio and thinking about an interview I saw Usher do after Michael Jackson died. In the interview, he said he felt a lot of pressure to take Michael Jackson’s place as the next King of Pop. When I first heard him say this, I was not sure he had what it took. 

There’s something you should know about me before we go any further. I am a Michael Jackson fan. And I don’t mean I know the Thriller dance. I had an entire library of Michael Jackson everything. I had records, cassettes, CDs, VHS tapes, magazines, posters. Right now there is a life-size Michael Jackson cardboard cutout. It’s my most prized possession. 

My fascination with Michael came at an early age. I was in the fourth grade when I was introduced to Thriller. I immediately began listening to everything I could find of his. I seemed to discover Michael at the perfect time. He was everywhere at the moment. VH1 had a marathon and I recorded every minute of it. I spent the next year watching it repeatedly and memorizing nearly every song. His music helped me through what was mostly an awkward childhood. I didn’t have many friends at the time and his tunes let me escape. He understood what it felt like to be lonely and picked on. Say what you will about the man, but he could sing. 

Knowing this, you can understand how important it was that Michael’s “successor” be every bit as awe-inspiring as he was. Two words: Justin Timberlake. Hear me out. He started his musical career as a member of boy band N’SYNC. Just like Jackson 5, there was no official leader of this group. But also like J5, we all knew who the star was. Justin stood out for his smooth voice and impressive dance skills. After the boy bands faded away, Justin stood out as a truly talented solo artist. Remind you of anyone? They are both also known for blurring racial lines with their flawless musical skills. 

I know most people aren’t concerned with royal rankings of the music world. But speaking as someone who dressed up as Michael Jackson for Halloween in the fifth grade, I wanted to plead the case anyway.

Sidechain compression is an audio effect in which the volume of one signal is used to drive a compressor which lowers the volume - or 'ducks' - the main signal. The most common traditional use for the effect is when a radio DJ speaks over the music and the music fades out and back in again. It's also used to create space in a mix for the kick drum by momentarily ducking the bass and it's this that I wish to draw your attention to, because it is now the norm to overuse this effect to a preposterous degree.

I'm pretty sure it was Daft Punk who kicked this off. You can hear it on 'One More Time' and 'Harder, Better, Faster' but those tracks are comparatively subtle compared to how it's used today. It's all over that electro pop-dance crap that's suddenly bafflingly popular in the states but you can hear it in lots of other music, dance and non-dance. Trust me, you've heard the effect a lot.

The reason I made this post is that someone in another thread mentioned a new Bonobo album so I gave it a listen and the [first track is rendered completely unlistenable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHotQANrGCE) by this stupid hackneyed effect. It physically hurts my ears like being repeatedly rendered momentarily deaf. It completely kills the groove and dynamics in a track.

So I wonder if a lot of decent music is being ruined by a production fad. Or maybe it's just me and people quite like it.

The lineup is:

Chino Moreno (of Deftones) - Vocals

Bryant Clifford Meyer (of Isis) - Guitar and keys

Aaron Harris (of Isis) - Drums

Jeff Caxide (of Isis) - Bass

I've seen some negative response regarding this album from people saying it wasn't what they hoped it would be or something else along those lines. I feel completely opposite. If you ask me, this album is EXACTLY what I anticipated. Chino's vocals are a perfect match for this sound and the instrumentals sound like a logical next step for where Isis may have gone on a next album. In their last few years, they were progressively getting softer, so cutting out the sludge parts altogether really sounds like where the band would have gone after *Wavering Radiant*.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with the album. The only thing I'd say it's lacking is the sheer thickness of the guitar work on an Isis record, but any time you step down from 3 guitarists to 1, that's going to be an obvious tradeoff. Aside from that, this is just what I had hoped to hear. It may not be AOTY material, but it makes me really happy to see a supergroup that can actual sound as good as it looks on paper.

Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen legitimized songwriting as an art form. Both are considered, at least by academics, as much poets as they are musicians but Dylan's style is far easier to replicate. Bob Dylan wrote songs that evoked specific emotions through the unique imagery he used. He drew upon poets such as T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound in that he conjured images to evoke a specific emotion in the reader rather than to describe an event. This served to reinvigorate song writing as a method of record keeping because Dylan could record how people felt as well as what actually occured. Dylan spawned many imitators who wrote lyrics that sounded cool but didn't really mean anything a trend that continues to this day. Don't get me wrong, I consider Desolation row one of the best songs ever and easily the greatest work of modernist poetry ever nut the prevalence of disconnected images in song lyrics has hamstrung pop music. I mean stuck in the middle with you by stealers wheel is a parody of a Bob Dylan song complete with Cliched images snd nasal voice. Coldplay are probably the most guilty of this practice but its endemic to modern pop music. Because of this in my mind the best songwriters are those who shy away from dylanesque imagery. John Darnielle, Steven Malkmus, Jarvis Cocker, Jeffery Lewis, Stuart Murdoch, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy are modern songwriters who buck this trend and of course there are plenty others but in terms of pure number the amount of lyricists who mimic Dylan's style but lack his substance is far greater.

Let me first describe to you my personal experience with music and the internet, and then I'll tell you why.  

As a kid, I grew up listening to 3 records over and over again.  These were *Paul Simon - Graceland*, *Steve Miller Band - Greatest Hits*, and *The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper* (really though, I was listening to the entire Beatles catalog, but Sgt. Pepper was the one I always begged my parents to play).  Like most kids, I didn't mind the endless repetition; to the contrary, I craved it!  Kids are like that, once they find something that's good, they have no reservations about indulging in it over and over and over.  I think more than anything, these records taught me to appreciate the immediacy of pure pop hooks.  I could listen to other songs and enjoy them, but if left to my own devices I would always go running back to *Graceland* or *Sgt. Pepper*, because they delivered those sweet hooks every time, and I wasn't looking for anything else from music.

This changed when I was in Jr. High, when music took on a social dimension.  It wasn't enough for music to just satisfy that craving for catchiness.  Now, I had this new desire for it to be shared by others.  Nobody understood Steve Miller or Paul Simon the way I did...maybe their parents started them on Queen or David Bowie instead.  In any case, nobody talked about their parents records, they talked about what was playing on the radio.  Moreover, they were all listen to *opposing* stations, these encampments of taste that defined to some extent who you were.  Some kids listened to the pop/rap station, others the alt-rock station.  I decided to align myself with the alt-rock station, during what was quite possibly **the worst era of alt-rock radio**.  For the most part, the airwaves were dominated by nu-metal trash like Korn and Limp Bizkit, and while some better 90's bands like Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins were still popular, they weren't exactly **fresh** anymore.  During this phase in my life, I knew that I didn't really like these nu-metal bands as much as bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers or Sublime, but I jumped on the band-wagon all the same, just to be able to fit in.  Looking back retrospectively, I think the confused pre-adolescent part of me just wanted to identify with the overwrought angst of nu-metal, while the kid in me just wanted to listen to songs that were catchy and fun.  (You have to admit, it says something about your genre if you're appealing to the emotional maturity of a 13 year old :P)

It was in high school that I finally began exploring music through the internet.  However, the social dimension of this exploration was still extremely important to me.  Like many high-school kids, I was going through phases, trying to find my clique.  For the first two years of high school, I was in my pop-punk/emo phase, listening to bands like Saves the Day, Taking Back Sunday, At the Drive-In, Rufio, etc.  Then, using internet resources like IRC servers, I started looking for pop-punk bands that nobody had heard of before, just so I could come to school and show off to my friends.  Maybe this seems superficial, and certainly it was to some extent, but I should add that pop-punk as a genre really did provide a satisfying experience at the time.  Not only were the hooks there (if we're talking about the right band, that is :P), but there was an *energy* there that I sorely needed.  This was also around the time I started picking up the guitar and writing songs myself, and just the act of thrashing around with a guitar, or headbanging in a pit, was absolutely exhilarating.  To this day, I still have a bit of a sweet-tooth for this kind of music, although I can't really listen to the lyrics without cringing.           

The latter half of high school for me was all about letting go of the social dimension of music, and taking a more personal approach.  This was when I started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, and allowed myself to let go of the trendy pop-punk fashion and music in favor of classic rock and metal.  I was hanging out with a lot of kids who considered themselves to be the next generation of hippies, and while I never really attempted to be a part of that, I did allow them to turn me on to a lot of classic rock that I hadn't previously heard.  Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin weren't news to most people, but they were to me, so exploring them was a much more personal experience.  Drugs also helped me to internalize music in a way I had never previously experienced.  I was no longer listening for the hooks, or for the sake of being a part of a larger movement.  Now, I was listening for the sake of personal reflection, I was connecting the lyrics and melodies of the song to events and emotions in my own life.  

During this time, I also began using the internet to explore metal.  When I tell people how much I know about metal to this day, they can't quite believe it, because I don't really listen to any metal anymore, and true metalheads tend to be extremely purist.  However, metal was the first genre that I really explored for my own personal satisfaction, and doing so taught me a lot about how to appreciate different aspects of music.  I listened to melodic death metal and power metal for the virtuosity, orchestral metal for the arrangement and scope, doom metal for the texture, prog-metal for the storytelling, black metal for the pure abrasiveness, etc.  More than anything, I learned to love approaching an album completely blind to what it will be, and coming away with some element to be appreciated and respected.

After high school, I went to college and with the aid of an Oink account, I began exploring every genre of music I could get my hands on, in earnest.  Indie, blues, jazz, electronic, folk, shoegaze, hip-hop, you name it.  It was all at my fingertips, and I had developed an enormous appetite.  

Flash forward about 10 years and 180GB of music, and here I am now.  I still like to explore and listen to new music, but it's just not the same.  Honestly, I think the unbridled access to music has spoiled me a little bit.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to appreciate an artist's innovation;  I feel like I've heard it all before.  It's also becoming more difficult to really connect personally to a song's lyrics or emotions, it's like I've gone numb to music's affective power.  Is this just me getting older?  Am I just having some sort of quarter-life crisis, if such a thing exists?  I don't know, but I guess I'll keep on trekking, and hopefully I'll find something that really moves me again.  Currently, I've been trying to devote some focused listening time to jazz and classical, specifically Chopin and Miles Davis.  I think if I can train myself to appreciate these two purportedly timeless artists, maybe some of my capacity for music appreciation will return.  Only time will tell.

As a music fan, and even more so as a producer of music, I've become more and more drawn to the idea of what might be called 'non-representational' music, that is to say recordings which actively try to problematize the idea that a recording is necessarily a recording **of** something.  In my own music, I've been quite influenced by the concept of 'flatness', in the way that Clement Greenberg used it to describe Abstract Expressionist painting as eschewing depth, in the sense that we visually experience the world as 'deep', and how this idea might be applied to music.  

More generally though, I'm curious as to what people are attracted to (or perhaps not attracted to) with regards to recording practices that are not practical or possible to recreate live, and the artistic possibilities that these open up.  As an example, in How Music Works, David Byrne talks about one of the things that made Frank Sinatra so interesting and unique at the time was the way he recorded the vocals so that they were much more close and intimate compared to the rest of the instruments, giving the effect that he was talking or even whispering directly to the listener, an effect which could not be done to the same effect in a live setting.

The complaint encompassed a number of major points, including the similarity between outlets. Sadly the piece was unreadable, to say the least, and failed to really back up the assertions put forth.

The reason I am bringing this up is the following: Every year I compile a list of all the top 50 albums each year, to see who was consistently listed in the Top 50, who had top rated albums, and how much did these outlets differ from the aggregated list and each other. Although I have not done the actual aggregation this year, I have pulled 15 top 50 lists, and have found that they are all very similar so far. I am not talking about the same 10 artist, I am talking about 70-80% of their lists are the same, with a slight reshuffling. So are there 25-30 albums that are unquestionably the top 50 albums of the year, or are the media outlets broken?

What is everyone's opinion on this? Are there ""honest"" or even appropriately biased ""indie"" media outlets to discover new music anymore?

Before someone mentions that MetaCritic already compiles Top 10 of every music outlet, here is the reason I do it myself: I do not like the metrics used for their rankings. They do it based on ranking within top 10 and not frequency on a list. Although this metric is useful for finding gems, such as Fucked Up's David Comes to Life, it is not useful for finding albums that are considered good by every outlet, as opposed to a few. For example, Fucked Up's David Comes to Life was ranked #1 and #2 on 6 out of the 15 top 50 list from last year (and was not even mentioned on the others), meaning that if you liked the album, you fucking loved it. On the other hand, PJ Harvey's Let England Shake was mentioned on all of the lists, but only a few times as #1. Furthermore, this project allows me to collect metrics like similarity between my compiled top 50 and each outlet's.

_____________________________

Kvlt in the Cascades

Musical genres have often been known to grow in specific scenes and styles based on location, just look at Detroit’s soul, Motown, at post-rock in Montreal, or Seattle’s acoustic revival beginning in the late 90’s.  Black metal has always been a genre reliant on location, Scandinavian bands always finding more success than American bands, or the bands in the bracing cold of the north capturing the ideas of black metal more successfully than those in the bright and noisy cities.  However, in the past decade a new progression of black metal has arisen that is based entirely on a bioregion: Cascadia, of the Pacific Northwest.  Defined by some as any black metal influenced projects coming out of the region, and by others as any environmentally minded atmospheric black metal project, the genre has remained vague and unfocused, as well as receiving a large amount of scrutiny and criticism from the black metal scene, questioning whether Cascadian black metal should be called black metal at all.  But a closer study of the genre reveals bolder definitions, which secure its place as a true black metal band.

Black metal first branched off from conventional heavy metal in the late 1980s.  It was marked by speed, intensity, and extreme loudness.  Blast beats, shrieked vocals, and tremolo picked guitars.  It was focused solely on being harsher, more abrasive, and more extreme than any other metal before it. But in the early 1990’s on the Scandinavian Peninsula, mostly in Norway, black metal developed a more unique and recognizable sound, along with a strong set of beliefs and an accompanying aesthetic.  Particularly thanks to the bands Darkthrone, Mayhem, Emperor, and, most infamous of all, Burzum (the solo project of Varg Vikernes of Mayhem), black metal began to be characterized by an emphasis on atmosphere, rather that extreme metal, and an anti-Christian stance based on paganism and national socialism.  A scene of angry and depressed teenagers and twenty-somethings began to form throughout Norway, and the darkness, hate, depression, and evil they expressed through their songs seemed to be just as real in their lives.  

Crime, murder, and death were as closely associated with the scene as they are with US gangsta rap today. Most famously were the church burnings.  Beginning late Christmas Eve night in 1992, Varg Vikernes, also known as “Count Grishnackh,” set fire to a church in his hometown.  In 24 hours he’d set a second ablaze.  Sometime later he set fire to a third.  He’d left no evidence and the only witnesses were the three different band mates he’d perpetrated the three different crimes with.  However, in 1993, tensions in the band grew, and eventually lead to Vikernes murdering Mayhem guitarist “Euronymous.”  Vikernes was arrested and, while on trial, other members of Mayhem offered their eyewitness accounts of the church arsons, effectively putting Vikernes away, despite any other evidence for his crimes, for the maximum Norwegian sentence of 21 years, of which he served 16.  Over the first ten years of his sentence a number of albums he had recorded for Burzum during 1991 and 1992 were intermittently released and supplied some context for his anti-Christian stance and crimes.  While the worldwide media had covered his trial calling him a Satanist, his work as Burzum, and his personal explanations, instead revealed him aligning with Norse paganism.  He was angered by the Christianization of his nation and its culture and their loss of the Norse gods.  

On top of this he preached, from his cell, a racist, sexist, and national socialist worldview.  His life authentically reflected the hate in his music, and Europe generally reacted against this by shunning the genre of black metal.  It still exists there today, especially in Scandinavia, but is not a generally accepted form of music and is still a great source of controversy, especially in Germany, where black metal concerts are routinely protested, regardless of the individual beliefs of the musicians involved.

In the US, the legacy of black metal lives a more open and less taboo life.  Most US black metal, or USBM, bands attempt to recreate the cold emptiness of European black metal, yet the genre’s success is in debate.  Many claim that black metal can’t be created in a city, the center for much of the US music scenes, and must be inspired by the cold, open north.  The scene carries over the corpsepaint and the general aesthetic of its European counterpart, and doing its best to anger the religious in America.  The motivation for this has less of a holding than in Vikernes’ ex-Pagan nation.  America has no past of worship, it has no old gods.  There is no American history, at least of its whites, before the 1500’s, so what authenticity is in an American stance on an anti-Christian rhetoric?  For these reasons USBM is often criticized and looked down upon.  Thus a paradox was created.  USBM could not exist authentically if it spoke of reclamation of old world values that didn’t actually exist, and yet, if it abandoned these Pagan and anti-Christian points of view, it wouldn’t really be black metal.

Inspired by an Earth First meet-up in the Cascade Mountains during the summer of 2002, brothers Nathan and Aaron Weaver moved to a small, run down farmstead near Olympia, Washington.  It was here, during the cold and grey winter that followed, they acted upon the inspiration from the festival in the woods that night.  By combining an environmentally conscious worldview with the cold and aggressive sound of Norwegian atmospheric black metal, Wolves in the Throne Room was born.  In 2006, they debuted their sound with *Diadem of 12 Stars*, and one year later perfected the approach with *Two Hunters*.  Their lyrics were devoid of the hate and anti-Christian themes of most black metal, instead lamenting the loss of man’s connection with nature and his disrespect for it. Subsequently, they were often characterized as an inauthentic black metal group who were in no way, shape, or form “kvlt,” the term given to the corpsepaint wearing black metal bands of early 1990’s (Generally used very tongue-in-cheek, except by the corpse paint wearing black metal bands of the early 1990’s). At the same time, various other Northwest musicians had been struck with a similar inspiration.  Black metal acts Skagos and Alda popped up and received local attention.  Fauna, an environmentally focused black metal band from the Olympia, WA area that had already existed for several years came into some renown.  Almost a decade into this new form of atmospheric black metal, dubbed Cascadian black metal, one question is still asked and argued over at every festival, show, and online metal forum:  is Cascadian black metal true black metal; is it “kvlt”? 

The most distinctive part of Cascadian black metal is its sound.  It takes queues from atmospheric black metal and neofolk, incorporating acoustic guitars amongst the distorted walls of electric guitar and drums.  The percussion is informed by orthodox black metal, meaning blast beats, fast and relentless.  Songs tend to be long—usually passing the ten minutes mark and sometimes the twenty—and follow the structure of most black metal: a continuous and changing composition rather than a repeated chorus or distinct verses.  The guitars are not tuned down, and often only played on the higher strings, strumming as fast as possible to create a driving, droning effect.  The screams are higher as well, in opposition to the guttural croaks of death and doom metal. As Cascadian metal is also atmospheric black metal, its intent is to create an atmosphere for the listener rather than pummel the listener with the intense drumming and fast guitars—beauty above brutality.  Here is one border, simply what type of music is played, apart from lyrics and messages.  

Agalloch, an experimental band based in Portland, Oregon, is occasionally grouped into the definition of Cascadian black metal.  Many lyrical themes are the same: Agalloch often sings of worshipping nature, of reclaiming pagan roots, one example is in their song “In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion,” in which the lyrics exclaim “Here I gaze upon a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone.  If this grand panorama before me is what you call God, then God is not dead.”  Yet, while they take an influence from folk metal like Cascadian black metal does, with acoustic guitars, and often flutes and other woodwinds, and influence from black metal, with higher vocals and guitars, and, especially in 2010’s *Marrow of the Spirit*, blast beats, Agalloch is not Cascadian black metal.  2006’s Ashes Against the Grain, for example, takes far too much from post-rock and post-metal, with large amounts of ambient and noise elements.  Their sound is far too experimental and does not adhere to the style of atmospheric black metal as true Cascadian black metal does.  As for what sets Cascadian black metal apart from the rest of atmospheric black metal, it is the warmth and life apparent in the music.  While typical atmospheric black metal acts follow the trends of Varg Vikernes project Burzum, using cold and inhuman drum machines and looping guitar parts, no Cascadian bands use this approach.  
	Some bands, like Wolves in the Throne Room, are very outspoken about being a live band, recording every sound and never looping, not using drum triggers during live sets and never using a drum machine.  In fact, Wolves In the Throne Room are against the use of computers in music making.  Their music is recorded using completely analog technology and techniques, and it is mixed on a soundboard rather than on a computer.  Some critics see this as an attempt to be “natural,” and mock the irony of the situation.  Wolves in the Throne Room recognizes this hypocrisy, stating:

&gt;“One of the many contradictions of Black Metal is that it is a music that decries civilization, but relies on so many modern contrivances to exist.  I don’t think it is a natural sound at all.  It is really the sound of paradox, ambiguity, confusion, being 	caught between two worlds that cannot be reconciled”.

This recording technique is used to give warmth to a style of music so consistently straining for the cold of winter.  As is later explained in the previously quoted interview:

&gt;“True Norwegian black metal is completely unbalanced – that is why it is so compelling and powerful.  It is the sound of utter torment, believing to one’s core that winter is eternal.  BM is about destruction, destroying humanity; destroying 	ones 	own self in an orgy of self loathing and hopelessness.  I believe one must focus on this 	image of eternal winter in order to understand Black Metal, for it is a crucial metaphor 	that reveals our sadness and woe as a race.  In our hubris, we have rejected the earth and 	the wisdom of countless generations for the baubles of modernity.  In return, we have 	been left stranded and bereft in this spiritually freezing hell”.

The band though, living in the beauty of the Cascadian bioregion, sees that winter is in fact not eternal, and recognizes through their music the power of nature in all seasons.  But Cascadian black metal faces this paradox, described in the first quote, as well.  The music created is in reaction to our rejection of the “earth and the wisdom of countless generations for the baubles of modernity,” but it uses these products of the modern world, the electric guitars and the effects pedals and the amplifiers and it finds it self caught in the same to opposing worldviews as traditional black metal does.  The pain apparent in the music is caused by the fact that these musicians are being forced to accept this modern world and long hopelessly for the past.

Radiohead's albums tend to be circular.  Kid A starts off (arguably) at the conception of a child.  The last song ends with the lyrics ""I will see you in the next life.""  The album is born, the listener is made to experience a lineage of emotions, and then there is the experience of death.

In Rainbows works similarly.  The first line of 15 Step is ""How come I end up where I started.""  Videotape, the last song, discusses the idea of Faust - Faust searches for happiness his whole life, and only after selling his soul to the devil does he realize how he had happiness the whole time.  It's very circular - you search for happiness, you find it, and then its fleeting and evades you once again.  ""How come I end up where I started?""  Even the idea of a videotape - something that goes round and round ties into this notion of circular motion and circular thinking.  

These are just two examples.  I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this debate.

Then you have lyrics which range from typical sex, drugs, rock and roll to how great high school was to how we all want to be rock stars. Lastly, they have a large and energetic live show suited for stadiums, they are known to cover artists like Pantera and others.

I don't like them for a number of reasons. The big one is how they sing songs about how much they care about everything, then play a song about burning things to the ground. I think it makes them inconsistent as a band. I also don't like their lyrical content, specifically Shakin Hands, a song about how a woman can only make it in the business world by using her body.

I have listened to ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and ""Blonde on Blonde"" and I think they're great albums. However, for the most part, I only think this because *I like how the songs sound*.

I argue that this is a significant factor in the popularity of revivalism. It provides an opportunity to see acts perform or perform with youthful enthusiasm while still hearing music of an older style.

Jazz, interestingly, has escaped this trend, and while that seems to be largely because of its nature of heavy improvisation that can greatly alter a tune, there's also artists like badbadnotgood who will perform jazz renditions of hip hop songs.

On their new album they've teamed up with a bunch of internationally acclaimed brass players from various backgrounds (most famously probably Mats Gustafsson and Ken Vandermark). The result is unique and unusual but at the same time far more cohesive than you'd expect from such a bunch of highly talented individuals. As for some quick points of discussion beyond how cool it is: How far can you integrate different genres and what does that make the end product? What makes a good collaboration? Is it just post punk with some unusual instrumentation or do the addition of jazz players, even if restrained in their freedom, make it something else? How important can individual instrumentalists be in a genre as typically averse to overt virtuosity as post punk anyway? etc etc.

I'm gonna start pasting in the nominator's blurb and sample so maybe people will be more interested in listening and discussing.  Here's what Oblech said:

&gt;Fully improvised space rock/psychedelic/instrumental album by four swedish musicians who got together to jam a little bit. Apparently members of the band are somewhat known in their local scenes, which is why MBTW is sometimes referred to as a ""supergroup"". Personally I think it's one of the finest works in it's (totally underground) genre, so I try to get these guys as much recognition as I can. I think it could start a discussion about the state of the quality of improvised music in general, it's purpose and recognition it gets.

When it comes to creating music, he takes a strange approach, from sampling things he bangs around his house, to taking that sound and essentially breaking it. Now, breakcore is nothing new (I'm pretty sure we're all familiar with Venetian Snares). However, Lapalux doesn't break the beat using syncopation, he literally breaks apart the sounds to create new tones. I refer to it as ""broken"" music. 

I've got a few examples of Lapalux's music [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fh06Hw5mow), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cGPOaSUAyc), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_kGR7R2p_M).

I know of a few other artists like him, such as Pixelord and Balmy.

But I'm curious to see what everyone's thoughts are on this different notion in electronic music, and perhaps moving towards a more ""organic,"" if you will, sound.

Specifically, whether music should be remastered to improve upon itself and reach new potentials, or whether it should remain more like a piece of art and a reflection of its original conception, subsequently a part of the music itself. I understand that this idea could easily be seen as case specific, but there are general inclinations either way.


For example, the song [Bad Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMHrtedWtfA) by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles certainly presents a less than perfect production. However, let's say a miraculous remaster came about that had clarity and everything was mixed to perfection, would it necessarily be a better song? (I understand there isn't a remaster to compare this to) Personally, I would be more inclined to think that I would prefer the original, since the production gives the song a certain character and aged sound, situating it in an era where quality in production hadn't reached its apex. What I'm trying to say is that it gives it more atmosphere.


However, this could well be seen as over romanticising the issue. Surely if we could hear a digitally remastered version where each channel was clear and everything could be heard in balance with everything else, we would be able to appreciate more and it would make for a better song?


So yeah, I could give more examples but I feel I have rambled on. I guess my question is:

**Should the manner in which an album/song was produced be preserved?** 

**Should it be treated as an aspect of the music itself and a reflection upon the conception of the music?** 

**Or, should music be under the scrutiny of remastering and at any chance of improving production, should production be improved?**


Give any examples you want to of songs that benefit from remastering, or benefit from no remastering, etc

By context, I mean anything from the album cover to the interviews given by the artist surrounding the release. For example, the new Crystal Castles was released today, and I noticed that before I even listened to it properly, I already thought of it as a ""dark"" record, due to its [album cover](http://www.scaddistrict.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/artworks-000031061475-k66hpu-original-e1352144851297.jpg) and [artist interviews](http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8988-crystal-castles/). Same could apply to the new Kendrick Lamar, and almost any other record you can think of.

My question is, do you guys (and girls) think that context can add to and deepen the impact of a record, or do you think it's just marketing that distracts us from the music itself.

1. In a general sense, in what ways do given instrumentations improve music for you?
2. In a more specific sense, are there any particular aspects of any given instrumentations that you really get a kick of out?



For me, I feel that in addition to your standard 4 piece rock band, I really love the addition of some strings and/or horns. I feel that Hey! Rosetta exemplify this beautifully. [A Thousand Suns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViA7aZr4Oe0) and [Yer Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1xegyTordE&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=103s) are two of my favorites. I feel that the variety of strings interspersed with traditional rock instruments adds such an excellent extra layer to the music.




The second, more specific question is really what led me to make this thread and came to me when listening to [Into the Mystic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAnlke_xUY) . I simply love when he sings ""And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home"". A cello (or other stringed instrument, I'm no expert), answers with a fog horn-esque interjection.

**Part 1: Songs Selling Stuff**  
This was all sparked by an [opinion piece in The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/beastie-boy-role-node-rock-stars) that brings up the following and more: 
  
* Beastie Boy Adam Yauch stipulating in his will that none of his music can be used for advertising purposes. 
  
* British Airways using The Clash's 'London Calling' in an Olympics ad.  
  
* John Lyndon from The Sex Pistols hocking butter on the TV.  
  
* Converse resurrecting Ian Curtis and plonking him in a pair of Chucks.  
  
A couple more conflicting opinions I've noticed in recent times:  
  
* Ed Droste (Grizzy Bear) saying [he doesn't care if The Shins are in a McDonald's commercial](http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/33221/Grizzly-Bear-I-dont-care-that-The-Shins-did-a-McDonalds-commercial?page=2).  (Starts halfway down, continues over on page 3)
  
* Volkswagen approached Beach House about using a track for a car ad. Beach House declined because they didn't feel VW's ad was a good fit for the song. VW then made the ad anyway with an [obvious soundalike ripoff](http://stereogum.com/1035911/does-this-volkswagen-ad-rip-off-beach-house/video/).  
  
* Ezra Koenig (Vampire Weekend) and The Black Keys appearing on The Colbert Report to make fun of themselves in a [battle of the sell-outs](http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/7c03f375d1/colbert-welcomes-the-black-keys-and-vampire-weekend-for-a-sell-out-off).  
  
**Part 2: Cool By Association**  
This is where it gets a little grey.  
  
* Converse's three artist/one song series, including the Gorillaz/James Murphy/Andre 3000 collaboration '[DoYaThing](http://play.converse.com/blog/2012/02/23/doyathing/)' which is a pretty great track.  
  
* Anecdotal: a local community radio station devoted a long segment to a pre-recorded package of an iterview with Dan Bejar (The New Pornographers, Destroyer, Swan Lake) about his various musical projects. It was really interesting. The segment was presented by (and I'm assuming produced by) the [Red Bull Music Academy](http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/people).  
  
* Converse, again, and this one has really thrown me for a shoelace loop. They are putting on a guerilla gig series called Acts Of Disruption in Australia and New Zealand. The upcoming show in my city features [Royal Headache](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFFocv8IaDg) and [Kitchen's Floor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxZo9IstNmw). Those are some damn good bands that are not now, and probably never will be, commercially successful. I signed up for a ticket. 
  
**My Questions To You:**  
  
* It's pretty well known that nobody makes money from music like they used to. Do you see attaching a brand to a band as an inevitable annoyance? A sign that a band has made it? A complete cheapening of their art? An otherwise irrelevant business move? 
  
* Is the Red Bull/Converse approach of creating and exposing music to be the cool guys putting on the cool shows a win-win for us and them?  
  
* How far will this go in the future? Can anyone, especially a defunct band, stop their music being used? Will the next Russian Olympics have Pussy Riot soundtrack a vodka commercial?  
  
* If you're in a band or you make music, would you say yes if McDonald's asked to put it in a commercial for big bucks? Would you play a gig for Converse?
