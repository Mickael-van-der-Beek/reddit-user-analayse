Five laps were left and he was leading trying to pass a lap car and got into a pretty nasty wreck. He was taken by ambulance immediately. Within minutes a helicopter was spotted overhead headed for the Oskaloosa hospital. 

After the races I received a ride out with a member of the sherifs posse on a four wheeler and he told us that the helicopter was Life Flight coming to pick up Tony. The race just finished. It does not look like this has been reported anywhere as of yet. 

Edit :This just came out of the Des Moines register news paper.

Well yesterday , my mom is at work. She works at Advance Auto Parts, and has worked there for the longest time, and she busts her ass every day, one of the hardest working people I've ever met. She is changing a battery for someone, and it turns out to be the Pilot for Dale Jr. He calls Dale JR and he actually talks to my mom and thanks her for continuing to be a fan of his even though he has went through his winless drought.

I was born in the mid-90s right around when Jeff broke through. I got in to NASCAR right around the year 2002. All because of a hat. It was a DuPont hat with the rainbow tornadoes on it. I thought that thi was so cool. I immediately started to watch NASCAR and grew to be a huge Jeff Gordon fan. I've never seen him win a championship. I've ever seen him win 13 times in a single season. But I will tell you hat since he 2002 Daytona 500, I haven't missed a race. 
Every week I would look forward to Friday to watch Jeff qualify. Then Saturday to watch him practice. Then Sunday to watch the race. It was the highlight of my week. And it still is. I'm 17 now and I look forward to every single race just for the hope of that chance that Jeff could win. Lately it has become rare. All I can do is hear about the 13 and 10 wins in 97 and 98. Hear about the championships in 95, 97, 98, and 01.  I know that it might sound unreasonable because he has won around 30 races between 2002 and now but it's nothing compared to the 48 from 95-98. As slim as a chance as it may be I hope to god he wins at least 1 more championship. But thank you Jeff for giving me something to look forward to every week or 11 years. I don't know what I'll do when you're gone. But thank you.",,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,24b,True,t3_1e9yng,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1e9yng/thank_you_jeff_gordon/,

You guys were so helpful getting me up to speed I figured I should return the favor in whatever small way I could.

First, a quick note of my history to understand where I'm coming from.  F1 fan for about 5 years, attended my first GP last November at [CotA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_of_the_Americas) in Austin, TX with general admission seating on the grass.  This past weekend I was offered a package deal through work which had me in the Roberts tower along with the Sprint FanZone.  So, better accommodations at Daytona, although I only was at the track on race day.  Also, I have no idea what the fan experience for F1 is like outside of CotA so my comparisons might be off depending on where you live.

**The Good**

* NASCAR knows how to keep their fans engaged.  I've never attended a sporting event where you could get this close to the people and the machines that make it happen.  From viewer voting, the ability to look into the garages (and write messages on the window), the presentation of the drivers, the ability to stand next to the cars as they go through scrutineering (not sure what NASCAR calls this, the inspection before the race), to walking along pit row and the rest of the track, everything is setup so a few hundred thousand people all have the chance to feel like they're a part of the action.  F1 is terrible at this - all the teams, drivers, cars, etc are well out of reach to the common fan.  Tickets are crazy expensive, and even if you drop a few thousand you're still unlikely to get anywhere near the cars or drivers or teams themselves (based on my experience at CotA).  NASCAR understands that marketing to the ""everyman"" is their bread and butter, and they do this better than any sport I've ever attended.  Great showing from their end.

* The price.  F1 is just exploitative in their pricing of literally everything.  The least expensive shirt on sale in November was a normal color printed T-shirt for $120.  Prices went up from there.  Tickets are ridiculously priced, merch is just insultingly priced.  NASCAR tickets were something like a fifth of the cost of equivalent F1 grandstand seating.  I realize [Bernie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Ecclestone) needs to get his billions because [his daughters need expensive homes](http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/15/bernie-ecclestones-daughter-buying-most-expensive-house-in-the/), but goddamn F1 hundred and twenty dollar T-shirts are nothing but a big fuck you to the fans.  NASCAR merch is the same price that you'd pay for any other T-shirt: $15.  That's how you treat a fan.

* I know they've had 55 years to figure this out, but they've got their shit on lockdown come race day.  As expected, the entire event is well organized from crowd control, vending, ushers, police, etc.  Everyone I encountered was polite and professional.  Getting a few hundred thousand drunk NASCAR fans safely into and out of the raceway is a monster organizing task which they handled well.

* THE SOUND!  Holy crap the thunder from 40 of these cars roaring past you is something you just can't describe without being there.  As a fan of anything with a go-fast button, the experience was amazing.  I was wearing hearing protection for most of the race, but I just had to take it off a few times so I could experience the full force of these machines as they thundered past.  Breathtaking.

* These cars are durable!  Being an F1 fan (and a fan of exploding jet dryers) I was rooting for Juan Pablo Montoya.  I was pretty sad to see him taken out early in the race, and started watching Danica with my wife.  Some 15-20 minutes later, there's number 42 back on the track with the number 2 slapped back on the door in what appeared to be white duct tape.  HOLY SHIT JPM IS BACK ON TRACK!  You can do that?!?!?  An F1 car that gets damaged in any real sense is done for the day.  These guys were banging dents out, taping shit back together, or just plain racing without half the body panels.  This is awesome, and it makes the race so much more fun.

* I had a lot of suggestions to pick up a scanner and I'm very glad I did.  I rented the FanVision thing which was not as useful as I would have hoped apart from the scanner portion.  Being able to listen to the teams and track officials was a *huge* help in understanding what was happening on the track.  F1 teams use encrypted coms to prevent other teams from listening in.  NASCAR wins huge points on this and I wouldn't even consider going to a race without a scanner now.

**The not-as-good**

* The NASCAR marketing goes a little overboard with the fan engagement bordering on pandering.  NASCAR has a long heritage of racing stock cars 50 years ago, but the modern cars are about as far away from stock as it's possible to get in closed wheel racing.  NASCAR is a spec series, not a stock series, but they refuse to admit it.  They keep making mention of the history of ""race on Sunday, showroom on Monday"", but that's absurdly and obviously not true any longer and hasn't been for decades.  Stock series like Ferrari Challenge and the various touring car or LeMans series use actual stock cars, race prepped for safety.  That's a stock car.  NASCAR cars are fucking amazing, race-tuned thoroughbred monsters!  There's not a single part there that you could find on a dealer lot, and as far as I'm concerned, that's good!  I know they want to pander to their sponsors, but watching a real Chevy SS race for 500 miles wouldn't be anywhere near as exciting as the machines I witnessed this weekend.  It seems like NASCAR is afraid to share the technology under the hood with the fans in order to keep with their mythology of racing factory cars back in the 50s and 60s.  I think it does a discredit to the fans and is bordering on dishonest.  The cars are amazing - flaunt it!

* Most of the race progressed like an F1 race when it comes to passing.  I know this is a result of the high banked super speedway type track, but for a majority of the race the cars were lined up in one long single file as they logged more laps.  I'm used to this in F1, but at least they're braking, turning, etc - meaning, they're out there driving their asses off just to keep in position.  In NASCAR, it really feels like the majority of the race is sitting on the bumper of the car in front and waiting a few dozen laps for a yellow flag or something to happen so you might be able to grab a few positions through pit strategy.  NASCAR fans continually complain about how boring F1 races are - have they even watched 90% of a NASCAR race?  It's even worse - they aren't even shifting or braking, and they certainly aren't passing.  This was, hands down, the least exciting race event I've ever watched in terms of pure racing.

**Some additional thoughts**

* Danica Patrick is a fucking amazing driver and her gender doesn't even enter into it.  After JPM got knocked out I changed the scanner over to her channel and didn't change it for the rest of the race.  Her interaction with her team was the most civilized, thoughtful, and just generally matter-of-fact exchange between race team members that I think I've ever heard.  She brings a level of civility and professionalism to the sport that her male counterparts would do well to learn.  Obviously NASCAR understands the marketing potential she brings to the table, but outside of all of that, she's just a damn amazing driver and I expect much of her as she begins her NASCAR career.  If I'm rooting for anybody at this point, it's Danica, and she's earned it.

Finally, thanks again to everyone here at /r/NASCAR for answering my original questions.

You guys are the heart of this sport and NASCAR would definitely not be the same without its incredible fans. I hope other sports fans in other sports arenas understand why we say a prayer before we race and why each driver's spouse and child kiss their driver before they strap in. You just never know if that's gonna be you're last time to do it. So thank y'all for being such an incredible fan base. We are a family because we all unite on one thing. Racing.

I'm going to submit posts on the two subs that won't have a race going with a link to the discussion post of the sub that will have a race happening.

Race 1 is the Monaco Grand Prix so a link to the [r/Formula1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/) discussion thread a bit before the race is about to begin to [r/NASCAR] (http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/) and [r/IndyCar] (http://www.reddit.com/r/INDYCAR/).

To start, Stewart just caught the wrong end of the stick he readily dishes out to oh-so-many people. Of course Logano was gonna block you--it was the end of a race he had been running towards the front of almost all day! Logano not giving up that spot on the restart was evidence that he (and many other drivers) are scrambling to not just finish well, but also win, and that's awesome. I loved Stewart's lack of inhibition afterwards, but if he had good finishes the first four races of the year instead of the generally dismal finishes he actually has had, I doubt he would have been so worked up. I understand that potentially winning down to 22 is a serious blow to your season's start, but to act like Logano did anything no other driver (including Stewart himself) would have done is ludicrous.

Now, Logano and Hamlin dueling it out for the last few laps. I'd say both of them were equally too aggressive with each other in the next to last lap--maybe Logano was even more aggressive then Hamlin when he want to pin him to the wall, but then again Hamlin was trying to take a spot on Logano's right that really didn't exist. But on that last lap it looked like they both calmed down and realized that Busch was charging while they were rubbing. I don't think Logano tried to do anything in that final turn except overdrive it--AKA he didn't try to run Hamlin into the wall, but he did drive it too hard. That was foolish, but I don't think him getting into Hamlin was intentional.

In fact, it actually looks like Hamlin turned down into Logano's rear bumper intentionally after Logano slid into him. One could argue that he was trying to get low and out of the way, but I think Hamlin really did try to spin him--his movement on the track was just too sudden to be anything else.

But after the race, for Logano to say that Hamlin got what was coming to him was really confusing to me, because it looked like the accident was really just good racing gone wrong. He's definitely trying to fight out of the choir boy image everyone has painted of him, but he can do it with the kind of hard racing he gave Hamlin at the end without trying to sound like he's intentionally wrecking people.

And Smoke doing anything to Logano on the track is going to slam a fine on him pretty fast, I think. And bonus for me: Jr.'s sitting pretty at the top after Keselowski got sucked up the middle line at the final restart!!!

You could drive 200 straight at that damn thing and the most you would get is sliced up parts flying through it, the impact was even at a gated area, the weakest point of the entire system and it held. The cables are near an inch thick placed about 2 feet apart and up at least 10 feet above the wall, they are spliced with multiple clamps and attached to steel flanges buried in concrete every 100 feet or so.

I have seen the fence many times, touched it and was amazed at how sturdy it looked. Just seeing it makes you realize the forces it was designed to contain. The pictures and video do not depict how imposing a structure it is.

**OP is a fag... after carefully reviewing the slo-mo taken at a better angle, I go with my original theory, the gate failed, badly.**

http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/193qlx/since_all_the_youtube_vids_are_getting_blocked_i/c8kibuw

This thread is me right after the crash, I suspected no cables at the gate, implying stuff went through there.

I was talked out of it...

Anyway this thread was awesome I think we may have fixed the world.

[Props to this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/194k9m/the_catch_fence_did_what_it_was_designed_to_do/c8kt8kh)

I finally got what he meant by the angle and where the tire crossed the plane of the fence.

[0:24 tells the real story here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdv0eC8zovQ)

I am always trying to figure out the forensics of crashes, I did not have this vid to watch when I posted this thread.

The gate, that damn gate.


**Conclusions of this inquest:**

+ A tire/wheel/A-frame assembly penetrated the crossover gate, resulting in a destroyed TV camera a camera-man with a huge load in his boxers and a Baadyear for a couple of fans.

+ It could have been worse, it could have been today, with the seats and the fudge packed.

+ Shit Happens

+ OP thanks everyone for an awesome fact-finding meeting

***The Basics***

**Yellow Flag (Caution):** Indication of an incident or debris on the track. No passing under yellow flag conditions. Pit roads are generally closed directly after a caution until the field is set, then pit road is open for pit stops. See this video of the use of a yellow flag. When the accident starts, the caution flag is waived and the field is frozen. [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYTPQrovA0k&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Black Flag:** When someone is black flagged they have 5 laps to pit. Drivers get black flagged for either breaking a rule or having car problems that affect the track / safety / flow of the race. See this video of Jimmie Johnson being black flagged for jumping the restart: [Example](http://youtu.be/rhJnBWp1-lQ)

**Red Flag:** The race is stopped, no pit stops can happen. Used in scenarios where unsafe for the vehicles to move across the racing surface, like in bad weather conditions or after a major accident requiring cleanup and/or work to the track itself. In this video, there is highly flammable jet fuel on the race track that needs to be cleaned, thus the cars are parked until cleanup is done. [Example](http://youtu.be/BtJ25vXnIMM)

**Pit Stops:** Short maintenance stop to allow repairs / new tires / fuel for a car to continue the race. A great explanation of a pit stop: [Example](http://youtu.be/gzbhpHfqJiI)

**Drafting:** I'll give you the short of drafting. Imagine you're driving on the interstate, roll down your window and stick your hand out like you're trying to give someone a high five. You immediately experience wind resistance blowing your hand back. Notice how hard it is to hold your hand steady? Now get behind a tractor trailer and do the same thing. Notice there's not as much wind resistance? That's because the truck in front of you is moving the air away from your line of travel. Less wind resistance against your hand, the easier it is (and less effort) to hold it up. Same goes in nascar racing. The vehicles are moving at a speed where wind resistance is holding them back under full throttle. Tagging behind another car allows you to maintain speed without having to fight the wind resistance, which usually means you're not using as much throttle. This sometimes allows for fuel conservation, and is a viable strategy. Also, under the same power load you may be a MPH or two faster than the vehicle in front of you, so the draft is used for getting a small speed boost to pass a vehicle. In this video, watch the M&amp;M car: [Example](http://youtu.be/80th39DyurA)

**Loose:** Ever heard of drifting? Fishtailling? That's the definition of being loose. The rear tires are losing traction and are sliding out of control. Also called ""oversteer."" Watch the yellow car in this video, you see several instances of being ""loose."" [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne5BnrkwJ8c&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Tight:** The exact opposite of ""loose"" obviously. The front tires are not getting enough grip, and sliding. ""Understeering"" is the term used here. Example from the truck series of a vehicle being ""tight"" and running up the track into the wall [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvV0WIyupzk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Restrictor Plate:** This is a plate that is installed in the engine, mandated by Nascar, to alter the racing of certain tracks. Their purpose is to limit the amount of air and fuel the engine consumes, thus limiting the performance of the vehicle to what Nascar deems as a ""safe speed."" A side effect of this is that the racing is usually very close and the performance gap is bridged. It is at restrictor plate races that underdog wins usually happen. Anyone who knows nascar knows what im about to post... [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brGT0eVao2A&amp;feature=youtu.be) [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35n20PrJRk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Roof Flaps:** Ok, i know this really doesnt reflect strategy at all... but it is representative of the restrictor plate races, as well as any other race where a vehicle may be spun at a high rate of speed. There are flaps on top of the car that lift up when the car is travelling backwards. They are intended to prevent the car from flipping, as when a car is going backwards there is very little natural downforce. Video of a crash before roof flaps: [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLdvjpFYcIs&amp;feature=youtu.be) Now in this video, the roof flaps engaged which prevented the car from getting further airborne: [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vTdpEvrZ7U&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Lucky dog:** When a yellow flag waves, whichever driver was the first in the running order who was behind by 1 lap or more when the field is locked gets one lap ""back"". In other words he has one of his deficit laps erased. If he was down by 1 lap, that will put him back on the lead lap and allow him to compete with the leaders again. Seems kinda like cheating, doesn't it? So why do it? It's two-fold:

There was a safety issue for years, where when a yellow flag was initially waved, the cars would be able to race back to the start/finish line--at which point the order in which they cross the line would determine where they line up for the caution laps. If drivers were a lap down, but driving right next to the leaders at the time, they could attempt to race the leaders back to the start/finish line--if they crossed before the leaders, they'd get a lap back. However, there would clearly be times where that race back to the finish line would go right past the wreck or debris that brought out the caution. So they stopped the racing back to the finish, but used the Lucky Dog as a way to still give the best running lap-down driver a lap back. The SECOND reason to do this has to do with situations when the first driver 1 lap or more down is running in the middle of the pack. There's a little less incentive to be competitive back there since they can't beat the leader to the start/finish line. Well, that driver might be around another driver who is a lap down. So now those two drivers can race each other to be the first driver a lap down so they can get the Lucky Dog if a caution comes out. So: it makes racing among the lap-down drivers more competitive.

**Wave around:** During a caution, the lead lap drivers are permitted to use pit road 1 lap before the lap-down drivers are permitted to. If the lap-down drivers pit, they remain the same number of laps down as they were before they pitted. If a driver stays out during the entirety of the caution and does not pit, he can get 1 lap back. He'll literally drive past the pace car and lap the track, and join the field in the back of the pack just before the green flag waves again. This is called the ""wave around"", or ""wave around lap"". The downside to this strategy move is that the driver using the wave around did not get the chance to refill on fuel or replace his old tires. This is a great idea if the wave around is taken on a caution that broke out within a few laps of another caution ended during which time the wave around driver DID pit.

**Competition caution:** A competition caution is a caution flag thrown out at a predetermined point in the race. For example, they might throw one at lap 20. If a regular caution breaks out around lap 20 due to weather, debris, or a crash, it will serve as the competition caution. The purpose of the competition caution is to allow drivers and crews to make adjustments to their cars without sacrificing track position. Why do it? There will be race weekends where, for some reason or another (typically due to weather, however possibly due to very new mandated changes to the cars), the drivers will experience driving conditions during the race that they had not been able to practice for. Often times, these new conditions make it very difficult to set the cars up properly for the race. So the drivers race for a few laps, they and their crews figure out what needs to be changed, then the competition caution allows them to make the change without falling behind. During races that have a planned competition caution, drivers are not allowed to pit for gas before the competition caution. Any pit stops made before the competition caution (under yellow or otherwise) can involve tire changes, but cars cannot be refueled.

Really, there isn't anything that happens during a competition caution that doesn't happen during a regular caution--the primary difference is that for one reason or another, it is predetermined that a caution will happen at a certain lap.

---
***Strategies***

**1. Short pitting**

This is a tactic where a driver/team will attempt to erase some or all of a gap by pitting before another car. The strategy is that Car 1 and 2 will be on old tires nearing their 'pit windows'. Generally, there is some time lost due to old tires - lets say .5 seconds per lap. If car #2 is 3 seconds behind car #1, he can try to ""short pit"" car #1. The goal is to be out on fresh tires while car #1 is on old tires, thereby erasing .5 seconds per lap of the difference on the track.

**2. Fuel Mileage**

Coming down to the end of a race, teams will attempt to stretch their fuel mileage in order to gain or maintain track position against rival teams. With the EFI in the new cars its a bit more difficult to do, but you will see teams trying to stretch their mileage 'back off' (coast) earlier on entry to the corner, drive at partial throttle and even turn the engine off and roll during cautions.

**3. 2 Tires, 4 Tires &amp; Gas-and-Gos**

Another strategy used to gain or maintain position on the track. In the pits, it generally takes 12-14 seconds to change all 4 tires and gas up the car. To try and gain an advantage, teams may chose to only change 2 Tires, which saves 3-5 seconds, or just put gas in the car and save even more. The downside of this depends on the difference in lap times between new tires and old tires. At tracks like Charlotte, new tires can make the car 1-2 seconds per lap faster, while at tracks like Talladega, the difference is marginal.

**4. Rim-Riding** (Queue Larry McReynolds: Hes gawn to the HIGHSIDE!)

While the preferable racing line at most tracks is for the cars to be close to the wall on the straights, and down on the while line in the corners - some drivers try to run the high line. This can help a car maintain its momentum better, and have an advantage at the end of the straights...which is coincidentally one of the best opportunities to make a pass. A car running the high line will actually drive farther, but since the radius of the turn is less, that car can achieve a higher speed through the corner and be at a higher speed exiting the corner, accelerating more down the straight. The goal of all strategies is to gain an advantage, and win the Race. Conveniently the best way to accomplish both of those (at all but 2 tracks - Daytona &amp; Talladega) is to be the car leading the field in 'clean air'. The Gen-6 cars punch a BIG hole in the air and the large spoilers on the back create a lot of turbulence. This 'dirty air' affects the aerodynamic efficiency of the cars and actually can reduce downforce. The leader doesnt have to deal with any of this, and has a distinct advantage.

1367344907.0,42,self.NASCAR,1dfax1,Do You Think Race Car Drivers are Athletes?,davan,50,8,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1dfax1/do_you_think_race_car_drivers_are_athletes/,"I thought I'd go ahead and share an article I wrote last year for a local fitness magazine (I welcome your comments!):


Do You Think Race Car Drivers Are Athletes?


It’s a question loaded with debate and has been under the media spotlight ever since The Associated Press announced their 2009 Male Athlete of the year.  Five-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion, Jimmie Johnson, was the subject of much scrutiny when the announcement was made.

From my spot on the bench the answer to this question is an absolute, YES!  Those who disagree have never experienced the tremendous conditions inside a professional race car. 
Let’s look at the facts (source: ESPN Sport Science)

•	During a 500 mile Sprint Cup race, a driver is subject to up to 3G’s of force.  That’s the equivalent of doing 800 reps of a 40 pound weight over the duration of the 4 hour race!  At 3G’s, a 160 pound driver feels like he weighs 480 pounds!

•	A driver can lose up to 3.5 pints of sweat per hour.  That can be as much as 15 pounds of water weight during the course of the event. 

•	Driver’s heart rates have been recorded at a sustained 130 beats per minute for the entire duration of a race.  That’s over 30,000 beats over 4 hours, exceeding most long-distance running events.

•	Body core temperatures reach 101 degrees F, while in-car temperatures soar over 130 degrees.


And we’ve only touched on the physical side of the debate.  A race car driver must be at the top of their game when it comes to reflexes, quick thinking and hand-eye co-ordination.  They must be able to process a lot of information at a high rate of speed. At 200 miles per hour, a 1/10th of a second reaction time translates to two entire car lengths.  Being mere inches away from your competition, milliseconds is the difference between victory lane and a torn-up race car.

With the incredible forces exerted on a driver, the high temperatures, the effort, agility, focus and reflexes required to maintain control of a car in excess of 200 miles per hour, it most certainly takes an ATHLETE to compete at this level.

1368128318.0,37,self.NASCAR,1e0r2j,Let's talk about when cars go upside down...,krayziepunk13,47,10,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1e0r2j/lets_talk_about_when_cars_go_upside_down/,"Ryan Newman is very upset about the end of last Sundays race, which is understandable. However, I don't get why he is blaming NASCAR and saying they ""can't get their heads out of their asses far enough to keep them on the race track."" 

NASCAR has made incredible strides in keeping the cars from going airborne. Roof flaps alone made a big difference and then you had the shark fin, and it seems to get better. This year NASCAR introduced much larger roof flaps along with hood flaps, all with the intentions of raising liftoff speed.

So why did Kurt Busch flip over and land on top of Ryan Newman's car? Roof flaps are designed to prevent blowovers.  Before roof flaps were introduced, it was a regular occurance for cars to take off like airplanes the spun at high speed. Roof flaps cannot prevent a roll over like what happened Sunday. This is not because the roof flaps failed, because they weren't made for those types of situations. It all has to do with forces and friction.

Kurt Busch was travelling around 200 MPH when his car was hit in the left rear quarterpanel. This caused his car to violently turn sideways. As the car turned, the drivers side tires gripped into the asphalt, causing the car to turn over. [Ryan Newman suggested](http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-05-07/talladega-wreck-kurt-busch-ryan-newman-landed-on-hood-standings-schedule) that slowing the cars down could prevent this from happening in the future. You would have to slow the cars down below highway speed for that to work, because this exact same scenario happens to passanger cars all the time. There really isn't anything that can be done about it, at least not that I could possible think of. 

If Ryan Newman got out of the car after [this crash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ8o38eK-KI) and said the same thing, I would agree with him. That was 100% NASCAR's fault, because of the COT wing. Jeff Gordon was going about 150 MPH in [this crash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9_WlnGEbbI) at the moment he was hit in the side and his car turned over. By the time he started rolling, he was probably going between 50-75 MPH. [Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSA7HtDEXKA) of a V8 Supercar in a similar scenario as Kurt Busch, but at a much slower speed. Notice how quickly he turns over and how violently he flips. 

I'm sorry for the long rant, but it annoys me that someone who has spent his entire life racing cars doesn't understand how these things happen. Blowover's are the worst way a car can turn upside down, and NASCAR has done a great job with that. The roof flaps even did their jobs in Carl Edwards crash at Talladega and Kyle Larson crash at Daytona. They both only ended up in the catch fence because of hard contact from another car that lifted their cars into the wind. Think about how much worse those crashes could have been without roof flaps.

I've been doing this awhile and using some of this to look at racing, currently NASCAR. The first part of my series is to look into the career of the modern-era champion (1972-2012) and determine how long of a career they had, what age they won their first championship and other data qualities.
I will be referencing this chart in the coming series. Essentially this is a baseline, its not meant to do anything more than provide the average career length of retired drivers, the years taken to win a cup championship and the age at which that was accomplished.

Of Note: I only calculate a drivers career in the modern era, nothing prior to 1972 is included, including Age. For Example Petty's first championship in the modern era was at 35.

*- Active prior to 1972 on a full-time basis

**- Currently a Full-Time Active driver

Firstly, Richard Petty's actual career statistics make very little impact on the results so I left his modern era totals in.

I also did not include any active driver in the career length average as it skews the data slightly.

Using the data you can see that Earnhardt was the best driver of the modern era with 7 championships in 3 generations of car. Aside from that you can easily see the ""drivers of the generation"" take shape. Petty was clearly a Gen 2 driver, Waltrip a Gen 3, Gordon a Gen 4 and Johnson a Gen 5 driver. Petty won nearly all of his races in a Generation 2 car, Waltrip collected all of his 84 victories in a Generation 3 car.

You can also see that you have some pretty large outliers. Bobby Allison won his first championship at the age of 45 and is the oldest in the modern era followed by Dale Jarrett at 42. Both drivers took a significant amount of time to win a championship as well in there 13th and 12th seasons respectively. Benny Parsons and Dale Earnhardt were the quickest champs winning in their 2nd seasons as a full-time driver. The youngest champ is Jeff Gordon at 23, followed by Kurt Busch at 25.

In Part 2 I will be using this data to make predictions about current drivers and their probability of a championship before they retire. It will probably be posted tomorrow.",,False,,t5_2qs08,1376577444.0,,42b,True,t3_1kdakf,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1kdakf/nascar_analytics_part_1_the_career_of_the_modern/,

A couple examples would be...

Texas in April (Eddie Gossage is always up for something different plus TMS is near a huge market so you wouldn't see a huge drop in attendance)
Coke 600 (Monday is a Memorial Day, plus this would also free up many drivers to do the Indy 500/Coke 600 double!)
Atlanta (Monday is Labor Day)

Possibly more but just a few examples, I think it would really open up NASCAR to more people, especially outside of Football season. What does everyone else think?",,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,29,True,t3_188wxp,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/188wxp/monday_night_nascar/,

The mindset and experience of racers has changed over the years. Nascar's popularity (and paychecks) have attracted lots of drivers from other disciplines of racing. Lots of those drivers have been turning left AND right for a lot of their careers. 

I think it's time for Nascar to take a look at other venues to put more Cup/Nationwide series races. The Watkins Glen and Sonoma races are are getting better every year. I think it's time to drop another road course or two on the schedule. 

The logistics of doing that are hardcore, of course. The Nascar schedule is jammed packed as it is and the tracks that have the dates now have so much money and time invested in to the races that they host. Somehow, someway, somebody loses money and exposure but some other track also gains those things. That's just how it goes but if Nascar could find more road course facilities that could host a Nascar weekend, I think it would be good for the sport.

***Car Adjustments***

There is only one adjustment a driver can make by him(her)self in the car, and that's brake bias. The driver can adjust the brakes using a knob in the middle of the dashboard that either makes the brakes relatively stronger in the front or in the rear. This adjustment, like most, is made because the car is either too loose or too tight.

The most common adjustments made during a pit stop by the pit crew are: tire pressure, ""wedge"", ""track bar"", ""spring rubbers"", and tape on the grill...

**Tape on the grill:** the grill on a stock car is a very short and wide opening--it's NOT the decal that looks like a grill, though. The bigger the grill opening, the cooler the engine will stay while racing. The smaller the grill opening, the more front downforce (and therefore, more front tire grip) the car will have. So teams will try to keep the grill opening as small as possible while keeping the engine from overheating. There's only so far the grill opening can be widened, though: NASCAR dictates the maximum size of it.

**Tire pressure:** This adjustment is made before the driver pits, so that the tires can just be slapped right on and be ready to go when the time comes. Stock cars run tire pressures much lower than you have in your car--sometimes as little as 10 psi, so tire pressure adjustments are often in very small increments--sometimes as little as +/-0.25 psi, which would be announced as ""they're taking a quarter pound of air out of the left front tire"", for instance. That's another thing: tire pressure is adjusted individually so as to maximize grip. There are minimum tire pressures mandated by NASCAR, though, just like there are maximum grill sizes.

**Wedge:** This is an adjustment of how much force is applied to one of the rear springs. [HowStuffWorks](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/jobs/nascar-wedge-adjustment2.htm) put it nicely: ""Compressing the spring of a left-rear wheel or **adding wedge** puts more of the car's weight on that corner. This adds pressure to that end of the car just like putting the paper wedge underneath the table leg. As with the table, the corresponding diagonal corner of the vehicle gets more of the car's weight. So if you increase the tension in the left-rear wheel, the left-rear and right-front wheels will hold a larger share of the car's total weight than the right-rear and left-front wheels.

The reverse happens if you reduce the tension on the left-rear wheel's spring or **subtract wedge**. In our analogy, that would be equivalent to cutting short a table leg. It would increase the weight on the right-rear and left-front wheels. This is why a crew may need to adjust only one wheel when a race car needs to add or subtract wedge.

The diagonally related weight between the left-rear and right-front wheels is referred to as cross-weight or simply wedge. It is often measured as a percentage of the vehicle's total weight. When more than 50 percent of the car's weight is on the left-rear and right-front wheels, the car is said to have more wedge."" Read more if you want to there--it's a pretty thorough page! The short of it:
Decreased wedge makes a car looser (oversteer) by making the weight supported by the front wheels in a turn more even, while making the weight supported by the rear wheels more UNeven in a turn. 

Decreased wedge allows a driver to enter a turn a bit faster, but makes it tough to exit since getting on the gas too soon might turn a looser car into a spinning car.

Increased wedge makes a car tighter (understeer) by making the weight supported by the REAR wheels more even in a turn, and the weight supported by the fronts more uneven. Increased wedge gives a driver more control as he exits a turn, but makes it tougher to enter it since he might not be able to turn enough to miss the wall.

**Track bar:** The details of what a track bar is are a bit above me, [but thanks to this article](http://bump-drafts.com/2009/08/04/track-bar-adjustments-explained/) , I understand it better. I'll let you read his words on what exactly it is, but here's the short of it: the track bar adjusts the angle at which the sideways force of the car moving through the turn is applied to the rear tires. If you raise the track bar, the force is applied to a higher point on the rear tires, making the car more loose, and if the track bar is lowered, the force is applied to a lower point on the rear tires, making the car tighter.

**Spring rubbers:** these are literally blocks of rubber that get inserted between the coils of the springs. They could be inserted at any corner of the car, however they are probably the most time consuming adjustment a team can make during a pit stop, so these are likely to be last-ditch effort adjustments. [Here's what they look like, along with yet another thorough explanation I'll attempt to summarize for ya.](http://www.stockcarracing.com/techarticles/39758_what_are_spring_rubbers/) Adding a spring rubber will ""increase the spring rate"", e.g. make the spring stiffer. Teams often start with spring rubbers already in the rear springs, and will add a spring rubber to the right front (or left rear) to make the car tighter, or add a spring rubber to the left front (or right rear) to make it looser.

Curiously, spring rubbers and wedge are closely related, as they impact how the car handles the cross weight through a turn.

***Technical Information***

**Drive Train:** NASCAR Sprint Cup 'Gen 6' cars (2013-present) are 3300 lbs (~1500kg), with mandated left/right minimums of 1680/1620lbs respectively. (Without per-side limitations, teams would likely try to move more weight to the left on left-turning ovals, e.g. all but 2 races.)

The **engines** are somewhat 'old school' in design, using a single camshaft and pushrods to actuate the 2 valves/cylinder. They are 358 cubic inches (5.8L) in a v8 configuration and develop in excess of 850hp, typically revving under 9000rpm. They are normally aspirated and, as of 2012, fuel injected (with ECUs heavily regulated to be standardized across all cars). The fuel used is an 85% gasoline / 15% ethanol blend at 98 octane; the fuel cells are in the 'trunk' area and hold about 18 gallons. At the two 'superspeedways' (Daytona and Talladega) the engines are limited to 400-500hp by a 'restrictor plate' between the throttle body and intake manifold that restrict air intake. The size of these plates are determined by NASCAR, which aims for a top speed 'in the draft' right around 200mph. Teams are limited to one engine per weekend.

The engine is in the front, with the drive wheels at the back. They are connected through a 4 speed, manual; H pattern **gearbox**, using a clutch pedal on the floor. The transmissions are set up to allow shifting without clutch use as needed. Other than the two road courses and (depending on driver/car) Pocono, races are run in 4th gear (mandated to be 1:1) with the exception of pitting and cautions, of course. The transmission connects to the rear end, where you'll find a very tough limited-slip differential in a bog standard solid axle housing. Teams are given a choice between two rear-end gear ratios for each given race weekend.

While the front **suspension** is double-wishbone, the rear end is attached with two 'truck arm' trailing arms and a track or 'panhard' bar to limit lateral motion. There is a single coilspring and shock absorber on each corner. Spring rates or 'weight' may be mandated by NASCAR at some tracks (e.g. 500lb minimum rear springs at Daytona/Talladega to keep the spoiler in the air).

There is only one type of **tire** provided by Goodyear for any race weekend, but the construction and compounds change from track to track. Sprint Cup teams are not limited to any number of tires in a race weekend, but typically don't use more than 8 sets. The tires are slick radials mounted on 15” steel rims with 5 lug nuts.

**Data Acquisition/Car Adjustments:** There is no data from the car being sent to the crews during a race, aside from what the driver says verbally. The steering wheel has up to 2 buttons, one for radio and one as an emergency kill switch. The gauges are far closer to road cars than F1 or IndyCar, using needle dials to indicate RPM, oil temp and pressure, and water temperature. As noted above, other than steering, braking, and acceleration the only adjustment that can be made inside the car is brake bias. During practices (and after the race) teams are allowed to pull data off the ECU.

**Pit Crews:** Pit crews in NASCAR consist of 6 men: front and rear tire changers, front and rear tire carriers, a jack man, and the gas man. Crews may get permission from NASCAR to have an extra man 'over the wall' for windshield tear-offs. The pneumatic lug guns used by the tire changers typically operate in excess of 400psi. The gas man carries a ~90lb gravity-fed 'can' of fuel which is sufficient to fill the tank about ½ to 2/3 full; most 4 tire pit stops involve at least part of a second can. The crew may not go over the pit wall until the car is within 3 pit boxes of its own pit. Each car has its own crew chief, pit crew, and pit, which brings us to politics:

**Teams:** A given owner in NASCAR may own up to 4 cars. While not at the track, during practice, and prior to the race, these drivers/crew chiefs/crews may consider themselves teammates, share information on car setups, work out of the same shops,etc. Once the race starts, each car is typically operated as a single entity. There's too much ego in NASCAR for team orders. The pre-race information sharing also extends beyond a given shop: e.g. Stewart-Haas racing buys car chassis and engines from Hendrick Motorsports and may share information back and forth on what setups work for the given track and tire combination.

ESPN to cut back?: NASCAR has signed one contract for 2015-2022, for the first 13 Cup races, with Fox Sports, which includes the new Fox Sports 1 that replaces Speed in August. Fox considered it a priority to get NASCAR as one of its anchor sports for its all-sports Fox Sports 1 network, so it already signed a deal for 2015-2022 (at a 36% rate increase). While the sport might have lost some of its buzz, Fox Sports recognized the loyalty of NASCAR fans to watch its programming. It will eventually put some Cup races on that cable network to boost its profile. The big question now turns to who will televise the remaining 23 races of the season. Right now, TNT has six and ESPN/ABC has 17. NBC is expected to make a run at NASCAR. It could replace TNT for those six races but there's also speculation it could take 12 or 13 races and ESPN/ABC gets the final 10 or 11 events. With Turner relinquishing NASCAR.com to NASCAR, it makes little sense for it to have the six races. It's not enough time to really get in a good flow. The TNT telecasts aren't bad at all, but it's just too short of a bridge from Fox to ESPN for any continuity or for the announcers to get into a groove. If NBC lands races, that would put more Cup events on network television, which is important considering the addition of cable races to the Fox portion of the schedule.(Sporting News)(5-15-2013)""

Granted, he is a symbol for some of the best NASCAR racing ever. But someone's going to have to bring it back, so why not let it be the Dillons? 

Reason #1: Drivers don't care about the sponsors and the numbers nearly as much as the fans do. I think it was Kasey Kahne who recently brought this up in an interview. Drivers can and usually do switch numbers at least once in their career. Look at Clint Bowyer from the 33 to the 15 or Matt Kenseth from the 17 to the 20. Neither seemed too torn up.

Reason #2: Most people ignore the fact that Richard Childress drove the 3 before Dale even thought about it. But when RC stopped racing, Dale took over the number. It's RC's number to start with.

Reason #3: Dale's been dead over a decade. New generations of NASCAR fans are coming into the sport, not realizing or knowing the significance behind the number, so this whole rift is deterring people who don't understand. 

Reason #4: Again, Dale's been dead for 12 years. 

Reason #5: RC has said that the number is special, since Dale was one of his best friends and his grandsons idolized the guy. The only people that he would let drive it are either his family or family of Earnhardt. 

Reason #6: NASCAR wouldn't work if numbers were retired. It works in other sports because numbers are retired within individual teams. Someone plays the #19 for the Chargers doesn't mean the Raiders do. But NASCAR is universal, so if they retire every number the greats drove, they'd run out of numbers. Plain and simple. Also, if you think about it, retiring Dale's number would be on par with retiring Richard Petty's number. Nobody talked about it in the short time before Petty put Andretti in it. 

Reason #7: A lot of people are mad about the colorization and stylized 3. Again, this was RC's paint scheme, and the Dillon brothers' way to honor him during every race, like the 3 on Harvick's b-post his rookie year.

I just think that it's time for the number 3 to make a comeback, so future drivers can add on to the legend of the #3. ",,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,29c,True,t3_1hjaoe,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1hjaoe/regarding_the_3/,

He doesn't think he can win a championship and 2. He wants to make the 55 ride as appealing as possible in 2014. 

I think that while he may not win the championship, I'd bet on him to make the chase and maybe have a top 5 points finish. I think that alone will be extremely attractive for free agent drivers next year.

I'm super excited to see this race, but I really don't have any understanding at all of NASCAR and how the races work out.  In F1, there are a number of subtle rules during qualifying along with KERS and DRS that result in huge changes to how the race is run, but that wouldn't be at all obvious by just watching the cars from the stands.

Are there any such non-obvious rules in NASCAR?  Am I going to be missing anything if I just show up and watch the cars do their thing?  What can I read or study before the race so that I am better able to follow what's happening on the track?

**Doc Brown from Back to the Future appears out of nowhere in his time machine/DeLorean. You are offered the opportunity to go back in time and compete in NASCAR in any ONE year from the history of the sport.  What year do you chose to race in and why?**

&gt; I would say, 1979.  It was my dad's rookie year and the first live flag-to-flag televised race with the Daytona 500


**r/NASCAR enjoyed your new ""Living Portrait of Dale Jr"" Mountain Dew commercial (it was amazing), how long/how many days did it take to shoot that commercial?**

&gt; Thanks! It took about 2 to 3 hours. Everything was done on a green screen, so basically it was just me in a chair for most of it. It was as much a surprise to me as anyone else what the finished product looked like because it was all green screen. It was like unwrapping a Christmas gift.


**Were you able to get the jet dryer Juan Pablo Montoya destroyed at Daytona to add to your car graveyard?**

&gt; Yes we were able to get it. It's deep in the woods by request of Chip Ganassi. Pic: http://imgur.com/DmoxITg


**Who would you say is the most underrated driver out there?**

&gt; I don't know - I don't sit there and categorize or judge my competitors.


**1.  If you could pick ONE race to have a second chance at from this season, which race would you pick &amp; what would you have done differently?**

**2.  Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?**

**3.  How often do fans try handing you ""the last bottle of Diet Dew"" to see if they can trade up for a race car?**

&gt; The Michigan race where we had engine problems. I wish we had the chance to run that race without any problems. I think we had a winning car.
It would be more to fight the horses because they'd be in the cute category. It would be like ""aw neat, little tiny horses.""
All the time. Alllllll the time. They don't finish the joke though, it's just ""Hey, I've got the last Dew."" It's a cliffhanger...


**Whats the scariest moment you've had on the track?**

&gt; Any time your car gets upside down, you're in for a wide variety of outcomes. It could be a quick couple flips or it could go in barrel rolls... you just never know. When we're upside down, we're nervous.


**Last year Brad said he was interested in getting a tank, and wanted to mess around with you in your own tank, but nothing else has been mentioned of it since. Are there any updates on how NASCAR's first armored division is coming along?**

&gt; Brad's getting very close to purchasing his tank and I see that as happening very soon. I think that I'll just look at his tank and watch his tank ride around before I make any purchasing decisions.


**What is your favorite current and classic street legal car to drive?**

&gt; I have a '77 Oldsmobile Cutlass that I just got. We take it and make modifications to make it look like an old NASCAR stock car. Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/jVQIiuF


**Do you think the Gamecocks have a shot at the SEC/National championship this season?**

&gt; Absolutely. They've got a great team and a great coach.


**Do you think all professional racers are born with a lot of talent, or can it be 100% learned?**

&gt; I think you can learn it.


**Dale, what is the craziest thing you've seen in any NASCAR infield.**

&gt; Name it and I've seen it.


**What's your favorite kind of music for raceday?**

&gt; My favorite musician is Matthew Good - so any of his stuff.


**Who is your favorite comedian?**

&gt; Jim Gaffigan


**Do you really Love taste of Diet Dew?**

&gt; I love the taste of Diet Dew: http://imgur.com/3TPH8Uf


**As a fan I don't like G/W/C finishes and I have a tough time staying interested in a race after a mysterious caution comes out because of ""debris on the racetrack."" But I know a lot of fans really like having the G/W/C rule in place because it all but guarantees a green flag finish. And as a driver, It's gotta be nice getting to bunch up with the field when a yellow comes out, regardless of why that yellow came out.**

&gt; I like G/W/C finishes but I wish there was only one shot at it instead of 3. And I absolutely despise debris cautions but we cant have anyone running over that stuff now can we?


**Someone asked Jimmie this a while back, but I'd like to know if it also applies to you... So my question is, how often do you yell under your helmet during a race?**

&gt; Yes, I yell under my helmet sometimes. Maybe half a dozen times during an event. Its a good way to release some frustration. I have learned its best not to key the mic at this time.",,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,z08,True,t3_1jtsva,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1jtsva/the_complete_qa_from_the_dale_jr_ama/,
