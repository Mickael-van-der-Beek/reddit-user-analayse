1337133129.0,915,self.wisconsin,tp90x,Son lost his ipod touch at Fox River Mall tonight 5/15. He's 10 and bought it with his own money :(,ifindthishumerus,1307,392,393,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tp90x/son_lost_his_ipod_touch_at_fox_river_mall_tonight/,"Long shot, of course but if anyone could be of any help, it would be much appreciated. My son went on a class trip to Madison today and on the way home they stopped to eat at Fox River Mall food court in Appleton. He says he took it out to check the time and that was the last time he remembered having it. Needless to say he is very distraught as he earned the money and bought it himself and mainly uses it to play minecraft with his brother.

He did have it locked with a passcode, so that is a small consolation as the account is linked to one of my credit cards. He didn't have any ""find me"" apps downloaded and the email it was registered to was the same as my iphone. I have left a message on Fox River's voicemail and also emailed them, and told my son to tell his teacher right away in the morning in case he left it on the bus. We live too far from Appleton to drive there and they would be closing shortly anyway.

Any ideas would be appreciated.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_tp90x,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tp90x/son_lost_his_ipod_touch_at_fox_river_mall_tonight/,

I'll be checking in on this AMA all week, feel free to submit your questions and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.  Sorry for the wall of text, but I know a lot of the questions that may be asked so I'll cover them up front.

In this post the word ""fireworks"" means anything that flies, moves or explodes.  Not sparklers, fountains or smoke bombs.  When I say ""fireworks"", I mean the good stuff.  Firecrackers, bottle rockets and aerials.  The legal name is ""Consumer Fireworks"", previously called ""Class C Fireworks"" and given the [DOT classification](http://phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Hazmat/Regulations/chart%2015.pdf) of 1.4g.  Commercial fireworks are classified 1.3g.  You will see this designation in an orange diamond on cases of fireworks and on placards on the semis delivering our goods.

**About Me**

I've been in the consumer fireworks business for 18 years, all at the same store located in Wisconsin.  I report directly to the owner who played a role (read: money) in making fireworks legal in Wisconsin.  I cannot get more specific without advertising for myself and that is not the intent of this post.  This year I've actually submitted proof to the mods.

**The Law**

State statute [167.10](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167/10) outlines the regulation and handling of fireworks in Wisconsin.  The most important part to you is the ""user's permit"" that is required.  [167.10(3)(a)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167/10/3/a) states nobody may possess or use fireworks without a valid user's permit.  [167.10(3)(f)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167/10/3/f) specifies 5 things that must be on a valid fireworks permit.  The big one is number 4 on this list: ""The date and location of permitted use"".  To legally possess Consumer Fireworks in Wisconsin, you must have a place to shoot them approved by the local municipality.  In our case, we offer our shooting site on July 4th and December 31st to everyone who gets a permit from the town we are located in.  Loopholes in the law FTW.

It is illegal to shoot your fireworks at any other time or location than expressly permitted by a fireworks user's permit.  There is no such thing as a ""Possessor Permit"".  Joining a ""Shooters Club"" or some other organization does not grant permission to possess fireworks. ([City of Wisconsin Dells v. Dells Fireworks, Inc.](http://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinions/94/pdf/94-1999.pdf))

Without a valid permit, possession of fireworks is illegal in Wisconsin with a maximum fine of $10,000 ([167.10(9)(a)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167/10/9/a)).  BUT, [167.10(8)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167/10/8) only gives a city, village or town the authority to enforce the law.  The state itself cannot enforce the law, only the local municipality can.

Your local authorities can impose greater restrictions and many do.  Some allow nothing, not even a smoke bomb or sparkler, some only restrict ""Consumer Fireworks"".  Be sure to check your local ordinances before shooting anything.

**Buying Fireworks**

Phantom Fireworks is an out-of-state corporation that is extremely overpriced.  Do us all a favor and don't shop there.

Nothing is free.  Ever.  Buy One Get One Free/$0.99 is never, ever a good deal.  Ever.  If a retailer can do a buy one get one ""sale"" or a 60% off ""sale"", you're paying too much and nothing is actually on sale.  This is a marketing scheme to get you to spend more money.  If you are promised ""free"" items after spending a certain amount, you're paying too much to begin with as well.  Those ""free"" items are calculated in the price of everything else you purchased.  NOTHING IS FREE.

Fireworks sold from a tent are inherently more dangerous.  Only purchase from a physical building.  Fireworks stored outside have this nasty habit of sucking up the moisture in the air on these hot and humid summer days.  Damp fireworks have a habit of malfunctioning.  Even if you dry them out the cardboard used to project the shell can easily fail.

The physical weight of an item doesn't mean squat.  The majority of the weight in fireworks (reloadables excluded) is clay.  Just because that fountain weighs 5 pounds doesn't mean anything.  Don't shop by weight.

Pretty packaging means nothing.  The best fireworks on the market come with really crappy labels, the best are wrapped in brown paper.  The less money spent on the wrapper the more is spent on the firework itself.

Fireworks change almost every damn year.  Just because you got something that was awesome last year doesn't mean anything for this year.  The last few years we have started seeing knock-offs getting into the country.  Looking closely at the labels we can sometimes tell the label was scanned from the original item and slightly modified (UPC and model number).  Only shop with a retailer who shoots EVERYTHING each and every year.  If you ask about a product and the sales person didn't see it THIS YEAR, they have no idea what the item actually does.  Sure it may be similar but China is known for watering down a really great seller for the next year to make a little extra money.

**Prices**

What are “good” prices?  Each type of firework is different but here are some general prices:

* Sparklers – A pack of 96 should be around $6.00.  $1.50 should get you at least 20 sparklers.

* Firecrackers - $4.50 for a half brick (40 packs of 16) or $8.00 for a full brick (80 packs of 16), add a dollar or two for Black Cat brand.

* Bottle Rockets - $3.00 a gross (144), $4.00 a gross for Black Cat brand.

* 200g Multi-shot cakes – Varies greatly, $1.00 to $18.00

* 500g Multi-Shot cakes – Varies greatly, $18.00 to $35.00, zipper cakes excluded (The ones that shoot 100+ shots in 30 seconds) those tend to run in the $69.00-$99.00 range.

* Excalibur Artillery Shells - $59.00 for a box of 24, these are the best on the market again this year.  Black Widow by RGS claims to be better.  They aren't.  It's close, but the build quality of the Excalibur is better.


**Safety**

80% of fireworks safety is common sense.  Don't be an idiot and you'll be safe.  20% is knowing what the item you're shooting does.  The most asked question I get is ""how far away from the crowd/my house/the highly flammable gas station next to my house should I be?""  225-350 feet.  If you are 350 feet from people/buildings/etc you cannot hurt anyone.  The rule of thumb around here is the height of the shell plus one half the diameter of the break (explosion) times 1.25.  This will ensure if you have the worse-case failure everyone and everything is outside the ""blast zone"".  So if you have an item that goes up 150 feet and breaks 50 feet wide your bare minimum safety area is 218 feet (This is very typical of what we sell).

DON'T PUT ANY PART OF YOUR BODY OVER ANYTHING EVER!  The majority of fireworks-related deaths are caused by people putting their heads over the firework.  Treat your fireworks like loaded guns, even after they have gone off.  Light something and it doesn't fire or partly fires?  LEAVE IT ALONE.  Wait at least 30 minutes and then submerge it in water.  The next day take it back to where you bought it, any decent store will replace the item no questions asked.  If you have a dud and cannot get it replaced, never shop there again.  We will even accept things that are a year old for replacement.

Reloadable fireworks use 1.91” inner diameter tube for launching.  By law shells must come with launch tubes.  These are NOT made out of PVC.  Do not, ever, use PVC for launch tubes.  If a shell explodes in the tube (flowerpot), PVC will shatter and turn into shrapnel.  Always use HDPE (high density polyethylene).  HDPE is awesome, the tube will actually turn itself inside-out in a failure situation. 

Don't be completely wasted when shooting fireworks.  You have all night to drink, wait until the fireworks have all been shot.

Put your dog inside.  It is super funny to see your best friend run to attack a roman candle.  It is horrible to have your pet bite the firework and cause it to malfunction and blow up in their mouth.

Don't be a douche with fireworks.  Have crabby neighbors?  Don't shoot at your home.  Roman candle fights?  No.  Throwing fireworks out your car window?  I'll personally kick your ass.  When you do stupid things with fireworks you make the whole consumer industry look bad.  Fireworks are dangerous and barely legal in Wisconsin.  Every time some idiot does something stupid it reflects poorly on the industry as a whole and takes us one more step closer to becoming illegal again.  Don't be that guy.

Any other questions?  Ask away, I'll answer them as best as I can!

**tl;dr:**  You must have a ""User's Permit"" to possess and shoot fireworks in WI.  Buy One Get One Free is a ripoff.

How does this happen?,gman243,123,12,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/12t0y3/gay_senator_and_scott_walker_how_does_this_happen/,"Honestly curious about this. Scott Walker is pretty much a political polar opposite of Tammy Baldwin. Yet, not only does Walker take the Governor election he also takes the recall. Now, during the presidential election Wisconsin leans Democrat for president for the 7th election in a row and also elects Tammy Baldwin as senator. What are the factors in play here? Why such a dramatic difference in our political leaders in this state?

I also noticed that a lot of the governors being elected in general tended to be from the Republican party. Is this a normal trend?

A few factors I can think of:

* Obama takes a whopping percentage of the minority vote. I believe the minority vote shows up more for presidential elections but have no evidence to support this theory. 

* Is it the lack of good opposing candidates? Did Walker win because many didn't think Barrett was up to snuff? Is this the same for Tammy as well? In other words were the other candidates too weak to deserve a vote in some electorates minds?

I am in no way advocating for any of these candidates nor am I trying to get into a debate about each candidates position on political issues. I just want to know what factors you think cause this much of a difference in our chosen electors. 

EDIT: Also I don't mean for the title to be offensive or to stir the pot. I just meant for it to catch the eye and contrast the differences in our state's political realm.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_12t0y3,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/12t0y3/gay_senator_and_scott_walker_how_does_this_happen/,

The bill's page showing his sponsorship:
http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/show

Reddit's excellent FAQ:
http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/sopa

Herb Kohl's contact page:
http://kohl.senate.gov/contact.cfm

Herb Kohl's Facebook page:
http://www.facebook.com/herbkohl

Facebook page opposing Kohl's support:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Citizens-Opposed-to-Herb-Kohls-Support-of-the-Protect-IP-ACT-2011/343003562393618

I think we need to begin by all sending Mr. Kohl an email communicating our opposition to this bill.  I also think that Facebook is a good,  visible place to display our feelings on PIPA/SOPA.  So, if you use Facebook please post on Kohl's page and 'like' and share the opposition page.  Of course we should be using conventional media as well, so if you're inclined you could write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper.

What else can we do?

If you are not registered, you will need to prove your residence in order to vote. If you do not have a valid ID, they will accept [several other forms](http://city.milwaukee.gov/vote) of proof of residence. Walker's voter ID bill did not go into effect, so you will not need to bring photo ID with you to the polls. I personally had to use the lease option when I went to vote in the Republican Presidential Primary, as I went paperless with my bills and I haven't yet been able to find the time to get my drivers license switched over. The last time I was at the polls (for the recall primary) I saw one girl who was not able to vote, as she did not have any sort of ID with her and was living with someone without her name on the lease. Make sure you go prepared, whoever you plan to vote for.

From [a reply I got on /r/politics:](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uk3ry/activists_converge_on_wisconsin_for_historic/c4w3f2t):

[In some cases,](http://gab.wi.gov/clerks/provisional-ballots) you may be able to vote using a provisional ballot.

Additionally, [get in line before the polls close. Voters standing in line waiting to vote when the polling place closes at 8 p.m. on Election Day will be permitted to vote.](http://gab.wi.gov/node/2376)

Sent: Wednesday, April 10, 2013 8:01 AM 
To: *Legislative All Assembly; *Legislative All Senate Subject: (SHORT DEADLINE) Co-Sponsorship of LRB-0926/1: Relating to injunctions on state statute.

TO: All Legislators FROM: Rep. Dave Craig, Rep. Al Ott, Sen. Glen Grothman and Sen. Leah Vukmir RE: Co-Sponsorship of LRB-0926/1: Relating to injunctions on state statute. Date: April 10, 2013 Deadline for Co-Sponsorship: Monday, April 15 at 12pm 

We are introducing LRB 0926/1 to address the legal uncertainty Wisconsin residents and businesses are subject to as a result of injunctions on state statutes, ordered by judges only elected by a fraction of our state’s population. 

Increasingly, questions have been raised as to a) whether individual circuit court judges’ rulings impact the state as a whole in regards to the implementation of state law; and b) whether a ruling from a judge - elected by a small portion of the state - should prevent the statewide implementation of legislation passed by the duly elected statewide legislature, and signed by our Governor, having also been elected statewide, without allowing for an expedited review by a higher court. **Under this bill, if a circuit court or court of appeals places an injunction, restraining order, or other order that, upon entry, suspends or restrains the implementation of any state statute, it would be immediately appealable to a higher court.** If such an appeal is made to a higher court within 10 days of entry of the lower court’s order, the lower court’s order will be immediately stayed pending an order by a higher court or a final and unappealable order disposing of the entire case. Nothing in this legislation would prevent any court from entering an order that suspends or restrains the implementation of a state statute, or prevents a higher court from removing the stay should the higher court determine the lower courts order was reached appropriately. 

This legislation would facilitate a fair and more efficient judicial system by ensuring that one judge cannot prevent the implementation of state law without an expedited review by a higher court. This legislation would also ensure that Wisconsin residents and businesses have a greater degree of certainty as to whether a law is or is not in effect during the disposition of a legal challenge. Lastly, this bill reaffirms that the three branches of our government remain separate, but equal. If you are interested in co-sponsoring LRB 0926/1, please reply to this email by 12:00pm on Monday, April 15, 2013. 

Unless you request otherwise, you will be listed as a co-sponsor on both LRB 0926/1 and its Senate companion LRB-1131/1. Should you have any questions please feel free to contact Rep. Craig’s office (6-3363) or Sen. Grothman’s office (6-7513). Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau Generally, under current law, an interlocutory or final judgment issued by a court in an action for an injunction may not be stayed after the entry of the judgment or during the pendency of an appeal. 

This bill makes an injunction, restraining order, or other order that, upon entry, suspends or restrains the enforcement of any state statute (order) immediately appealable to an appellate court or to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. 

If a petition for interlocutory review is filed within ten days after the entry of the order, the order is stayed until one of the following occurs:
The appellate court or the Supreme Court grants the petition for interlocutory review and subsequently orders that the automatic stay be lifted.

The appellate court or the Supreme Court denies the petition for interlocutory review and simultaneously orders that the automatic stay be lifted.

Entry of a final and unappealable order disposing of the entire case.
The bill permits the appellate court or the Supreme Court to enter such orders as are necessary to the resolution of the petition.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_1c7ewh,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1c7ewh/leaked_email_from_wi_gop_bill_to_remove_power/,

Scott Walker Must be Recalled,cschema,82,14,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/fsv9n/why_gov_scott_walker_must_be_recalled/,"Removing an elected official should never be taken lightly. An elected official should not be removed from office because we simply disagree with his policies. There must be extraordianry circumstances to justify such extreme measures. 

Gov. Walker introduced a Budget Repair Bill that destroys the tradition of Collective Bargaining for public employee unions. His reason for this is a budget crises that does not exist and certainly does not warrant his extreme measures. 

His explanations are disingenuous and dishonest. The current fiscal year will end with a surplus. While there are anticipated budget deficits in the next fiscal year they are manageable and do not constitute a fiscal crises. 

During his first few weeks in office, Gov. Walker has rejected close to a billion dollars of federal assistance for high speed rail and broadband. These federal grants would have created thousands of good jobs in Wisconsin. 

Also during his first month in office, Gov. Walker has enacted massive tax cuts for corporations and Wisconsin's wealthiest citizens. 

These tax cuts have created a serious revenue problem for the state. In essence, Walker's tax policies have created the fiscal crises that he is using as an excuse to destroy collective bargaining for public employees. 

Furthermore, Walker and the Republican controlled state legislature have not provided adequate time to fully debate the legislation. They created phony deadlines and refuse to negotiate. They refuse to allow Democrat legislators to make amendments. 

Gov. Walker and the Republican controlled State Senate left the 14 Democrat State Senators no choice but to flea to Illinois so there would not be the required quorum to vote on the legislation. 

As a result Wisconsin is suffering from a constitutional crises with 1000s of citizens protesting everyday all around the state. 

Gov. Walker has refused to negotiate and to work together with legislators from all parties to find a reasonable and fair solution to Wisconsin's fiscal problems. 

Gov. Walker refuses to share the sacrifice among all the citizens of Wisconsin, rich and poor. 

A prank phone call incident, where Gov. Walker thought he was talking to a billionaire who has helped finance his campaign, revealed Gov. Walker's true selfish political ideological motivations driving his craven decisions. 

Gov. Walker has left the citizens of Wisconsin no choice. He must be removed from office or resign immediately. 

According to state statues the recall process can not begin until January 3rd 2012. 

We urge all Wisconsin citizens of good conscience to support the recall of Gov. Scott Walker.

WI fireworks law explained, shopping suggestions, safety, etc.",WisconsinFireworks,76,9,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/vcjvk/iama_fireworks_retailer_in_wi_ama_wi_fireworks/,"In this post the word ""fireworks"" means anything that flies, moves or explodes.  Not sparklers, fountains or smoke bombs.  When I say ""fireworks"", I mean the good stuff.  Firecrackers, bottle rockets and aerials.  The legal name is ""Consumer Fireworks"", previously called ""Class C Fireworks"" and given the DOT classification of 1.4g.

**About Me**

I've been in the consumer fireworks business for 17 years, all at the same store located in Wisconsin.  I report directly to the owner who played a role (read: money) in making fireworks legal in Wisconsin.  I cannot get more specific without advertising for myself and that is not the intent of this post.  I'm fairly sure my qualifications will become apparent in this post, but if you want solid verification I'll be happy to hit up a mod with my real-world credentials.

**The Law**

State statute [167.10](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/167.pdf) outlines the regulation and handling of fireworks in Wisconsin.  The most important part to the consumer is the ""permit"" that is required.  167.10(3)(a) says nobody may possess or use fireworks without a valid permit.  167.10(3)(f) specifies 5 things that must be on a valid fireworks permit.  The big one is number 4 on this list.  ""The date and location of permitted use"".  To legally have consumer fireworks in Wisconsin, you must have a place to shoot them approved by the local authority.  Here is the loophole.  The intent of the law was to prevent the average person from possessing fireworks but allow it for ""professionals"".  In our case, we offer our shooting site on July 4th and December 31st to everyone who gets a permit from the town we are located in.

Yes, it is illegal to shoot your fireworks at any other time or location than expressly permitted by a fireworks user's permit.  No, there is no such thing as a ""Possessor Permit"".  Furthermore, joining a ""Shooters Club"" or some other organization does not grant permission to possess fireworks. [94-1999](http://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinions/94/pdf/94-1999.pdf)

Without a valid permit, that contains a date and location of use, possession of fireworks is illegal in Wisconsin with a maximum fine of $10,000 [167.10(9)(a)].  BUT, 167.10(8) only gives a city, village or town the authority to enforce the law.  The state itself cannot enforce the law, only the local municipality can.

That is the state law in a nutshell.  Your local authorities can impose greater restrictions, and many do.  Some allow nothing, not even a smoke bomb or sparkler, some only restrict ""Consumer Fireworks"".  Be sure to check your local ordinances!

**Buying Fireworks**

Nothing is free.  Ever.  Buy One Get One Free/$0.99 is never, ever a good deal.  Ever.  If a retailer can do a buy one get one ""sale"" or a 60% off ""sale"", you're paying too much and nothing is actually on sale.  This is a marketing scheme to get you spend more money.  Let me repeat: BUY ONE GET ONE FREE IS NOT A DEAL.  YOU ARE PAYING TOO DAMN MUCH FOR THE FIRST ONE.  Don't be a sucker.  If you are promised ""free"" items after spending a certain amount, you're paying too much to begin with as well.  Those ""free"" items are calculated in the price of everything else you purchased.  NOTHING IS FREE.

All the stores in Wisconsin use the same 9 (or so) importers for fireworks.  These are the same importers that supply the entire country.  Nobody has a better version of a particular firework over another.  Phantom Fireworks is the exception to the rule.  They direct import all their product, from the same manufacturers in China as the rest of us.  They simply ""re-wrap"" the fireworks with a different label/name so you cannot compare prices.  (Protip: Phantom Fireworks is the biggest ripoff in the fireworks industry in entire the US)

Fireworks sold from a tent are inherently more dangerous.  Only purchase from a physical building.  Fireworks stored outside have this nasty habit of sucking up the moisture in the air on these hot and humid summer days.  Damp fireworks have a nasty habit of malfunctioning.  Even if you dry them out afterwards, the cardboard used to project the shell can easily fail.

The physical weight of an item doesn't mean squat.  The majority of the weight in fireworks (reloadables excluded) is clay.  Just because that fountain weighs 5 pounds doesn't mean anything.  Don't shop by weight.

Pretty packaging means nothing.  The best fireworks on the market come with really crappy labels, the best are wrapped in brown paper.  The less money spent on the wrapper the more is spent on the firework itself.

Fireworks change every damn year.  Just because you got something that was awesome last year doesn't mean anything for this year.  Only shop with a retailer who shoots EVERYTHING each and every year.  If you ask about a product and the sales person didn't see it THIS YEAR, they have no idea what the item actually does.  Sure it may be similar but China is known for watering down a really great seller for the next year to make a little extra money.

**Safety**

80% of fireworks safety is common sense.  Don't be an idiot and you'll be safe.  20% is knowing what the item you're shooting does.  The most asked question I get is ""how far away from the crowd/my house/the highly flammable gas station next to my house should I be?""  250-400 feet.  If you are 400 feet from people/buildings/etc you cannot hurt anyone.  The rule of thumb around here is the height of the shell plus one half the diameter of the break (explosion) times 1.25.  This will ensure if you have the worse-case failure everyone and everything is outside the ""blast zone"".  So if you have an item that goes up 150 feet and breaks 50 feet wide your bare minimum safety area is 218 feet (This is very typical of what we sell).

DON'T PUT ANY PART OF YOUR BODY OVER ANYTHING EVER!  Treat your fireworks like loaded guns, even after they have gone off.

Don't be completely wasted when shooting fireworks.  You have all night to drink, wait until the fireworks have all been shot.

Any other questions?  Ask away, I'll answer them as best as I can!

**tl;dr:**  You must have a ""User's Permit"" to have fireworks.  Buy One Get One Free is a ripoff.  Don't get completely wasted when shooting fireworks and you'll probably not kill yourself.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_vcjvk,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/vcjvk/iama_fireworks_retailer_in_wi_ama_wi_fireworks/,

The discussion in this subreddit is hostile to different points of view. Subreddit growth has slowed due to a lack of new subscribers. New subscribers are put off by the hostility. This prevents new and interesting content, which in turn, slows growth again in an unfortunate feedback cycle.

I am not advocating any change in the stance that moderation remain completely neutral with respect to politics. **I am however, proposising that this subreddit institute a ""Don't Be An Asshole"" Rule.** DBAA for short. I have adapted the following from the *very* successful r/nfl rules.

**DO**

- **Be civil.** Spirited discussion is allowed, but don't make it personal.

- Follow Reddiquette when posting/voting.

**DO NOT**

- **Post Flamebait.** Inflammatory posts designed to alienate or insult a anyone will not be tolerated and will be removed. Ad hominem attacks on other posters are frowned upon. Racist, homophobic or unnecessarily rude violated the spirit of this subreddit.

- Create threads asking to attack individual posters in the subreddit.

- Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. Down votes are for comments that add nothing to the discussion.

**I took me about 5 minutes to find the following examples of comments that exemplify the problems in this subreddit:**

""This is for Kohl's old seat, not the dyke's.""

""You are fucked in the head, Fucked.""

""You probably prefer a catholic because they've been fucked in the ass by a pervert priest."" (This actually is a +5 post!)

""I don't care about comment karma or getting downvoted, it is meaningless. I just enjoy countering the liberal attitude around here""

""Homosexuality is the same thing as bestiality and pedophilia.""

""Another day another worthless biased submission to r/wisconsin""

""It's been one day. Fucking crybaby. If you have a problem with it, post something else that isn't you crying.""

""You are just an ignorant, disrespectful, atheist cunt who was probably never taught proper respect for your elders or authority.""

""I'm not saying whites shouldn't be allowed to marry coloreds if they really want to...""

""Fuck Paul Ryan. Fuck Mitt Romney. Signed, Former Republican.""

Furthermore, I had a hard time finding mature conservative comments because there are hardly any left in r/wisconsin and most of them are downvoted to hell. I don't feel that the purpose of this subreddit should be for the forum to become a liberal echo-chamber with a few trolls getting off on posting their intentionally inflammatory rhetoric.

**Can't we all just talk and not be jerks?**

**TL;DR:** The unmoderated, toxic environment of this subreddit is scaring off good subscribers, and is especially uninviting to conservative viewpoints. I suggest we install a general ""Don't be an Asshole"" rule.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_ybnga,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/ybnga/a_plea_to_change_to_rwisconsins_moderation_policy/,

Winter Driving Edition.,Rang3r1_v2,63,6,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/oelg5/looks_like_tough_love_time_winter_driving_edition/,"Hey guys, I had a very, very expensive day today, so I recreated my account to warn and remind you about the dangers of winter driving, and to maybe help dumbasses to be safe out there.

Today I was driving South on 151 between Mt. Horeb and Dodgeville when I was cut off by a woman on her cellphone, coming down an unplowed on-ramp, going well over 65, regardless of the snow, acting like because she had an AWD SUV, she could do what she wanted.

I was driving a 3/4 ton duramax silverado, towing a gooseneck trailer with a 13,000lb piece of very expensive equipment on it. She wasn't paying attention, and forced me into the other lane, and since I had to hit the brakes and downshift to prevent her from ramming right into me, I started to fishtail, and I ended up sliding over 300 feet into the ditch, with half of my trailer thrust into oncoming traffic. I was completely stuck, and my truck was at a 45 degree angle in comparison to the trailer.

I lost over 100,000 dollars today, in recovery bills and equipment loss, not even to mention the citations I received for failure to control my vehicle and disrupting a motorway. All because someone was too busy to think about other people while she was driving.

Please, please don't fuck around, no matter how much or how little snow we have, or how big your truck is. It is much more important to get to a destination safely than quickly in these conditions.

And If I ever see any of you on your cellphone, or even worse, texting, I will personally kick the living shit out of you.

Here are a few tips I have learned over the years to drive safely in the winter.

Always stay below the speed limit with snow on the roadway, usually 45-50 on the highway is cutting it a little high.

Pay attention. Turn off any distractions, especially cellphones, loud radios, etc.

If you start to slide, even in an automatic, downshift into neutral and lightly pump the brakes, even if you have ABS. Don't ever slam on the brakes in snow or ice conditions.

Snow chains are a good investment, but check your local laws beforehand, some municipalities don't allow them due to possible road damage.

Always carry a sleeping bag, blanket, water, a small snow shovel and nonperishable food in your car. Add a flashlight and extra batteries and you are good to go.

And please, don't be a jackass, if you only care about getting somewhere fast regardless of anyone else on the road, I don't want you out there putting innocent people at risk.

Thank you for letting me rant.",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_oelg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/oelg5/looks_like_tough_love_time_winter_driving_edition/,

This is the template that is being used in Wisconsin. Get someone like Walker who has no ability to decide things on his own, but follows directions well. The ""other"" in Wisconsin is ""the unions"" but the end goal is the same - a complete gutting of government and a crony system where you have to be a member of the church to get a job. Do you want to end up like Kansas? Environmental regulation ... gutted - you can't even eat the fish there anymore. Government revenue generation ... gutted with a hugely regressive tax system. Women's reproductive rights ... gutted - where you can be denied birth control and planned parenthood was made illegal. And an education system that is the laughing stock of the world where school boards vote to promote creationism. 

Tomorrow is it Wisconsin - the turning point between the American-taliban-like controlled state of Kansas or a state where things like education, water quality, using science to determine public policy, non-toady leaders, separation of church and state, and effective (non-crony, non-corporate owned) governments matter.

Hello All Friends and Supporters,

I would like to first off say thank you all for your promotion and signing up and donations (for the MANY of you who have donated).  We promised you all we would put your help and support to good use.  Today, we proved it.  This morning I was at the Capitol, as I am every morning, to hang our banner from the stone railing on East Washington Avenue.  I quickly noticed a bunch of people at the door and went to investigate.  What I found was disgusting.  Dictator Walker and his crew of thugs somehow managed to shut down the Capitol.  I was told the ACLU was ""negotiating"".  The time for negotiation is over.  Why would you negotiate with someone who won't negotiate with you?  It's a losing battle.

It was at that time I realized quick and decisive action would be needed.  I immediately filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court against the State of Wisconsin.  Attached is a copy of the lawsuit.  I want to make a few things clear with this.  Some criticize me for the $10,000,000 for the protesters that I had asked for. I say, and I repeat, that even if awarded, I will not claim any of the money myself.  This is not about the money the money only came into play because the administration clearly would not be moved by injunctive relief as he has no problem disobeying the law and has made that very clear.  For this reason the only thing that will get through to them is a financial request.

We were covered by most all local and national news outlets.  Here's the deal folks.  We will continue to combat the evil dictator to the best we legally can.  And if peaceful civil disobedience is necessary rest assured we will be on the front lines.  This is a promise.  However, we could use some help.  If any of you know any civil rights attorneys, please send them my way.  You can give them my phone number and e-mail.  We have several attorneys interested, however, we would like many options so we can meet with them all and get the best.  I promise you we will keep fighting.  And please, whoever can, get to the Capitol.  Our numbers seem to be dwindling slightly and we really need bodies on the ground.  When I say our I do not refer to Defending Wisconsin PAC, however refer to the entire group of protesters.  Thank you and as always feel free to contact any of us at Defending Wisconsin PAC at any time.  Thanks and have a great day.

Your Brother in Solidarity,

Jeremy J Ryan

I am neither a lawyer nor a politician, and I will try to keep my opinion out of this as much as I can.*

-------------------

First off, here is [Article III of the WI State Constitution (PDF, see page 4 column 2)](http://legis.wisconsin.gov/rsb/unannotated_wisconst.pdf):
&gt; SUFFRAGE

&gt;Electors: Every United States citizen age 18 or older who is a resident of an election district in this state is a qualified elector of that district.

Notice how it begins with the word ""Every"".  Before getting into specifics, keep in mind that the constitution is supreme to a law. That is if the constitution is establishing certain rights, no law may take away rights that are established in the constitution. Therefore, the law cannot take away rights from others. 

**Now onto the reasoning why the WI Voter ID law is unconstitutional:**

Let’s say there is a person who meets WI's constitutional requirements to vote, that is s/he is a U.S. Citizen, WI resident, and at least 18. Now consider the Voter ID law states that one must show a Photo ID to prove these things. 
As far as I understand, there is no law in either WI or the U.S. which requires a citizen to have a government issued Photo ID. This being said, the law would then mean that anyone without a photo ID (which is fine by law) would be unable to vote in the election. This directly contradicts Article III of the constitution, and because no law may take away a liberty given by the constitution, this law is unconstitutional. This is in line with the [statement by Judge Niess]( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/wisconsin-voter-id-law-unconstitutional_n_1339830.html)


Now I would like to address some common questions and concerns.


**Citizenship must be proved in order to vote. Without a photo ID, how is this accomplished?**

Citizenship is proved at registration. State ID, Driver's License, **or Social Security Number can be used to register** [Source]( http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/voters/registration-voting). It is reasonable to assume that if the clerk has your SSN, name, and other identifying information, the clerk could easily check to make sure you are a citizen if they had a proper reason to do so.  **Age** can also be verified with this same reasoning.

**Residence must also be proved to vote in WI.**

Residence can be proved in a number of ways that do not require a photo ID, and still be in accordance with the [Help America Vote Act of 2002.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act#Voter_identification) Here are a few [Source]( http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/voters/registration-voting):

 * ID card from a private business
 * real estate tax bill
 * utility bill
 * bank statement
So long as a person has registered, proof of residence has been shown.

**If the state is allowing citizens to get free photo IDs for the purpose of voting, why can’t everyone just get one?**

There is no law requiring to have a photo ID, so government can’t “force” people to have one.


**Hasn’t the SCotUS decided that Voter ID *is* constitutional in [the Indiana case]( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/washington/28cnd-scotus.html)?**

Not exactly.  This case was mostly stating that there is nothing unconstitutional about the Indiana Voter ID law *at the national level*. The 10th amendment of the US Constitution states:
&gt;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

Since the neither the constitution nor federal law mentions a Voter ID requirement, that state is given the power to make its own rules, and the supreme court would likely not overstep it’s jurisdiction to interpret the WI constitution for the state.

**edit 1:** Recalling Scott Walker requires 500,000+ signatures within a 60 day period and cannot be done until he has been in office for a year.  There are several pages on Facebook for this movement, the most serious and organized seems to be this one:  http://on.fb.me/eVBgLI.  I don't know how feasible a recall is, but I'll do my part to help it happen.

**edit 2:** Walker's budget ""fix"" proposal does have to pass the republican controlled legislature.  It almost certainly will, but we should all be contacting our representatives:  http://bit.ly/fTDHl4.

So, what should I know about Wisconsin.  I know the winters are brutal and I have dealt with brutal winters when I was in the Army.  Other than learning how do deal with that is there any reason why I shouldnt move there?

The University of Wisconsin-Madison is aware that classes may be disrupted
tomorrow (Thursday, Feb. 17) as a result of reaction to the budget repair bill.

We value public debate and participation in the political process, however, we
do not believe that this should come at the cost of a day of instruction for our
student body. We are advising students to attend class, and faculty and staff to teach in the way they normally would. It is the responsibility of instructors to ensure that students' educational opportunities are preserved.
For additional guidance about political activities on campus, information about
appropriate use of IT resources, please refer to my message of Monday evening:
For information on the state budget impact on UW-Madison, visit:
&lt;http://budget.wisc.edu/&gt;
If you have questions, please consult with the appropriate supervisor,
instructor, or department chair.

Respectfully, 
Provost [redacted]""


**EVERYONE its time for a good old fashioned protest! skip class, call in sick. everyone will be at the capital tomorrow**


**EDIT: First, Students and teachers will walk out of classes at 10am. Then there will be a march from the library mall to the capital at 10:30 AM.  Be there!  I have signs, you should make your own. i actually bought every poster board walgreens still had left.  This is a momentous day for Madison and Wisconsin.  The national media is finally starting to catch on to what is going on.  Watch the [Ed Show on MSNBC](http://ed.msnbc.msn.com/).  He has been covering this non-stop all week.

Thank you for contacting me about legislation in Congress to address online piracy and consumer fraud. I value the correspondence I receive from fellow Wisconsinites, and welcome this opportunity to address your concerns.

 

Federal copyright law originates from the Copyright and Patent Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to ""promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" Our modern copyright law protects original works by allocating certain rights to their creators for a specific amount of time. As our use of the Internet has continued to grow, the number of websites we use has grown exponentially. In recent years concerns have been raised about websites pirating original content or deceiving users with counterfeit products, and whether our copyright laws can still adequately protect creators right to their works and the safety and security of American consumers who wish to purchase them online.

 

American businesses lose billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs to online piracy and sales of counterfeit goods over the Internet.  While U.S. law can reach domestic websites that sell illegal counterfeit products, law enforcement cannot pursue websites owned and operated by foreign entities with domain names registered outside the U.S.    To address this problem, on May 12, 2011, Senator Leahy (D-VT) introduced the ""Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011,"" S. 968. I am a co-sponsor of this bill, which is known as the PROTECT IP Act.  Our bill made changes to a similar bill introduced in the 111th Congress that more narrowly target it to only the most seriously infringing foreign websites.

 

Under S. 968, the Attorney General would be authorized to file a civil action in court only against foreign based websites that are ""dedicated to infringing activities"" and have no significant use other than engaging in illegal activity such as streaming pirated movies and selling counterfeit consumer products and pharmaceuticals.  The Attorney General is required to notify the registrant of the Internet domain name, providing due process and an opportunity for him or her to respond to the allegations.  Only if a judge finds that a website is dedicated to infringing activities and harms U.S. consumers and intellectual property owners, the Attorney General would have the authority to serve the court order on third parties.  Those third parties, such as Internet service providers, payment processors, online advertising networks, and search engines, would be required to take reasonable measures, if feasible, to stop doing business with and prevent access to that website.  The bill includes safeguards, including the ability of website operators to challenge the Attorney General's allegations and petition the court to reconsider its order after removing the infringing content.  On May 26, 2011, the Judiciary Committee approved S. 968 by a voice vote.

 

As you may have heard, on January 13, 2012, Senator Leahy announced that he plans to make major modifications to the bill in order to address concerns about the provision that permits the court to order third party Internet Service Providers to use the Domain Name System to block consumers from accessing foreign websites dedicated to illegal online infringement.  We will be studying them to see how they square with the concerns we're hearing, and I look forward to working to improve the bill. Similar changes will also be examined in the House version of the PROTECT IP Act, H.R. 3261, the ""Stop Online Piracy Act.""   Known as ""SOPA"", this bill is being considered by the House Judiciary Committee.

 

In an effort to promote a compromise on the legislation, on January 20, 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid [D-NV] announced that he would postpone a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill, originally scheduled for January 24.

  

As we work to find common ground and improve the PROTECT IP Act, please be assured that I will keep your thoughts in mind. Again, thank you for contacting me.

 
Sincerely,

Herb Kohl
United States Senator

I have the data and will be following up with the exact number of petition signatures needed to force a recall election for each of the eight Senators above.

Data source 1: [2010 Fall General Election Results -- Ward-by-Ward](http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/2010%20Fall%20General%20-%20All%20Races%20-%20Ward-by-Ward_0.xls) (15MB Excel file)

Data source 2: [2008 Fall Election Cycle, Ward By Ward Returns: State Senator](http://elections.state.wi.us/docview.asp?docid=15410&amp;locid=47) (426KB Excel file)


To get the final number, you need to inspect the specific wards reporting for each Senate district in data source 2, find that ward in data source 1 in the page on governor election ballots cast. Once you have all of the numbers of governor election votes cast in each ward for a given district, you add them together and then multiply by .25 to get the minimum number of signatures needed for a recall petition to trigger an election.


Please, other people, recheck my numbers and calculations!

Yes, I am an agent, no, I'm not suggesting you call me or soliciting your business. Every year we get a call from a student that was living in some cheap-ass house with shitty wiring and it burned down. Stoner neighbor or moron roommate decide to cook something and forgot about it. People overload circuits, bypass fuses, etc. Imagine the cost of replacing ALL of your clothing, computer, TV, misc electronics, etc. Unless you're much more wealthy than I was in college, you don't have that kind of cash laying around. $10 / month is a steal compared to what you're on the hook for replacing.

Make the call.

Chris,

For the past few months, PCCC members have been helping the Wisconsin Democratic Party and local allies collect enough signatures to recall Governor Scott Walker.

On Friday, January 13, the Democratic Party is holding parties across the state to celebrate a huge milestone -- collecting all the signatures we need!

The list of events are below (with alternate dates for areas not celebrating on the 13th) -- hope you can make it!

Thanks for being a bold progressive.

1297985358.0,41,self.wisconsin,fnj2t,My cousin's spouse (a WI public school teacher) just posted this as a Facebook note. Very well written statement from the perspective of a union worker.,aveman101,53,12,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/fnj2t/my_cousins_spouse_a_wi_public_school_teacher_just/,"&gt;A friend of a friend on here, posted to his post, that she was glad someone was finally not bending to the union thugs, and that it was about time.  My friends post made a comparison to Big Lebowski, and the lines, this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass.  The friend posted: This is what happens when you elect a republic to governor.  My response is what I offered to the post about this time of our state being a good thing:

&gt;""Excuse me if I offend, as I do not know who you are, [*Name redacted*], and am unclear on whether or not your post is sarcasm (as I am wont to read it). If it's not sarcasm, I simply remind you that as a public servant, and a union rep, I TOO AM A TAX PAYER. I don't exist in a fantasy bubble, and steal money like a leprechaun. I also support local business with any disposable income I might have, which technically is nothing, because I still owe too much for student loans, and the necessities of life. My base salary as a teacher has been limited in the good times and the bad. I recognize that the public sector has been hit hard recently. I feel for everyone. My union has allowed me to stay not in peaks nor in valleys, but constant. The trade off is a lower than private sector salary, but some decent benefits. Now, with this bill, I will be placed in a permanent valley. I will not gain back any extra money in good times. My district does not pass out bonuses when it makes a ""profit"". I will be stuck. My wages were already bargained away almost 20 years ago, in order to maintain some decent work conditions and benefits that help me to keep my family surviving. My debt load, however, is deep, like most middle class Americans. I make it paycheck to paycheck because I am in a two teacher household. We each are paying off student loans. We have debt which was incurred for things like: groceries, clothing, a shitty used car, engagement ring, etc. We live in a small house ,which like everyone else has lost value, with a mortgage I'll be paying for another 25 years. This bill will bankrupt my family. Literally, not figuratively. If I am bankrupt, I cannot provide money for the economy, and thus business in the private sector (because I am but one of tens of thousands who will be in the same situation) will falter. If my union rights are stripped, there is no more hope for decent work conditions in the private sector. Corporations can then work quicker and harder to exploit workers, to pad their own bottom line. I respect you as an individual who is most likely struggling in this rough economy, but I am not the one who caused the state to seemingly have a budget crisis. Scott Walkers decision to hand out $140 million in money to business, created this immediate fiscal crisis, and now he wants me and my union brothers and sisters, to pay for his tax cut to the corporations. This I can not abide. Thank you for creating an opportunity for a discussion. Remember, as the economy continues to recover and the private sector sees CEOs making millions, but they don't get anything else, they won't have unions to turn to either. We'll all be bending over and taking it from the fat cats; I don't want a stranger fucking me in the ass.""",,False,,t5_2qrc2,False,,,True,t3_fnj2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/fnj2t/my_cousins_spouse_a_wi_public_school_teacher_just/,
