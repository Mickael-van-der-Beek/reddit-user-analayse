I'm Alex Hirsch, creator/mayor of Gravity Falls. Every day I get tweets, physical letters, and rocks thrown through my window with questions written on them by fans. The most common question I get is ""Are you Mr. Tumnus, the goat-man from the Narnia movies? Can you let me into the snowy wonderland that lies beyond your enchanted wardrobe?""

The answer to this question, and many more, lie right at your fingertips for the next TWO HOURS! Ask me anything your heart pleases, no matter how strange! A few TIPS

*BE SPECIFIC! THE MORE SPECIFIC the question, the MORE LIKELY it is I'll write back!

*Try to BE ORIGINAL! I've done like a zillion interviews already, so stuff like ""where did you get the idea for the show?"" will make me fall asleep on my keyboard, and the answer will be ""nnnxxxfffffffffff"" 

*BE SHORT! The shorter it is, the easier it'll be to read!

*I'm 100% more likely to answer your question if you only ask ONE

*SPOILER QUESTIONS will either be ignored or responded to with an image of an axlotl, the albino frilled Mexican salamander.

UPDATE UPDATE: ***SWEET FANCY MOLASSES guys. We're at 1,000 questions and I gotta get back to working on a script for Season 2. Spoiler Alert! It involves Bill. Thanks for all your questions. You guys are totally amazing. If I have some time this weekend maybe I'll answer a few more.

1358816275.0,90,self.gravityfalls,170w87,Hidden codes in the new gravity falls game (re-posted due to spam filtering),Stratisphear,98,8,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/170w87/hidden_codes_in_the_new_gravity_falls_game/,"Thought I'd do a rundown of the codes in the new Gravity Falls flash game, [here](http://disney.go.com/disneychannel/games/rumbles-revenge-2017596)

The codes pop up pretty much at random. There are 12 in total. They are:

l ehw brx’uh zrqghulqj zkr l dP.

l grq’w jlyh xs dqvzhuv hdvB..

l nQrz wklqjv. Idvflqdwlqj wklqjv…

brxu uhdolwb lv d jdph wr ph.dqg l olnh jDphv….

plvfklhi lv pb Plggoh qdph. exw qrw pb iluvw…..

wkHuh duh vla klqwv l zloo jlyh brx ……

1- wkhuh lv d vhfuhw vrfLhwb lq judylwb idoov…….

2- wkh kdqgbpdq nqrzV pruh wkdq brx wklqn……..

3- jlghrq kdv Ehhq vhdufklqj iru vrphwklqj ………

4- zkdw jrhv xs Lv vxuh wr frph grzq ……….

5- glsshu lv sOdblqj zlwk iluh ………..

6- l zloo eh uhwxuqlqj wr judylwb idoOv ………..

Using the decoder in the sidebar, you can translate them into:

i bet you’re wondering who i aM.

i don’t give up answers easY..

i kNow things. Fascinating things…

your reality is a game to me.and i like gAmes….

mischief is my Middle name. but not my first…..

thEre are six hints i will give you ……

1- there is a secret socIety in gravity falls…….

2- the handyman knowS more than you think……..

3- gideon has Been searching for something ………

4- what goes up Is sure to come down ……….

5- dipper is pLaying with fire ………..

6- i will be returning to gravity falLs ………..

Now, as many of you probably noticed, there is a single capital letter in each phrase. If we put the phrases in order by number of dots at the end, and put all the capitals together, we get:

[MY NAME IS BILL](/spoiler)

(A huge chain of record stores here in New England) Along with CDs/Movies, they have pretty much everything else, from books to merch. I was browsing and saw a ton of Adventure Time and Regular Show stuff, (Both on Cartoon Network) and it got me thinking. I know fans of those shows, along with just fans of mystery/paranormal shows, would love this show. Unfortunately, I feel as if Disney is hurting Gravity Falls. Let's be honest, Disney's quality has been declining ever since Hannah Montana and it's numerous clones have aired, and now is the butt of many, many jokes. I personally find most of the shows on Disney awful, and it almost kept me from watching Gravity Falls. I think GF is the complete opposite of the rest of disney, not only with an awesome story, characters, and setting, but with top-notch animation and it's genuinely funny. I feel as if Disney is keeping the show from becoming the cult show it deserves to be, and would be much more fitting on Cartoon Network, where Regular Show and Adventure Time fans could see it. (Although I do think that besides those shows, The Amazing World of Gumball, Cartoon Network has also severely declined) This, I feel, would give it the place in nerd culture it deserves, and we would be able to see cool merch in stores everywhere. That's just how I feel, and I can't imagine there's nobody else that feels the same way.

So, I've been looking over the forum and haven't been able to find any details (or warnings) on this, but I've compiled a list of links that go to Gravity Falls episodes on Disney.com. Navigating their video player is a nightmare, so I keep these in a text file. Feel free to add to it, I'm missing the last 3 episodes, I believe.

One is in front of the Mystery Shack and the other one is on (Scuttle)Butt Island. Their significance has been discussed in the past, and I've always been very curious about them. 
But now that the season finale aired... we DO know the purpose of the one at the Shack! 
In Stan's secret lair, there's a periscope connected to the totem pole which apparently monitors the surrounding area!
So, assuming the other one has the same purpose... There could very well be another secret lair under the lake! 
And maybe it's McGucket's. 
Maybe it's a common secret base layout for the Royal Order of the Holy Mackerel and both Stan and McGucket are part of it. 
Who knows! I'm basically rambling right now. I can't wait for season 2.

It separates them in a way that they shouldn't be separated. Dipper and Mabel get along; they are best friends, brother and sister, they love each other, etc. Alex Hirsch himself commented that they are very close, not constantly at each other's throats like everyone on TV is these days.

Now. This pretty much *proves* that Stan had a twin brother who isn't around anymore.

Furthermore both the glasses Stan takes from the room *and* the symbol on his hat are in [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6I-Ha7FJzLY/T-fywuZHSyI/AAAAAAAAIlw/qkaeHnVqw1E/s1600/STAN.jpg) picture. I think that these symbols are kinda like family crests and each one follows a specific bloodline through life. One part of my theory is that Stan, his brother, Dipper and Mabel's parents, and some other characters were apart of a secret society that knew about the secrets of Gravity Falls. But when Stan's twin got too far deep into the mystery he died and with that the rest of the members were too scared to move on in the adventure and with that Dipper and Mabel's parents didn't pass their symbol down to their kids.

It would explain why there were so many odd things in the secret room. It could've been Stanley's old room and with him being so involved in the mysteries he kept some things.

What do you guys think of my theory? I'd like to think it's pretty solid.",,True,nsfw,t5_2udb8,1365029291.0,,,True,t3_1bm6hx,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1bm6hx/stanley_and_stanford_spoilers/,

Please post your theories or modify ones that have already been posted in the comments!,instant_,39,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1hrmia/large_theory_compilationdiscussion_thread_please/,"This was originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1f09tq/new_theory/), but since then I have come up and seen some new theories and I thought that I should update this with the new release of ""Dreamscraperers."" A lot of the inspiration for these theories came from the discussion pages on this subreddit. I will make edits to this thread if more theories become apparent and seem to hold some form of logic.

**ORIGINAL**

Here it goes:
Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well, I think it could have a lot to do with this [guy.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG)

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan. Now, I am aware of the Stan/Stanley theory and different versions of it, but I believe mine is a little different. So, of course when Stan goes into the hidden room he pics up a pair of [glasses.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/6/6a/S1e16_what_are_Stan%27s_glasses_in_the_secret_room.....hmm....png) He looks at them and then is seen later in the episode looking at them and thinking as well. They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, I know that this has already been observed and it is a known theory. But, what I do not believe has been discussed is HOW the glasses got there. My theory is this: at some point, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, Stan informs Mabel that she HAS to marry Gideon. He then says, ""...plus, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat."" Then, Mabel runs away screaming and Stan screams, ""bodies change honey...bodies change."" Let me know what you guys think!

**Update for ""Dreamscaperers""**

In this episode we see many age versions of Stan ([example 1](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/ce/S1e19_It_sucks..png)). Throughout the episode we can see his different features. Try and pay close attention to the nose, eyes and hair. I feel that it is still different enough from [this guy](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG) to be considered the Stan that we know. 

My belief regarding this is that it can be one of two things:
     1. It is Dipper in the future/past (""the future is in the past, ONWARD AIOSHIMA!"" -Mabel)
     2. It is Stan's brother/twin that he switched places with in the ""Carpet Diem"" episode. (An extra possibility on this is that he is in some sort of alternative dimension.
     3. Lastly, as said in the flash game ciphers a while ago. It says that there is a secret society in Gravity Falls, it would make sense to say that he is a different member of the secret society. This also opens up the possibility that he is also Stan's brother/twin or even a future/past Dipper! I theory that was also talked about in the same thread was that Stan's new hat that was switched after a goat ate it belonged to the other member of the secret society. As you can see in the [picture](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG), this man is not wearing a fez. 

**Bill Cipher (A.K.A. ACE)**

Bill clearly knows Stan. It is apparent when Gideon mentions his name in the first place and mumbles ""Stan Pines...."" He also [changes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/1/12/S1e19_Stan%27s_full_tatoo.png) and we can see Stan's full tattoo. This shows that he is aware of the tattoo and most likely knows about its origins. My only theory on this is that it is related to the secret society along with Bill himself. 

He also changes to show an [angry Stan reaching towards something](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/8/8d/S1e19_stan_pines....png). I think this suggests that Stan was involved in some sort of battle with Bill. I assume this has to do with the secret society as well.

They keep referencing age in this episode, more specifically, I think they were referencing Gideon's age. Here are some things I've notice from the series:

* Gideon always refers to the twins as ""kids"" or Dipper as ""boy.""

* He has a vocabulary beyond a normal child's as noted by Stan in Hand That Rocks the Mabel. He's in Gideon's house and asks if he has a word a day calendar.

* Gideon is the only child with 4 fingers. I know, they have stated that it's an artistic choice, but recently there was talk that Gideon may have 4 fingers for a reason.

* He dresses like an old man with a suit instead of more normal clothes a kid would wear. There was a time when men wore suits and that's exactly what he does.

* When Mabel rubs Soos' Grandma's face, she says it's ""old lady soft."" When the head of the gnomes, Jeff, rubs Gideon's hand he says his skin is soft and asks if he moisturizes.

* On stage when Stan tells everyone Gideon's a fraud, Gideon refers to him as ""old man,"" Stan fires back ""I'll show you who's the old...""

* When Mable tells the gnome Jeff about Gideon and mentions his white hair, Jeff replies ""A muture woman huh?""

* During the scene where Gideon rips the roof off the bus, Soos thinks the situation more closely resembles an old person who won't get off the bus.

Could this be a hint that Stan is what the eye is focused on/seeing? Or that perhaps whoever has the fez is the person that Bill sees? Alternatively, since it's an eye from the side, could it mean that Stan is actually in the eye/Bill's peripheral vision? Not the focus, but at the edge of upcoming events?

Like everyone else I have theories about what's going on and being a family man I started thinking about Dipper and Mabel's dad and why their dad would send them to their great uncle for the summer.

It all started when Stanley and Stanford were born as twins. Growing up in GF they noticed all the weird things happening and probably formed a group to look into the weird thing that was sabotaged from the inside (hence don't trust anyone). 

At some point Stanley sires at least one child, Dipper and Mabel's dad. While their dad is growing up something happens to Stanley and he disappears. Stanford locks the room up with the glasses and moves on. Lacking a father figure, the dad becomes close to Stanford. Stanford and his nephew also try to unlock mysteries together and try to find a way to get Stanley back.

I believe [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/usHa39p.png) is their grandfather Stanley. Notice that while similar to Stanford and Dipper he still has his own features. The cleft chin that Dipper inherited, similar hair style but different color from Dipper, and the glasses that were found in the closed up room that caused Stanford to reminisce.

In time their dad grows up and moves away from Stanford, meets a woman, and starts a family. Reminiscing of the good times he had he decides to send his kids to form some memories of their own. Since Stanford is the only father figure the dad has known it would make sense that he would send the kids there to stay with their Grunkle Stan.",,False,self,t5_2udb8,False,,,True,t3_1ewi3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1ewi3a/family_dynamic_theory_spoilers/,

We added a brand new style to the subreddit. It's definitely not set in stone, so feel free to make suggetions/comments on it, and I'll be happy to change it around based on feedback.

I know the blue takes some getting used to (I'm not one normally to change the background like that) so if you aren't a fan, let us know in the comments below. We might end up lightening it up, or perhaps just reverting to white if people aren't fond of it.

You may remember me from my previous posts regarding theories and some discussion based threads as well. Since the season finale has finally premiered, I think it is high time to do a full Season 1 theory compilation thread. Feel free to contribute in any shape or form! 


Okay, let's get started.


________________


So the most recent post was [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1hrmia/large_theory_compilationdiscussion_thread_please/) This was the update for ""Dreamscaperers."" That thread also includes links and other things involving theory discussions.

______

Okay, so here is a list of some theories that I have written previously in the text threads.

* **The Carpet Diem Theory:** 

Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well, I think it could have a lot to do with this [guy.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG)

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan. Now, I am aware of the Stan/Stanley theory and different versions of it, but I believe mine is a little different. So, of course when Stan goes into the hidden room he pics up a pair of [glasses.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/6/6a/S1e16_what_are_Stan%27s_glasses_in_the_secret_room.....hmm....png) He looks at them and then is seen later in the episode looking at them and thinking as well. They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, I know that this has already been observed and it is a known theory. But, what I do not believe has been discussed is HOW the glasses got there. My theory is this: at some point, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, Stan informs Mabel that she HAS to marry Gideon. He then says, ""...plus, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat."" Then, Mabel runs away screaming and Stan screams, ""bodies change honey...bodies change."" **This is one version of the twin theory and more or less explains it. Please comment any alterations!**


* **Here are the updated theories for ""Dreamscaperers."" This includes some minor alterations to the twin theory as well.**


In this episode we see many age versions of Stan ([example 1](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/ce/S1e19_It_sucks..png)). Throughout the episode we can see his different features. Try and pay close attention to the nose, eyes and hair. I feel that it is still different enough from [this guy](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG) to be considered the Stan that we know. 

My belief regarding this is that it can be one of two things:
     1. It is Dipper in the future/past (""the future is in the past, ONWARD AIOSHIMA!"" -Mabel)
     2. It is Stan's brother/twin that he switched places with in the ""Carpet Diem"" episode. (An extra possibility on this is that he is in some sort of alternative dimension.
     3. Lastly, as said in the flash game ciphers a while ago. It says that there is a secret society in Gravity Falls, it would make sense to say that he is a different member of the secret society. This also opens up the possibility that he is also Stan's brother/twin or even a future/past Dipper! I theory that was also talked about in the same thread was that Stan's new hat that was switched after a goat ate it belonged to the other member of the secret society. As you can see in the [picture](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG), this man is not wearing a fez. 



* **Here is my theory on Bill Cipher:**


Bill clearly knows Stan. It is apparent when Gideon mentions his name in the first place and mumbles ""Stan Pines...."" He also [changes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/1/12/S1e19_Stan%27s_full_tatoo.png) and we can see Stan's full tattoo. This shows that he is aware of the tattoo and most likely knows about its origins. My only theory on this is that it is related to the secret society along with Bill himself. 

He also changes to show an [angry Stan reaching towards something](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/8/8d/S1e19_stan_pines....png). I think this suggests that Stan was involved in some sort of battle with Bill. I assume this has to do with the secret society as well.



 _______


Well, now that that is done with, here are a few of my theories regarding the season finale, Gideon Rises.


____



First off, we now know officially that there is a secret ""society"" so to speak regarding the books. I saw it posted in another thread that he said ""we"" now finally have the books. 



Secondly, we now know that there are three levels in the basement. One of them contains multiple electronic gadgets and gizmos but most importantly, the 1st journal. We do not know yet if Stan WROTE the journal, but we do know that he knows an awful lot about it.


As far as theories go, all of the evidence here seems to support some of the theories that have already been put in place. But there are still many unanswered questions. I for one cannot wait until season two! 



Just as a finisher, did anyone notice that when Soos was in the restaurant as the cook, Stan called him a ""man....child""? 


My theory on this is that Soos is a kid trapped in an adults body. That would def. explain his personality. 


Well that's it from me! Thanks for reading and be sure to put your own theories in the thread!

 ”Fight Fighters” – After being challenged to a video game battle by Wendy’s boyfriend Robbie, Dipper is shocked when his favorite playable fighter, Rumble McSkirmish, comes to life to defend him. But Dipper soon loses control over Rumble McSkirmish and has to find a way to stop him in a new episode of “Gravity Falls,” premiering FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14 (9:30 – 10:00 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel.

”Little Dipper” – Dipper feels self-conscious that Mabel is taller than him and is becoming the alpha twin, so he seeks out a magic way to grow himself the same height. Meanwhile, Lil’ Gideon takes advantage of Dipper’s and Mabel’s height discrepancies in a new episode of “Gravity Falls,” premiering FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28 (9:30 – 10:00 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel.

&amp;nbsp;

###Emote Example:

\[](#mabel ""Mysteries, Mysteries Everywhere."")

*turns into*

[](#mabel ""Mysteries, Mysteries Everywhere."")

[](#sp)

**Remember: you can see embedded text in emoticons by rolling over them with your mouse!**

**If you want the hidden text to always display, [install this handy userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/109869).** There's also one available for [safari](http://www.sitharus.com/2011/11/reddit-title-text-expander-safari-extension.html).

&amp;nbsp;

###Reversing Emotes:

To reverse an emoticon (flip it horizontally), simply put 'r' before the code. For Example:

\[](#rdipmad)

turns into

[](#rdipmad)

[](/sp)


###Spacing Out Emotes:

In order to properly space out emotes, simply use the code \[](#sp). It will create a new line in between emotes.

\[](#gnome)

\[](#sp)

\[](#rgnome)

turns into

[](#gnome)
[](#sp)
[](#rgnome)
[](#sp)

###RES:


When composing replies, you may find that the Live Comment Preview feature of [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com) helps make sure you're posting the emoticon you intend to! It's also a handy tool for a variety of other reasons. Definitely recommend an install if you intend to stick around.

&amp;nbsp;

###EMOTES!

You can also use the grid system for emotes, \[](/gfXY). X is the column, and Y is the row. To reverse them using this system, put an r in front of it.

\[](#gf01)

[](#sp)

turns into

[](#rgf01)

[](#sp)

In the distant past (possibly THE BEGINNING OF TIME ITSELF), Time Baby was a benevolent being. It ruled over the fabric of spacetime with a gentle hand, even if that hand did smell kind of like throw-up and diapers. It created an ancient order to preserve the sanctity of time: the Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron. This squad would live on in secret through thousands of generations.

One fateful day -- though of course all days are as stitches in the giant binkie of spacetime to Time Baby -- some kind of horrible corruption befell Time Baby. In its last desperate moments of clarity, Time Baby [sealed itself in a glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) to protect the world from its own inevitable path of destruction. Modern civilization grew as Time Baby was locked in the Antarctic ice, causality protected by the vigilant members of the TPAES. All that remained of Time Baby were echoes on the wind, hints that some kind of evil baby that devoured time was locked in a glacier. Few alive, even among the TPAES, knew of its true nature.

At the end of the world, Evil Time Baby breaks free of its prison. (Stupid global warming.) Time is but a giant figure-eight-shaped rattle to Time Baby, though, so Good Time Baby sees all of this from its high chair at the beginning of time. Thus, an eternal war is being waged in the Gravity Falls universe. Good Time Baby struggles against Evil Time Baby across the depths of the ages, perfectly locked in skill and strength. Neither can destroy the other without collapsing the universe in a giant paradox. Will it ever end?...

It's the only children's show I've ever watched that I actually *wanted* to watch. The show is such a fun blend of the children's genre, excellent animation, and subtle references to adult shows my wife and I have enjoyed like The X-Files, Twin Peaks, etc. 

Online show/genre recommendation engines fall short in finding any sort of match because they weight the whole child/youth aspect too heavily and skim over the actual content/style of the show. Jinni.com, for example, recommends Charlie and Lola which is, siblings aside, absolutely nothing like Gravity Falls. 

So to that end, fans of the show, could you recommend *anything* remotely like Gravity Falls that fits into the broad genre of super-natural/suspense *and* is child-friendly?

First, Stan is their Gruncle, or ""Great Uncle"". Your great uncle is your parent's uncle, or your grandparent's brother. Therefore, Stan MUST have a sibling, and that sibling MUST be the grandparent of Mabel and Dipper. Also, they have the same (uncommon) last name. Considering that the vast majority of parents (when the parents or grandparents got married) give their children the father's last name, and barring lesbian adoption, that sibling is almost DEFINITELY his brother. 

Whether it's a twin or not has yet to be seen. In fact, due to the time travel screenshot, and the boxing memory, it's pretty likely. But please stop suggesting his brother as a ""theory"".

her grappling hook yet",TheSind,28,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/y63aa/a_possible_explanation_as_to_why_mabel_hasnt_used/,"At the end of the first episode, *Tourist Trapped*, Mabel got herself a neat grappling hook that she played around with for long enough for it to seem like it was going to be an important object throughout the series. Hoever, it hasn't been shown ever again since.

This is something that has been puzzling me for a while, but I just discovered something that might explain why Mabel hasn't been using her grappling hook since she aquired it in episode one.

First off, if you aren't familiar wih it, check out [Joe Pitt's tumblr](http://joedrawsstuff.tumblr.com). He is one of the show's directors, and has released a bunch of design sheets for characters and scenes from the show. You might even be able to figure out the mystery about the missing grappling hook by yourself ;)

One of the things you might have noticed is that *Legend of the Gobblewonker* was the first episode to be made acording to [this post](http://joedrawsstuff.tumblr.com/post/26357268683), not tourist trapped. Notice how the sheet marks it as ""Episode: 101"". The same post also has a sheets from *Headhunters*, marked ""Episode: 103"". So where does this put *Tourist Trapped* You might be guessing 102, but [another post](http://joedrawsstuff.tumblr.com/post/25581910122) shows that it is actually *107*, which is a bit later in the production.

Which brings me to my theory: The grappling hook is an item that was designed much later in the story, and was probably supposed to be aquired somewhere alongside dippers ""Presidential key"". However, they probably figured it would be best to seprate them by a few episodes, or they just didn't have anything else to give Mabel in episode one.

Either way, this could potentially explain why episodes 2-8 don't have the grappling hook; since the episode was designed somewhere around the same time as episode 8. Also, if this theory is true, the item should be showing up again within the next two episodes.

Personally I have my fingers crossed, and I really hope it wasn't just a throwaway gag.

 What fan theories or Easter eggs have you found in Gravity Falls?


Here is mine: Fingers. Most adults in Gravity Falls have five fingers. For example, Grunkle Stan: [](#grunklemad). 


Most kids and teens on the other hand (wakka wakka) have four fingers [](#gf12).

However Gideon has five fingers, while Sheriff Blubs has four. 

Finally both Book Two and Three have gold hands on the cover. Each with six fingers on them.

The Mabel/Stan subplot was better than the one in Dipper Vs Manliness thankfully. Considering that, I'd put it right above that episode in quality. 

The pixel animation was beautiful, and all the video game references make the episode incredibly rewatchable. 

The voice acting in this episode was spot on, with all the characters. 

This was ultimately a good Robbie episode, making his appearance in future episodes I expect more likeable. 

I like that Waddles did not go the way of the grappling hook, and actually showed up this episode. 

Poor Free Pizza Guy :( 

More screen time for Soos! 

Did I mention the awesome voice acting here?

And the 16-bit background music was icing on the cake.

So I first got into this show because I just LOVED the colors alone. And then I found out it's a comedy/horror cartoon based on mystery and cryptozoology? Stop pushing those buttons!

So I was just curious, what kinds of cryptids are you guys looking forward to see? What do you guys think about Gravity Falls introducing their own creatures (ie The Summerween Trickster)?

Personally I think their own creations are pretty interesting, but I definitely would want the Mystery Twins to come across something cool like the [Jersey Devil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Devil), or something that is unsettlingly creepy such as the [Batutut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batutut).

1373450176.0,25,self.gravityfalls,1hzyph,Cryptograms and Pyramid Guy,elkpapa,25,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1hzyph/cryptograms_and_pyramid_guy/,"Before reading this, I highly suggest reading up on the Bill Cipher GF Wiki page (http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/Bill_Cipher), and then check out the hints from Rumble's Revenge video game (http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/Rumble%27s_Revenge#Cryptograms) which foreshadow Bill's presence and other mysterious happenings in GF. Below are some speculations as to what exactly those might be, but mostly pertaining to Bill's role in previous episodes.



I'm guessing the ""handyman"" mentioned in hint #2 is Soos , because Bill makes a similar comment at Soos at the final showdown in ep 19, and Soos blatantly skirts the issue. Also, #3 and #6 are obviously references to ep 19 since Gideon is looking for the deed, and Bill comes ""back"" to GF in ep 19 (he's summoned again, that is). Perhaps #5 is a reference to Dipper literally throwing fire at him at the end of the episode, or it could be a non-specific threat.

In the episode, Bill says he already knows Dipper, Mabel, and Soos (""the pine tree, the shooting star, and the question mark""), so it's not a large leap to the realization that the cryptograms at the end of each episode are potentially his doing. On top of that, one of the end of episode cryptograms is ""Ever noticed Stan's tattoo?"" And Bill is the only character to ever refer to Grunkle Stan as just ""Stan"" with the exception of Lazy Susan. Obviously Bill appears in almost every episode, seemingly watching the characters: his image is on a DVD cover, various rugs, multiple stained glass windows, and even the screen of an arcade game (see wiki page for pictures). He could just be a recurring symbol coincidentally, but one of the Rumble's Revenge hints states that ""there is a secret society in Gravity Falls""; perhaps the secret society posts his images? Either that or we can assume he is actually there, since not only is he 2-dimensional physically, but he is also an inter-dimensional being, and apparently only appears in 3 dimensions when summoned.

Just some thoughts. Please post ideas in the comments! (This is my first post :D)",,True,nsfw,t5_2udb8,False,,,True,t3_1hzyph,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1hzyph/cryptograms_and_pyramid_guy/,

Should be a quick one, but I've seen a lot of theories flying around. Some of which are decent (e.g. Stan's brother, Gideon's age) and others which are not so decent (a lot of stuff about McGucket). Just a friendly plea to have at least a couple pieces of evidence to corroborate your theory. What you suggest should not just be possible, but plausible. Of course, I'm not trying to be a jerk, and it's always awesome to find such an active fanbase. I'm just tired of finding stuff that either can't work because of evidence from the show, or something that's based on one thing and doesn't really make sense. Again, not trying to discourage anyone, but rather encourage people to dig a little deeper.

2. We're all freaking out about what to do until Season 2 arrives. For those of you who are older than Gravity Falls's target audience (like, high school at least) and have a Netflix account, I highly recommend watching [Twin Peaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks). As I'm watching it, I notice that Gravity Falls shares an overall tone and a kind of ""mystery"" plot style with Twin Peaks. I'd go so far as to say that Gravity Falls is kind of like Twin Peaks Jr.

I will say that Twin Peaks is pretty surreal, and it's definitely crime-drama. If anyone has any other ideas about what to watch to keep us in the mood while we wait, I'd love to hear them.

First off, lets start with the most recent episode, Dreamscapers. In it, we see a young Stan being taught to box. Cute. But, in the back corner of this image is a boy dressed just like Stan, same down to the last detail- and conspicuously holding a book in front of his face. This sparked my new theory; Stan has a twin. As soon as I thought that, I remembered seeing Stan's license plate: STNLYMBL (aka Stanley Mobile). So his real name is Stanley? No. Gideon and everyone else who has used his full name says ""Stanford."" Stanford and Stanley Pines- twins. Also, the room they find in Carpet Diem? Stanley's room. The glasses that are subtly different from Stan's? Stanley's glasses. That also ties in with the symbols on Bill's wheel for each character. Everyone's like ""why does Stan have two symbols?"" He doesn't. The moon symbol from his fez is for Stan- and the glasses are for Stanley. This is evident by Stan's reaction to the glasses in Carpet Diem, which is pretty emotional, for him.

Here it goes:
Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well, I think it could have a lot to do with this [guy.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/f/fe/S1e9_young_stan.PNG)

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan. Now, I am aware of the Stan/Stanley theory and different versions of it, but I believe mine is a little different. So, of course when Stan goes into the hidden room he pics up a pair of [glasses.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/6/6a/S1e16_what_are_Stan%27s_glasses_in_the_secret_room.....hmm....png) He looks at them and then is seen later in the episode looking at them and thinking as well. They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, I know that this has already been observed and it is a known theory. But, what I do not believe has been discussed is HOW the glasses got there. My theory is this: at some point, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, Stan informs Mabel that she HAS to marry Gideon. He then says, ""...plus, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat."" Then, Mabel runs away screaming and Stan screams, ""bodies change honey...bodies change.""

So I've been giving some thought to the whole [Stanley/Stanford](#spoiler) question going around so get out your good 'ol tinfoil hats:

If Stanford is Dipper and Mabel's Great-Uncle, that means that Stanley could probably be their grandfather. I say probably because while it is conceivable that their actual grandparent is some unknown third sibling, that complicates things a little too much for my taste. 

So! A potential answer to ""what happend to Stanley?"" is that he got married and moved away from Gravity Falls, leaving his ~~Mystery~~ Shack to Grunkle Stan who found his notes/research and took over custody of whatever needs hiding. This implies that there is a chance that we may yet see Stanley if he's alive and gives a good opportunity for older sibling rivalry and ""Grandpa? what are you doing here?"" lines from the twins.

**IF** they were working together before Stanley moved then it gives Grunkle Stan a reason to not like marriage - hence his tasteless joke on the lake with the weak justification that ""It's funny because marriage is terrible."" 

I'm grasping at straws people, but straws is all we got for now. Thoughts? Ideas? ""You're so wrong it boggles my mind?"" Sorry for rambling. 

**TL;DR**: the real take away here is that I think Stanley is the Twins' grandfather and there's all sorts of neat implications with that relationship.",,True,nsfw,t5_2udb8,False,,,True,t3_1ew100,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1ew100/yet_another_stanstan_theory/,

Thought this episode was fantastic, though all episodes have been I guess. Still, thought it was funnier than ""The Deep End"" and more on par with ""Boss Mabel"" (though not quite the greatness of ""Time Traveler's Pig"") in terms of quality.

The only thing that bummed me out a little was that I would have liked if the voices didn't switch. One of the cool things about body swapping is that it lets actors show a bit of range by physically having to inhabit another person. Think it would have been cool to see Schaal and Ritter to do their impersonations of the other characters rather than just playing their characters in different bodies. But then all the other character and voice swapping was great, so I guess I can't complain.
