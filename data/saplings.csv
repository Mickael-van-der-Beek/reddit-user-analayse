1334920946.0,142,self.saplings,sjhes,"Everything a beginner needs to know about cannabis. Self-post, too, so please upvote.",econymous,164,22,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/sjhes/everything_a_beginner_needs_to_know_about/,"Disclaimer: Dammit, Jim! I'm a stoner, not a doctor! Some of these may not be 100% true for all people and some facts may have been omitted. I'll fix them as they're brought to my attention. Also, **please look up applicable laws in your state to determine if cannabis is right for you.** 

Basically, cannabis comes in three flavors. Sativa, Indica, and a third one that's useless called... Rudimentia or something similar. No one smokes that third one. It's not used for hemp or what-have-you either, given that it's the smallest of the three. 

Now, Sativa is not similar to salvia at all, although it is an easy thing to confuse. 

Sativa (as was mentioned before) gives you more of a head-high. This can be both good and bad. 

Upsides

* More energetic (not crazy hyper like coke or anything, just awake)

* Much more of a ""free-your-mind"" type of high. You'll have all kinds of weird thoughts you wouldn't otherwise have.

Downsides

* PARANOIA. This is everyone's problem with sativa. When I said freeing your mind, what I meant was... it kind of kicks you out of your habits of thinking. Normally your brain tells you ""no, that's ridiculous, don't waste your time thinking about that"" but with a decent head high you don't think like that. This means that every cloud will look very cool, you'll have crazy insightful thoughts, and every time you take a step you will imagine a cop or a thug is right behind you. You should note that not everyone gets paranoid, most people aren't affected like this at all. I am, though, and most people that say they don't like pot are affected in the same way.

Fun facts

* It grows much taller, up to 25 feet in height. As such, it's typically grown in large outdoor groweries. Were it legalized, this is what would be grown in Cali due to their excellent growing conditions (google the Green Triangle to see what I'm talking about).

* Additionally, if cannabis were legalized to grow for non-recreational/medicinal purposes, such as hemp, this is what they would use because a taller plant can produce much more hemp using much less ground space.

Then there's Cannabis Indica, the body-high

Upsides

* Much more similar to being drunk.

* No paranoia or bad feelings at all.

* Very relaxed high; you'll lay back, say ""oh man, I am sooooo stoned"" as opposed to sativa where you'll lay back and say ""oh shit man, I don't even think time is real""

Downsides:

* You can get too tired. This isn't a ""fall asleep where you're standing"" thing, but more of a ""I'm real stoned, I'm gonna lay down"" and then wake up 2 hours later, completely sober.

* The body high can kind of mess with your depth perception and make you dizzy. Someone mentioned in a different thread the feeling of falling backwards every time you sit down. This can happen, but it's avoidable by just not leaning/laying back. Sitting up straight works just fine, as well as standing. In **extreme** cases (as in, ""this happened to a friend of a friend once"") the dizziness can lead to nausea and vomiting. Again, I've never seen this.

Fun facts: Indica grows much smaller, bushier, and has much wider leaves than sativa. As such, it's grown indoors much more than sativa. However, the shorter/bushier look does not suit well for production of anything other than, well, recreational/medicinal buds. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: It hits everyone differently. The above descriptions of the effects are as general as I could make them. **

Methods of ingestion (Ranked from most to least economical in terms of amount of weed required to get you high)

**LESS IMPORTANT NOTE:** For most of these you are going to have to grind your weed up in to small pieces. It's pretty easy, if you don't have a grinder I typically just crush it with my hands while it's still in the plastic bag. You need fairly small pieces. Fill the bowl right up with those, push 'em down a bit and you're set. Except for hookahs. Smoking pot out of a hookah requires at least a little experience so I won't go in to it here.

* Edibles. The basic tradeoff with edibles is that you can get much, much higher than smoking or arguably vaporisation, but to make a batch of brownies or what-have-you, you need a fairly large amount of weed. Baked goods like this work because THC is released through heat (HEAT not carbonization, this is important). THC will also bind with alcohol and fat, which makes ""weed tea"" a possibility. NOTE: weed tea does NOT involve pouring fat nugs into a mug of hot water and stirring. Google some recipes. One of the favored methods of ingestion via edible is called ""cannabutter"" which as it sounds is butter infused with cannabis. Tastes delicious, you can store in your fridge or spread it on anything. Oh, one more downside to edibles: They take a fairly long time to make and they smell VERY strongly while you do so.

* Vaporizers: Expensive pieces, but definitely worth it. They are the best method of ingestion you can buy. There are a few ways to vaporize the THC in weed. As I mentioned before, it is released via heat only, not by flame.  The main methods are the hookah and the vaporizer. A vaporizer, or vape, is definitely the more popular, at least here on the weed-related subreddits. Specifically, most members will point you towards a portable vaporizer called the Magic Flight Launch Box, or MFLB. I don't own one and have never seen one, but I've only ever heard good things about it online. So I won't vouch for them but you should look them up if you've got the money. Anyways, vaporizers are one of the healthiest ways to smoke, although many people say that it will affect the high. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but definitely a different high. This may be due to the lack of smoke not causing a shortness of breath+head high. I'm not too sure. Anyways, vaporizers work by heating up the weed, usually using electricity or indirect flame from a lighter. NOTE: indirect flame from a lighter makes it look like you're smoking meth. Use an electric vape as they're much better with temperature + heat distribution. 

* Hookahs: Huge range of expenses. Mine was $140 and has served me very well. I've seen smaller ones go for $20, and on eBay you can buy artistic ones that range up to thousands of dollars. Hookahs are one of the only pieces that are actually meant to be ""tobacco only"", at least according to modern day hookah enthusiasts. They were invented in afghanistan and were probably one of the first ways to enjoy pot, in the form of hashish. Nowadays, most hookah ENThusiasts will tell you to smoke shisha (a delicious mixture of tobacco, honey, and various flavorings) out of a hookah and never soil it with drugs. This may be the way to go if you have a really nice, expensive, classy hookah, but if you have a cheapo $20 one you should be fine. Hookahs also utilize vaporization, but in a slightly different method. It's hard not to look classy as all fuck while smoking a hookah. Basically, at the top of this long stem, there is a bowl. Inside the bowl sits the shisha or weed. There are small holes in the bottom (enough to pull vapor thru but not your smokeable). On top of the bowl goes a screen, or, if you're cheap, a piece of tin foil with holes poked in it. To be honest, I've tried both and they work equally well. On top of the tin foil is a coal. The heat from the coal will get hot enough to vaporize the weed or shisha without burning it. You inhale through a hose. (picture the caterpillar from alice in wonderland, he smoked a hookah). The hose connects to the base which is full of water. Important: The hose ends inside the base, but a you're not inhaling any water. The water simply cools the vapor down and perhaps filters out some of the nastiness inherent with coals. The stem to which the bowl is attached goes down below the water line. So, you inhale through your hose, this pulls air down over the coal (which heats said air up), the hot air passes over the shisha or cannabis (which is already pretty hot from the coal being right on top of it) and pulls down the THC, or tobacco+flavoring. This goes down the stem, into the water, then out of the water, through your house, and into your body. Hookahs are my favorite way to smoke, due to the absolutely delicious flavoring of the shisha. There are (legal) hookah bars in most US cities where you can go and smoke high-quality shisha out of high-quality hookahs. Since shisha is just tobacco you need to be 18 to enter but other than that they are 100% legal. I highly advise you check one of these out. They do **not** allow marijuana in there, as this would be *very* illegal and they'd get pretty fucked.

I've been doing P90x before Every smoking session my friends generally joing me since I'll smoke them out before we do P90x. I'm literally getting a six pack and am getting in the best shape of my life, my self esteem is through the roof, my friends are also seeing dramatic results. I make enough money and finally balanced my budget and payed off all my debt with my part time job money. Now that my debts are payed I buy just about anything I want and drive my honda civic that gets 37mpg and is a stick shift! (my first car which I also payed for with my extra cash I've been saving up from working so much)

I've met the greatest people in my life and have a much better and healthier social life now. I don't have a girlfriend yet, but I figure with the body I'm building I'll have no problem finding a decent chick who is also healthy smokes and takes care of herself. I have an amazing set of friends who I always smoke out at my house since I have the extra weed money from my part time job, they love to come over and workout and smoke with me! We jam to the greatest tunes and have the grandest adventures together, I couldn't ask for better friends, I'm so appreciative.

Smoking gives me dry mouth so I bought a 1L Sigg bottle. I have gotten into the habit of drinking 3 liters of water a day, which makes me feel amazing.

When I smoke I get bad munchies. So I stopped buying junk food and have only fresh fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. I'm almost a vegitarian I just dont keep meat and junk food in the house. I can have it if I go out, just no junk food at home. By far one of the greatest things that's happened to me. I eat to make My body happy, I no longer eat to make ME happy.. 


I have become less selfish and more appreciative, I buy what I need and use the hell out of it. I no longer buy nick nack random crap that is literally just 'stuff' to make me happy. I have removed all the 'stuff' in my life and literally have what I need and a few things that I like to have but don't need (nice gaming computer, new cell phone, tv etc) I'm simple and run efficiently.


I have pretty bad ADHD that doesn't allow me to focus on anything in school really. I'm not going to brag, but I'm smart enough to catch on and pass without having to study really, but I make B's. I can really focus now and do my work, something I've never been able to do without literally forcing myself to be encaged in the library at the last minute so I dont fail. I'm out of school this semester saving up money and getting out of debt.

I occasionally smoke with my sister and we watch great movies and play mario party and just have a great time actually getting to know my sister. Something I've never stopped to do anymore.


I feel like our normal life is this structured mess where we build and build and build, sketching out on a canvas, intentionally applying specific strokes to get the main painting. But it's the blurry weekends, the times you find it hard to recall everything because you were just living life. Those blurry moments are the brush strokes that brings everything together and creates your masterpiece. 

For me a smoking session is when I stop walking down the busy street
and stare. Just soaking in life and all it has to offer, sometimes the ideas are good sometimes they are bad, sometimes they make me happy sometimes they make me sad. It's all life. ""To each his own"" ""Such is life"" I understand those words now. Actually I dont understand the words, thats folly, I understand the emotions those words are meant for. 

/r/trees, and /r/saplings.. You're the greatest thing that has every happened to me.. Before you guys I was as average as an average man comes. Now. I'm going to be something exceptional! Make a Man of myself! It feels good :) I can honestly say I'm happy with my life and what I've finally made of myself. I could get in a car wreck right now and die and just be another unknown statistic to the world. But I'll know. I'll know I was a beautiful and fruitful plant. And you guys *cheers* it was great for what it was and is :) ""Love and peace!"" -Vash The Stampede

",Brinjal,132,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/xnf8b/whats_so_good_about_being_high_a_guide_for/,"*This is a small guide aimed primarily at first-time smokers and those who have had weird, unpleasant or unmemorable experiences with weed so far. Regular 
users probably intuitively understand what I'm talking about, but hopefully putting it in to words is interesting and helpful to you.  Most of the advice 
that potential smokers receive concerns proper inhalation technique, comparisons of different methods of ingestion, and activities and snacks to try during 
the high. I will talk about the actual sensation of being high and what you can do increase your enjoyment of the experience.*


Ask a regular smoker, ""*Why do you enjoy being high?*"" and you'll receive many answers. But when it comes down to it, it's difficult to express. Everything 
seems richer and rawer. Some people describe a child-like sense of wonder. You derive even more pleasure from doing the things you love. It's almost as if 
you perceive the world in higher resolution. 


*Life in HD.*


Here's what weed is to me:


A **Magnifying Glass for Awareness**.


A magnifying glass allows you to see something in very great detail. It reveals what you would otherwise overlook or be unable to perceive. It allows you to 
focus on one subject, to the exclusion of everything else in your visual field. Weed does the *same* thing to your awareness. It lets you to focus on something with your whole attention. 


To extend the magnifying glass metaphor, 
if you were to pass an anthill while walking, you would probably glance at it and continue on.
Maybe you would watch the amorphous, black mass coalesce around its tiny pyramid for a few moments before moving on.
But, if you stopped and crouched over the hill and pulled out your magnifying glass, the black mass would dissolve into individual ants going about their day.
You would see one ant bringing a crumb five times its size back home. Or 100 ants fighting, overwhelming and evenutally dismantling a doomed
grasshopper. After watching for a time, the patterns and behaviours of these ants slowly become apparent. You may start to notice alien reflections of human society in the miniscule civilization 
you are hunched over. Waste disposal, resource collection, social stratification and class, cooperation, territoriality, war, sex and the daily grind and on and on. All of this is exhibited by tiny insects 
experiencing the world by blindly probing in front of themselves with their antenna.

*The staggering complexity, beauty and subtlety was there to see the whole time, but it took a magnifying glass and some focus to appreciate it.*


Let me give you a more concrete example. You are eating a bowl of spaghetti while watching television and talking to your friend. Meanwhile your mind is 
running its own narrative, intermittently distracted by the itch in your foot and your body telling you to switch to a more comfortable position. your 
attention is constantly pulled to and fro by the many competing inner and outer signals of everyday life.


Now you are *high*; viewing life through a *magnifying glass*. The *hot* spaghetti, slightly al dante and slick with tomato sauce, *warms* and lights up your 
mouth. A whisper of basil follows a *spicy* garlic note. Saltiness, sweetness and acidity play together on your *tongue*, each affecting the other in a complex 
relationship. You move the magnifying glass. Troy and Abed are building a pillow fort. You remember *childhood* memories of building forts with your 
siblings. This recollection is interrupted by the soundtrack of a commercial whose *melody* entrances you. your *friend* gets the punchline of a joke a few seconds after it's 
delivered and starts laughing. You *laugh* as well and together your laughter builds its own infectious momentum. Your subjective experience continues like this 
for the duration of your high, as you peak it becomes more powerful and as you come down it becomes more subtle.


Once again,


weed is a **Magnifying glass for Awareness**.


Whatever you point your mind at is revealed in greater depth and detail. Allowing you to derive greater enjoyment and meaning from it. It can be a physical 
sensation like touch or taste. It can be sight or sound. Perhaps you are focusing on an emotion, memory or idea. Whatever it is, it is amplified.


*How can you apply this magnifying glass concept?* Here are some


**SIMPLE GUIDELINES** *for first-timers (these are not rules. As you become more comfortable with being high or want to push your limits, you can break these 
guidelines):*


* **1) Don't multi-task**


Looking at several different things through a magnifying glass is difficult. You have to keep switching back and forth between subjects. When you're high, 
try doing one thing at a time, you will be pulled into the experience and enjoy it more. After you are done, move your awareness to the next thing. If you 
are doing several things at once, you may become overwhelmed and confused. This confusion can become an enjoyable odyssey or a bad trip. 


Sometimes it's better to do what you're doing alone or quietly. Social interaction can become another ""task"" that overwhelms you, especially for SAPs.


* **2) Start simple, get complex**


Some things demand more mental resources than others. Eating a burger requires less thought than cooking that burger. You have to form and grill the patty, 
slice tomatoes and lettuce and Caramelize Onions. One requires you to divide your attention between multiple actions while juggling several thoughts and 
timings. Simple activities or thoughts will allow you to focus your attention rather than those which involve many sub-components. 


Social interaction is also more complex than we give it credit for. You must take in a complex array of information involving body language, words, ideas and 
cultural practices, reflect on it and transmit your own signals back. That being said, interaction with fellow human beings can be extremely rewarding while 
high.


* **3) Be aware of (mind)set and setting**


People usually advise this when talking about more powerful psychedelic drugs like LSD or Magic mushrooms, but it is a helpful concept to keep in mind when 
using weed. 


Your current mindset and setting will affect how well you can control your awareness and where it wanders. If you are stressed out, then you will probably 
turn your attention there and amplify those feelings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Weed can help you work through difficult emotions and problems 
because you are able to think more deeply about them. Plus, while high, you can forget about these problems easily by focusing your attention elsewhere. 


In the same way, your surroundings or setting will affect your attention. A sunlit field, with headphones on in the middle of nowhere will present different 
paths for your awareness to travel than a crowded party with friends and strangers. Each of these trips will have a different ""flavour."" Be aware of this. 
Preparation really helps in this area. Know when and where you want to be. Smoke when you know you will be in the mental space you're looking for. Prepare 
your meals and activities so that you're not focused on getting everything together during your high. Of course, disorganized and unprepared highs have their 
own flavour, too. You can have some great adventures.


* **4) Learn to control your awareness**


The bottom line is that you should learn to direct your attention. you should be able to move from one area of intense, telescopic attention to another when 
you want. Or focus deeply on one thing for a period of time. If something is bothering you, learn to turn away from it. If something attracts you, let it 
consume your focus.
 

**COMMON PROBLEMS** *experienced by first timers:*


*""Am I high?""*


*""Nothing's happening. I feel the same.""*


*""Things feel different but normal, too.""*


*""I'm freaking out!""*


If you find yourself dwelling on whether you are high or not, it's because you're understandbly dwelling on your nervousness at trying something new and 
possibly dangerous. Your expectations and anxiety are foremost in your mind. Guide your attention elswhere. Forget about having smoked and enjoy the music 
that's playing or take a bite of that chocolate bar and enjoy the taste. If you like dancing, move around and explore your bodily sensations. Maybe you 
really enjoy nature. Take a hike.


Things that involve consuming, spectating or absorbing are passive and therefore less complex than more active things like creating, doing, or participating. 
Focusing on the physical and tangible is generally easier than focusing inwardly on thoughts and emotions. These are not hard rules and there is a lot of 
overlap of course.


If you feel as if you are freaking out then you may be experiencing sensory overload. Refer to the above guidelines. It's also possible that you are 
confronting some issues that you weren't even aware of when sober.

Although these posts are well-intentioned and come out of desperation, they quickly degenerate in to a quick internet hookup.  
  
I want to take this opportunity to remind people that the internet is not as safe, secure, and anonymous as it may seem, and Reddit, with it's millions of users from all around the world, is absolutely no exception. You do not know who you are talking to, and what intentions they have.  
  
The reasons these posts aren't allowed isn't just so we can play big brother. Most of you are adults and can fend for yourselves, and it is not our place to tell you what's right and wrong, safe and unsafe. The main reason we do not encourage this, is because it simply attracts negative attention. Saplings is intended as a sort of safe internet haven where we can innocently learn about cannabis culture. If this Reddit (or any other for that matter) becomes an online black market and a place to get a quick hookup, it will easily attract the attention of people we do not want. Just like Facebook can be used as incriminating evidence, so too can Reddit, and I assure you, the Reddit team will *not* protect you. They are running a reputable business and will not be held liable for any illegal activities going on on their website.  
  
The bottom line is that it is simply not safe. We want absolutely none of it on Saplings, and most Reddits feel the same way.  
  
For those of you who are genuinely curious in learning *how* to obtain trees in your area, there are many simpler and safer ways.  
1) Find local stoner hangouts in your city. Parks, bridges, schools, what have you. Stoners are all around you, you just have to look for them, and ask.  
2) Order a pizza and ask the delivery guy.  
3) Ask friends, or friends of friends. Go outside your direct social circle if none of your friends have direct access. Somebody you know through 6 degrees of separation smokes weed.  
  
We need your cooperation in keeping Saplings a safe community. Do *not* give out personal information. Do *not* try to obtain trees via the internet.

Click Here,tokepuppet,123,20,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/iy14t/are_you_feeling_too_high_click_here/,"Based on the suggestion of [ballsdeep_in_lame](http://www.reddit.com/user/ballsdeep_in_lame), here's a post where we're going to list some advice for people feeling panicky or scared. 

**First, a quick message to our too high friends:**

1. Keep reminding yourself that you are simply high and it will pass. Being ""too high"" can't hurt you, there's no need to worry.
1. Get as comfortable as you can, be it sitting or lying down.
1. If you're with friends, talk (calmly, no rowdiness) about a subject you like.
1. If you're by yourself, listen to some chill music. Grateful Dead or Simon and Garfunkel are choices I'd recommend. Alternatively, you can watch Regular Show or Adventure Time (fantastic to watch while high). Or whatever other shows you like. Futurama is also a good one (notice the pattern here of bright, colorful cartoons?).
1. Keep hydrated. Water, teas or juices are preferable. Sodas tend to make cottonmouth worse.

EDIT: Hey guys, I've got a quick update. I was out with a few friends on Halloween night, one of them asked me if I wanted to try weed for the first time, he told me there was no pressure and that I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to, so I said no. It was kind of weird, I had a bit of hesitation when I said no, I kind of wanted to do it, just to try once with some good friends...

Some people consider me paranoid about this stuff, but I got busted once and I don't plan to replicate it. I'm sure a lot with disagree with me on this shit, but whatever.

Oh yeah: This is written from the perspective of someone who grew up in a non-medicinal state. The stakes(and what you should do) are different if you're in Cali.

**Not Getting Busted in the First Place**

* **Never break 2 laws at a time**. Or as it was put to me: ""*You never get arrested for having weed in your trunk, you get arrested for having weed in your trunk and your taillight out*""

* **Do not store your weed in the same place you store your driver's license, insurance or registration**. Nothing makes a speeding ticket worse than a marijuana charge on top of it.

* **If you have weed on you, be nice to cops** - Yes sir, no sir. How's your day been sir? Keep your hands on the steering wheel if you're in a car, ask permission before you dig anything out of the car.

* **If you get pulled over, they look for movements from the driver's seat** - Don't turn around, don't throw, don't make any movements that would be clear from your silhouette. Also be aware that they're probably going to do a quick glance behind/under the drivers seat without making you get out of the car. This means dropping it next to/under the seat can be a bad idea. 

* **If you're going to smoke in public, don't use glass.** Use a joint or carry a small piece of tinfoil you can use to ghetto rig a can. The point is you want to be able to eat or quickly toss anything you have. Joints or a 1 hitter are best.

* **If you live in a medicinal state and travel out of state, be on your best behavior.** If you get caught they will likely make you drug test in your home state. If it's legal 90% of the time for you, it's worth being a bit extra cautious that other 10%.

* **Cars are stupid places to smoke. Parked cars are even more stupid.** If you're driving:Cops and citizens are a lot less sympathetic when they think you are endangering others. If you're parked: Your lighter might as well be a road flare at night.

* If you live by water, **use a boat**. Most cops don't give nearly enough fucks to come out and find you, and you're surrounded by a place you can safely toss it.

* **No matter how used to it you get, remember it's illegal** - It's not a big deal for our generation, but many older people still see it as bad. Don't get lazy.

**When The Police Show Up and Know You're Carrying**

* If you're running, be aware that doing so will likely significantly increase your charges and will eliminate any chance they will go easy on you if they catch you. Also be aware that people do get away. Examine your situation carefully. If you're 1 of a hundred people at a party, you may pull it off. 1 of 5 in a parking lot? Just keep your ass still, you're done.

* **Do not consent to a search** - They will find it if you do. They're good at their job. There is a much lower chance they'll be able to get a dog to search your car.

* **Do not ever fucking carry bags or scales on you outside your home** - It's a one way ticket to ""intent to distribute"".

* **One cop is better than 2 cops** - If the cop is going to cut you slack, it's helpful if he doesn't have a partner around. If you're fortunate enough to get a single cop(which doesn't happen often), it's *probably* in your best interests to not give him a reason to call for his partner. I've actually seen a cop help a kid toss beer cans out of his car 'before his hard ass partner showed up'.

* If you have to toss your weed, **toss it somewhere you can't get it back**. Seriously, $60 worth of weed will be the least of your financial problems if they find it. Throwing it in a ditch won't work, they actually look for it.

* **Keep in mind that throwing it is a calculated risk**: They need *something* to search your person(in theory), but the minute that weed leaves your body it's free game.


* **Don't be a dick**, especially if the writings on the wall. You're not going to convince the cop that weed should be legal in a 30 second exchange of words.

**Fuck, you're busted. What next?**

* **If you're under 18, don't freak out.** Your state probably has a way of getting you out with a clean record. In Michigan(for example) there's the 7411 and the ""Youth Training Act""

* **Lawyer up** - There's a plethora of possibilities(like the ones mentioned above) that you don't even know how to ask for. You will get destroyed if you don't do this.

* **Clean your Facebook up** - Limit what will show up in the news feed about you (random inebriated tagging has been the downfall of more than one ent), remove any pictures of you doing anything you shouldn't be at the age you are. Don't add any facebook friends you don't know.

* **Start Saving Money** - Probation is damn expensive. Think ~$80/m just to be on it, plus $5-10 per breathalyzer(frequently required with Marijuana cases), $10-15 per drug test, random court costs.

* **Shut the fuck up to the police**, but don't be arrogant about it. They're going to want to know who the dealer is. If you have a small quantity, they will probably not go significantly easier on you for giving this information up.

* **Going to Court? Get a hair cut, where a damn suit** - Presentation is everything. You need to portray the idea that you have something going for you that they would be screwing up by coming down hard on you.

* **Once there is paperwork done or radio traffic about the incident, you're getting charged.**. Most cops are not going to let you go once either of those things happen.

* **Places drug test differently.** ""Monthly"" tests don't all happen the same way. Some places it means everyday you have a 1 in 30 chance. Some places it means you get tested once a month. Obey the conditions of your probation, but if you're going to break them know what you're getting into.

* **""Diluted"" drug tests generally just mean ' your piss is clear'** - Vitamin B will clear that up. Red bulls have a huge percentage of Vitamin B and will turn your otherwise water filled piss yellowish green in no time. Diluted drug tests are seen by many probation officers to be just as bad as dirty.

* **There is a difference between a lab drug test and a home drug test** - Home tests(which are also used by many drug testing programs) barely work at all. 2-10 days if you're skinny[don't test your luck]. Lab tests can go up to 30 days.

* **Violating Probation is serious business** - They will not be nice to you. They think they *have* to be harsh to send a message you're not getting. Don't give them this chance.

* **If you're in a ""serious business court"" (especially if you're a minor) get your ass to outpatient rehab** - They're going to probably put you there anyways, and it shows the judge you're serious. If you do it ahead of time, you get to pick your own program and they won't want to remove you from it. You can find one you find tolerable.

Unfortunately due to the illegal state of marijuana, giving personal information over the internet in connection to purchasing marijuana is a good way to catch unwanted attention from police and internet weirdoes. In order to solve these problems, I thought it would be imperative to make a guide for finding a new dealer. Most of this information comes from my personal experiences, constructive criticism to this ""guide"" is welcome!  

The number one problem with a lot of these threads being made is that the poster is being socially awkward. Neither myself, nor Reddit can help you with this. This guide is more or less about how to make *friends* with people who smoke pot. Ideally you want a “dealer” that will become a good friend, not because he’s got the hook-up, or just because smoking is the only thing you two have in common, but because you’re both chill ents. 90% of the “dealers” you will encounter just want to smoke for free and buy enough to part out to close friends. Someone who is dealing with harder drugs, or pills, is a gang-banger, or doesn’t like you for whatever reason has WAY MORE excuses to rip you off at some point. **Grow some balls, and go outside.** 

Here are some tips:

- You should ALWAYS start looking for a new dealer before your stash runs out. Otherwise you’re gonna be in a Wendy’s parking lot at 9pm waiting for a friend of a friend to come through. George Carlin was right on when he said that when two guys are sitting alone somewhere in a parked car, you can be sure drugs are involved. 

- Once again, think ahead. Network even when you have bud.

- [Cops **can** legally lie to you,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzYs00pxgE) ~~but they won’t smoke bud with you~~ (see next paragraph). An informant will, but as long as you're not a big time dealer you should be fine. Someone will be a lot more willing to hook you up once you toke with them (if you’re paranoid, make sure they inhale). The laws regarding police conduct may be different where you live compared to where I live, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. If you are paranoid about a police encounter check [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqMjMPlXzdA) out, or get a copy of one of Barry Cooper's DVDs. 

I might be wrong in saying that undercover police cannot use drugs. [Opn420 linked to a page on Erowid which cites 21 U.S.C. § 885(d) of the U.S. Code](http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_info6.shtml) as saying ""Police officers working undercover have exceptions from certain criminal laws. For instance, law enforcement officers directly engaged in the enforcement of controlled substance laws are exempt from laws surrounding the purchase, possession, sales or use of illegal substances."" On the other hand, [here is an article by former Texas police officer Barry cooper where he states that undercover cops were NEVER allowed to partake in illegal drugs on or off the job.](http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/node/18941) 

I am sure there are three things we can all agree on concerning this: (1) the chances of being busted buying a baggie of weed are slim, (2) police officers lie, (3) once arrested there is literally nothing you can say to the police that will help your situation until you speak with your lawyer. 

- Use your fucking head! Don’t front a stranger money. Make sure you have a friend with you before wandering down any dark alleyways. If you live in a dangerous place consider only bringing enough money for whatever you’re going to buy (I tend to always do this as a general rule of thumb). 

- Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. At what point would you be ok hooking up that person in the mirror?

- Dealer etiquette varies from person to person. If you are thinking about posting a dealer etiquette thread consider just asking your dealer in person next time. That way you both know what to expect. If they’re your dealer, and you call to ask if you can visit or talk for a little bit; they will know what’s up.

- If you are going to smoke with your dealer, HE should be smoking you up for patronizing him. Although I would suggest throwing into any bowls you’re going to smoke after the first one.


There are some Internet resources you should check out. Going to Webehigh is a good first move. It might tell you where you can procure bud in your city, but it will also let you know how open or restrictive your area is concerning pot. You might want to check Norml’s website out as well and see if medical marijuana is an option that is available for you. Finally, there is Silkroad, which I would recommend as a last resort for marijuana. If you don’t get scammed, your package could be intercepted or stolen. An ounce of high grade weed is bulky, and REEKS compared to some LSD blotter. 

Although I have never tried it, I have heard that people do have success with pizza guys. (It’s the perfect stoner job after all!) As mentioned before, you should consider inviting him in for a toke first. You could even be innocuous, answer the door with an unpacked bowl and see if they notice, be creative! [Make sure to use your best judgment to safeguard yourself from assholes.](http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/213849/58/Pizza-delivery-guy-calls-cops-on-customer-who-smoked-marijuana) Something else that has brought up is working in a kitchen as a dishwasher. I guess the idea here is that if your every day routine isn't getting you what you want, you need to break out of it and find some novelty/dank nugs. 

Universities and colleges are good places too. If a nearby school has a SSDP, NORML chapter, or other drug reform group… go and hang out! DO NOT discuss trying to buy pot in their office. Go to some meetings, get to know everyone, and ask once some people step out for a cigarette or bowl. Even if your local Uni is an hour away, you should be checking these places out if you’re in high-school anyways!! Towny highschool students would hang out with us all the time and it was totally chill. There is usually a place on campus where stoners go to smoke; probably hills and fields where students chill on in the weekend. They are a cool place to relax with a book or frisbee. I should also mention that a lot of my stoner friends hang out or work in coffee shops, where it’s probably more acceptable to strike up conversations than other places (bonus points if you bring a Jack Herrer or Terrence Mckenna book with you). 

I would say it is likely that any 18 to 20 year old that smokes cigarettes is going to smoke bud. If you are a smoker too, consider approaching them for a chat. Casually bring up that you’re new in town, and if they know anyone with bud. Keep in mind that when selling someone something this is considered the cold approach, and only works for a percentage of attempts. Anyone buying cigars (blunts) or Zigzags at a gas station is probably a toker. But would you follow up with anyone you met at a gas station? 

Take a walk around the parks. They are a great place to hang out in general. Go for a walk and see if you catch a wiff of bud. Dusk or night time would work the best because young people tend to stay up late. Once again, be safe. Parties can work in your favor too. I would recommend NOT buying at the party though. Most dealers I have known cut the bags down to .8 or .7 either as a convenience charge or to take advantage of drunk people. You're better off just bullshitting with the people that are smoking.

[Demographic factors are something you want to consider when approaching someone.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique#Demographic_factors) Please note that I am **NOT** telling you to stick to your own race, or to socioeconomic class, or anything else obviously retarded. I am pointing out that age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender are things you should take into consideration. Don't hang out at a high school trying to pick up bud if you're a forty year old dude. tha_snazzle suggests asking any young white person with dreadlocks. I have had friends (both male and female) who had dreadlocks, and they were constantly jokingly asked about weed by strangers. However, I have a male German flatmate with dreadlocks, and if he does smoke, he's completely down low about it! 

My last piece of advice is avoid false positives. When I ran cross-country in high-school, everyone had long hair and wore jam band t-shirts (most of these people were anti-drug). During a summer evening where a bunch of us were going to play D&amp;D, some of us stepped outside to smoke a jay. A fellow cross country runner panicked, and literally ran away. We thought that he might of went to go get some authority figure but he came back saying he wanted to get away from ""the drugs"". He was wearing a Phish t-shirt.

It's hard to see the thickness of the buds from this overhead view, but it'll give you a basic idea of what a gram generally looks like. 

These buds are relatively dry (sticky with resin perhaps, but no excess moisture that adds weight).

Strains from L to R:

- OG Kush

- Dream Queen (the bottom bud is pretty thick)

- Purple Kush (ran out of buds, had to include some scraps in bottom half)

It's come to my attention that many of you are getting caught with trees. Understandably you're upset and believe the use of trees is a personal decision, and one that you should be allowed to make for yourself. This is true to an extent, and I won't wax lyrical upon what age you should partake in trees or anything like that.

**Disclaimer: if your family are understanding, then talk to them openly and discuss the matter. Take their advice over mine. This advice only applies when you know they have no understanding of cannabis, and you know they'll go mental**

Let's start this off simply - your family loves you, and no matter how angry you feel you still love your family. This is the basic premise I'll be taking here. I understand this may not be true for all of you, and some parents, siblings, or spouses may enjoy making your life a living hell. I'm fortunate enough not to have suffered your plight, honestly I don't understand it, and I would suggest contacing a support charity relevant to your ordeal. Do it now, your life doesn't need to suck.


**The basic premise:** 

Your family disagrees with your decision for thier own reasons, and they want to protect you. This is how true love affects all of us. Nobody wants to see a loved one destroy themselves, especially if that person is your child. Without understanding this none of your family's actions will make sense.


To be able to navigate your problem in a mature and sensible manner, that won't cause friction, you need to use a very basic tool you already understand. **What someone does not know will not hurt them.** You need to be clever, strategic, and determined to this course of action for this to work.


**Understand the initial encounter:**

You got caught. Either your shit has disappeared, or you've been called for 'the talk'. If your stuff has gone, and you are 100% sure you've been caught - own the hell up. This will give the impression that you're scared, confused, and truthful. You want to be working to give this impression from now until everyone forgets about it. If you just get pulled in for 'the talk' then you've been caught off guard, and you don't have the advantage of free confession. This is how most of us find out about the impending shit storm.


You're scared of how all this is going to pan out, you're angry because you feel your rights and privacy have been breached, and you want to vehemently defend yourself. Essentially what you want is for your use of trees to be accepted. If it was an empty can of beer or something they'd probably find it cute and you'll just get a wait until your older then you can drink type of deal. This paradoxical notion is going to annoy the hell out of you.


Instead of being shocked and angry you need to empathise with what your family are feeling about your herb use. They think it's a gateway drug and next thing you'll be shooting heroin into your genitalia. They don't understand that herb is not a gateway drug. Really they could have any number of notions.


You need to understand they are terrified for your safety, and nothing makes people more protective and irrational than thinking their child is in danger. **You cannot intellectualise this or debate it, no amount of rational argument on your part is gong to assuage the sheer terror they feel right now.** If you take anything on board from this it's that these people are only intervening because they want to protect you. Let's be mature about the problem and solve it rationally.


**Strategy for 'the talk':**

Understand that you're working with irrational fear! The **only** path to a win state here is to nullify that fear. You need to think from their point of view, and give them the responses they want to hear.


They want you to understand that you're wrong, they need to see that you think weed is addictive/against god/ going to destroy humanity. Whatever it is they believe, you need to make them understand that's the belief you have also come to by partaking in trees. This is incredibly important, unless you want to be hearing about this bullshit for years. 


It's massively important that you walk out of the talk with them thoroughly believing that weed is a VERY BAD THING! That you know it, and you're now sincerely convinced by their arguments against it.


**Show penitence:**

Until they trust you they're going to keep fucking hassling you. Don't get drawn in by this shit. What's happening is they're working out their own frustrations. You need to adhere to the notion of penitence from the moment you got caught until people shut the fuck up about it.


You need to be consistent. If you make out that you think trees are good then you're just making your life difficult for yourself. You can be bitchy, backtalk, whatever, but your argument must always be that you think weed is stinking shit that corrupts youth. Ask counter questions referring to why they don't trust you. You don't always have to suck it up, but remember... drugs are bad 'mmmkay.

**Something to think about:**

Maybe trees aren't for you right now, it's said that there's a place for drugs, and it's called college. I first smoked trees at 15, occasionally smoked at 18, and became a heavy smoker at about 25. I tried every drug available to me in the two weeks after my 21st birthday, and basically didn't like them.

Take things in your own time.


**Get smart:**

Now your problems are just about over, but if you still want to enjoy trees, you want to get back toking. Now you need to be a hell of a lot smarter than you were before. This will help you endlessly in life anyway. You're not 'living a lie' or some shit, you're compartmentalising your life, being sensible, and exercising sensible levels of caution. AKA being mature.


* Rule 1 - Don't shit where you eat. Don't have a sly toke in your room like some dumb kid, who thinks they can get away with everything, because they're so much smarter than everyone else. That kind of muddy thinking is going to get your ass caught. You will fuck up in some way, eventually, and probably a hell of a lot faster than you think. Any change in your behaviour at home is going to arouse suspicion -Why are your windows always open? - Have you started using more deodorant? - Why does the closet smell of febreeze?


* Rule 2 - Don't be stupid, don't toke with idiots that have no fear of getting caught. Don't let your stupid mates get you caught, I can't stress this enough. And for fucks sake don't get caught by the police. It's not safe to toke it up in the car, walk down the street, or leave evidence of trees on some boozy campout. Don't become overcome by paranoia, but don't be that idiot that thinks they're invulnerable. That's how idiots end up in jail. If you are caught be respectful and deny all knowledge. For fucks sake don't ever talk yourself into police custody, don't chuck your weed out a car window, throw that shit down your neck and keep quiet.

* Rule 3 - If you're out in the wild don't get completely blazed, you're just asking for trouble. Find a safe smoking spot and use that. Don't leave any litter or evidence or your spot will be found. If it's your intention to get really blazed then do it in the safety of someone's home. If you're going to a party that's likely to be busted keep your herbs in a small paper bag, so you can drop them discreetly, preferably whilst walking. In the same vein never take too much weed to a party, or in a car, because you'll never know if you'll need to toss it or eat it.

* Rule 4 - Don't appear to be a stoner. Never go home fucked, your paranoia will betray you. Always carry eyedrops. Don't tell your family you're off to see your best mate that's a stoner, be non-specific, unless you're asked and then either garnish the truth or tell an outright lie. If you tell an outright lie it must be one that cannot be proved or disproved, saying you're going to X's house when you don't actually go over is dumb. Don't answer your phone stoned. Say you were driving, or better convince people you only talk via text or instant message.


* Rule 5 - Never take weed home, ever. You don't need to. Either keep a stash somewhere, or only buy small amounts - enough for you and your pals to blaze in one session. Always check your pockets for incriminating evidence before you go home. Get used to doing it.


* Rule 5a - If you MUST take weed home, hide your shit better. If it's easy for you to get to, and it's in your house or garden, then it's easy to accidentally discover. If you really want to chance it, you think you've got everyone fooled and you're going to keep your shit close, buy a lockbox. Tell everyone you're buying a lockbox to keep your savings, stamp collection, precious porn cutouts from the '70's in. Remember though, that shit is easy to break into. A lockbox is a good idea if you intend to stash stuff at a friends house, because it discourages them from toking it up when they are short.


* Rule 420 - Enjoy your herb, and enjoy your family. They are both good things. If you have to choose, then choose your family. Weed will not be there to help you when you run into serious trouble later in life. In this world the **only** people you can always trust to act in your best interests at a moment of real crisis are your family. You may think I'm wrong, but please don't try to prove it. If you end up homeless, or what the fuck ever, you'll soon learn the limits of a great friendship.

- Never mention trees on the phone or in a text, or even in ""secret code""
- If texting, do not send one message per text (1.yo 2.you good? 3.mind if I stop by?) but rather - may I stop by?
- Dealers know why you are contacting them. Again, just ask if you can stop by. If he/she is good, then they will say yes. If they aren't, then you'll get a no.
- Don't share numbers with your friends without dealer approval.
- Never make your dealer meet a fresh face. Go solo.
- If you're just getting a g, its ok to grab and go.
- If you're getting 1/8th+, its advisable to stay and burn one to cut down on the dealer's traffic.
- Get what you have the cash for. Asking for a front is a scumbag move, except with close friends who really trust you.
- If you're buying headies in a state with a pricey market, don't try to haggle. Dealers with premium product, esp. on the East Coast, have razor-thin profit margins on $60 1/8th tree &amp; most of them are just selling to support their love for trees.
- If it goes dry, don't constantly pester your dealer with herb status updates. They will contact you if and when the drought ends.
- Don't take/make phone calls from your dealers house.

I'm sure there are plenty others, but those are some key ones I wanted to share, in hopes that maybe one day, all this will filter back to me.

I am going to go through the many different types, features, and overall etiquette in a smoke shop or head shop. 

Ok, so you're ready to move up from joints or pipes to bongs, the big leagues. Before you go out to your local smoke shop here's a few tips and pointers you should know. 

**Terminology**: 

*[Downstem](http://reviews.nuggetry.com/post-pics/trikky/trikky-1-5-09-illadelph-slit-style-bushing-diffused-downstem-001.JPG)*: a long, slender tube of glass that holds  the bowl of the bong.

*[Bowl](http://img492.imageshack.us/img492/782/bowl8ae.jpg)*: the small circular glass or acrylic item that holds your trees. 

*[Diffused downstem](http://www.bbsmokeshop.com/files/2009/08/glassonglass19-19mm-glass-on-glass-diffused-downstem.jpg)*: a downstem with holes or slits in the bottom intended to produce more bubbles thus a smoother hit 

*[Percolator](https://www.smoketown-headshop.de/bilder/produkte/gross/50cmBlackLeafPercolatorBong.jpg)*: the percolator is an additional diffusing mechanism made of glass 

*[Honeycomb percolator](http://cdn103.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/472/883/920/phx-hd-honey-comb-bong-4b40.jpg)*: a type of percolator that resembles a honeycomb 

*[Tree percs](http://www.thebongblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TreePerc.jpg) superior to dome percolators, resembles a tree with several branches often with diffused types, can vary greatly in number of branches*

*[Showerhead percs](http://www.thebongblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Eross-showerhead-percolator-300x300.jpg) similar to dome percolators, but have less drag (amount of time to clear bong)*

*[Inline percs](http://www.smoketown-headshop.de/bilder/produkte/normal/40cm-Zenit-Inline-Percolator-Bong.jpg)*

*[Stemline percs](http://cdn103.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/385/137/842/sovereignty-king-stemline-20-inches-tall-brand-new-b7766.JPG) this it the cream of the crop when it comes to percolators, it creates the most bubbles out of all percolators, and more bubbles means smoother hit 

*[Ashcatcher](http://www.gorillaglass.com/images/clear%20g%20on%20g%20ashcatcher.jpg)*: a glass bowl with a basin that is filled with water to quite simply catch ash to prevent it from entering the bong 

[*Ice pinch*](http://www.rollitup.org/members/intrin-71982-albums-random-picture819654-ice-pinch-medicali-bong.jpg): a feature common on many bongs that serves to allow ice to be placed in the chamber of the bong to cool smoke 

*[Stemless](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1353&amp;bih=739&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=Th0Kh5ybAo7bjM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://forum.grasscity.com/toking-tools/546093-syn-inverted-showerhead-stemless-bong.html&amp;docid=xZgZoxQu6IMhlM&amp;imgurl=http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/2965/img00054201002081203.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;h=1536&amp;ei=UeFmT7XzMI6Ttwes9-nTBA&amp;zoom=1)*: many high end tubes (straight shots) do not have a downstem and simply have a integrated downstem. In other words the downstem is attached to the piece 

**Bong Materials**

*[Glass](http://cdn102.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/470/466/936/18-inch-straight-shooter-biohazard-glass-bong-5538e.jpg)*: the best material to use for a bong Highly recommended 

*[Acrylic](http://www.drbongs.co.uk/images/bassuiBong.jpg)*: often times cheap alternative to glass bong, not recommended

***It is necessary to note that not all glass are made the same. There are obviously cheap and durable glass. [Borosilicate glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass) is a very thick, durable material used on high end pieces made by Toro or Sovereignty for example. I'd suggest going boro glass over cheap, mass produced glass. In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6aFmXKlWac) video Luke Wilson, a talented glass blower, touches upon the quality of mass produced pieces.***

**In the Smoke Shop**

-Do NOT mention cannabis in any way shape or form even in you are in a medical state

-Do NOT call them bongs, call them water pipes or pieces

-Be careful when bringing in a piece with marijuana residue. In some shops this is okay, in others this can get you in trouble. 

-Be smart. 

**How To Pick Out a Bong**

1. Determine your price range. Bongs can range from as little as $10 to thousands of dollars. It's important to determine your price range to find the best product. 

2. Straight shot, beaker or other? Now, this is mostly a matter of personal preference. Straight shots offer the least drag and fastest snap (amount of time it takes bong to clear). Beakers offer more surface area and therefore more smoke. Other types, like bubbles, are a combination of both beaker and straight shot. I suggest straight shot as it clears the fastest. 

3. Artistry, ornate designs, and decorations do not improve the quality of the piece. Many people argue this because they believe a piece should have character and I completely agree, but not at the price of quality. Too often I see saplings buying cheap, but beautiful looking pieces only to have them break very, very easily. Please be careful when purchasing an ornate piece. You can always get a unique bowl or different downstem or stickers to personalize your piece. 

4. Features. Nowadays it isn't uncommon to find a nice solid straight shooter with an ice pinch and a diffused downstem for about $60 or less. Look for bongs and head shops that know the latest technologies for pieces. Search yelp and other reviewing sites for the best head shops. Do some research. 

5. Durability. Durability is a very important factor when choosing a bong. You don't want to have it shatter if it gets a little banged up. I'd suggest a bong with a 5mm glass thickness. This is not very hard to find. You will thank me because it also gives you milkier, thicker hits. 

6. Haggle. Often times you can haggle with the head shop employees **respectfully**. Don't try and lower a price on a unique, brand name piece. They will shoot you down. Offer to purchase another item for a combined deal. Mention you frequent the shop often. Just recently I got a huge discount on a dab setup (concentrates) simply because I had bought my piece at the store. 

7. Buy a bong bag. I can't tell you how many times I've seen downstems or bowls broken in the back of a buddy's car wrapped in an old t-shirt. Get a bong bag. The headshops will often cut you a deal if you buy it with your bong. It's worth it. 

Good luck with your bong purchasing ventures. Feel free to PM me with any questions. 

**Brands** 

*Note: Name brand bongs are not the end all-be all of bongs, but many high end labels require their glass blowers to have a scientific glass blowing certification ie Illadelph and Toro. Scientific glass generally means high quality and superior construction.*

Look [here](http://aqualabtechnologies.com/) for brands like the ones below... 

-Sovereignty

-Roor

-Toro

-Helix

-ZOB

-Vertigo

-Illadelph

-HVY

Have you ever got really high? Of course you have! Have you got really, really high? So high you thought you were going to have a heart attack, or vomit, the room's spinning the moment you close your eyes and you can't quite get it to stop if you open them again?


If you've encountered all the horrible panic, and that's as high as you've ever managed to get then Tubby is here to help you get past a [7], because Tubby thinks you're worth it.


We'll do this in steps, surely other Ents have superior methods to achieve unparalleled levels of blockup, but this is how I managed to go from the nasty little panic attacks **I** get, which prevent me reaching an [8] - the level where you can feel your whole body.


**Step 1 - eliminate tobacco**

Those of you in the UK who toke spliffs mix your herbs with tobacco. Tobacco, of all varieties but organic (American Spirit etc.) contains a smorgasbord of contaminants. You can guess the reasons for things like [arsenic](http://www.tricountycessation.org/tobaccofacts/Cigarette-Ingredients.html) being in there as well as I can, but overall they are designed to increase the intake and effect of the nicotine through your lungs and to your brain. 


The additives increase the hit of the tobacco and the trees, so you get a better initial hit. However you'll find yourself at a plateau because of the chemicals, nicotine, and the wasteful nature of smoking a tobacco joint. Remember, you're burning more tobacco than ganja, and most of the mixture is being exhaled. Unless you're baking in a car or a shed or some other school kid hijinks the efficiency of the method is too low.


I'm not saying don't smoke tobacco while you're getting toasted, just don't mix it with the herbs. If you want a really nice clean high, though, then don't smoke tobacco unless you want to calm down and level out. If you think the walls are looking at you funny then it's probably time for a cigarette!


**Step 2 - increase efficiency and get really stoned**

When you've got the baccy out of your herb it's your time to shine, or radiate, or whatever the hell people do when they're really sparkled. I like to lie foetal and drool.


The easiest way to get extremely high is the American puff puff pass method, with or without additional rules. It staggers the intake of goodness, and as long as there are enough of you to keep going after people start to whitey, extreme levels of blazedness may be reached.


Eating is probably the most efficient way of getting wrecked, but there are some complexities. No matter what anyone tells you cooking with weed is not easy, especially for a stoned ENT entering a kitchen for the first time. Above a certain temperature all the goodness in your weed will burn off, this temperature is considered low in cooking terms. The reason you always see space cakes and hash brownies are because they're yummy foods that are baked at a low temperature. If you cook read up and be careful, otherwise you're just wasting trees. You gotta save the rainforest my dear!


Pipes, spoons, vapes, bongs, buckets, waterfalls, hotknifes, and other such pure burning methods are the next best thing to cooking, and it's the next best thing to one draw pass with a room of your favourite ents. Smoke it up like I know you always do. Exhale, hold it in, it doesn't really matter. All these tools get you hellastoned and are a matter of preference. 


**Step 3 - meet the panic barrier**

You need to keep getting high until the room starts spinning, until you get horribly paranoid, sick, panic attacks (palpatations, unusual feelings in your chest and arms), whatever it is that freaks you out and stops you getting past [7] - what I call the panic barrier. 


When you hit the panic barrier you're as high as you want to be at the moment, so don't force yourself to smoke more. You can't punch through the panic barrier by sheer force of will, bravado will only make it worse.


The key to this, and it sounds really simple, is that none of it is real. You aren't going to have a heart attack! All of the 'physical' symptoms are simply the shift past [7]. Cannabis can't hurt you, unless someone drops a bale of it on your head, these feelings are your brain freaking out. In my case, all these sensations were linked to my physical well being. Places built up with stress and aches. Our brain blocks out continuous sounds, it also blocks out discomfort from stiff muscles and other little aches.


When you go past [7] you start to feel your body, and it's a shock. I still freak out pretty badly as I pass [7]. Maybe that's just how it should be. I don't know.


When I hit the barrier, many times over the last 20 years, I never knew how to handle it. Eventually I decided that the symptoms weren't symptoms at all. If it was symptomatic of anything it was just that I was really fucked. So as the room spun, panic, or a thumping chest attacked me I tried to stay calm and concentrate on relaxing. The room's not spinning (although I can feel it doing so), I'm not dying (although I feel like I'm having a hear attack), nothing bad is going to happen. Relax.


**Step 4 -  relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it**

After the initial panic attack you still have to shake off the residue of doubt. Rationally you know nothing bad is going to happen, but subconsciously you're still tense. On a physical level you'll still have tense muscles, and these tense muscles are sending messages to your brain telling it they're not too happy about the situation. Up until now your brain has been ignoring the signals, but the crossover at [7] messes all this up.  Or that's my pet theory anyway. To get past this I started off with some stretches, paying particular attention to the joy of shaking off my limbs afterwards. Move about, wriggle, act as loose and daft as you can handle. Do whatever it is people do to release muscle strain, the key is to not think about it too much. Shrug off all that stress and doubt.


**Step 5 - break through [7] and keep on going**

To get up to a real [8] you need to prepare gradually. At its crux an [8] is like a shortcut to being able to meditate. By meditate I don't mean sitting half lotus 'omming', or reciting mantras - these are just teaching tools that allow one person to teach another to meditate, to relax, and empty their mind of all the crap rattling about in it. We ents just short-cut that preparation by being massively stoned.


We do however need to follow some of the principles of meditation, [we need to borrow the poses](http://www.chikung-unlimited.com/Meditation-Positions-2.html). Or Yoga, that's probably better, I wish I could do yoga...


The poses just let you relax your body properly, straightening your spine, and you don't have to look like an idiot doing it. There is a pose and posture for sitting in a chair that looks inconspicuous and relaxed. I like to lie in bed on my back, but some people find they just nod off to sleep then they do that, thus the talk of poses. The pose is important because the sacred herb can get us high enough to feel our entire body we still need to make sense and order of that wash of sensation.


**Step 6 - be your own master**

More than that I can't really say, you have to take your own path blah blah blah. Also I'm able bodied and some of my terms and descriptions may be poorly worded for my fellow ents with disabilities. Please don't take offence as I recount my experiences.


The way I did that was gradually. I'd get completely blitzed and lie flat out on my back with the room spinning. Then to stop the spinning I'd try to understand the sensation. That led me to all kinds of tense muscles. One by one I learned to relax them and internally mapped each one, always looking for oddities, what I ignorantly call missing muscles. Not actually muscles that don't exist, but ones you forgot about, don't use, can't feel, whatever. 


When I say feel I don't mean poke your fingers into yourself. Use your central nervous system. Feel and relax each muscle in turn. I normally try to relax one tense muscle, which invariably seems to be tense because of a connected muscle, often a muscle you didn't even know that you had. Eventually you'll start to feel how they're all connected, and you'll probably be a bit surprised. This is the short cut to meditation I was talking about. It's funny because it's pretty easy to do when you're [7]. Try it when you're [0]. It gave me great respect for people that can clear their mind and feel every muscle in their body simultaneously, without having so much as a bite of spacecake.


Slowly you'll start to get a better feeling and understanding of this strange quasi meditation thing and you'll be able to snap right through the panic barrier and into the calm meditative state you need to hit a good solid [8].


So that's how I learned to love the bong, and the whitey - I learned to be like the dude and abide.


Happy tokes all. Thanks for the positive vibes!

1. Eliminating the ""am I ok to smoke if...?"" posts and
2. Eliminating the ""will I pass this test...?"" posts

Here are some easy, simple, but useful rules and tips!

1. NEVER tell a non ent, that you have weed on you

2. Do NOT smoke out of plastic (such as pens made into pipes) aluminum (such as pop can steam rollers) copper, or full brass pipes (as some may be coated or made in a poor manner), unless absolutely necessary! It's very dangerous. After awhile aluminum is ok, but only if with the correct knowledge of how to use, or with an elder who can assist!

3. Make sure when you get a stash box it isn't too suspicious. Keep something very common in your room that no one will touch, or toss on you. Here's an example http://imgur.com/a/Bqh8b

4. When smoking with people, don't be a dick, this gets you kicked out of sesh's and lose friENTS. 

5. Don't spray too much cologne, body spray, or any other deodorizer on yourself before leaving the house as this is very suspicious!!!

6. NEVER carry your stash box with you, unless going to a smoke spot/sesh! This is how people get caught, without the intentions to smoke.

7. Make sure you have cough drops, eye drops, and lighters with you at a sesh. Always carry extras.

8. Never allow other people to ""hold"" your weed, if you don't know them. I know many ENTS who have gotten their stuff stolen this way.

9. Always listen to the elder ENTS unless It seems ridiculous and you know it's not right. They are always willing to help

10. The most important one is DO NOT be afraid to ask
questions! ENTS help ENTS! Do not be shy, we want people to be educated correctly!

11. When buying your first piece, make sure it's simple, but not too simple. There are lots of confusing maze like pieces out there. Try a standard Sherlock pipe, or glass bowl.

**Do bongs get you higher?**

  Sort of.   I'm going to use an alcohol analogy here; bongs are like hard liquor.   Do you get 'more drunk' from hard liquor?  In a strictly technical sense, no.   How drunk you are is simply a matter of how much alcohol you consume, regardless of the form.  Beer, wine, liquor, moonshine.. they'll all get you drunk if you have enough.

  The reason I said 'sort of' is because just like a well mixed drink with a lot of alcohol in it (Long Island Iced Tea, Zombie, Paralyzer, etc..) a bong allows you to take in a large amount of cannabis in a very short period of time.   *However*, just like hard liquor, this can be risky and result in a very messy situation.  

  I like hard liquor, but I like the good stuff.   Well aged rum, bourbon, scotch, tequila.. things like that.  I enjoy the flavor and like to savor it slowly, taking little sips over a long period of time.   Does this get me drunk as hell?  No... I actually drink slower than if I was drinking beer or something else.  I could (and did in my younger stupid days) pound back shot after shot or guzzle straight from the bottle, but that's a waste of good liquor.  Sure, it hits you hard at first and knocks you on your ass, but the end of the evening usually leaves you with the room spinning and a lovely evening talking to a toilet, bucket or nearby bush.   Not fun.
 

  The same logic applies to bongs.   You *can* load up a huge bowl in a triple perc glass RooR and clear the entire thing in one massive hit and go back for more, but this just like doing tequila shots one after the other.   It hits you hard and fast because of the large amount you're taking in a short period of time, not because their is something magical about smoking out of a bong.  When it hits you all at once, you feel 'higher' and great for a bit, but unless you're careful, the evening is going to end with you passing out or being uncomfortably high and unable to do anything by lie down in a quiet spot while waiting for the chaos to stop. 

  If you want to smoke from a bong or drink hard liquor responsibly and have a better time, the  same logic applies to both.   Spend to get good quality and enjoy slowly and savor the flavor.   For bongs, this means making sure you get a good quality glass bong for nice smooth hits, but pack smaller bowls and slow down between hits.    **A bong *can* be a way to get massive amounts of THC into your system quickly, but it can also be a way to take much smoother hits that allow you to enjoy the subtle flavors and aromas of really good cannabis.**    

  Leave the massive bong rips and chugging contests to the 'bros' and fraternity kids.   Take the more mature approach, slow down and enjoy things.   With both alcohol and cannabis, the results are the same; you'll still be having an enjoyable evening while the impatient and immature folks are spending the last half of the evening passed out and not feeling very good at all. 

**TL;DR?  With bongs and booze, the approach is the same.  Take it slow and take smaller hits/sips.  You'll last longer and have a better time.**

Also, just like cannabis and booze, remember that you don't have to join in to have fun.  Sometimes it's a blast just to hang out sober and watch your buddies get silly, then be a GGG and make sure they make it home safe.   If you are drinking or smoking, don't mock the sober guy/gal.  They're your lifeline and can save your ass in any number of situations.  Respect that and everybody has fun.

First off, this guide will (hopefully) inform you on how to keep your smoking stealthy. This does *not* mean I am encouraging smoking behind parent's or roommate's backs.

1. Never brag. - This means, only talk to close friends, who don't mind, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky, don't smoke! This can lead to panic attacks and anxiety. Just wait till no one is awake or whatever your situation is, too smoke.

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are, always have a plan B.

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is, is a toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets. 
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative, and it probably works better.
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common, then light one after a smoke sesh. It personally mellows me out, and covers the smell.
 
 * The ""[Bathroom Method](http://i.imgur.com/ZxaDe.jpg)"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, steamy shower, and let the room steam up. If you have a window, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful, as they leave almost no smell. You could make your own [lightbulb vaporizer.](http://i.imgur.com/Mzgwv.jpg) The [Magic-Flight Launch Box](http://magic-flight.com/) (MFLB) is also a good option.

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, Lysol, Cologne, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room, a wet towel placed against the bottom of the door is helpful. This blocks all smoke from going out that way.

 * Even with a sploof, if you are using a bowl or pipe, the bowl can ""cherry"", or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and when it is safe, smoking outside is nice. It doesn't leave a smell, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots, too. - Closets keep most of the smell inside, and not lingering around your room/house. Just be sure to air it out good afterwords.

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window, and aim the fan out it, and it will pull most-all of the smell.

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, so always have it open when toking! Be careful, if a breeze is blowing in from outside, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, Kroger, etc.) and usually work. Make sure only to use them when you need them, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily, so I hope this helps you all!

EDIT: I'll add user suggestions here:

* Don't let that towel stick out too far, or else it'll look funny from the outside!

* Wash yo' smelly hands. The smell sticks to your hands.

* Wash yo' smelly mouth. Gum or mouthwash works well.

* Make a super safe sploof by poking holes in the bottom of a water bottle and stuffing it full of scented dryer sheets. I've heard stories from people who used TP rolls and it didn't work out so well...

* Microwaving popcorn is a great way to make an overpowering smell to cover up other ones

* Cover your bowl with your thumb, or a coin, when you're done hitting and it is still burning. This stops smoke from escaping.

* [Hogwash](http://www.amazon.com/Hog-Wash-Organic-Hogwash-1oz/dp/B0036QOV4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093137&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hogwash+1+oz) is a good spray to help remove the smell of weed.

* Roast some coffee. The smell will help mask it, and, well, coffee!

* People swear by [Ozium](http://www.amazon.com/OZIUM-SANITIZER-OZM-1-ORIGINAL-SCENT/dp/B000CSWCAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093079&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozium).

I've smoked three to four times a week for the last few weeks with a mflb, and joints, so I feel like I gave it a good old college try, but I just can't enjoy it long term.

I apparently have an extremely low tolerance for THC. Half a J gets me to a [5] or [6]. [10] for me was finishing a full mflb trench. My eyes were rolling back in my head while I was trying to watch John Dies at the End, and I generally couldn't concentrate on anything. I slept for 11 hours after that, and still woke up feeling generally sick, groggy, and hazy. It was okay, but I don't really want to repeat it. Even at lower highs, I get twitchy (every couple seconds, some of my muscles tense up, and release). I get couch locked, and I have a hard time talking to people. Basically, I get all of the symptoms of [serotonin toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), but I don't think that's actually what happens to me. I guess THC just does me differently than most other people.

1352496596.0,45,self.saplings,12xm8y,Cannabis Research for effective and less harmful use - summarized in plain english for saplings,Fudbar,50,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/12xm8y/cannabis_research_for_effective_and_less_harmful/,"Howdy saplings..  When doing some Googling on another topic the other day, I came across a very interesting and informative scientific paper that contained a lot of research data that I hadn't seen or come across before.  I shared it with OldHippie, and he was as interested as I was, so I thought I'd take the time to write out some of the more interesting points in a 'plain english' form.  

 Scientific papers are the best source for info, but they can be hard to read if you don't have the proper background. (In my case, I don't actually have any science degrees, but I've known many Ents with high level degrees, dated a PhD chemist for 5 years, my brother is a brilliant geneticist doing post doc work, and his partner has a Masters in molecular biology.. I've learned to read and interpret scientific papers just to keep up with dinner conversations..:)  



A note for Ents and saplings that can read this sort of stuff:  This is a layman's translation of a scientific paper.  I'm sure I've made a few errors and it's certainly not properly cited, etc...  please read the paper linked to below on your own and submit replies with any corrections.  I'll be happy to edit the post to reflect them.
 
A note for Ents and saplings that may disagree with things contained within:  Sorry, but it's science.  If I've mis-characterized anything reported in the paper, that's on me, but the rest is in peer reviewed black and white.  

If you can't be bothered to read and understand the original source material and want to argue anecdotally (ie, 'you're wrong because me and my buddies do 'x' all the time) then I'll probably just delete your reply unless it contains a good point.   Don't hate on science.   

Conspiracy theories and 'Big Pharma' rants are also not welcome.

The paper:[Harm Reduction Associated with Inhalation and Oral Administration of Cannabis and THC - Franco Grotenhermen](http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/2001-03-04-8.pdf)

My summary: *my interpretations and conclusions are in italic*, all the rest is direct from the paper and in more or less the same order it appears within.

- Inhaling any sort of smoke is bad for your lungs.

- Use materials with a high THC content allows you to reduce the total amount smoked.

- Edibles are safest and provide longer lasting effects, but it's easier to take too much.  

- When smoking, THC concentrations peak with 5 minutes of smoking.  Effects are felt within 1-2 minutes, peak after 30 minutes, and last 2-3 hours.  Certain effects last longer.   Muscle/body effects can last more than 12 hours.

- When inhaled normally, only about 20% of the THC in marijuana is absorbed in mainstream smoke. If you were to somehow inhale an entire joint in one huge toke, this number would be 69%.  About 30% is lost simply by burning the material. The rest is lost in sidestream smoke.  Bio-availability (your bodies ability to absorb THC) can be as low as 10% in new users.  Highest level reported among experienced users was 56%.

- Absorption is slow and erratic with edibles.  Effects start between 30 and 90 minutes in, usually peaking after 2 hours.  More than one peak can occur. Effects last 5-9 hours or longer with very high doses.


- Absorption of edibles in the stomach is a complex thing.  Preparations with high oil or fat content are likely to be more effective.

- Decarboxylation through heating is required to activate THC into a usable form in the body.   5 minutes at 210 degrees Celsius (410 degrees Fahrenheit) is optimal for complete decarboxylation without oxidation to cannabinol. Note that this assumes you're consuming that product without any additional heat. (ie: cannacaps)  *If you'll be baking your cannabis afterwards, this will probably need to be reduced.*

- For medicinal use for MS or glaucoma, muscle spasms the longer lasting effects of edibles are best, but the chance of taking too much is greater.

- For migraines or pain relief, inhalation provides quick relief and easy titration (the ability to control the dosage) the downside is potential lung damage

- Cannabis smoke contains over 200 combustion compounds, many of which are known to be toxic to lung and stomach/intestinal tissue.

- Tobacco smoke and cannabis smoke are fairly similar.   Several PAH's are 25-75% higher in cannabis tar, and the lack of filters and typically longer inhalation time for cannabis amplifies their absorption by 4X. 

- Holding your breath 4X longer results in a 40% increase in tars.  It's not clear if this means 4 times the damage, but if so, 4X is probably the upper limit. (1/2 joint equals damage of 2 cigarettes)

- Chronic smokers tend to develop chronic bronchitis and eventually COPD, but findings regarding marijuana smokers are unclear and conflicting.  One study found no association between heavy cannabis use and a decrease in lung function over a 15 year period.  Another found that over 6 years, previous cannabis users had some decrease in lung function, but current users didn't.  *Very strange and an area that needs more research badly.*  

- Holding in smoke may increase THC absorption, but if you gag or cough with a closed mouth, you run the risk of a spontaneous lung collapse.

- Average THC concentration is USA cannabis was 4.2% in 1997.  and 10-20% in 2001.   Higher is better for smokers since they use less and decrease the overall volume of smoke inhaled.

- One puff from a 10% THC joint provides about 5mg of THC.  Daily doses of between 2.5 and 20mg have proven effective in treating nausea and vomiting in HIV/AIDS patients. With tolerance, this may need to be increased to 1/4 of a joint (.8 grams @ 10% THC levels)  Recreational effects begin to kick in around 10mg for most people.  *You don't need to get high when smoking for medicinal purposes.  A puff or two may work just fine.*


Best practices:

- Use highest the THC level possible

- Use a pipe.  Tars condense on the sidewalls, not your lungs.  Clean them often.

- Bongs are worse than joints for cutting down tars.

- Avoid moldy, contaminated or cut cannabis.   Baking suspected moldy pot at 150c for 5 minutes kills most spores without reducing THC.

- Of all smoking methods, vaping reduces tars best (10:1 ratio to cannabinoids) followed by joints (13:1) and bongs (27:1)  *Yep, bongs are twice as bad for filtering out tars than joints*.  You can put a filter in a joint to reduce tar, but it will also reduce cannabinoids, so it's not worth it. 

- Vaporizers studied heated up to 185c without producing any toxic components.  Toxic stuff begins to show up at around 200c.  Combustion happens at 230c.  THC is available at temps as low as 140c.

- Holding your breath beyond 10 seconds does nothing but increase tar concentrations.  Plasma concentration doubles between 0 and 10 seconds.   *Around 5-7 is probably the sweet spot. Holding in is more effective for more potent pot than for schwag or ditchweed.*

- 'Cough to get off' is a bad idea that can lead to spontaneous lung collapse


- For those who have taken too much, lying down with your legs elevated will help with 'greenouts'.   Talking someone down can work.  Valium has been reported as being effective, but this should only be done by a doctor or medical professional.  *Giving someone who's freaking out *more* drugs if you're not a medical professional is a really stupid idea.* 

- For medical patients who can't smoke or even keep down edibles (stomach cancer, HIV/AIDS nausea, etc..)  It is possible to take cannabis via suppository.  Reported method was ground cannabis baked with cocoa butter for 1 hour and allowed to cool down then formed into suppository.  Effects felt within 10 minutes.   Sublingual (under tongue) and trans-dermal (through skin) absorption are also possible, but the preparation of the compounds is beyond most consumers and only possible in labs or pharmacies.  *Sublingual dosing through tincture is probably achievable at home, but your mouth is gonna burn like hell.*

Him and some of his buddies have only been smoking since the beginning of the summer so they really don't know a lot of the lingo or even how to prepare a bowl. I understand that each Ent has their own little ritual. But I came to the conclusion while watching them that I needed to guide them on how to not be wasteful.

One of them bought 2.5 grams for only $30 while we were there. Which under any circumstance is awesome! But, they didn't understand that the dealer knew he had shit trees so he just wanted to get rid of it. None of them know the difference between good and bad trees. But only to make matters worse, he said ""Hey, dude, I'm gonna make a gram bowl. You down?"" Of course I'm always down! But his idea of a ""gram"" bowl is to literally put the nugs in the bowl without breaking/grinding them up first. I wanted to tell them right then and there that what he was doing was extremely wasteful and not the way to do it. But, since it's his weed I only made little hints on it. Didn't want to insult him or anything. 

When he loaded the next bowl, however, he said ""ALRIGHT WHO WANTS SOME FUCKING STEMS?!"" and everyone else besides me said ""FUCK YEAH DOOOOD"" or any other variant on that. This is what threw me over.

So, here are two *very* basic things that every sapling should remember:

* First, **GRIND OR BREAK APART THE NUGS BEFORE SMOKING THEM.** The reason why you should do this is because:
* A) Grinding will conserve more weed. If you just stick the nug in the bowl and light it, you're *very* likely to have an uneven burn which means that when you think you've cashed it, there could still be plenty of green in the middle of the nug left.
* B) Grinding makes it much easier to corner hit. If you don't know what a corner hit is, it's where you light the very edge of the green in a bowl. That way the bowl lasts longer, you waste less, and you don't instantly torch it.
* C) KEEEEEEIIIIIFFFFF!!! Grinders are great because a lot of them have keif catchers. Which also means that you get more bang for your buck!


* Also, **NEVER SMOKE THE STEMS.** Smoking stems is somewhat debatable. But personally, I will never smoke stems again for two reasons:
* A) There's little to no THC in the stems. If you happen to get a good strain with very crystally stems, grind them, catch the keif, make a keif bowl.
* B) For me, and a lot of people, smoking stems gives me a headache. Yeah, if it has THC in it it'll get you high. But it's not a good high, and ultimately, not worth it.

So that's my two cents. I hope this helps!

tl;dr don't smoke stems and always grind.

I got home about 5:30PM, had my tea, and my friend came around to my house.
He asked me if I was coming out to chill, and to get some bud. Now, I don't really smoke too often, but this past weekend I smoke some both Saturday &amp; Sunday and has a pretty fun weekend.

So, we went to some place just to pick up £10 worth of weed. It was at a car garage (Some of the people that work there/hang around got some pretty good weed). Whilst we were waiting, a friend of my Brother's came looking for the guy I was chilling with, because my friend owed him some money. He said he had some 'chronic' shit back at his place, so we left and went to his house.

He's pretty cool, and was telling us stories of his fights and stuff he'd been getting himself into.

When we got to his house, he gave me a nice bag of bud, smelled pretty nice, I can't remember what he said he weighed the bag at, but it was alright.

We decided to chill at his house for a while, and in the kitchen we rolled a nice joint. We went out front and lit up, after a few tokes I was pretty high, and after I passed the joint I knew I was stoned as shit. After a few minutes, I was higher than I've been for quite some time, I could feel it all over my body.

I could feel myself going white as a sheet, and my whole body was tingling like ice, I thought I was going to puke so bad. It was like I could feel everything inside me, if that makes sense.

We went back inside and the guy knew I was was pretty bad. I could feel myself sweating a lot. I took my coat of my he told me to sit down. He got me a nice drink, and I sat chilling watching whatever was on TV. Wasn't sure what it was, but Football came of later. He also gave me a bun, that his girlfriend made, and it has the nicest icing I've ever had on it!.

As I was sat down, the guy went upstairs and got his tarantula out, he brought it downstairs and as he was walking across the living room he dropped it, and it landed on it's legs and it started bleeding or whatever they do.
I just couldn't contain myself and was laughing pretty hard. He was saying loads of stuff, about how he is going to have to put it down. And he can't take a tarantula to the vets.

Can't really remember what happened but my brother was on his way to chill aswell. I think my friend was in the Kitchen rolling another joint, and after a while we went back outside after I was feeling a little better.

The guy unlocked his car, and I sat down inside, with my drink. We smoked the joint and my brother arrived. As we were outside, there was a women and some children looking for a rabbit. We stopped smoking until they left. 

I ended up going back inside on the couch high as fuck. Loads of other fun stuff happened and he told some pretty cool stories. After I while, we had to leave for some reason, really can't remember why.

My borther and friend were going somewhere, and I wanted to go home, to we split the weed we had left and I went home.

I got home, and thought my Mother would have been in bed, but I was in the kitchen, just as she came downstairs. I got quite scared, as I was still high as fuck, and probably stunk of weed, since I'd just been smoking, had some in my pocket, and my hands were covered in tiny bits of bud (from splitting the weed, it was ground). So I quickly grabbed some food and went outside. For about 2 minutes, until I just took my coat of and went upstairs.

 Chilled, ate food, and spoke to some friends.

I'm 30 years old, and until this summer I was a judgy-non smoker.  I gave my husband crap about it when he occasionally smoked while out with friends, etc.  I was kind of a bitch about it, to be honest.  I want to share with you how I came to eat my words about this topic and have become and enthusiastic sapling.

Long story short, I have lupus and have been increasingly sick since the beginning of the year.  In June, I was sicker than I've ever been, considering having to leave my job because of it, and friggin miserable. I was told I was going to have to start low-dose chemotherapy, and I would be on it indefinitely.  I was in soo much pain and so super sick that I had trouble walking and couldn't sleep. 

At my husband's urging, I talked to my doc about medical marijuana.  He said that considering what was going on, he would be supportive of it. I smoked up for the first time a week after I started chemo (taken once a week in pill form), and have done so every chemo day since then.  It seriously was the only time I was not in pain, not stressed, not nauseous, and could finally sleep more than 3 hours at time.  

I just finished the chemo, but am still fairly sick.  While I definitely enjoy the medical aspect of it, it's been a great stress reliever as well.   I have also gotten to interesting places in my meditation, and am now at the point where I just enjoy it. 
  
And funny enough, my husband and I have really bonded over it.   He's been awesome walking me through learning how to smoke, how to figure out what to buy, introducing me to the Ents subreddit and all that jazz. 
 
Don't mind my rambling - i'm at a [6].

I'm a relatively new re-ent (gave up smoking for a couple years due to jobs and shit) and had never really smoked kief before and he shared with me the best way to smoke kief with a bunch of people. First, take a little weed and put it in the bottom. From there top with kief and then apply another layer of weed to the top. This helps it burn smoothly. I also use this even when smoking kief by myself. Lets you get two or three BIG hits of kief or a handful of small.

1370840871.0,41,self.saplings,1g10i0,Smoked for the first time last night (My Experience),wooftail,44,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/1g10i0/smoked_for_the_first_time_last_night_my_experience/,"So I finally smoked up for the first time last night with a good friend. To be honest, I never thought I'd actually smoke, but after thinking on it a lot, I realized it's not a bad thing.

**FIRST SMOKE**

We agreed to meet at his place at 7:30 and I would buy pizza instead of pitching cash for bud. Not long after arriving, we smoked in his garage using a one-hitter. I took a couple of hits off of it, and headed upstairs to wait for pizza to arrive.

After about 5-10 minutes, I felt noticeably relaxed and buzzed, a lot like a couple of drinks without the loopiness. We played some video games, which I managed ok with some coordination issues. Pizza showed up and we chowed down.

In all truth, I don't really remember too much of the first smoke. Based on [this chart](http://cdn.hailmaryjane.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/1273558257127.jpg), I'd estimate that I was probably around a [2]-[3]. (I don't think I inhaled deeply enough the first smoke. You'll see why in a second.)

**SECOND SMOKE**

At 9pm, he asked if I wanted to go back down for a second round, to which I agreed. This time, the one hitter was packed, then dipped in the kief from the grinder. The first try wasn't packed right. The second one was spot on and I got a good hit or two in.

We migrated back upstairs to the couch and sat there talking. As I was sitting there, I noticed I started to feel really relaxed. I become only vaguely aware of this heavy warmness spreading slowly from the top of my head down to my neck and ultimately through my body. Everything was almost exactly like that state between sleep and wake (that is, the hypnagogic state). My thoughts were fleeting at best and I it became everything I could do to explain something or form cohesive thoughts. Time was dilated to an unreal degree. Seconds felt like minutes or longer. Minutes felt like hours. But everything also seemed to move quickly sometimes, like it was catching up with itself. ""It's like slow time and fast time at the same time"", as I eloquently explained. I found myself holding a bottle of cold water to my lips, sipping away the whole time, just being lost in the amazing feeling of the cool water going down.

My friend was grinning at me like an idiot, saying, ""This is awesome"" and said that we needed to play video games because I was ""really high and needed to come down"". A round of Portal 2 and Modern Warfare 2 proved impossible. I was seeing a village where there was only one house and was getting so lost just going from one room to the next. My own head felt super heavy on my shoulders.

I realized I had to take a leak and got up to go to the bathroom. I stumble to the bathroom and after what feels like forever, am able to finally start taking a leak. Halfway through, I forget why I was there. I realized I'm peeing and finished, washed up, and left. It felt like I was in there forever! I'm told I was only there for 2 minutes.

He brings popcorn in for snacks. I barely notice and am fading in and out of this feeling that feels like my body is awake while my mind is drifting in and out of sleep with all the hypnagogic imagery. I remember he told me to eat some popcorn. I leaned forward, forgot why I leaned forward, reached for popcorn, forgot about that, reached in to grab popcorn, forgot I'd done that too, then brought it towards myself, forgot that, wondered why the fuck I'm holding popcorn, then ate it anyways.

I left for home (with the wife driving) at around 11:30pm and was just starting to come down a bit. The car ride was a bit intense and I eventually made it home. A nice, restful sleep was not long after.

**CONCLUSION**

Today has been pretty good, save that I've been feeling pretty spacey for the first few hours of the day and generally fatigued with a persistent headache.

In all, a great experience, I think. Plus, with chronic pain in both knees from injuries suffered in the military, it was really nice to be able to relax and not be in pain.

(Btw, how high does /r/saplings think I was on the second smoke? How do you guys judge how baked you are?)

**TL;DR**

Smoked for the first time. Never thought I would. First smoke with a one-hitter left me feeling nicely buzzed and relaxed, around [2]-[3]. After an hour and a half, went back for a second smoke.

This advice was given to me by one of my seasoned stealth smoker friends when I told him I would like to get back into it, but I didn’t want to get caught by my parents. He gave me permission to post his advice on r/trees and r/saplings. Basically this serves as a guide to any young adult or teenager who lives with parents who disapprove of trees. I know it’s a wall of text, so you can pick and choose what you want to read!

1) Where/how do I hide my weed and paraphernalia? -Smell proof containers for both. I keep my stuff in a large tin can - I put it in a baggie, put charcoal in the can (to absorb odor), then wipe a stick of deodorant down a long piece of toilet paper, which I wad up and put in the can as well. -I keep my stuff in my closet, but don't use any single hiding place for too long. It's also a good idea to keep your herb and your receptacle for herb enjoyment separate - my rationale is, if your piece is discovered, you can act shocked that they uncovered that antique from your junior-year reefer smokin' days.

2) How get them to not suspect anything? -At the end of the day, your first weapon against being found out is not letting your parents have reason to worry. If you maintain your health, your grades, and are respectful and help around the house, then it probably won't matter if they even do suspect anything, because you'll be showing them that you're in control of it, and it's not impacting your life in a negative way. Gradually, it'll become less and less a matter of solely keeping it a secret, but also setting up a means of defense and rationale in the event that they become suspicious, or even find you out.

3) Should I use joints, a pipe, a bong, or a vaporizer? -NO JOINTS. Joints and blunts both constantly burn, making stealth-toking that much more difficult to hide. The smell will permeate any area, even when you're outside. Plus, it's more wasteful. -Pipes and vaporizers are a lot better for stealth smoking - they're smaller, easier to handle, and they conserve a LOT more herb. Whereas with j's or blunts, you need a good about of herb to even utilize the paper, with pipes or vapes, you can just stick any small amount in there and toke away. -Sociability shouldn't be any problem. I've never heard anyone complain that they're about to smoke a bowl. Really, no one cares. Your buddies will understand, and if they're the kind of tight-ass that ""only smokes mad bong ripz,"" then they can bring their own, damn it.

4) I used to use a sploof, but I found it to be a hassle. Is it really worth it? -Sploofs are never more hassle than they're worth - because they can be worth a LOT. We're talking you can smoke pretty much anywhere without being caught - but you have to do the sploof right. We'll cover this really quickly: -Take a plastic water bottle and poke many holes in the bottom with a thumbtack or other small, sharp object. -Add a layer of wet wipes (about 5 or so.) -Sprinkle in a layer of baking soda. This will absorb the odor. use a sheet of paper to funnel it in... or a funnel. -Add another layer of 5-10 wet wipes. -Crush up a piece of charcoal into a coarse powder, and then funnel that in. Again, it’s a fantastic odor absorber. -Add another layer of wet wipes/paper towels. -This will be your best fucking friend. It takes five minutes to make, but it can be the difference between secrecy and a hell of an awkward explanation for why your room smells of herb. My sploof is my best friend. Use it.

5) How do I smoke at home undetected? -If you want to smoke in your room, close the door, and stick a towel under it. Have windows? Good, open them all - but be sure to open the top AND the bottom panes. This will allow for easier air flow - warm air goes out, cold air comes in. -Get a fan. Point it towards the TOP opening of a window. When actually smoking, put it up closer to the window, pointing outside, and exhale from the sploof into the back of the fan. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPLOOF, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TOKE IN YOUR ROOM. I'm serious. And it had better be my super-sploof design. -When smoking, after you've taken your finger off the carb, cover the bowl with your hand or a handy coin nearby. This will prevent smoke from escaping out the bowl - and also conserve your herb! If it keeps burning, close off the bowl, the carb, and the mouthpiece with your mouth/fingers. No oxygen = no fire = no smoke. -Have some air freshener handy. DO NOT OVERDO IT. I say three sprays of one second each. Spray the entry point of the room, the space that your supplies were occupying, and then where you exhaled. You can also hit some of the corners of your room with small little sprays where the odor likes to hide. -Next, AIRFLOW. Air is a beautiful thing. Take the towel out from under your door and feel under the space. Does it feel as though cold air is flowing INTO your room from the hallway? Use a lighter to make sure. Crack your door open and hold up the lighter. If it's pointed into your room, then you have NEGATIVE PRESSURE, which is a neat little tool you can use to prevent the smell from leaking. If flows OUT, then close the door and stick the towel back under there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_room_pressure -Now, room smoking requires the most secrecy maintenance. You can skip a lot of the work by simply going outside. In any case, make sure either a) no one's home, or b) they're asleep, or at the very least upstairs and NOT coming back down. -Garages are good places for stealth toking at night, but make sure you at least use a sploof, open the garage door just a little bit, and then exhale towards the TOP opening. Once again, use the airflow to your advantage, and understand when it can work against you! If it's a cold night, and only the bottom opening is exposed, then the air is flowing in - and if you exhale towards THAT, then you'll end up with a face full of... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVIvA5Exs28 blowback. Yich. POST-SMOKING -Clean yourself! Wash your hands and your face, and hell, your neck. Drink water, then either brush your teeth or chew some gum. Brushing your teeth is the best method, this way you can actually eliminate the stuff causing the smell rather than just covering it up. -BUT WAIT! If you're desperate, and you're sure that your family won't barge in on you, then there ARE some excellent ways of smoking undetected that don't require your housemates being miles away, physically or consciously. The best? The SHOWER TOKE. Turn on your shower, HOT HOT water, and build up steam. Then, toke as usual, USING YOUR SPLOOF, and exhale INTO the stream of water. The steam will neutralize the smoke particles and clear up the odor. If you have a window, that's even better! Open that shit up and let the steam flow on through. A couple sprays of air freshener never hurt either. Make sure you have your storage containers there in advance, though, so you can pop your herb and your piece in there to sit while you enjoy your shower - while lifted! This is also good, 'cause then you'll be clean as a whistle and smell-free.

6) And now the most important question: Is it worth it? (The risk of getting caught) Well, getting high is fun, AND can be spiritually and physically healthy, but remember: The better you get at stealth smoking, the more easily and frequently you'll be able to do it. Take care to not let it become a problem. My suggestion? Buy small. Going just a gram at a time is a good basis for organizing your smoking routine. Whether you're only buying on a friday and smoking through the weekend, or managing that gram to last you through the week, either way, you're not smoking a whole lot, and it's easier to keep it in check. However, if you're smoking socially, you'll have to buy more on account of smoking more frequently, with more sets of lungs, and more herb per smoke session. But there's another aspect to it - trust. I don't know your parents, or how close you are to them, and how important their trust is to you. I know for myself that as fun as having a secret life is (trust me, it's kind of a badass moment when you finish stealth toking without a hitch. It's good to feel prepared,) it still kind of sucks to have to, well, keep it a secret. You will encounter situations where you need to either lie or fess up, and that's not a fun thing to do. Be certain that if you go that length to keep it a secret that you KNOW that this is not a habit you need to kick. If you're confident that you are toking in a safe, responsible, healthy way, then the facade is something that isn't too morally draining to maintain.

Edit: From texts he's sent me:
From Texts:
“If you have pets, smoke around them, but do NOT try to get them high (unethical.) This has multiple benefits: 1) If your pet smells or shed, congrats! You have a masking smell... and a patsy to throw under the bus if anyone mentions a smell. 2) If you have dogs, get them used to the smell. They won’t act all interested if they detect it on ya. Also, my dogs now appreciate herb-smell with me being in a playful, happy mood...which brings me to 3) Play with them when you’re high. So much fun.”

“Use pieces of charcoal to absorb odor. Baking soda also works wonders. Eye drops are a great investment, but you really don’t need to spend more than $5. Act a little high even when you’re not high. Get your family used to the idea of you acting slightly silly or lazy. MAKE EYE CONTACT. Be considerate. Have a story, and make sure it works. Have open, friendly body language, but don’t overdo it. You’re trying to minimize suspicion—not invite it. CLEAN THINGS. It’s fun AND rewarding.”

“Lastly for now: Remember that you are putting some responsibility on yourself to keep your space clean. Do your part as a member of the household, and defy the stoner stereotype! Learn to use herb to make productivity more fun that passivity. Do work around the house! Done with that? Make art! Read a book! Explore the depths of your mind! Empathize with  people as you spend time with them! Some final pointers for if you are caught: If you know the jig is up, then don’t waste time lying.  That’ll only get you into bigger trouble and make your parents trust you less. However, assess the situation and determine how much your parents probably know to be true. Just because you’re getting in trouble doesn’t mean you can’t do some damage control. Half-truths are better than whole lies. Use your productivity. Be mature, reasonable, and non-confrontational.”",,False,self,t5_2rukl,1353565198.0,,,True,t3_13l84c,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/13l84c/stealth_smoking_for_young_ents_xpost_from_rtrees/,

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure, which has been lost in my archives for well over a decade. It happened exactly 15 years ago today, to the *minute* (I’ve timed this to publish exactly at 12:15…you will soon see why). 

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, right in San Francisco where it all happened, but I had no idea what I was in for. It turned out to be my first experience with edibles and my first glimpse at the elusive level [11]. Bear in mind that I had thought at that point that all my drug use was way in the past, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), and posted it on my blog/website (yes, some of us really had them even back in those days), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, I remembered this story as one of the best things I had ever written, and a classic example of someone writing under the influence of cannabis. But I couldn’t find it anywhere, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, other than fixing broken links and removing/changing names and such, except the original psychedelic background, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet, but [this is the closest I can find](http://www.hempire.co.uk/showthread.php/45797-Ganja-Goo-Balls-anyone-know-the-recipe?p=815917&amp;viewfull=1#post815917) to what I remember from the ingredients used.
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever,
Old Hippie

3. Random thoughts. I like this part because it's hilarious. I make myself laugh and laugh. This lasts throughout the rest of the high.

4. Body starts to vibrate. I close my eyes and lay down but I see shapes and lines forming into things. It freaks me the fuck out.

5. Body is shaking. Full body vibrations occurring about every 10 seconds. About every 30 seconds it feels like I'm sober for about 5 seconds, then a HUGE wave of vibrations come. They start at my head and make their way down to my toes. I'm fucking scared shitless and can't move, stand or do anything. It felt like I would close my eyes and never wake up. I  keep telling myself that nobody has ever died from weed, but I still couldn't remain calm because I honestly thought I was dying.

6. I laid in bed for about 2 hours motionless before I fell asleep.


How high was I? I didn't really like it because I was fucking scared the whole time through phase 5, which felt like an eternity.

Is this what happends when you personally get high?

How can I reduce the effects? I only took 2 hits, so how could I possibly smoke less? Smaller hits?

The first 4 times were awesome, because I felt amazing and got random thoughts. I never got full body-locking vibrations.

Is weed just not for me? I loved it all the times before this one.

Questions inside!,,41,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/k5bd6/im_a_25_year_old_guy_whos_treecurious_questions/,"A quick blurb about myself: Generally cheerful 25-year-old Australian (Brisbane QLD) guy. I've never had alcohol or tobacco (my mother has had far too much of both and the shit I endured during childhood has scared me away from both), but I've had little exposure to marijuana.

Here are my questions: 

+ What do you use weed *for*? (I know you smoke it to get high, but do you use it to relax, to explicitly hallucinate, as a social thing like alcohol, etc?)
+ Can you bypass the anti- and pro-weed propaganda and tell me if it has any negative health effects (both short- and long-term?)
+ Is it safe to try it for the first time by myself, or should I do it in a group?
+ For the Australians in the audience, what are the legal ramifications of getting caught with it?
+ If you've got any awesome (or terrifying) stories about your first time, I'd love to hear them.

I realise a lot of these questions could be Googled (and I am in fact doing that as well), but I'm geeking out and compiling information from several sources so I can make a well-informed decision.

1287200287.0,37,self.saplings,drx95,A few tips from your friends at r/trees,B3bop,54,17,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/drx95/a_few_tips_from_your_friends_at_rtrees/,"**1.** If you're going to short something make sure you blow the smoke out. It'll taste less like ass when you light it back up.

**2.** For better burning, pre roast your weed (heat it up a bit with a lighter but don't burn it).

**3.** If you're new to packing and you're having a hard time keeping your bowl lit then it's probably packed too tight, dump out and repack.

**4.** Always keep your pieces clean, especially when smoking with friends. It tastes better, looks better, and keeps you from looking dirty.

**5.** Practice rolling with tobacco or the same weed over a large flat surface (so you don't lose the ground weed) until you get the hang of it. It's a great skill to have and surprisingly hard to do.

**6.** Always treat your dealer well and he will (most likely) do the same with you.

**7.** Hot water in bongs makes it easier on your throat and makes a smoother hit. While cold water (with or without ice) makes the smoke stack better and for experienced smokers can smooth the hit.

**8.** Most people cough because the smoke expands while in your lungs, so don't pull in a bunch of air after a hit or fill your lungs completely or you'll be more prone to coughing.

**9.** Air tight containers will keep your nugs fresh and keep the thc from leaving it (I use pill containers, but depending on how much you have airtight jars can be used too. Bags will work in a pinch but will never be completely air tight).

**10.** Always carry eye drops and an extra lighter, most new ents have a tendency to lose lighters and eye drops are always good to have, even when not smoking. (A lot of people use rhotos, I personally like bausch &amp; lamb's Opcon-A as it works just as well if not better for me without the burn).

**11.** If you don't live on your own, have several hiding spots and always disperse your weed/paraphernalia between them so if you're caught you don't lose all of it.

**12.** You can get a P.O. box for like $30 a year, and always get the smallest one because the post office will hold your package anyways. this way you can buy things online and not have to rush home worrying about someone else opening it.

**13.** Always know how big a hit you can take, so you don't waste your weed (or even worse someone else's)

**14.** If the bowl is cherried, try to relight it just by drawing smoke in instead of with a lighter as the lighter's flame is hot enough to destroy the thc, but the burning nug is not. (especially important with kief bowls).

**15.** Speaking of kief, never make it the top layer as you don't want the flame to touch the kief if you can help it because as previously mentioned, the flame is hot enough to destroy the thc.

**16.** Keep a drink nearby, cotton mouth is a bitch.

**17.** **NEVER** drink bong water.

**18.** THC is a relatively non-polar molecule, hence it being soluble in fat (a non-polar solvent) and not water (a polar solvent). Alcohol consists of non-polar carbon chains with polar alcohol groups attached, so it's somewhere between the two and thus can dissolve either non-polar or polar substances, but not as well in either case as fat or water would. In this case, you can dissolve THC in it -- losing more than you would if you used water, but not by a whole lot.
Theoretically, you could make cannamilk by sticking it in a bong, but that's really gross.

**19.** Don't use liquor as a bong water, it removes some of the thc from the smoke. (debated, but most people believe it and why take the chance?).

**20.** Appreciate the taste of good bud and you'll gain bonus points from many more experienced smokers.

**21.** You can change out your bong water with flavored waters or sodas to change the taste (though I've never noticed a difference to be honest).

**22.** The cheapest upgrade you can make to a bong is to get a diffuser stem, it costs around $20 where I'm at. (alternatively you can use bb's or small beads as diffuser beads for even less, but I'm not sure if the plastic is bad for you).

**23.** When shopping for pieces, do your research or bring a more experienced smoker along, and don't be afraid to wait. (you'll also usually get better deals online).

**24.** If there's a need to mask the smell you can make a sploof by taking an empty toilet paper roll and filling it with dryer sheets. (for a better, but harder to make sploof drill holes in the bottom of a small bottle and fill it with carbon pellets (I can't remember the actual name right now, but you can find them at pet stores, usually by the fish) then rubber band a dryer sheet around the open top so they don't spill out on you).

**25.** Dealers usually give discounts if you buy larger amounts, so getting together with some friends to buy a lot then splitting it up is often a good idea if you have a scale or means to separate it.

**26.** Getting caught with a scale automatically elevates possession to intent to distribute, so be very careful of bringing them with you/having them out in the open.

**27.** In a pinch you can make a pipe out of almost anything. (a pen, an apple, soda can/water bottle, etc.) some people enjoy building their own.

**28.** Vaporizers are great, but quickly increase your tolerance so be careful with using them as your only means of smoking. (the already vaped bud can also be smoked regularly or used in place of tobacco in joints/blunts as it's drier but still contains cannabinoids)

**29.** If you can't roll you can always get a roller from a head shop or online which makes it incredibly easy (as long as you have papers that fit)

**30.** Cologne or axe does NOT cover up weed, but for most people makes it more obvious.

**31.** The best way to cover up the smell of weed smoke is with cigarette smoke.

**32.** You can chew gum or use the on the go toothbrushes (these work better, think they're made by crest or something) to get the smell of weed off your breath.

**33.** If you're being pulled over and want to get rid of the smell of weed on your breath, only use mouthwash if there's absolutely no chance you'll be breathalyzed as it contains high concentrations of alcohol and will make you blow falsely high *this is debated, and not from my personal experience so it could very well be false.

**34.** Blown out speakers make great places to hide paraphernalia as you can remove 3/4 screws and swing the top open (kind of like butterfly doors on a lambo) and nobody ever suspects it. (pens also work for skinny joints if you cut the stem [part holding the ink), but it is messy as the ink will flow out after cutting so be careful).

**35.** Don't use a zippo to light your bowl, it's harder to use and emits more gas, making your hit taste nasty (and it can't be good for you).

**36.** Smoke the corners. Imagine the bowl in four sections and try to light only one of those sections. That'll save you from ""scorching"" (quickly burning up) your trees.

**37.** If your joint is really tight (hard to pull when smoking), use a thin poker (swiss army toothpick's are ideal) and push the joint innards through the roach up about 5mm. The joint will now smoke perfectly, this works EVERYTIME.

**38.** Some people don't have Iron Lungs and that full bong might look intimidating. Put your hand on top of the bong and take some long deep breathes to get some oxygen in your blood stream, if there is an ice pinch this also gives time for some of the smoke to cool down. Take your hand off and clear the bong. Stop after the bong is empty — the gas will expand in your lungs and you want to leave room.

**39.** Ask around and learn how to properly pack a tobacco pipe, take everything you learn and use it to pack your cannabis pipe. If done right it will be cherry easily and you won't have to poke ash out of the way.

**40.** Buy a pipe tool. They cost around 2 bucks and can be bought at any tobacconist and it will be your best friend. Plus even experienced smokers will be impressed with this device.

**41.** When you're smoking a joint and its on the last third; making passing awkward; pass right hand to right hand or left to left and go index to index then pinch with the thumb. It's the best passing method and it always works.

**42.** For joints, blank business cards make good roaches (also called crutches). cut around any sections with ink; don't need that in your lungs.

**43.** Leaving baking soda in a dish overnight can absorb some of the smoke smell in your car.

**44.** If you need to cover the smell in your car immediately -- maybe if you're being pulled over -- light a cigarette.

**45.** Blowing smoke through a tube with a dryer sheet will mask the smell.

**46.** Eating an apple will remove smoke breath (and cotton mouth). They also taste great.

**47.** Trying to light a roach on your stove because you lost all your matches and lighters could result in you smelling your hair being burned.

**48.** Take hits you're comfortable with, and go at your own pace. getting high should be enjoyable. there's no need to treat it as a pissing match with friends/strangers.

**49.** If you're not the provider of the trees don't try to fill up your lungs and kill the bowl in one hit. This will annoy every one else.

**50.** If you're smoking some one else's trees and you have trees yourself offer to match them on the trees you smoked or offer to throw some of yours into the bowl or even green-cap it. This will win you some cool points and respect with whom ever you're smoking with.

**51.** **Lastly:** Enjoy the process. Relax and breath.

I bought a strange ""legal high"" from a shop called happy high herbs.

It was merely described as 'Zzzzz-zing' on the packet.
The leaves were chopped up, but they were flat, skinny and pale grey, and the smoke smelt kind of musky.

It got me REALLY high, It was a sort of body experience I guess you could say:

Loss of balance
Tingling, insides felt like they were flipping
Complete loss of concentration
Strobe-time lapse type effect similar to weed
Complete disorientation.
Gave me a radical head-ache afterwards.

Anyone know what it might be?

So basically I'm around 75% sure that what I smoked was 'spice'

''Hey, you smell nice today'' (Wtf was i thinking 0.o) *She smelled like weed as always

''Uhm, thanks? whats going on?''

5 seconds pass and i tell her: ''well, i was just thinking of pulling out my best friend...''

Still not completely sure of how to react she says: ''Your best friend? whats wrong with you, are you high? *jokingly

I then looked her in the eyes and said: ''Not yet... Wanna come smoke with me?''

We then had the most intimate brother-sister talk about how i was always gonna be there for her, and after i got done pouring out my thoughts, she jokingly said: ''You know, if we were ever in prison together, i would totally shank someone if they looked at you the wrong way...''

I'm in a lovely relationship with the man I love (f/m, both mid/early 20s), and we've been together almost 6 years now. We've had our ups and downs, but things between us have been wonderful. The down side? He is 100% absolutely against trees. He thinks they are terrible. I myself was the same way for a while, but while I was going through a lot of rough things and we were on hiatus as a couple for a few months I took the plunge with some mutual friends and got high. It was a very enlightening experience. It helped my anxiety, it helped my depression. For 2 hours I felt just felt good and had no hangover threatening to kill me the next day.  I absolutely want to start smoking casually. I'm a 5th year senior in college that is completely over going out and getting smashed. I just want to sit around at home and watch Dr. Who and get high.

My question for you is this: How do I go about opening him up to the idea of me using them for recreational use? How do I help him realize that when used responsibly it could really improve my way of life? It doesn't have to be with him, or in front of him (we still live apart). I just want him to not threaten to end the loving relationship we have. I want acceptance and understanding, just like one would with any aspect of a relationship.

I haven't smoked since, and I will not smoke unless we come to a mutual agreement. I respect him and his opinion, but I want him to realize that it may be founded in misinformation. Let me know your thoughts

[The Pipe/Gift](http://imgur.com/l4C3i) (long pink one)

my niece is 17, 18 next year (she visits during the summer from the south to NY/NJ). my bro is not very good at hiding his ent status, emerging from the garage, eyes red with the familiar smell of ""jah"" in the background. i say familiar because my niece lives in TX with her mother. of course, at her high school, almost all the children smoke marijuana. she's just naturally around it all the time. so she KNOWS when poppa ent is at a [5], so to speak. 

as uncle ent, she will speak to me about certain things because i never over react. i was a teen once and i know the feeling of not being able to talk to the parental units about things. so i act as that bridge - never judgmental, always available to talk. sometimes parents get into overcontrol mode so uncles like me are a necessity. anyway, as uncle ent aka the bridge, i was able to talk her into waiting to smoke (realistically, we can't stop her), bring up the topic to her father, and block any attempts at my bro being a two-faced parent - narc by day/ent by night. once you're two-faced, you lose credibility as a person, not just a parental figure. 

now, after a few years, we're at this point. she's going to be a legal adult and it's better that she be introduced by responsible tokers (and growers) who actually know wtf they're doing as opposed to her dumb ass friends who can't even keep their pants pulled up.

when it comes to the green, she probably knows more than some long time ents. we've been teaching her everything from general use to cultivation to politics. her brother will have his time next year. he's already thinking in stealth mode, taking after his daddy ent. when it's his time, he'll be just as ready.

Enlighten me.,sleepmuseum,47,13,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/ld3i1/bf_smokes_weed_daily_i_dont_get_it_enlighten_me/,"My boyfriend likes to smoke 3-4 times a day, on average. Sometimes less, sometimes more, depending on our situation. I've smoked with him on occasion and it never really seems to affect me--save for one time where I ended up smoking too much and felt like I was going to die for a few hours... I didn't feel it at all until it hit me all at once like that. Is there something I could be doing wrong?


Anyway, not knowing what it's like to be stoned makes it kind of difficult for me to understand why he does it so often. That makes me uncomfortable with it, and I would like not to be. I've asked him about it and he says it's his way of self-medicating, that his thoughts are normally pretty restless/all over the place, so it helps him to think more clearly and be more productive. However, almost every other stoner I hang out with (which isn't many, really) refers to it as ""getting stupid"" or things like that, which seems pretty contradictory to what he's saying. Is it different for everyone or is he BSing me here? Why do YOU do it? What's it like?


He seems pretty normal still when he's high, he just rambles a little more and his jokes get even cheesier. He doesn't veg out or anything and is even way more likely to kick my ass at Scrabble. Soo is it not a problem?


I'm just kind of concerned with the frequency. A few times a week, okay, whatever. But a few times a day? I don't get it. Is it a filling-the-void-in-your-life type thing? Because I can't help but see it that way. I've had experience with a couple of other substances and I can't imagine doing either of those on a daily basis unless I found my life incredibly dull. The thought of that being the case with him just makes me... sad.


Also, I guess I feel kinda left out. I don't like being not sober without him, and I don't like being sober without him either! It's obviously something he enjoys a lot and I wish I could enjoy it with him every once in a while!


**TL;DR - What's a good way for a non-smoker to look at a smoker's habits to understand them better? What does smoking do for you? Is there a point where it becomes a problem?

This guy somehow convinced me to buy a sack of shake off of him that he claimed to have bought from the dispensary. I told him to pack a bowl of it first so I could see its quality. I'm now thinking that he already planned for this to happen, and packed some actual weed in the bowl for me to test. I thought that if it was of this quality, it would definitely be worth buying, despite it being ground up.

I didn't really exam the bag much because I didn't feel a need to (I thought I could trust this guy). But now that I look at it, it doesn't look right. At first glance, it appears to just be normal ground up weed,  but when I more closely exam it, it looks wrong. There's a few leaves that look bright yellow, and there is long, thin, orange sticks scattered throughout the bag as well. Furthermore, it just doesn't seem to smell like weed to me. It definitely does not smell skunky at all, but rather like an actual blend of spices and herbs. There also seems to be a small smell of mint as well. 

The first reason I got suspicious of this shit though was that it gave me a weird high. I didn't feel the usual feeling of calmness and relaxation that I get with weed, but rather a high-strung, twitchy kind of feeling. I also feel rather unsociable and indifferent. Another thing is, one hit of this will make me feel very stoned, whereas I usually have to smoke a full bowl to reach this level, as I have built up a tolerance. 

I have bought sacks off this guy in the past, and they were always satisfactory quality. I also consider him a good friend of mine, who I often hang out with, which is another reason I'm so reluctant to say he ripped me off. 

I don't know, can someone put my mind at ease?

Also, the only camera I have is on my phone, and I won't be able to take a decent picture at the moment. I will take one tomorrow night when I get home.

Any answers/advice would be appreciated. Thanks! (xpost)",TrypE25,38,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/1h2j2m/im_suffering_from_crohns_disease_and_have_been/,"(I posted to /r/trees first, but I realize that this is probably a more appropriate place for these types of questions).


Hey /r/saplings, I'm a 20 year old guy who has been suffering from crohn's disease since high school. Fortunately, I live in California. Unfortunately, I'm still financially dependent on my very, very anti-drug parents, and I still am on their medical insurance plan.

For the past two years, I've been experiencing worsening and more frequent pain and nausea from this condition, and it's been really disrupting my life. The only thing that somewhat helps works is a liver-terrorizing dose of Tylenol, but I want to avoid that for obvious reasons.


A few of my friends were nice enough to let me try week last year, and I had a really positive experience with it. Apart from the usual awesome stuff you all know, I finally felt pain-free for a few hours, and was able to eat without the fear of having to throw up. I've toked up with them sporadically over the past year, and it's helped pretty much each time, but I feel bad for continuously mooching off of them.

So - I think it would be ideal for me to try to get a card. But, I have a few questions.

1) Do I even qualify for MMJ in California? I read the law, and it seems to only allow it for really serious conditions. I'm in pain, sure, but I'm still able to do most of my normal activities most of the time. It's only really bad once every few months, when I can't move or eat or anything.

2) If I do qualify, is it possible to get a card without using my parents' insurance/having it show up on my medical record? Sadly, there's no way they'd allow me to try this route for relief.

3) If I do manage to get a card, would vaping hash oil be similarly effective? I'd prefer not to smoke, but I've also read that hash oil is primarily composed of THC, while CBD is the main compound that helps with the pain. While I'd obviously love some sweet head highs, if I'm going to use this medically, I want to make sure that it would be effective.

4) Are any of you suffering from a similar condition? Does weed help? Or is it just my wishful thinking?


I'm living with my parents this summer, but I'm going back to UC Berkeley for college this fall, so I think it'd be ideal if I can try to get the card right before I head back - while I'd still be on my parents' insurance plan, at least I'd be in my own apartment and have my own car.

A good friend of mine smokes a lot and since I've been home (a couple weeks now), we've smoked together a bunch of times. 

Generally, I know that etiquette is that you share your bud and don't ask for any payment and I offered a couple times when we smoked, but she always very nicely said no and that she was just happy to be smoking together, since we never got the chance to when we were younger.

Anyways, I asked her once via text if she could hook me up with her dealer so I wouldn't be smoking hers all the time, but she never answered. I don't know if she didn't get the text or didn't want to answer or just forgot or what. 

Basically, I'm just not sure how to proceed from here. She has never seemed bitter that I'm smoking so much of her weed, but I feel bad about it and I would also like to be able to smoke without going through her, if she's working or I just want to chill solo or with some other friends or whatever.

Edit: First off, thanks for the comments. The Reddit community will never cease to amaze me. And, as it seems, you guys are all saying wait a couple more years, and due to where I am at in my life, I'm going to. This question actually spawned from my friend wanting me to go smoke with him after my game yesterday. I have always been told learn to say no early, and out of habit, I answered no. However, a lot has changed in my life (Me becoming atheist, my mom finding a partner who has 3 kids) so it's made me look at other aspects.

It's my first post here so I bet sploofs have been mentioned before, but if not I thought i'd let you in on my most helpful tool in my smoking arsenal.

A sploof is nothing more than a paper towel roll with a stack of dryer sheets rubberbanded (or duct taped) to it. All of these things are things that can be easily attained and you probably already have them lying around. After you take a hit, put your mouth to the open end of the tube and blow your smoke through the dryer sheets at the other end. The smoke that comes out has not only been lessened by going through the sheets, but the sheets also take the smell of the pot away and replace it with a more 'clean' smell. I wish I knew about this earlier. If you're in a house, dorm, or apartment that you can't smoke in, it's a good way to be sneakier and therefore smarter!

When I exhaled, no smoke seemed to appear, so I thought that I mustn't have really have taken any hits. So I take 4 more. I go upstairs to pack away my pipe and weed, and take a shower.

This is where it began to get a bit weird. The moment I step into the shower, an immense burst of pressure is now present behind my eyes. It felt as though they were trying to escape my skull. That went away after thinking about something else. A tad later, when I began to wash my hair, it was as though I could feel every one of my hair follicles being touched and my mouth seemed *extremely* small. After leaving the shower, it began very hard to hear things for about 5 minutes. It was as though someone clapped their hands next to my ears, and my hearing became static-y and obscured by a faint ringing.

The rest of the night was a blur, and  I could not really remember anything besides *needing* to eat otherwise I would feel uneasy and dizzy. My experience was a bit daunting, I have to say. I have actually considered staying away from trying cannabis anymore.

Now I should state that I haven't toked in about two months - maybe longer. And I should also state the last times I smoked up I was with good friends and just chill with it, and the following didn't really take place.

However, when I first started smoking about two years ago I used to love everything at face value. Like, I wouldn't normally notice it in either a positive or negative light, but whilst high I would see the colours, the nature, the buildings, the lights and everything around me as so interesting, vivid, enjoyable.

But recently I've been going through some experiences when I smoke. Like, I'm pretty interested in the world and I know a little bit about, say, international relations, and the different gas supplies in Europe and different corporations and things. All that stuff I'm half educated in. And I just feel like it's all pointless. Now, perhaps there's some good stuff created in there. Like my guitar, it makes me feel nice to just play with the strings and here the music. And some songs etc help me. But it seems like all of this stuff we've built up, this civilized world, is pointless and erroneous and if humanity had just dealt with its issues it would never have found the need to get to 7,000,000,000 people and have energy wars, and massive pipelines cutting through the ground, and people driving about in cars, and dingy blocks of flats and unhappy families in cramped council housing...eugh.

It's like, I can enjoy the weed still. I like its effect. It chills me out and shit. It's just, everything I see around me... especially living in a city... and everything I know of the world... is just pointless.

And the thing is that at the moment, not having toked for a couple of months, I'm kind of coping. I'm making good steps towards my career, making plans for the future and stuff. But when I get high (at least, as of 2-3 months ago), I just seem to get stuck in a rut surrounded by stuff that other people care about (like exams), but I - vainly and stupidly - feel too smart to just take at face value and enjoy.

1) When toking, make sure you take in air periodically in a hit and don't let smoke pool up in your trachea and mouth, you are wasting smoke you could enjoy!



2) Firmmmly grasp whatever piece you're using, but don't try to give it the choke of death. You don't wanna drop it, but you don't want shards in your hand either.



3) If you need to have clear eyes, use artificial tears, not visine.



4) Possibly one of the most important rules: if you are carrying trees, carry in small amounts. This will keep you from getting stuck with intent to sell if you get caught



5) If you are approached by an officer, you may refuse a search. Unless the cop has a warrant or has probable cause beyond anything which could be construed as profiling. The officer cannot ask you to empty your pockets because you have on a rasta beanie. If you don't want to tell a cop no, simply say ""Sir, I would like to exercise my rights given to me in the fourth amendment of the United States Constitution.""



6) Don't steal from or wreck anyone's belongings. This should be a no-brainer, but I see it happen time and time again. Treat everyone's stuff a thousand times better than your own. How would you like it if someone ran in your house after you smoked them out and stole your lighter, or a painting or spilled drinks everywhere.

Been smoking a couple months now after a 10 year tolerance break.  Nothing state ordered or anything, just didn't really feel like toking again after I graduated high school. Anywhoser - My normal routine is to toke up and chill watching TV or playing a game online. 

Tonight after toking about as much as I usually do, I decided to lay down in my room and try listening to ""trippy music."" Cue ""Ambient"" channel on pandora. 

After a while I could swear I saw Simba in the spackle on my ceiling. I thought that was hilarious. After cracking up about this to myself for a bit, I calm down and realize I can make it feel like my eyeballs are being pushed out when I stuck out my tongue. Don't ask. Sounds stupid to a [2] me now.

I'm not a meditator, but I can definitely see where pot could help one meditate. It was so peaceful and I felt at ease for the first time in years.

I'm pretty high right now, gentlemen, so please, if what I type next is ridiculous, that's probably why. So, I decided, day off, let's get high as the moon, smoke this nug, when my typical outload is like, 0.55 grams, So, you know a gram (Since I'm pretty lightweight now, after two month t break, figured I should clarify) to last. Oh, right, okay. Decide to smoke like, 0.4 grams, which is a LOT to me, in a coffee can bowl [this](http://www.commonsensewithmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/illy_issimo-300x300.jpg)

In my bathroom, shower running on steam, fan and vent and door bottom covered. Did that, (Before I got high I flipped the can but it all landed on a towel thank god) Okay anyways I was like, Okay I should get out of this room, gotta breath this smoke, get it out

after of course seeing into the can and seeing some tiny bits that fell in :(
Hit it against my hand like 20 times, kinda hurt, not bad though, got a lot of ashy coffee, from like, those rings of drink you can never get in the can, such bullshit by the way

Okay, then I needed to get out, dont want it to stink the house so I gotta breath it all

Kinda scratchy in my throat I think, but I'm breathing really heavy I think on accident?
feels kinda scratchy so I give it a cough I think but it might have just been me coughing. Did it again, coughed. Did it again, coughed a few hearty coughs then vomit the coffee into the sink. WTF. Just like, Marinara music as I'm coughing since you got to cough to get off, then me vomitting in a sink, to like Thunderkiss '65. Shit. I'm so offtopic, I'm really sorry. Oh, right, I vomited.

1329268520.0,28,self.saplings,ppzrb,first timer's guide for obsessive worriers with a glass pipe,stonercommando,36,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/ppzrb/first_timers_guide_for_obsessive_worriers_with_a/,"The goal:

To have a pleasant newbie experience with your glass pipe and weed.

The plan:

You're going to take one or two hits.  Later on when you're more comfortable with the ride, you can try more.  But not now.

Cautions:

* consider weed to be a mood ENHANCER, not a mood CHANGER.  thus if you are in a bad mood, save it for later, unless you want to be in a worse mood.

* you might cough.  later you will get better at smoking and this won't be as big of an issue.

* people on youtube take monster hits.  you don't need to do that, those people are showing off.  you can get plenty high on small hits, and for now, giant hits will make you cough.

* weed is not toxic, nobody has ever died from weed.  but you can do stupid shit while sober or stoned, so don't walk in front of a bus in either condition.  for fuck's sake, don't drive while stoned.

* don't talk to cops while sober or stoned.  don't take your weed outside.

* if you're not listening to your favorite music, you're doing it wrong.  music is essential, whatever else you are doing while stoned.

* don't take any other drugs, including alcohol.  later when you're more comfortable with the experience, go for it.  but not now.

The procedure:

1) have a trusted friend with you, either an experienced stoner or at least someone who cares for you. second best: have them on your phone's speed dial.

2) pick an activity to do while high, and have everything laid out and prepared.  if you're listening to music, have it queued up.  if you're going for a walk, have your shoes on.  if you're going to nap, no preparation is necessary.

3) break off a pea-sized chunk of material.  put it into the pipe, making sure it isn't going to get sucked through the hole.  stuff it down a little so it won't fall out, but not so much that the hole is clogged.

4) Hold the pipe in your right hand, thumb over the carb hole on the side of the pipe.

5) apply flame to the material, inhale just enough to get some smoke flowing into your lungs.  try to also get some air from the sides of your mouth at the same time (don't clamp down on the pipe) to cool the smoke as it flows from the pipe.  after you've inhaled a bit, open the carb hole and inhale whatever remains in the pipe.  still inhaling, suck down some fresh air.  hold it a little bit, then exhale.

6) repeat once at most, for now.

7) go drink some cool water to soothe your mouth.

8) chew some gum to get your saliva flowing to combat potential dry mouth.

9) burn some incense or something to get rid of the smell.

10) don't worry about leftovers.  put your pipe away and smoke them later.  they will keep just fine, even partially burnt.

Things to do now:

* go for a walk

* listen to some epic guitar solos

* watch a funny movie

* play video games

* browse reddit, at last the comments are interesting!

* eat something, anything.  it will be delicious!

The future:

* figure out how to take cooler hits to reduce coughing.

* figure out how to take bigger hits to get a punchier high.

* find out the differences between smoking a little and smoking a lot.  both are enjoyable, but very different experiences.

* cook a meal.  nothing is more fun while stoned, except eating your meal.

* ride your bicycle while stoned.

* clean your glass pipe: put vodka or rubbing alcohol into a ziploc bag.  add kosher salt.  add pipe.  seal bag, shake until pipe is clean.  rinse with fresh water.  worry about proportions some other time!

* get a vaporizer.  because you're an obsessive worrier, you are worried about your lungs.  vapor is the way to go.  science suggests that weed smoking is safer than tobacco smoking, but it's still smoking.

If you freak out:

1) you're not going to freak out.  people have been smoking for thousands of years and they're not into it because it sucks.

2) have your friend distract you.  call them if they're not with you.

3) remember: nobody has ever died from weed.  you will not be the first.  the effects last 1-4 hours, and if you 
only took two hits, even less than that.

4) people take weed to combat nausea.  if you're nauseous, it's not the weed, weed fixes that.  have some water, lie down.

5) people take weed to combat freakouts caused by other drugs.  so weed combats the freakouts -- why are you freaking out?  weed makes you caaaallllm.

6) just go to sleep.  people take weed to combat insomnia, weed will help you fall asleep.  when you wake up you'll be sober.

Here's what I learned: it's largely a matter of personal taste, and people like it because they feel:

* Greens taste/feel better
* Greens contain more THC/g
* Greens get them higher
* They want to maximize the value of their weed
* They would rather relight than have to nurse a cherry
* It 's more aesthetically pleasing

I'm headed to the mighty city of Amsterdam later in the year with some friends and i have a few questions. In my group of frients I'm *generally* the most versed in stoner etiquette and general smoke knowledge and i don't wanna be the guy who makes himself look like an idiot tourist (even though i will be)

So, I'll fire off some quick(ish) questions and any/all input plus any other tips / experiences that spring to mind would really help a brother out.

* What can i expect to pay (in euros) for, for example an 8th of good weed? Something like a Vanilla Kush or Some Amnesia. Don't wanna have to run to an atm, or get screwed over, or do that awkward double take.

* In smoke shops, is it the done thing to roll your own shit inside the cafe? (I love to roll, i find it therapeutic and a huuuge part of the smoking experience.) If a couple of my buddies who can't roll go to another place are the guys and gals who work there happy to roll for them?

* Kinda related to above, is it advisable to just grab a grinder and shit whilst I'm over there? Or is there enough of a price hike (if any) to motivate me into giving my grinder a hella good clean and taking it with me?

* Where are you cool to smoke? Like the cafes, yeah... but Hotel balconies? Parks and Gardens? - What are the local authorities attitude towards tourists? (We're not asshole ents, we're nice and chill!)

* Generally, do people stick to joints in cafes? I mean, does anyone use glassware or anything, is it considered obnoxious to do so? I presume blunts are fine. I'm also a smoker of cigarettes, and love one after a joint -  is this cool inside cafes?

* Any direct recommendations of specific cafes you found particularly friently / easy going?

* Do i just speak English? I'd imagine alot of them would, but then again the whole idiot tourist thing... Should i learn how to ask for an eighth in dutch or anything? Any specific stoner sayings in dutch that it's good to learn?

* Obviously we don't just wanna crash in cafes all day... any awesome shit to see or do? Any good parks or countryside to find a secluded smoke spot outside of the city?

I decided to make this post since more and more states and more and more people are going medical cannabis. So I though I would just let everyone here know about what you can and can not do with a medical marijuana recommendation. I also talk about what I went through to get it. And most of all I just want you guys to be safe!

**What exactly is a recommendation?**

-A recommendation is exactly what it is. A recommendation on a piece of paper from a doctor saying that your pain/anxiety/stress will be subsided with the help of cannabis. It is usually good for up to one year. (depends on the state.) Your rec(ommendation) allows you to go to **licensed** cannabis dispensaries and legally buy cannabis from there.

**Then what the flap is this card I hear?**

Here is the key difference a card can only be obtained after you get your rec. You pay an extra fee and you get an I.D. card to go with your rec. Basically it says to cops ""Yes officer, I do have a legal recommendation."" More on this later. 
Do you need a card? No
Is it a good idea to have one? Yes

**How do I go about getting this rec?**

Well first off you need to live a state that allows medical cannabis. 
[Pretty helpful link for what you can posses in your state](http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881)

**What if I don't?**

If you live near the border of state that's next to a medical state just go there. However your rec won't help you with your state's P.D.

**And if I do?**

Now it's time to find a doctor that will analyze you. A quick search of google and your state should be sufficient enough to find a doctor. However always ask around or read reviews about doctors who give out recs. Always find out this about them.

* 1. Are they licensed by your state? (If they aren't they your rec isn't worth anything.)
* 2. How relax are they on giving you your card?
* 3. How much is it?
* 4. Do I need any medical records? (More on this later)

Also always calling the place that will evaluate you is always good. Just don't ask how chill they are lol.

*Pro tip* 

*Go to a dispensary with a friend who has their rec and look around the place. Usually the have deals that will knock quite a few dollars off your evaluation.*

Next it's time to go see a doctor. If you need medical records bring them. All states say you need them, but a lot of doctors will say you don't need to bring them in. Also bring money and an I.D.

Fill out a few forms and you are ready to see the doctor.

*Pro tip* 

*Try to avoid anything to with past medical visits to hospitals. They will need those records too and it's just a hassle. but sometimes it can't be avoided.*

Next you go in and see the doctor tell him why you feel you would benefit from cannabis. He/She takes your blood pressure and viola you get your rec! 

*PRO TIPS ALL DAY BABY!* 

*My doctor was a dick, but that doesn't mean yours will be. But if they are please do not be nervous or intimidated it's like the DMV getting your drivers test except you most likely won't fail. And it doesn't take a quarter as long.* 

**So I got it now what?**

You can use it right away, so do what I did and find a **licensed** dispensary and buy whatever you want up to your states limit!

If you need help finding a place here's a useful link. [Weedmaps.com](http://legalmarijuanadispensary.com)

**So what am I immune to the police?**

Oh lord no you are not immune to our friends in the blue (I know a few cops they are nice people). If you do not have your medical I.D. card they can still arrest you if they suspect fraud on your rec. (Meaning your rec isn't legal). BUT if you have the nifty I.D. card the police can not arrest you for cannabis. (they can still arrest you for something else)

*Dodge the police tip* 

*I know not everyone is going to drive dry, but if you do get pulled over please do not inform them of any cannabis in your vehicle. You may get a DUI and a felony for just letting them know. And 9/10 they won't hassle you.*

[Also never agree to searches.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJrQBwJpqk&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL)


**Can I enjoy cannabis anywhere?**

You sure can as long as they allow tobacco in the same place. I wouldn't recommend going to public places though you will get **A LOT** of heat and possibly some calls to the police.

**What can I buy?**

If your dispensary is licensed; anything they are willing to sell. Just remember your state limits.

**Can I grow it?**

Sure can check with your state and their laws about it first though.

**Can I sell it?**

NO! NO! NO! NO! NEVER SELL IT TO ANYONE! It is a felony and you will lose your rec **FOREVER** if you are caught selling. And if it's to a minor you may face prison time. 

**But I want to!**

Then get registered by the state to do so and open up a dispensary.

**What else can't I do**

It's easier to say what you can't do because it's shorter of what you can do lol.

* do not drive
* do not operate heavy machinery
* Keep your stash in your trunk if you are going somewhere with it.


**So what's your story how did you get yours?**

I had a lot of friends who have theirs. And I wanted mine. So I went to a doctor and got it. That was...... 6 months ago so my renewal is coming up soon. Which I have no Idea how that is gonna go as the place I got mine started demanding medical records which I do not want to give. But if it is a problem over there I will just find a different location and get a brand new one again. I have probably bought...... oh lord A LOT of cannabis legally now and I love it.

*TL;DR* Umm fuck you? do it on your own then.

My friend and I usually split a gram for 20 bucks and would fly to the moon about once or twice a week.

Well, I get these mids and the first thing i notice: they look like.......well exactly like mids would look like.  They were a little more compressed, more stemds, and less visable crystals (none tbh), but they still didn't look as bad as a lot of the shit i've seen on here labeled as ""dirt"" so I was feeling confident.

My experience:  took a grav of it.  Started feeling quite good pretty fast.  A little bit of a throbbing headache came with it, but it was negligable next to the high.  About 2 hours in, I start getting ferociously sleepy, and coming down.  Not used to that with all the dank I've been smoking since my ENT inauguration a few months ago.  The next day, I felt a big sluggish too.  Almost like a hangover, but only until I got in the shower.  Then it cleared up

Smoked a lot of it that night with a friend.  We all were high as kites, but the comedown was quick and tiring.  It felt like we had been doing physical labor for a few hours by the time we came down.  

Final verdict:  Worth the money, but I would still pay 20 for the Gram for the dank and use that as my main.

It gives a really nice high pretty quick, but dies down just as quickly and leaves a headache or tiredness in it's wake.  Certainly not something to be smoked when there are lots of the day's tasks still ahead.  It went down pretty hard down.  It tasted a bit like dirt, even though there wasn't visible dirt.

What are some good ways to avoid couchlock?,caamando,29,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/gerax/what_are_some_things_enhance_by_being_high_and/,"I've been vaping for a few months now, and noticed some pros and cons concerning what I do or attempt to do while high. Here's my very incomplete list. What would yours look like? 

Also, anyone know a good way to avoid couchlock?

**Pro** 

* Passive enjoyment of things (music, tv, movies, etc.)

* Thought- I feel like I'll have ten times as many thoughts in the same time span and it consequently makes me feel like time goes a bit slower

* Increased sensitivity- my entire body tingles, and my newly grown beard tickles me when I talk or eat.

* Nearly everything is more enjoyable/interesting

* My mind feels sharper although I've yet to test this by attempting to perform any mental tasks while high

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa, watching Life or some other documentary while playing with my puppy and not go or do anything for several hours.

**Con**

* Spacing out makes me feel like time goes slower, which makes cardio (running and/or heavybag) feel like it goes on forever

* increased sensitivity- if my back was sore from sitting in a weird position, then it gets amplified by the high

* munchies- Cool ranch doritos are my kryponite, but I tend to get quite gluttonous when high

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa, watching Life or some other documentary while playing with my puppy and not go or do anything for several hours.

I rolled a pure what must have been 0.5-0.7g joint (pure because I don't smoke) and went out.

got to the park near my house and lit up, I had to smoke the entire thing as soon as possible as I mostly didn't want to get caught with it but also just didn't like the looks I was getting. after finishing the entire thing i sat on a bench for 5 minutes and my eyesight started moving constantly to the right my eyes literally wouldn't stay still. but then I looked around and just noticed all the flowers and how colourful everything was, everything so vibrant and glowing it was really strange but when I went to stand I just felt like if I stood i was going to fall straight over so i stayed their for a few minutes enjoying myself eventually managing to move around.

I got nearer the plants and sat under a tree for what was probably around 15 minutes but felt like hours, at this point I noticed improved hearing and could hear conversations from the other end of the street which I suddenly found fucking hilarious. trying to control my laughter was impossible so I just made my laughing quieter. 

I remember moving around from tree to tree because the sun kept moving into my eyes and it was so fucking beautiful but I didn't want to go blind so i moved. at one point i remember seeing some older couples sitting the other side of the flowerbed to me looking straight at me with the biggest smile on their faces ever, that kind of scared me but I didn't really think too much about it. 

Must have been an hour after I had smoked i started feeling like my heart was going to explode as it felt like it was beating really fast and my right kidney was in agony but I just remembered not to panic and it was all fine and I knew it couldn't be anything bad. at one point someone came up to me and asked if I was okay, I said I was but after that I had no clue what he was talking about but remember saying ""bye"" when he left even thought I've never met the guy in my life. 

I slightly remember waves of pulsing in my head that is just explainable but felt like the best thing ever. I think because I was against a tree I didn't like the thought of spiders or things crawling on me so I kept seeing black shadows over my shoulder or hearing noises that I just put down to my new spidey senses. 

I took a few pictures of my eyes while this happened as I wanted to know if it was still as red as the start because I needed some food and didn't want to turn up with really red eyes. ended up getting a burger and devouring it on the way home.

got home and passed out,the day after smoked was very strange to me, it felt like what i remembered slightly from the day before but a lot less intense and everything just looked amazing still. it's been a few days now and I've had a headache since but I slightly put that down to the weather and not drinking enough water.

I don't really know why I typed this but I hope this can give some people who are first timing some idea what will happen, I would also not suggest doing what I did (only take a few hits before you take any more, don't rush the thing) because at points I really wished the pain would go away but when it went everything was amazing.

So I sit at my computer for a while and do the usual, reading Reddit and watching funny gifs when I'm like ""I should probably get in the shower to get the smell off me."" So I hop in the shower (make the water really hot, as I like it) and I am in there for a while thinking before I actually start to wash my hair and as soon as I close my eyes I have this entirely new full body feeling like I am transcending everything and it is fucking crazy. So soon as I open my eyes I get the worst stomach ache and fell like I might throw up, so I bend over. I'm in that position for a while and the next thing I know my friend is in the bathroom freaking out like. ""What's wrong? How did you fall? I heard a big thump!"" I then come back to reality and realize that I am on the floor of the shower and I fell and knocked down all the bottles. I get out of the shower because at this point we need to pretend we are asleep in case her parents come down. So I get a towel, dry myself off, and start putting on my clothes. I look at myself in the mirror and, what do ya know, my face is ghost pale (and a little bit yellow-y and my lips are slightly blue.

I still have no memory of the actual fall. I have no idea what happened or how I got that high but it was crazy and a bit scary.

Do any of you have a story like that or can give me advice on what happened?

I roll it, we head out to smoke. I'm assuming I really overestimated our capabilities. After we had smoked 1/3 of the joint my friend says he's had enough.

We both take another hit and as I'm putting out the joint he's leaning against the door and then falls down on his knees and says ""spaceship"" this is the part where I think he's kidding. 

Of course he wasn't and this is where I start to freak out, my heart starts racing I put the joint down and started supporting him. 20-30 seconds goes by and he begins coming back, so I help him up and ask him to open the door, once it's open he just falls down and has spasms. Now I'm really fucking freaking out, I go inside to hide the joint. 

As I'm fumbling through my stuff he staggers inside and says he's feeling better now, we sit down and watch Wilbur but I can't settle down, my heart was racing and everything just felt wrong. Eventually I switch to Adventure time because I found Wilbur was too scary (Ep2 or 3 where it starts out with one of them being paranoid)

We sit through 3 episodes of Adventure Time before we decide to head to bed, I thought it would be best and I hoped I'd feel better if I could just sleep it off.

On our way in my friend obviously starts feeling worse and goes around the house to throw up, I help him balance, pat his back and help him sit down while I fix him a place to sleep.

On our way in he makes a pit stop at the bathroom to throw up some more. Once in bed I couldn't settle down, my heart was racing and I could feel the heartbeat throught my body, I had sensation of warmness in my face and upper body.

He wakes me up at 11 and we talk a bit, I thought I had settled down, once he went home I started cleaning up.

I took my second test 29 days after my last smoke. I received another phone call yesterday, and was told everything was fine! My first day is Monday!

Then she just did that for a couple of minutes, kissing where ever I felt bad (neck, arm, around my lungs, etc.), anddd.. I felt better.

The first time I smoked I had few hits out of a hand pipe which involved a lot of coughing. I probably screwed up inhaling, so I didn't expect to get high. A few weeks later I took a few hits out of my friend's new bong, but I just got tired and had extremely bad cotton mouth which gave me anxiety since I didn't expect it.
The only time I ever felt something was when I smoked 4 or 5 hits from a bong. Everything was very heavy and I feel like I couldn't talk, but again, I didn't feel any different mentally. At another time, I took a couple hits off of a vaporizer; my eyes did get heavy, but I didn't feel any different. 

This is when I started doing a little research and made sure I was inhaling right. I smoke hookah quite a bit and the occasional cigar/cigarette, so I feel like I inhale right. When using a bong I'd light the weed, inhale for 4 or 5 seconds, remove the slide, inhale the smoke, inhale some fresh air on top of the smoke, hold for a couple seconds, then I would exhale and smoke would come out naturally... So I feel like I'm doing that right. Is it possible I just don't get high, because I feel like it would be extremely obvious if I was high. I've used several means: chillum, hand pipe, bongs(one with a carb and one with a slide), and a vaporizer, but again, nothing. I would love to get my hands on some edibles, but that's not possible right now. I also haven't ever smoked on my own, so I've been thinking of buying my own piece and experimenting. I feel like that might be a waste as I've never truly enjoyed any smoking experience yet.

According to the grower, it was a 50/50 Sativa/Indica hybrid harvested with 50/50 orange/cloudy trichomes. For 'a wide spectrum high'.

I believe that the highest I've ever been is a [[5]](http://i.imgur.com/AKrdc.png). With that said, I've experienced a lot of different effects, and I'm wondering if any of these effects are specific to the Sativa or the Indica buzz. I'll try to put the effects in the order I've felt them hit me.

* A sensation of pressure around the temples, coupled with a heaviness around the eyes.
* Dry mouth. Enhanced sense of touch. Riding a bicycle in sunny weather feels absolutely fantastic at this stage; The air becomes thicker, and you can feel it everywhere on your body. It's easier to *feel* the movement of the chain on the bicycle, if that makes any sense.
* 'Floaty' vision. Easy to look at everything at once, or to focus on the tiniest of details. Blinking with the eyes while moving fast can cause a feeling of *I'm not getting anywhere*.
* Thoughts begin to arise differently than usual. Increased chance/risk of getting stuck in smaller loops of thought. Minor changes in time perception.
* Tingling sensation in the chest area. I first mistook it as my heart beating insanely fast, but it wasn't/isn't. It's more like butterflies in your chest. Wonderful when you get used to it.
* Minor rush of euphoria coupled with a warming and intensification of colours. Music sounds/feels great. Writing feels amazing, one cares for each written letter as one would care for a smaller work of art.
* Small vibrations/pulses in parts of legs. It's almost as if I can feel the blood going through certain places of my body. At least that's what I imagine.

Then the buzz sort of wears off. Meanwhile, the bed feels wonderful.

I've heard about the *body high/buzz* of Indica, and *head high/buzz* of Sativa, but is it black and white like that?

Let me describe my primary smoking set up at home first.

I smoke outback on my patio surrounded on three sides by exterior walls of my house. It isn't closed in though (no roof/fourth wall). I also have a 7ft fence around my back yard. And to top it off my entire property is lined with huge evergreen trees. There is probably about 15-20ft between my back yard and my neighbor's yards. 

with that being said... do you think they can smell my smoke? Would the wind make the smell travel faster or dissolve it? 

After I finish smoking (others i assume as well) it is kinda hard to smell anything else other than burnt trees. But when I'm smoking outside during the day and I hear my neighbors in the next yard and I hope that they don't smell me and get me into some shit, however, this isn't enough to stop me from doing it....

I've been collecting small bits of gear for years (small glass pipe, screens, cheap grinder) and recently moved into my own place so I decided to start up again, just to chill out, much the same way I treat having a drink at home. 

Anyway, made my first-ever 'deal' (for myself anyway), loaded up my first-ever bowl for myself (wasn't sure if I did it right), and blew the smoke out the loft window (to hopefully disipate it enough)...niiiice :) turns out the bowl was loaded just fine, although I need to work on the grinding. My old housemates don't use grinders so I'm not familiar with them, everything else went better than expected :) 

I only watched one movie last night and I could feel the trees starting to kick in from time to time :) but I'm going to have to check out some video games, listen to music, etc. and EAT FOOD OMG can't wait 

The cheap single-layer (2 piece?) grinder (cast metal) I got in Amsterdam is touristy junk, I just ordered a Sharpstone :) I'll be getting a MFLB soon just to be more efficient with the trees, I don't want to mix tobacco in.

IMO there are quite a few risks related to doing so and I do not really think that it is worth it.

* ""Young and Dumb"" is a saying for a reason. I would say that teenagers, with an increased peer preasure factor are more likely to get cought one way or another. possibly ruining their lives dependant on where they are and how severe it is
* Your Body and Mind is still heavily developing during this time, there is a reason why even ""legal drugs"" have an age limit! Overuse of any Drug in that time has a chance (!) of causing severe issues for that teenager. Even if it's just the good ol' stoner stereotype: Sits on couch and does nothing, drops out of school. (My own brother was an example of this, started smoking when 14 and dropped from the highest tier of education in germany to barely finishing the lowest tier within 4 years)
* Availability: While it might not be the case all the time, let's face it, in states/countries where Cannabis has not been decriminalised, the people selling it aren't always the good guy next door.
* and the entire medical side of things. How can you claim that Cannabis is a medicine when 15 year old teenagers are lying stoned on their couch?

PVC pipes are one of the easiest things to make a working apparatus out of...however, this does NOT mean you should do it. And I'm posting this specifically to inform you not to! PVC is highly toxic when heated, it creates noxious fumes that WILL KILL YOU. Putting a metal piece on it (for the trees) will not make it safe. The flame from the bud can heat the pipe and mix dangerous gasses in with your not so dangerous smoke. 

Please, please, please, take my advice and stay away from PVC pipes when making your own piece. You can find many other 'blueprints' for other MUCH safer devices. The safest thing you can do is to just save some cash and buy some glass.

I was at a going away party for one of my friends, and I have a friend who has some brownies. He gives one to another friend, who in turn gives it to a female friend of his and she eats 3/4 of it. As soon as it hit, she was TERRIFIED of being at the party. People were taking pictures and every time a flash went of she flinched and she started freaking out about it begging someone to take her home. I immediately realized what was going on so I took her to the bus stop so I could get her home. On the way she repeatedly asked me to stay between her and the road as she felt she would fall into it. Her perception of time was EXTREMELY off (two minute walk to bus stop was a few hours, as was waiting for the bus) as well as she felt like her body was melting. I got her home safe, made sure she was ok, and told her to drink some water and sleep. She was fine in the morning and I was so glad because I felt so terrible for her, she had such a bad time :( 

So, moral of the story:  **DO NOT GIVE BROWNIES TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE WITHOUT SUPERVISING THEM/MAKING SURE THEY DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH**. Especially when you know the brownies knock YOU on your ass and you smoke everyday. 

Please, if you are going to give someone who doesn't smoke a brownie, make sure they only eat a bit, and prepare them for what they will feel. 

Also, if you don't smoke often (and even if you do) **BE CAREFUL WITH EDIBLES**, they are powerful.",,False,self,t5_2rukl,1374820773.0,,,True,t3_1j2ziv,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/1j2ziv/psa_be_careful_with_edibles/,

**For when you're buying bud:**

1. Dense bud, as a grower its all about getting those calyxes pumped full of cannabinoids nice and big. Calyxes are bud. You want dense bud not airy bud.

2. Dry/cured bud. Damp bud absolute **no**. You want it dry but not crispy where it falls apart in your hands. Usually if the bud is dried too fast it can be crispy on the outsides but danker towards the middle.

3. Trichomes/Sugar/Resin on the bud. Like all my points is contentious - but trying to be helpful for *most of the time.* Things like kush have massive calyxes but could have less visible sugar on the buds surface - but **as a rule** if its covered then you're set. Conversely if its not and is a bit airy I'd say thats poorly grown and not worth your money.

4. Strain names. OK well just ignore them - not because they could be lying or misinformed but because its entirely about the end product. Seed companies (won't name any names) have been pumping out crosses like ""Super Cheese Purple Hindu Kushberry Haze"". Anyway, find great bud and then enjoy the ridiculous name, I know I do.

-----------------

5. Trim/Manicure. The little leaves on the bud are called sugar leaves, they do have cannabinoids like THC and get you high, but if you're buying by weight it doesn't get better than pure trimmed bud. 

6. Smell, damp bud doesn't smell great it smells damp. Great bud smells stiiinky, lots of flavours. **Cheesy** smells will be Cheese related strains that will give you a stoney high. **Skunky** smells, a bit like a fruity stench are a bit more buzzy but still stoney. Lemony smells you might expect to be a bit more buzzy and heady, I'm less confident about this but its very largely true.

And the purple thing, well some growers know if they cool down nighttime temperatures or stress the plants in another manner they can turn the leaves on the buds purple. Anyway there are real genetic purples, but again look at the bud quality then relish in the fact purple bud is **awesome**. The different colour alone doesn't make it any better.

**Please feel free to add the other points I've missed or even correct mine, I think I know everything by now but I'm sure I can be shamed.**

1315799239.0,23,self.saplings,kcpg4,I think I had my first [11] experience.,jrh1984,29,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/kcpg4/i_think_i_had_my_first_11_experience/,"I've been smoking trees occasionally for the past year and probably once a week the last month or two. And up until Friday night, I had never really gone past an [8] or even gone back for a second hit once I was high.  

Typically, I blaze up and then settle down with a space doco by myself or play a nostalgic movie or cartoon with friends. The amount usually varies between a joint and a couple of bowls. That's it, I never go back for more once I'm high. However, this time I decided I wanted to smoke more than I normally do, plus go back for more. I wanted to get higher than I ever had before. 

But something went incredibly wrong.

I blazed a really full bowl in my glass pipe. I felt amazing. I could have settled down for the night but I really wanted to experience a higher high. I had a five minute break and drunk some water. 

Then I fired up my bong. One massive load, packed nice and tight. I blazed for what felt like hours. I was really high by this point. I'm not sure if I'm a pussy or not but usually I get a little inner monologue going by this stage which is tells me, ""that's enough jrh1984"". But I wanted to keep going. 

So I packed the same stinky payload in the bong again. Making the grand total three large bowls. 

By this time I was higher than I had ever been before. I sat in my bathroom, on the toilet to be precise, and gently rocked backward and forwards. Almost as if to regain control, although the rocking felt involuntary. I decided I needed to move spots. I got up off the toilet (lid closed - btw) and walked into our bedroom. I flopped on the bed, and got under the covers. I felt horrible. 

The sensation is usually somewhat consistent for me, this was not something I was expecting. I couldn't think. I tried to grapple for some Sagan-esque truth or Feynman-inspired quirk of reality to feed my brain. But it was not going to happen. 

It was almost as if my brain no longer had any conscious function. I was only reactive. My biggest tasks at hand were breathing, heart beating, and existing. I felt I needed to stay ""with it"" to keep being alive, as if I could slip away and die if I wasn't careful. I don't know if I could honestly say I was going to die or not. But I knew I had to ""be careful""; this phrase kept echoing in my mind. Does anyone else get inner ""mantras"" stuck on repeat? 

My whole body was humming. Like I was holding up a seashell, not to my ear, but to my existence. As though Tesla was performing electromagnetic experiments on me from the past. The sound was coming from everywhere and was unbearably loud. 

I was laying flat in bed, yet I felt as though I was performing somersaults. At one stage I caught myself gasping for air. I don't know how long it had been going on for, or whether or not I'd been holding my breath until then. But I gasped. Then immediately thew up. I vomited off the side of the bed onto the floor. Of all the experiences that weed enhances, showering high, eating high, listening to music high; this one takes the cake. This vomit felt like a stream of my insides had been sucked into the mouth of a dementor. 

The worst part was what I think was a ""death of the ego"". I felt physically separate from myself. I didn't see myself from above or any thing crazy like that, but I felt like me and myself were fundamentally different. The internal mantra my brain kept chanting switched, at some stage, to ""you are just a concept"". I was happy my intellect had resurfaced but I couldn't shake this notion. As a collection of atoms, forming various chemical combinations, shaped into various organelles deep inside cells, each with separate duties, forming different organs, all part of different bodily systems: all aiming to construct ""me"". Yet I was an idle, if indifferent, ""bystander"". I was just a concept. The very notion of my ""favourite color"" or ""my siblings"" etc seemed to be absolutely ludicrous. I was just a concept. I identify as jrh1984 - to appease my own subconscious need for ""identity"".     

So. Lesson learned:

Edit: Because some were asking about how I located said dealer, I'll share! 

It wasn't too complicated at all. I was with a good friend of mine who I occasionally smoke with, and I mentioned to him that I would really like to start getting my own supply so that I could control when I smoked, and also because I wanted to pitch in during some smoke sessions. He happily agreed, and said that he could contact his dealer. 

At this point I immediately asked him to make sure with his dealer that it was okay that I texted him. When it was confirmed that everything was cool, my friend gave me his contact information. After building up some courage, I texted this wonderful man, and let him know that my friend had referred me to him. 

From there it was all business. Very straightforward and professional, he asked me how much I was looking for, what his prices were, and what strains he had available at the time. We eventually met later that night across from his apartment building and made the deal. 

So now here I am, with an eighth of Blueberry Headband for $60 (in Chicago), and good dealer!

I only recently started toking daily, but those who I smoked with before got some real chronic. I was somewhat disappointed before with my weed because it didn't have the same high quality as my frients got from their dealers. This last time I went for a pick up though, my dealer's bf had to sell to me instead since she was at work. He asked what I wanted, and I said twenty, but then changed my mind and went for a forty. He then picked up one bag, smelled it, but then changed his mind or something and reached for another bag to give me instead. I also got smoked out by my dealer for the first time that day. I LOVE the weed I got! The crystals on it, the fruity smell and taste, the density... Its great. 

Reddit, how can I make sure I get this good of weed in the future? I'm not sure if he gave me the better stuff because it was her bf and not her, because I got a forty instead of a twenty and they like selling in higher amounts, or just because they have better stuff than usual..?

Over the years I have hidden my stash in many different places. Some spots I have found to be better than others. 

My first spot was under my office desk in my bedroom at home. There was a little place where I could slide my pipe and weed in.
Pros: Out of sight, Most people wouldn't choose to look there
Cons: Dusty, crammed space, nothing to keep in the smell.

Second spot was in a desk drawer.
Pros: Easy access, masked smell
Cons: Extremely easy to find, every time you opened it the smell would come out, cluttered.

Third spot: In a metal box on my dresser
Pros: Out of sight, good smell proofing
Cons: Out in plain sight, Easy to find if you snooped a little

Fourth and best spot: Behind a dresser drawer. Most dressers have drawers that can  come out of the dresser to make them easier to move from place to place. I removed one of my drawers while cleaning and found out that there was a large enough open space in the back of the dresser to fit my stash perfectly.
Pros: Incredibly hard to find, Smell proof, easy access, plenty of space   considering I can do this with multiple drawers, none of my friends thought of it before me.
Cons: When I'm a bit too high it can be hard to put back.

So the only ingredients you will need are:

Nutella

4 Eggs

and weed

What you need to do is first take about 4 ounces of nutella (about a third of the [typical nutella jar](http://siouxsielaw.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/nutella.jpg)).  Mix in 2-4 grams of weed (depending on the strength you want your cake to have).  Mix the two things in a bowl until they are blended well.  Now, at this point, you could let the mix sit for about three hours, and it would gain strength marginally, or you could just go ahead and make the cake.  Once again, it just depends on how strong you want your cake.

So once you have the pot nutella, grease a 6 or 7 inch springform pan and preheat the oven to 350.  Beat eggs very well (so they are triple their original volume)  Then mix in about a third of the egg mixture nd gently mix it with the nutella, stirring it clockwise until there are no visible streaks.  Then pour another third and do the same thing, and again until all the egg is mixed.

Then pour the batter in your pan, and bake for 20-25 minutes-until knife comes out clean.  Let cake cool, and then enjoy.  Takes about an hour and thirty minutes to take effect, I advise against eating more than a quarter of the cake at a time.

NOTE: If you want to make this snack even more potent, when you are mixing the pot with nutella, add maybe half a tablespoon of butter.

I smoke just about every day. The only days I don't is when I don't have time to. If I'm getting home and have nothing that needs my attention I will smoke until I pass out. This is generally due to anxiety and stress that I've been feeling after coming out of a serious relationship. Weed replaced alcohol for me.

I've started smoking with other people more often recently and I find that I seem to feel quite a bit higher sooner than everyone else seems to act. This just causes me more anxiety and is the reason I smoke alone most of the time.

I feel like I'm far less tolerant than most people. I felt like that during my last relationship too when I smoked with my stoner girlfriend. I've tried smoking in large volumes but my tolerance doesn't seem to increase when I'm smoking socially.

I've heard that some people are just overly sensitive to marijuana and I am wondering if I'm one of those people, or if my anxiety is causing me to feel unnaturally high.

The biggest problem I have is I become overly concious about the way I act and the things I say when I'm high. I feel like my insecurities are increased when I'm not in complete control. I also tend to make comments about being high and feel like I'm coming across as someone who just started smoking weed (I started in 2009).

I've got a little over 100 dollars and I'm looking for advice on what the best investment would be

As it stands, I'm required to chose between two highly valuable options. On the one hand, there is the good herb. I've been smoking mids for quite a while; this seems like a good time to upgrade my stash with some higher end product. I still have over an 1/8th, so not picking up anytime soon will not leave me dry.

On the other hand, there is the pieces/glassware. I've got a quality spoon and a mini bong which have been doing the job for a while, but  I'm sure there's something better out there. Currently, the debate is between a larger, higher quality bong or the MFLB. As it stands, my current pieces still work and I would have no quandary continuing to use them.

saplings has given me good advice in the past, I'm sure you can help me out. If you vote that I should invest in better herb, what strains would you vouch for? If you think better equipment would be a wiser choice, what sort of pieces have you used that deserve a good recommendation?

Update: Have been getting a very strong argument for MFLBs and I almost went that route, were it not for an unanticipated element introduced late in the game. As it just so happens, my regular dealer just got white widow in the day before. Needless to say that decision pretty much made itself.

I've been smoking trees the last couple of weeks. About once or twice a week. Haven't gotten incredibly high, but I've been smoking out of a bowl which is what I've used whenever I toke.  
So the other night I hit a gravity bong at a friends house. I've never had such an intense hit and immediately felt nauseous seconds after the hit. A couple more seconds and everything got very slow, as if my vision framerate was slowly decreasing. I told my friends I was going to pass out, not knowing what the hell was going on, and stumbled to the couch. Next thing I remember is hearing my friend yelling at me to wake up. 
At this point though I had lost sense of reality. It was almost an out of body experience, and I remember assuming that I about to die. Everything went numb, I could barely talk, and I kept telling my friend I was about to die. He persisted in trying to get me to snap out of it, but eventually I just couldn't react anymore. I thought to myself ""I'm dead. This is it. "" I was not in this world anymore, but in limbo between life and death. Everything was gone, but I could hear everything. My friend begging me to wake up, the others trying to help. Everything was no longer there, I felt like death had finally come.  I just wanted to pass on to the other side, but couldn't get the sound of reality to stop. I knew I was about to die, and I was content in going through it. I heard my friend's screams, felt him slap my face a few times. But the feelings were weak I felt like I was no longer trapped in my body. I began to cycle through events in my life, etc. Eventaully I could open my eyes and mumble a few words gasping for breath. After realizing I wasn't going to die, I was determined that I had a heart attack. I begged for an ambulance, I just anted help before it got worse. Eventaully reality set back in, and within 2 hours I was able to drive home. 


I have no idea why this happened to me and no one else. After doing a bit of research, Im pretty sure it was an anxiety attack  But I've never had a history of anxiety or panic, so I haven't a clue as to why this happened. I really wish it didn't, because it's been two days and my head still slightly hurts and I feel nautious whenever I eat. I feel I'm recovering, but very slowly. 

Obviously, all of this was in my head. My friends assure I never stopped breathing nor did my heart stop. I've read up on other similar cases and most point to an anxiety attack. 


Additional info: Not taking any meds, no past mental problems, First time I toked was about two years ago. 


Basically, I just have a couple questions: Have any of you gone though this? Why might this have happened(besides the fact that it was a shit ton of good weed)? Anyone have experience recovering?

Last week I was visiting him and I noticed that the friend (Call him Bob) was taking the pot and smoking regularly, a couple times a day. Bob is someone who I've had problems with in the past (which is why I'm not sure if my judgement is clouded or if he is being a douche). He's one of those guys who thinks he is a hippie because he smokes pot. He's an asshole sometimes but can also be really cool. 
My fiancé has been buying all of the weed for the two of them. All of it. Bob doesn't ever throw in for their combined stash. During my visit, I probably smoked out of 12 bowls, (I'm a serious lightweight so I'm talking like 2 small hits out of each bowl) but there was enough purchased for at least 30 bowls. By the time the visit was over, the pot was gone. So Bob had ~15 bowls to himself of weed he didn't pay for. 
Apparently, this has been happening between my fiancé and Bob for the last year. Bob even said he hasn't paid for pot in a year because my fiancé was buying it! My fiancé is mad about the fact that Bob never ever throws in and is about ready to stop buying any weed to prevent wasting money. 
So my question is, is this okay for Bob to be doing? Am I clouded by my dislike and distrust of Bob and its okay? Or is Bob actually stealing weed? If he is, how could he be approached about his actions in a way that wouldn't leave my fiancé without a place to live? Thanks.

I'm a female, and I got into it from my boyfriend. I get my trees from someone who is a bit ""sketchy"", so he's out of the option. Every guy I smoke up wants to have sex, not be friends, and I don't know any girls that toke outside of parties (which I don't ~~go to~~ get invited to). I'm in high school, but I'm kind of a nerd --not the shy type, just can't find any ents at school that aren't complete losers.

Any help for me? How did you find your frients? Thanks so much! ",,False,self,t5_2rukl,False,,,True,t3_vr2si,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/vr2si/tips_for_a_lonely_ent/,
1340699925.0,22,self.saplings,vmdfk,A sapling's revelation.,CHooTZ,24,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/vmdfk/a_saplings_revelation/,"Hello, I've been smoking for a couple months, and pretty consistently at that. I generally go through about .5g a day on weekends, maybe half that for a weekday, so I've been smoking significantly.

I will usually smoke one of two ways; through my bong filled with normal water, or through my glass spoon pipe, Terra. I like Terra because it's pretty hard to get overwhelmed with the pipe, as you can just pull away and not waste much. On the other hand, I really enjoy the bong as it's a cleaner hit, with the water filtering it, it's a little cooler, and I feel like I get higher or more bang-for-my-buck on the bong. Unfortunately, if I accidentally get a big cherry on the bong, it can easily over-whelm me and lead to me coughing, or wasting some of the smoke.

This leaves me at today, where on a spur-of the-moment type thing, I put about 4 ice cubes (each chopped in two to fit in my mouthpiece) in my bong before filling it with cold water. I proceeded to light up, and on my first bowl the difference was *immediately* obvious. The smoke was waaaay cooler and much easier to manage. With this smoke I didn't have to limit myself due to heat, leading to my main restriction now being how much I can fit in my lungs, now how hot my throat is. I was no longer afraid to milk a good cherry as I didn't have to cap myself nearly as badly. Due to me not having to stop midway through cherries, I could use up all of them, and this was a much faster process as I didn't have to keep pausing.

In the end, I'm definitely going to keep smoking in this manner, it's faster, more relaxing, less harsh and way easier. My spoon will still have its use as a portable option, but never am I going to chose to smoke though room-temp water again.

**TLDR:** 
Decided to try ice in my bong's water. The experience was *much* better, it was faster, more relaxing, less harsh and way easier. Definitely give it a try.

In both situations a group of me and 5 others were sharing 2 joints, I took deep breaths in, felt my chest expand and held for 5 seconds after passing. I didn't get high either time.

Fast forward to this week, I pick up my first weed and use a small twister pipe to smoke it, no carb. I do this 3 times over the past 4 days, putting maybe like ~0.3g into the bowl and taking like 4 big hits and maybe a couple smaller ones. I inhale into my lungs, hold for 5 seconds and exhale, knowing I have reached my lungs since the smoke is normally pretty much gone. The first time, I felt my face become 'heavy'(?), like my whole face just felt like it was being weighted down. Also felt a kind of 'buzz' but no enjoyable sensations really. Second day, I smoked and whilst walking around, my balance was totally gone and one of the worst parts was carrying food upstairs and when I put a leg down, it would shake a little as I put weight on it, took like 3 minutes to climb 16 stairs.

Then.. I smoked earlier today, suddenly I felt my brain become 'heavy', and there was an **extremely** unpleasant clicking sound in the back of my brain which synchronised with my heartbeat and occurred maybe once or twice every 20 seconds. The clicking noise and sensation was horrible, I was flinching every time it happened and my senses were on edge. I was hearing noises downstairs (me being the only one in) and was kind of paranoid that someone was in. I read online about the crunching sound and pretty much every symptom was terrible. It was like, cancer, heart problems, blood clots, schizophrenia. Now reading schizophrenia scared me a good bit, and I was panicking like mad hoping I hadn't damaged my mental health.

I decided to go for a nap thanks to [Nujabes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yYMicbSf98&amp;feature=related) and woke up 2 hours later, with the effects totally gone.

Now, I still have some weed left and might try tomorrow, but I'm honestly just wondering if there is something messed up with either this weed or me that is stopping me getting high.

I actually just made my second purchase and want to check how I'm doing. I'll be as specific as possible so I can see what I am doing wrong. It may seem obvious but I've only smoked a couple times with friends and they never really gave any advice other than ""hold it in.""

I bought a quarter the other day. I don't have a scale but it's a huge dense nug and smells very strongly of skunk. It's dark green with some orange streaks and kind of dim, tiny white crystals over it. From what I read, it seems to classify as a decent mid. Only thing that annoys me it that it has a big-ass stem.

(I don't have any pictures because I don't like messing with weed while everyone else is awake)

So, the way I smoke is I have a small glass pipe, and I kind of break off a piece of the nug and then crush and tear it inside of the plastic baggie until it's decently mashed into small, fine pieces. 

This is where I think I am going wrong: After that, I pack it kind of tightly into the pipe. Then I use my lighter at kind of a slant which lights most of the bowl and inhale to suck the flame into the bowl. Once it lights, I turn off the lighter and inhale. I usually take big hits and hold my breath until either I need air or I start coughing. I do this in fairly rapid succession.

Often times, I find that the kindling dies out almost immediately after inhaling, and I feel like I am just turning my weed into charcoal or something. The top of the stuff in the pipe is coated with black, burnt matter (is that the resin?) and I find that the middle and bottom of the weed is pretty much intact. 

Anyway, after I'm done burning my weed like an idiot, I sit back and wait for it to kick in. 

I don't really know what being stoned is *supposed* to feel like. My high consists of feeling like my face has a muscle relaxant, and everything is pulled upwards, like my cheeks and eyelids. It makes me have a huge grin. It also feels like my brain is kind of... buzzing? It's a bit of a weird sensation. Mostly, it just feels like my head is floating. Also, my eyes get red, but that is probably obvious.  My blood pressure seems to get a little bit higher. Not alarmingly so, but noticeably. 

These feelings are cool, and I enjoy it, but I don't really feel any of the experiences that I see stories about. I mostly kind of sit there and things are funnier and my head is floaty, but only if I'm sitting there kind of concentrating on the high. If I don't do that and I move around, I feel mostly normal and am able to focus on tasks, but kinda zoned out.

What is the difference between my experience (zoned out, relaxed, floaty-head/giggly) and getting totally blazed?

**tl;dr** Best way to pack and light a pipe? How fast/frequent should lighting and inhaling be? How long should a single bowl last?

I think for starters, I should really sit down when I smoke, but other than that, any suggestions? Thanks for any help in advance!

I just started smoking about month ago. First time I bought dealer gave it to me in a plastic bag that was inside a glass jar. He let me borrow the jar for 12 hours and then I had to figure it out on my own. I kept it in tupperware for a few weeks then transfered it to an orange prescription bottle which i continued to keep inside tupperware. All the time the tupperware was in a drawer.

A couple days ago I got a grinder but didn't have time to really smoke so I stupidly just grinded some weed and left it there for almost a week now. I packed a bowl today and smoked like half of it before I suddenly remembered reading about ""whiteys"" and moldy weed. I looked at my remaining bowl, and after carefully scrutinizing it, decided that the tiny white bits I could see if I looked really close were mold and that I was totally screwed. I dumped the rest out along with the record of the stuff that was in my grinder. I'm going to throw it out as soon as I get the chance. 

I'm thinking about throwing away the rest because it was in that little plastic bag so long. However, putting my nose up to the bottle still smells a lot like weed (didn't get to smell test the bowl and grinder weed before dumping). 

I'm definitely investing in a tight glass bottle for my new purchase and I plan on buying some 95% rubbing alcohol and soaking everything in it. I can take some pictures but they won't be real high resolution.

Also tips for future storage?

Most of my friends that I smoke with like to just lay around and do nothing which is how I start feeling uncomfortable, and smoking alone I'm fine with but I'd really rather not do.

I'm in my late 20s and decided to smoke trees for the first time. TLDR reasons aside, I want to make my first time the most enjoyable, relaxing, safe experience I can. I know it's not really a big deal, but I'm quite nervous (in a good way!).
I've got a pipe and a grinder. 
I've got a safe little smoking spot close to home, and a non-smoker boyfriend who is supportive and amazing. 
I've got Coke and Juice in the fridge, some of my favourite tunes loaded on a playlist, and a really comfy beanbag. :)
I've watched a lot of youtube about how to pack a bowl, how to grind, etc
Most importantly, a trusted friend is hooking me up with $150 worth - we are splitting a bigger bag, so I know I won't get terrible/sketchy stuff.

Advice for what to do?
Stupid mistakes you made as noob smokers that I should avoid?
Movies to watch?
How much to smoke?
What do I do if I start getting *too* freaked out?
What can the boyfriend do to help/have fun/etc?
Is Showering recommended for noobs? I don't want to drown.

WALL OF BORING TEXT:
I just want to say in advance that I don't have any affiliation with this guy or his YouTube channel.  But I thought his videos were informative and entertaining, and I wanted to share them.
So the main reason I came to Reddit was because I found /r/trees and later /r/saplings.  You guys are all freakin awesome, and I learned so much about life and I feel so much better about myself thanks to you good folk.
Anyways, before I came to Reddit, I had a lot of questions about cannabis.  I've been smoking for a while but outside of the weed my friends gave me, I didn't know a damn thing about marijuana, how to use various pipes, or cannabis culture.  So I searched a while on Google and YouTube, and the best site I found was Lex's World.  The guy that runs it is really down-to-Earth, methodical, and straightforward.  And his videos answered a ton of questions I had about weed.  Every once in a while, he does videos about other random things, but it's usually stuff that an internet-savvy smoker would be interested in.

Here's some memorable vids:

* [How To Use a Bong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?

Hey fellow ents! So I've mentioned to a couple of my best friends who don't smoke, that I respect that they don't want to try it and am glad they don't pressure me to quit. Although, I've also said that ""if you ever change your mind, I'd love to show you the experience.""

I kind of forgot about it, when today my friend was like. ""Bro. Do you have any more stuff? [Stuff?] Yeah, ...green stuff."" [Really? OH YEAH!]

We smoked a respectable amount, enough to get me a little up there, but not too much that he would feel too out of it. Yet, although he seemed to be doing it right, even coughed once, he kept saying he never felt anything. After a few hours when it was dying down for me I asked him if he had felt anything the entire time. ""Nope.""

He said it was a one time thing and that I was to tell no one, so it makes me sad that he may not try it again. Why didn't it work? Do the receptors or whatever have to be activated for some people during the first few times?

I followed the general procedure from the above link, but my amounts were mostly just eyeballed (1/2 an oz of weed + a couple spoonfulls of coconut oil, I assume about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup).

Anyway, I took two pills on thursday night (on an empty stomach), felt the effects within 30 minutes, and then went on to get very very enjoyably high. 

Fast forward to saturday, I figured I'd have a dinner party where my friends try the pills, then I'd cook dinner. Getting high + tasty food = awesome idea, right? 

Anyway, they have tolerances higher than me, so I recomended taking 2 or 3 to start. We all took pills, and then about 15 minutes later dinner was served (roast beef and yorkshire pudding).

I didn't end up taking a pill until just before I sat down to eat, as I was worried about remaining functional enough to take everything out of the oven on time. 

But then nothing happened. We ate at 6:30, and around midnight when people started leaving most people felt nothing. 

I ended up falling asleep on the couch, and when I woke up I had that groggy/spaced feeling that I *was* stoned, but I dont remember getting there. My assumption is that the pills kicked in after I fell asleep. 

This is anacdotally supported by two other people who took the pills, one of them woke up in the middle of the night and realized they were stoned, the other realized they were stoned when they got up in the morning. 

But then on the other hand, one friend took 5 pills and claims they never kicked in.

Do I need one of those grinder things?  Cant I just pull it apart with my fingers or something?  

/questions

I'm in highschool and terribly antisocial.  I have maybe 4-5 good friends and I know for a fact that none of them smoke/have ever smoked.  I know a kid, I wouldn't say we're best friends but we talk in class, he's a casual acquaintance.  I guess I wouldn't be sad if he died, but I'd notice that he died.  Anyway, I know without a doubt in my heart that he is in to trees(bongs, pipes, he has that stuff).  How would I go about asking him for some?  Or should I ask who he gets it from?  I'd rather not ask the pizza delivery guy if he has a hook up.  There is a community college a little bit away(10, 15 minutes?) but I don't really want to walk around(being 15-17) looking for people doing drugs.  

Are real life drug dealers as nice as the ones on TV?  They give you a free sample as a prospective customer and hope you return willing to purchase?  That would be sweet.

I'm in the market for a job, and for this job there will without a doubt be a drug test.  I'm still looking for one but I'm sure I'll have it before the end of August.  Should I just wait until after the drug test to start smoking?  

I have lighters and stuff, will those cheapy bic ones you get at a gas station work fine?  

Rolling papers.  On Harold and Kumar he ripped a page out of a phonebook and use it, is that any good?  Or I'm sure there's a bible laying around and I could rip out the blank pages. 

If I manage to get some trees but dont have a job yet, how long will they store?  What do I store it in, a Ziploc bag? 

Lets say I manage to buy some trees after all and now I have them in my possession, got that job I was talking about, and am ready to smoke for the first time.  What exactly do I need to do to the stuff?  I'd prefer to start out and make sure I like this stuff before I buy a pipe or anything so, joints for me?  I'm sure I can google how to roll a joint, but do I need to tear up that shit in to teeny tiny pieces? 

More questionssss:

How long does a high last?

Will I get the munchies?  Seriously though, I hardly ever eat because I never have an appetite, this could be a 
good thing.

Will(Could) trees help me fall asleep easier?  It takes anywhere from one to three hours(or more) of laying in bed doing nothing for me to fall asleep.

I have a vehicle of my own, and if I have trees with me(coming back from buying some or something), where do you suggest I put them?  I guess not the glove box or whatever you call it because, well, I tend to speed a lot and on the off chance I get pulled over and some cop sees in there, bustedddddd.  How about the console thing in the middle?  
Is a pipe really, really worth it? 

Thanks for your helpful answers, Ive seen how nice you guys can be, hopefully I'll be one of you soon enough =)

Until recently I read Treating Yourself magazine explaining how to use the paranoia as way to connect more to the world and become more conscious and aware of your life as part of nature and not part of this other egotistical world.

I have much more to learn but this has been one of the most life changing experiences I have ever had! I wanted to share this, in hopes of challenging other ents to think more critically when smoking trees!

So next time you feel paranoid, try thinking more in depth and realize that your mind is not who you are but more a tool you use. It is more important how you handle things in life rather than actually neglecting the ""NOW"".

Every time I smoke now, I become more of a conscious thinker and sort of ""reset"" myself back to this conscious mentality whenever I feel like I am losing myself into this ""Ego World"" as I like to call it.

Feel free to discuss, as I would love to keep learning about this important subject and show other ents this other amazing world.

Happy Toking everyone!

1292456521.0,18,self.saplings,emi41,How to smoke properly/take big hits.,cnbdream,21,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/emi41/how_to_smoke_properlytake_big_hits/,"[Caitthegreat](http://www.reddit.com/user/caitthegreat) and I were talking earlier about how many people don't know how to properly take a hit off of a pipe or joint, so we (or rather, she decided I) are (am) going to outline the steps here.  This is something most cigarette smokers learn very quickly, so as to prevent coughing and having their cigarette taste like trash.

The first thing that really needs to be established is that there are two ways to take a drag off of something.  The first involves inhaling directly through whatever it is you're smoking (this is most commonly properly used in smoking bongs) which alone is generally not how you're ""supposed"" to smoke.  My friends and I call this method of smoking, ""straight inhaling.""  The second involves using your cheeks to pull smoke into your mouth from whatever you're smoking, and then moving whatever it is you're smoking away, and inhaling air on top of the smoke in your mouth (most commonly used alone properly in smoking cigarettes and joints).

When smoking a pipe and attempting to take a big or fast rip, the easiest way is to do some combination of the two.  Generally, what I do is, inhale very slowly, while using my cheeks to pull air, until I can feel thick smoke at the back of my throat.  I let off the carb at that point and inhale air through it to clear the chamber, then take the piece away from my mouth and inhale air.  You can take hits that are two or three times bigger than straight inhaling in half the time, with a fraction of the harshness.

This is something I've found most people naturally do, but I've been amazed to meet some people inhale directly off of whatever they're smoking without taking the smoke into their mouth first.  Unless you're smoking a bong or a big bubbler, it's generally not the best way to enjoy the taste and smoothness of your trees, nor the most efficient way to take a hit.  Everyone talks about cornering the bowl and only touching the lighter to it for a few seconds, but not many touch on the act of actually inhaling the smoke.  Give this a try if you don't already and see how it works for you.",,False,self,t5_2rukl,False,,,True,t3_emi41,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/emi41/how_to_smoke_properlytake_big_hits/,

Probably won't be bad, show up in nice clothes and be polite, it works!  Get a lawyer if need be, but you can be fine without one, I have been in the past (in a super strict herb state too!).

Probation? Don't smoke spice, find out the testing schedule over a period of two months and figure out how much and how often you can smoke without detection.

I am currently considering trying cannabis for the first time. There are just a few questions that I would like to ask.

I'll give some background first. I am eighteen and have unfortunately lived a pretty sheltered life. The interest in cannabis has been there for a long time but I never really pursued when I was younger, which from my understanding is a good thing. The only thing that is really stopping me right now is a lack of connections, anxiety (I suffer from social anxiety that can range from mild to severe,) and an overall lack of knowledge on the subject.

I've done some reading around this and other subreddits and still have a few remaining questions. If these have been covered elsewhere please forgive me, I am pretty much clueless when it comes to this.

1. I have recently become what you could maybe call friends with someone who I know for sure is an ENT. I have brought up my interest and he has told me that he wouldn't mind smoking with me in a safe environment. This was about a month ago however. Should I bring it up again and how should I go about doing so?

2. I wouldn't feel right smoking someone's weed without reimbursing them in some way. Should I give them money or pay them back in another way. (How much should I pay them?)

3. I don't know exactly what I would want to do. Should I have a general idea, count on him having ideas, or will things just kind of happen?

4. From what I have read so far I should stay away from edibles, at least for now. What would be the best way for someone who has never smoked anything?

5. My mother is not what I would call anti-weed but I don't know how she would react to me smoking. If/when I do try it I will be doing it somewhere that isn't my house. Are there any particular precautions I should take to make sure she doesn't find out? 

6. Is there anything I should be aware of for the first time, like things to expect, watch out for, etc.?

7. Say things go well and I smoke a few more times and decide to try to get some for myself. Should I try to make connections through the previously mentioned person?

Again I apologize if this is common knowledge or posted elsewhere but I have no idea what I am doing.

Recently I've started to smoke (vape) every day using my MFLB. I hear that low amounts of cannabis use can reduce depression, although large amounts can increase it. I'm just wondering if other people have used it specifically for the intention of getting rid of their depression, and what techniques were used? Whether smoked a super small amount on a daily basis, a moderate amount every x days, or multiple times a day?

For the last 2 months I have been going through about an eighth every 2-3 weeks. I feel that it's possibly a bit too much, but I've since been working harder in school, been more motivated, and less depressed, but I don't really want to get too far without some outside advice.

Edit: Thanks for all of your advice, especially those of you who didn't jump on the bandwagon of ""Weed is a miracle drug that cures everything"".

So, a few weeks before moving away to college I tried weed for the first time (Well, not the first time, the first time doesn't count, musical festival, black out drunk, american weed) and honestly it was a splendid experience. A friend invited me and a couple other friends to go smoke with him. We used a bong and I only needed two hits to get going. I swear, being in the car (Sober driver) felt like a roller coaster. We then got home and just gamed and stuff, honestly I don't really remember most of the night other than that it was a great night and allowed me to just be more, me.


However, now that I've moved and am living in Vancouver (Quite lenient on marijuana useage I'd say). I'd enjoy to start recreationally to take the edge off each day and to combat my depression/anxiety/insomnia (None of which are ""professorially diagnosed"") What I am asking for is some advice, currently I live in a tiny ass studio apartment, with a person both above/below/beside me (Their window is also right above mine), however handily I am beside two large-ish parks (One is the 3rd largest in Van I'm fairly sure). However I'm not sure how to go about it? Pipe would be preferred device, but I mean if I walk down to the beach and sit down on the bench/grass or w.e am I gonna be all good since it's right across my road and I'd probably head down there at night. Also my biggest issue would be carrying the stuff in my car/backpack when walking due to paranoia, any advice to get over that or just do it? And lastly, does one need a grinder?

There's a local restaurant/rest stop thing within a minute from my house, and it was closed today, so I figured I could just pull in, tear open the plastic bag, and put everything inside.

I panicked, said ""No."", and threw it into reverse and pulled out. But I'm pretty damn sure I heard him say ""Whatever, I got your license plate number!"" and then he threw his arms up. He looked pretty fucking pissed. I almost think he saw me coming or something? I had JUST pulled in, and the spot was a bit away from the entrance and on the opposite side of the building.

I'm assuming the worst, that he immediately went inside and called the cops and gave them my number. So, what are the possible consequences of this? I go to school about an hour and a half away and was only even in town for a couple hours. Will there be phone calls? Should I be extra careful driving through town?

I had to breathe through my nose, but even then I didn't feel like enough oxygen was going through to my brain.

I felt my heart rate increase to what I felt was an abnormal rhythm, I got a terrible case of cotton throat where I couldn't feel what I was swallowing, and I started to freak out a bit. My first question--are these side effects stemming from getting too high too fast? This all happened probably in the span of 15 or so minutes.

I calmed down after a while I started to truly feel zen. Everything was happening around me in what seemed to me like a controlled chaos, and I felt that I was the controller. Then at one point I closed my eyes and got some beautiful closed eye visuals. I never knew trees could give you closed eye visuals! I essentially saw what looked like a spiral of galaxies and just awesome colors. This has never happened to me before--is this normal too?

Also, back to my heart beat. I am overweight, but I am physically active and go to the gym daily and to my knowledge there is no heart disease in my family. My blood pressure is fine too. Was I in danger of having a heart attack yesterday?

I was abroad for the past 8 months and haven’t smoked since before I left. I came back, however, to discover that my dealer had been caught by the damn DEA. Apparently they had been following him for weeks, if not months and now he’s at $50,000 bail. Or so I’ve heard. I know one of his friends still deals but I don’t really want to buy from someone who is also probably being watched.

This leaves me, for the first time in my 4 years of smoking, without someone to buy from. I don’t know what to do, I have never had to find someone on my own before. For years my ex would just get it for us, and the dealer who got arrested used to live on my dorm floor so he was an easy find. The main friends I used to smoke with are scattered across the country, my other friends don’t smoke, and the few other associates I know can’t help me. I have managed to get two recommendations but neither worked out. 

What are ways of scoping some out? I am in a large city and I know it’s everywhere around me, but I’m really kind of paranoid about just asking people who look like they smoke or asking strangers at parties. I have known too many people who have went to jail because they dealt with the wrong people, so I try to be cautious. I also don’t want to annoy my fellow smokers and feel like a moocher by just asking people at parties if I can have a hit. I am too shy to do that, and too used to doing it with only a small group of people who I know that doing it with a bunch of strangers would probably not be very enjoyable.

I haven't been smoking for very long. Once or twice a week for about two months. When I smoke, everything stops hurting. It's absolutely wonderful. I've tried every pain pill under the sun, and nothing comes close to this. That short respite gets me through the week.

I'm concerned, however, about the potential legal ramifications. Stopping is an absolute last resort, obviously. It's not about the high - being rid of that discomfort for a few hours a week is incredibly beneficial to both my physical and mental well-being.

Budrot or some other fungus? Any ideas? I didn't think it would rot once it was stored in a jar but I'd rather not smoke rotten tree.

Now for the questions; first, I was really jittery, i couldn't stop my twitches. Is that normal? Second, every time ANYTHING that had the possibility of hurting me got near me, I flinched/jumped back. Is THIS normal? The third question is kind of weird, I got thrown down a hill because I'm pretty light, I freaked out in the air, but it didn't hurt!

* What are you doing, exactly? Do you inhale for each ""puff""? Why don't you just take one long draw, like on a cigarette?

**Smell of Weed**

* How potent is the smell of weed? Is it stronger when it's dormant (hidden in your room) or when it's actually being smoked?

**Smoke Spots**

* How do you find a good outdoor spot to smoke? How far from civilization do you have to be so the smell doesn't tip someone off? How do you avoid getting caught? 

I'm asking because there's this amazing place a half hour drive from me that I'd *love* to smoke at -- right by a waterfall. It's not a public park (to my knowledge) and a few people do go there from time to time, but the ""crowd"" dwindles down closer to sunset. You can walk down a pretty tough trail to get below/behind the waterfall, and further beyond (past some challenging rocks) is a little pool of water surrounded by trees. It's very peaceful, and it's my *ideal* chillage zone.

**Transporting Weed**

* If I buy, say, an 1/8th, put it in a plastic baggy, then put that plastic baggy inside a disposable plastic container/pill bottle/etc. will it stink up my car if it's in there for about an hour drive?

**Steps Before/During/After Buying Weed**

I know at least three people off the top of my head who I could contact about getting a hold of some herb. I'm nervous about buying my first stash, but they're very cool people so it's just a matter of getting over my nerves and outright asking for their help. My question is...

* Do I need to ""weed proof"" my room before I buy some? I'm living with my mother (I'm 21, however) but will be moving out to my own apartment (shared with a roommate) in August, for college. Should I wait until I move? Would smoking here be fine for a month or so?

* If it's *doable* to smoke at my mother's house until I move, what are the risks of smoking outside? We have a fairly private backyard -- surrounded by tall wooden fences on one side -- but we are literally *surrounded* by neighbors. Front, sides, and back. Would the smell of weed be too overpowering?

* If I need to *wait until I move*, how safe is it to smoke in an apartment in a typical ""college town""?

I fist became interested in this when I was looking at the Magic Flight store. I noticed that there was a small selection of herbal blends to use with the MFLB and as I enjoy both being high and the process of smoking and vaping, I considered picking some up.

Using a MFLB.",ryou516,25,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/nf7a7/a_saplings_first_time_ever_using_a_mflb/,"I always wanted to try trees. I spent about a month reading and educating myself about it, mostly here on /r/saplings, and on /r/trees.

**This is the story of how it went the first time I used trees. Written the very next morning after.**


I had just bought the MFLB. I was planning on smoking it with my gf &amp; my best friend today, but when I realized my dealer lived a lil bit far from me, I didn't want to drive that far today so I just went yesterday to have the supply ready.

During my drive back, I considered smoking that very same night, alone. There was only one thing: my parents were home (they wouldn't be today).

After much internal debating, and approval from my gf (she wanted me to wait for her at first), I decided to go with it. Windows open.

I took out 1g (my dealer gave me 1 little plastic back per g) from the aluminum container I had. I took 1/3 of it and put it in my grinder. Grounded up that, and after a few taps and a few more grinds, it was done. 

I opened my MFLB and started pouring into the trench, just to realize *it was way too much*. I ended up needing only 1/3 of that to fill up the trench (math done, I'd get 6+ trenches out of 1g), which I thought was brilliant.

I left it there, and went to play a few matches of MW3 (PC) with my friends. I had a few of them on *ventrilo*, including my GF (who also plays MW3 with my buddies).

After a couple of matches, I asked my GF thru steam ""Should I do it now?"" and she said ""if you want xD"". So I told them 'brb' and stood up.

Went to get my *MFLB*, the stem, and my freshly charged battery and stood next to the window.

I pressed the battery in and after a few seconds, vapor started filling the chamber. I placed my mouth at the tip of the stem and started inhaling. Blew the smoke out of the window.

Did not feel a thing. Tried without the stem as I realized there were times I was letting go of the battery; didn't realize I needed to press it that hard during the entire process. I shook the herbs between hits. Coughing happened, but I knew it was normal.

No stem, didn't feel a thing either, but without the stem the vapor felt a lot hotter. So I plugged the stem right back and, after another wasted hit, I finally got the hang of it and started to *feel* the vapor instead of just tasting it. Figured I was leaving my mouth way too open and the vape was escaping.

About the taste: It tastes just like tobacco, but a lil bit smoother, and not as sour or unpleasant. 

Still not feeling that much, I left it there to rest, stood up and started walking around the room. Then, after a few seconds, it hit me. 

I felt a need to sit down, then just to lay down...then I started laughing for no reason. What a unique experience.

After the initial buzz, I jumped right back at my pc and started talking to my GF thru ventrilo...and then we both joined the channel where our friends were. Started talking shit like crazy, I wouldn't stop.

Here's a rundown of how I felt:

**Physically**

* My body felt heavy and kinda clumsy
* I felt dizzy, but not nauseated. It wasn't a bad feeling.
* I felt like someone replaced my blood with lemonade. My veins felt funny and cold, but it wasn't a bad feeling.
* I did feel hungry, which I was prepared for with a Taco Bell burrito.
* You know when stoner rage comics have red eyes and swollen up eyelids? It was exactly like that when I looked at myself in the mirror. Eyes were as pink as cotton candy.
* I was having a hard time maintaining a train of thought, especially when talking to people.

**Emotionally**

* I felt a kind of calm inside. Felt like everything was gonna be just fine.
* It was almost physically impossible for me to get mad or upset about something. I was just...happy.
* Just wanted to talk. I felt friendly as hell. 
* Relaaxxxxxxxxx
* I did not feel any kind of paranoia or fear.

That effect lasted about 2 hours (didn't know if it would have lasted more, I went to sleep). It peaked for the first 40 minutes or so, then it gradually (but very slowly) started to vanish, but I was still pretty numb and happy when I went to sleep.

If I were to imagine how high could you get with trees, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say I got pretty close to 7 or 8. I think I could definitely get a bit more fucked up in the head with it, but what I felt was pretty intense. Of course, it personally was my [10].

So that's that.
As far as addiction goes, getting high, I feel as I wouldn't do this everyday. It was a lot like drinking for me. I'd just do it when there's an occasion. I don't feel a need to smoke other than because it felt good and I want to feel that again...but not more as opposed to how you would buy a prime steak every once in a while just because it tastes fucking amazing. 

There's a desire, but not a need. I would be sad if I didn't get to do it again, but it not the end of the world. 

Thanks to everybody who helped me. The guys from /r/trees, /r/saplings, and the awesome guys from the /r/trees IRC. 

Today I will be smoking with my best friend, and I'm gonna guide him.

Thank you for reading this.

**TL;DR** After a few screw-ups with the MFLB, finally got high and it was awesome.
